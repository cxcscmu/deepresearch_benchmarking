# Future Technology and Its Impact on Healthcare

## Executive Summary

The future of healthcare is poised for significant transformation driven by technological advancements. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI), genomics, and wearable technology are expected to revolutionize diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. These technologies promise to enhance efficiency, personalize healthcare, and improve patient outcomes. However, they also present challenges, including cybersecurity risks and the need for regulatory frameworks.

## Methodology

To gather insights on how future technology will change healthcare, I utilized a combination of academic databases, industry reports, and reputable online sources. Key search terms included "future of healthcare technology," "AI in healthcare," and "genomics in medicine." The primary tools used were PubMed, Google Scholar, and industry-specific websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare**: AI is set to play a pivotal role in healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy and streamlining hospital workflows. For instance, AI programs can interpret mammograms with 99% accuracy, significantly reducing false results[^1]. AI's ability to process vast amounts of data quickly allows for faster and more accurate diagnoses, which can lead to better patient outcomes.

2. **Genomics and Personalized Medicine**: Advances in genomics are paving the way for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. This approach can lead to more effective treatments for diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders. By 2025, it is expected that safer and more functional drugs will be available, potentially eradicating diseases like Type-I Diabetes and Alzheimer's[^2].

3. **Wearable Technology and IoT**: Wearable devices and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are transforming patient monitoring and care. These technologies enable real-time health tracking and can alert healthcare providers to potential issues before they become critical. This proactive approach to healthcare can improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital admissions[^3].
