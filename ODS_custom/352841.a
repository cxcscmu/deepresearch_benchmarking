## Detailed Findings

1. **Role of the President and Congress**: Fiscal policy in the United States is primarily determined by the President and Congress. They are responsible for making decisions about government spending and taxation. "Fiscal policy is determined by the President and Congress and involves changing government spending and taxation" [^1]. This process includes the President submitting an annual budget proposal to Congress, which outlines the administration's fiscal priorities.

2. **Budget Planning and Approval**: The federal budget is a crucial component of fiscal policy. It is planned by the President and Congress to determine government spending and funding strategies. "The president submits an annual budget proposal to Congress with detail about the budget plans and goals. Congress and the presidential administration further develop and review the budget together" [^2]. This collaborative process ensures that fiscal policy aligns with national economic goals.

3. **Congressional Committees**: After the President submits the federal budget, congressional committees play a significant role in revising and approving it. "After the president submits the federal budget to the House and Senate, congressional committees revise the draft and forward its proposed budget to the US president" [^3]. These committees scrutinize the budget to ensure it meets legislative and economic objectives.
