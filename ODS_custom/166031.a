# Energy Prices: An Analysis of Rising Costs

## Executive Summary

Energy prices have been on a significant rise globally, affecting economies and consumers alike. The surge in energy costs is attributed to a complex interplay of factors including geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and the transition towards renewable energy sources. This report delves into the reasons behind the high energy prices, focusing on the impact of historical events, market dynamics, and policy decisions.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "energy prices rise," "global energy crisis," and "factors affecting energy costs." The tools used included Google Scholar, news websites, and industry reports to gather a wide range of perspectives and data.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Market Dynamics**: The roots of the current energy crisis can be traced back to the 2014 oil-price collapse. This event led to a significant reduction in investment in new oil and gas production, as investors sought more stable returns. "The true origin of today’s energy crisis isn’t the 2020 COVID crash, but rather, the 2014 oil-price collapse" [^1]. This historical context has left the market vulnerable to supply-demand mismatches.

2. **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in the energy market. As economies reopened, demand for energy surged, but supply chains struggled to keep pace. "The COVID recession took a toll on both energy demand and supply... global appetite for energy rebounded much faster than supply chains did" [^1]. This imbalance has been a significant driver of price increases.

3. **Geopolitical and Environmental Factors**: Geopolitical tensions, particularly involving major energy suppliers like Russia, have further strained the market. Additionally, the transition to renewable energy has not been swift enough to offset the decline in fossil fuel investments. "The switch from gas to less carbon-intensive energy such as wind and solar has made it harder for gas suppliers to project demand" [^3]. This has led to increased competition for limited resources, driving prices up.
