# Report on Extrinsic Motivation and Its Impact on Sports Performance

## Executive Summary

Extrinsic motivation in sports refers to the drive to perform based on external rewards such as trophies, scholarships, or media attention. While extrinsic motivation can enhance performance by providing clear goals and incentives, it can also undermine intrinsic motivation, leading to decreased enjoyment and increased pressure. This report explores the dual nature of extrinsic motivation, its effects on athletes, and strategies to balance it with intrinsic motivation for optimal performance.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online research strategies, including keyword searches on sports psychology and motivation theories. I accessed various articles and resources from reputable sports psychology websites and academic publications. The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Impact of Extrinsic Motivation**: Extrinsic motivation is driven by external rewards or the avoidance of negative consequences. It is a significant factor in competitive sports, where athletes often seek recognition, financial rewards, and accolades. "Extrinsic rewards are central to competitive sports; athletes receive publicity, awards, and money, among other things" [^1]. However, an overemphasis on extrinsic rewards can lead to decreased intrinsic motivation, causing athletes to feel controlled by these rewards rather than enjoying the sport itself [^2].

2. **Balancing Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation**: While extrinsic motivation can provide necessary incentives, it is crucial to balance it with intrinsic motivation to maintain long-term engagement and satisfaction. "A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is necessary to bring out the best in athletes" [^3]. Coaches and sports psychologists recommend fostering a motivational climate that emphasizes personal growth and enjoyment alongside external rewards.

3. **Effects on Performance**: Extrinsic motivation can enhance performance by setting clear goals and providing tangible rewards. However, it can also increase anxiety and pressure, potentially leading to burnout. "Extrinsically motivated athletes tend to focus on the outcomes of athletic contests, which can lead to increased pressure and anxiety" [^1]. Therefore, it is essential to use extrinsic rewards judiciously to avoid undermining athletes' intrinsic motivation.
