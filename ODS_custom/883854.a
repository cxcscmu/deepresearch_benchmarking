## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including educational websites, historical databases, and expert forums. The search focused on the relationship between fascism and the causes of World War II, examining both primary and secondary sources.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Fascism's Expansionist Policies**: Fascism inherently promotes aggressive nationalism and expansionism. This ideology was a driving force behind the territorial ambitions of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. "Fascism was based off the idea that the nation as a whole is more important than individual people. Fascism also created strong feelings of nationalism, or pride for oneâ€™s country, which led to clashes with other countries, and therefore war" [^1].

2. **Militarization and Authoritarian Control**: Fascist regimes prioritized military strength and authoritarian control, which facilitated their aggressive foreign policies. "Fascism was an ideology which glorified the military, denounced international organizations and cooperation, and considered war an acceptable means for achieving national goals, and maintaining power" [^2].

3. **Impact of Economic and Political Instability**: The economic turmoil and political instability following World War I created fertile ground for fascist ideologies to take root. "The end of World War I set the stage for World War II mainly because of the harsh and repressive sanctions imposed on Germany by the victorious Allies. This made the Germans very upset and more prone to elect a ruthless dictator" [^3].
