# Gas Price Increase Analysis

## Executive Summary

The rising cost of gas has been a significant concern for consumers and policymakers alike. The increase in gas prices is attributed to a combination of factors, including supply-demand imbalances, geopolitical tensions, and policy decisions. This report delves into the reasons behind the rising gas prices, drawing insights from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a thorough search was conducted using online databases and news articles. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the factors influencing gas prices. Tools such as Google Scholar and news aggregators were used to gather relevant information. The findings were then synthesized to present a coherent analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: The fundamental economic principle of supply and demand plays a crucial role in determining gas prices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for crude oil plummeted, leading to reduced production. As restrictions eased and demand surged, the supply struggled to keep pace, resulting in higher prices. "Supply and demand is a large part of why gas prices are higher in 2021" [^1].

2. **Geopolitical Factors and OPEC Decisions**: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have been cautious in increasing oil production, contributing to the supply constraints. "OPEC has been slow to reach agreement on production increases... The outcome of OPEC talks will determine how much of the nearly six million barrels of capacity that it’s holding in reserve will be made available" [^2].

3. **Policy and Regulatory Impacts**: Domestic policies, such as the suspension of oil and gas leases and the cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, have also impacted supply. "President Biden’s policy decisions have only slowed supply recovery... The suspension of these leases and the push to limit drilling on federal lands in general mean that new supply from that quarter is unlikely in the near future" [^3].

## Limitations

This report is based on data and articles available up to October 2023. The dynamic nature of global oil markets means that new developments could alter the current understanding of gas price trends. Additionally, the analysis relies on publicly available information, which may not capture all nuances of the geopolitical and economic factors at play.
