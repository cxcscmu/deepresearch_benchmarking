# The Armenian Genocide: Causes and Execution

## Executive Summary

The Armenian Genocide, occurring between 1915 and 1923, was a systematic campaign by the Ottoman Empire to eliminate its Armenian population. This genocide resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.5 million Armenians and was characterized by mass deportations, forced marches, and widespread massacres. The genocide was driven by a combination of factors, including nationalism, wartime paranoia, and long-standing ethnic tensions. Despite overwhelming evidence and historical consensus, the Turkish government continues to deny the genocide, which has implications for international relations and historical accountability.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including academic articles, historical essays, and reputable encyclopedic entries. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Armenian Genocide causes," "Ottoman Empire Armenian deportations," and "Armenian Genocide historical analysis." Sources were selected based on their credibility, relevance, and the depth of information provided.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Nationalism and Ethnic Tensions**: The rise of Turkish nationalism played a significant role in the genocide. The ruling Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) viewed Armenians as a threat to the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, especially after the Balkan Wars, which intensified anti-Christian sentiment[^1]. Historian Taner Ak√ßam notes that the genocide was less about wartime contingencies and more about the empire's long-term structural problems[^2].

2. **Wartime Radicalization**: The onset of World War I exacerbated existing tensions. The Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on the side of the Central Powers led to increased suspicion of Armenians, who were seen as potential allies of the Russian enemy due to their shared Christian faith[^3]. This paranoia was a catalyst for the mass deportations and killings that followed.

3. **Systematic Execution**: The genocide was meticulously organized by the Ottoman government. Armenians were rounded up, deported, and subjected to death marches through the Syrian Desert, where they faced starvation, dehydration, and massacres[^4]. The CUP's aim was to reduce the Armenian population to a negligible percentage to prevent any possibility of autonomy or independence[^5].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, as access to primary documents and archives was not feasible. Additionally, the ongoing denial by the Turkish government limits the availability of comprehensive official records. The complexity of the historical context also means that interpretations can vary, and some aspects of the genocide remain subjects of scholarly debate.
