## Executive Summary
The novel "Charlotte Temple" by Susanna Rowson provides a poignant reflection of women's roles in society during the 1800s. This period was characterized by rigid gender roles, with women largely confined to domestic duties and subservient positions relative to men. The novel illustrates the societal expectations and limitations placed on women, highlighting themes of dependency, lack of autonomy, and the consequences of stepping outside societal norms.

## Methodology
To explore the depiction of women's roles in "Charlotte Temple," I utilized a combination of online academic databases and literary analysis tools. Key search terms included "Charlotte Temple women's roles," "1800s gender roles," and "Susanna Rowson societal commentary." Sources were selected based on their relevance and depth of analysis regarding the novel's portrayal of women's societal roles.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Dependency and Lack of Autonomy**: Women in the 1800s were expected to be dependent on male figures, a theme prominently depicted in "Charlotte Temple." The novel illustrates how women were often seen as property of their fathers or husbands, lacking personal autonomy. "Women were considered unequal to their male companions legally and socially" [^1]. This dependency is a central theme in the novel, as Charlotte's fate is largely dictated by the men around her.

2. **Societal Expectations and Domestic Roles**: The novel reflects the societal expectation that women should focus on domestic responsibilities. "Women had been issued roles as the moral keepers for societies as well as the nonworking house-wives for families" [^2]. Charlotte's story underscores the limited roles available to women and the societal pressure to conform to these roles.

3. **Consequences of Non-Conformity**: "Charlotte Temple" also explores the severe consequences faced by women who deviated from societal norms. The novel serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of stepping outside prescribed roles, reflecting broader societal attitudes of the time. "Women were not allowed to venture into any other activities apart from taking care of her family" [^3]. Charlotte's downfall is a direct result of her failure to adhere to these expectations.

## Limitations
The analysis is limited by the availability of direct references to "Charlotte Temple" in the context of 1800s societal roles. The insights are primarily drawn from broader discussions of women's roles during the period, which may not fully capture the nuances of Rowson's narrative. Additionally, the interpretation of the novel's themes is subjective and may vary among scholars. Further research could include a more detailed literary analysis of the text itself to provide a deeper understanding of its commentary on women's roles.
