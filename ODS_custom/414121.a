# Climate Change Perceptions: A Global Overview

## Executive Summary

Recent surveys and studies reveal a growing concern among people worldwide, particularly young individuals, about climate change and its impacts. The anxiety surrounding climate change is not only due to environmental degradation but also stems from perceived governmental inaction. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to highlight the emotional and psychological responses to climate change, with a focus on young people's perspectives.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches related to climate change perceptions, youth anxiety, and governmental responses. Tools such as Google Scholar, news websites, and academic databases were employed to gather relevant articles and studies. The focus was on extracting data from reputable sources that provide insights into global attitudes towards climate change.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Youth Anxiety and Government Inaction**: A global survey led by Bath University found that nearly 60% of young people feel "very worried" or "extremely worried" about climate change. The study highlights that "many feel betrayed, ignored, and abandoned by politicians and adults" due to inadequate governmental responses [^1].

2. **Emotional Impact**: The survey also revealed that over 45% of young respondents reported that their feelings about climate change adversely affect their daily lives. The emotions most commonly associated with climate change include sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, and powerlessness [^2].

3. **Global Perceptions and Divides**: According to a Pew Research Center survey, majorities in most countries view climate change as a significant threat. However, there are notable ideological divides, particularly in countries like the United States, where political affiliations heavily influence perceptions of climate change [^3].

## Limitations

The findings presented in this report are based on surveys and studies that may have limitations in terms of sample size, geographic coverage, and the time frame of data collection. Additionally, the emotional and psychological responses to climate change are complex and can vary widely among individuals, making it challenging to generalize findings across different populations. Furthermore, the political and cultural contexts in which these surveys were conducted can influence the results, potentially leading to biases in the data.
