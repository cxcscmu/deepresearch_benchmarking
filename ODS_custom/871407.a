# Report on Flaws Leading to Exposure of Resources or Functionality to Unintended Actors

## Executive Summary
The exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors is a critical security flaw that can lead to unauthorized access and potential exploitation of sensitive information. This report identifies "Improper Authentication" as a primary flaw responsible for such exposures. This flaw occurs when an application fails to correctly verify a user's identity, allowing unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

## Methodology
To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches related to security flaws and resource exposure. I employed tools such as search engines and databases focusing on cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database and educational forums.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Improper Authentication**: This flaw occurs when an application incorrectly verifies a user's identity, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access. "Improper authentication takes place when a user's identity is incorrectly verified by an application" [^1]. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and arbitrary code execution.

2. **Exposure of Sensitive Information**: According to CWE-200, "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information" [^2]. This exposure can occur through various mistakes, such as insecure file permissions or unprotected data transmissions.

3. **Exposed Dangerous Methods**: CWE-749 describes scenarios where "the software provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted" [^3]. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical functionalities.
