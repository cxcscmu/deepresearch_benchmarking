# Radical Republicans and Their Opposition to Reconstruction Plans

## Executive Summary

The Radical Republicans, a faction within the Republican Party during the Reconstruction era, opposed both President Abraham Lincoln's and President Andrew Johnson's plans for Reconstruction. They believed these plans were too lenient towards the Southern states that had seceded from the Union. The Radical Republicans sought harsher measures to ensure civil rights for freed slaves and to punish the Southern states for their role in the Civil War. Their opposition was rooted in a desire for a more transformative approach to Reconstruction, which included military oversight and significant changes to Southern society.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of online search engines and academic databases. The search terms included "Radical Republicans opposition to Lincoln's Reconstruction," "Radical Republicans and Andrew Johnson," and "Radical Reconstruction policies." The sources were selected based on their relevance and credibility, including educational websites and expert-verified answers from academic platforms.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Opposition to Lincoln's Plan**: The Radical Republicans opposed President Lincoln's plan for Reconstruction because they believed it was too moderate. Lincoln's approach, known as the "10 percent plan," allowed Southern states to be readmitted into the Union once 10% of their voters swore an oath of allegiance. The Radicals felt this plan was too lenient and did not adequately punish the South or protect the rights of freed slaves. "Radical Republicans wanted stronger punishment to be imposed on the South than Lincoln's plan called for, and wanted a larger role for the federal government in the overall reconstruction plan" [^1].

2. **Disapproval of Johnson's Plan**: President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction plan was also met with disapproval from the Radical Republicans. Johnson's approach was seen as even more lenient than Lincoln's, as it quickly restored Southern states to the Union without significant protections for former slaves. "The Radical Republicans viewed Andrew Johnson as a Southern sympathizer because he wanted to bring the states that seceded prior to the Civil War back into the Union immediately and unconditionally" [^2].

3. **Radical Reconstruction Policies**: The Radical Republicans implemented their own Reconstruction policies when they gained control of Congress. These policies included the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, which divided the South into military districts and required states to ratify the 14th Amendment. "Radical Republicans won over two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate. They now had the power to override Johnson’s vetoes and pass the Civil Rights Act and the bill to extend the Freedmen’s Bureau" [^3].
