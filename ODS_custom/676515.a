## Methodology

Tools such as Google Scholar, academic databases, and educational websites were utilized to gather relevant information. The findings were synthesized from multiple sources to provide a well-rounded analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Domestic Policy Changes:**
   - The Cold War era was marked by a pervasive fear of communism, leading to significant domestic policy shifts. "The Cold War led to an enlarged fear of nuclear war; as well, it affected many of the domestic policies" [^1]. This fear was exacerbated by events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, which highlighted the potential for nuclear conflict.
   - The period saw the rise of McCarthyism, where individuals were accused of communist affiliations without substantial evidence. "Joseph McCarthy began his 'witch hunt,' leading to a society where every man is against another" [^2]. This atmosphere of suspicion led to the establishment of loyalty programs and investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).

2. **Economic and Social Impacts:**
   - The Cold War spurred economic growth in sectors related to defense and technology. "The Cold War introduced an age of science innovation... leading to the eventual landing on the moon" [^3]. Government spending on defense and scientific research increased significantly during this period.
   - Socially, the Cold War fostered a culture of fear and paranoia. "The Cold War changed American society by introducing both foreign and domestic fear into the lives of Americans" [^4]. This fear was reflected in popular culture, with films and media often depicting communist threats.

3. **Foreign Policy Developments:**
   - The U.S. adopted a policy of containment to prevent the spread of communism, as articulated in the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. "The U.S. had developed a clear policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, striving to prevent the spread of communism through economic, diplomatic, and military measures" [^5].
   - The Cold War also led to the formation of strategic alliances, such as NATO, and involvement in conflicts like the Korean and Vietnam Wars. These actions were driven by the desire to counter Soviet influence globally.
