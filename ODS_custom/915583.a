# Encouraging Nursing-Based Outcome Studies by Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs)

## Executive Summary

Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) play a crucial role in healthcare by providing high-quality patient care and contributing to nursing research. Encouraging nursing-based outcome studies is essential for advancing the profession and improving patient outcomes. This report explores strategies APRNs can employ to promote such studies, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based practice, collaboration, and education.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases, online journals, and institutional websites. The focus was on identifying strategies and examples of APRNs' involvement in nursing-based outcome studies. Key sources included the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at Penn Nursing, Springer Publishing's resources on outcome assessment, and various nursing research guides.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Promoting Evidence-Based Practice**: APRNs can encourage outcome studies by integrating evidence-based practice into their daily routines. This involves using current research to inform clinical decisions and advocating for the implementation of evidence-based interventions. "The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of two variations of the ARCC Intervention Program on nursing processes and outcomes" [^1].

2. **Collaboration and Mentorship**: APRNs can foster a culture of research by collaborating with other healthcare professionals and mentoring novice nurses. This collaboration can lead to the development of research projects that focus on patient outcomes. "The Program has trained 26 PhDs and 37 postdoctoral trainees, the vast majority of whom are now employed in research in 44 different institutions in 24 states" [^2].

3. **Education and Training**: Providing education and training on research methodologies and outcome measurement is crucial. APRNs can organize workshops and seminars to enhance the research skills of nursing staff. "This book provides up-to-date resources and examples of outcome measures, tools, and methods that can be used by APNs in their quest to keep pace with new developments in the rapidly expanding field of outcome measurement" [^3].

## Limitations

The report is based on available online resources and may not cover all aspects of APRNs' roles in promoting nursing-based outcome studies. Additionally, the findings are limited to the context of the sources reviewed and may not reflect the full scope of practices in different healthcare settings. Further research and direct input from practicing APRNs could provide a more comprehensive understanding.
