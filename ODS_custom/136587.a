## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact on International Stability and Security:**
   Terrorism poses a significant threat to international peace and security. It creates distress and damages relationships between countries. As noted, "Terrorism leads to instability in an international system and causes fear to spread throughout these areas" [^1]. This instability is exacerbated by the global reach of terrorist networks, which can operate across borders with relative ease.

2. **Economic Consequences:**
   The economic impact of terrorism is profound, affecting both immediate and long-term financial stability. Terrorist attacks can lead to significant economic losses, as seen in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, which "led to significant financial damage that affected business in New York, contributing to a massive economic crisis" [^2]. The increased spending on security and defense further strains national budgets, diverting resources from other critical areas.

3. **Social and Psychological Effects:**
   Terrorism instills fear and anxiety within societies, altering the social fabric and leading to psychological trauma among affected populations. The psychological impact is particularly severe, with survivors often suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. "In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, survivors often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and major depression" [^3]. This psychological toll can have lasting effects on community cohesion and individual well-being.
