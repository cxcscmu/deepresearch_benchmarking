# Cambodian Genocide: How It Ended

## Executive Summary

The Cambodian Genocide, orchestrated by the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot, resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.5 to 3 million people between 1975 and 1979. The genocide ended with the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, which overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in January 1979. This military intervention was a response to the Khmer Rouge's aggressive policies and cross-border attacks on Vietnam. The subsequent establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea marked the end of the genocide, although the aftermath left Cambodia in a state of devastation and recovery that continues to this day.

## Methodology

To gather information on how the Cambodian Genocide ended, I utilized a combination of online resources, including historical articles, academic publications, and reputable websites. Key search terms included "Cambodian Genocide end," "Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia," and "Khmer Rouge overthrow." The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the events leading to the end of the genocide.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Vietnamese Invasion**: The genocide ended when "Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in 1979, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge government" [^1]. This invasion was a direct response to the Khmer Rouge's hostile actions, including cross-border raids into Vietnam, which resulted in significant civilian casualties.

2. **Establishment of a New Government**: Following the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, "the People's Republic of Kampuchea was established" [^2]. This new government was backed by Vietnam and marked a significant shift in Cambodia's political landscape, moving away from the brutal policies of the Khmer Rouge.

3. **International Trials and Accountability**: In the years following the genocide, efforts were made to hold the Khmer Rouge leaders accountable. "On 2 January 2001, the Cambodian government established the Khmer Rouge Tribunal to try the members of the Khmer Rouge leadership responsible for the Cambodian genocide" [^3]. Trials began in 2009, with several leaders being convicted for their roles in the genocide.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may contain biases or inaccuracies. Additionally, the complexity of historical events like the Cambodian Genocide means that interpretations can vary, and some details may be contested among scholars. Access to primary sources or firsthand accounts would provide a more nuanced understanding of the events. Furthermore, the political context and international relations at the time also influenced the narrative, which may not be fully captured in the available resources.
