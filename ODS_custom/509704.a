# Influence of Culture on Deviance: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The concept of deviance is deeply intertwined with cultural norms and values. Deviance refers to behaviors or actions that violate societal norms, and what is considered deviant can vary significantly across different cultures and time periods. This report explores how culture influences deviance, highlighting the role of cultural norms in defining what is considered deviant behavior. It also examines the impact of cultural deviance theory and the role of subcultures in shaping deviant behavior.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online platforms, including Quora, Brainly, and Bartleby, to gather diverse perspectives on the relationship between culture and deviance. The search focused on academic essays, expert opinions, and theoretical frameworks related to cultural deviance.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Norms and Deviance**: Culture plays a crucial role in defining what is considered deviant behavior. As Michael Kavanagh notes, "‘Deviancy’ is usually defined as acts outside established cultural norms"[^1]. This implies that deviance is relative and can change as cultural norms evolve over time.

2. **Cultural Deviance Theory**: This theory suggests that crime and deviance are strongly correlated with cultural values and norms. According to the theory, individuals may engage in deviant behavior not due to inherent traits but because of the cultural environment they are part of. "Cultural Deviance Theory states that crime is correlated strongly to the cultural values and norms prevalent in a society"[^2].

3. **Subcultures and Deviance**: Subcultures within a larger society can have their own norms that may encourage deviant behavior. As noted in the context of gang culture, "In some subcultures, a system or acceptance of cultural deviance can be commonly present and accepted, even encouraged"[^3]. This highlights how subcultural norms can diverge from mainstream cultural values, leading to behaviors considered deviant by the larger society.

## Limitations

- **Subjectivity**: The concept of deviance is inherently subjective, and interpretations can vary widely based on cultural, social, and individual perspectives.
- **Limited Scope**: The analysis is based on available online resources, which may not cover all aspects of the topic comprehensively.
- **Dynamic Nature of Culture**: Cultural norms are dynamic and can change rapidly, making it challenging to provide a definitive analysis of deviance across all cultures and time periods.

In conclusion, culture significantly influences what is considered deviant behavior, with cultural norms and subcultures playing a pivotal role in shaping these perceptions. Understanding the cultural context is essential for analyzing deviant behavior and its implications within a society.
