# Distilled Water Shortage: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

The shortage of distilled water has become a notable issue, particularly affecting those who rely on it for medical devices like CPAP machines, as well as for other uses such as humidifiers and automotive batteries. The scarcity is attributed to several factors, including increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and panic buying. This report delves into the reasons behind the shortage, its implications, and potential solutions.

## Methodology

To gather information on the distilled water shortage, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including news articles, forums, and expert opinions. Key search terms included "distilled water shortage," "distilled water supply chain," and "distilled water demand." The search aimed to identify credible sources and gather diverse perspectives on the issue.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Increased Demand and Panic Buying**: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in demand for distilled water, primarily due to its use in medical devices like CPAP machines and humidifiers. Panic buying has exacerbated the situation, as noted by a forum user: "There is a shortage of distilled water. I looked for an explanation and evidently, the problem is panic buying by people who don't normally buy distilled water" [^1].

2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, affecting the production and distribution of distilled water. A Reddit user highlighted this issue, stating, "There is a bottle and can shortage and manufacturers are concentrating on core flavors that are more valuable. That means gallon jugs are being set aside for more profitable 20oz water" [^2].

3. **Alternative Solutions and DIY Methods**: In response to the shortage, some individuals have resorted to making their own distilled water at home. A user on a senior forum shared their experience: "I didn't use any ice and nothing special. Used my pressure cooker pan and bought a glass lid... I have enough distilled water for a week" [^3]. This DIY approach, while feasible, may not be practical for everyone.
