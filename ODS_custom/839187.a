# Report on Societal Views of Independence and Interdependence

## Executive Summary

This report explores how different societies perceive the concepts of independence and interdependence. It highlights the cultural variations in valuing these concepts, with a focus on how they shape individual and collective behaviors. The findings suggest that while Western societies often emphasize independence, many non-Western cultures prioritize interdependence, reflecting a balance between personal autonomy and communal support.

## Methodology

To gather information, I utilized a combination of academic databases and educational platforms, including Course Hero, Bartleby, and Study.com. These sources provided insights into cultural psychology and societal norms regarding independence and interdependence. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "society view independence," "interdependence," and "cultural psychology."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Western Emphasis on Independence**: In many Western cultures, independence is often seen as a sign of maturity and self-reliance. "In today’s society, people tend to be in favor of being more independent rather than dependent. Dependence can be viewed as weakness sometimes" [^1]. This perspective is deeply embedded in cultural narratives that associate success with individual achievement.

2. **Interdependence in Non-Western Cultures**: In contrast, many non-Western societies value interdependence, where communal relationships and family ties are prioritized. "In the society where my family is from, interdependence is valued more over complete independence" [^2]. This reflects a cultural philosophy that emphasizes mutual support and collective well-being.

3. **Balancing Independence and Interdependence**: Some scholars argue for a balanced approach, recognizing the benefits of both independence and interdependence. "Interdependence means that the relationship between two individuals does not sacrifice or compromise both person’s values" [^1]. This balance is seen as essential for creating well-rounded individuals and healthy societies.

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of sources that primarily reflect academic and educational perspectives. Cultural nuances and individual experiences may vary widely, and the sources used may not fully capture the diversity of views within each society. Additionally, the reliance on online educational platforms may introduce bias towards more formalized interpretations of cultural norms. Further research involving direct ethnographic studies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of these concepts across different cultures.
