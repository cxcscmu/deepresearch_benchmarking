# Report: Frequency of Gun Use in Self-Defense

## Executive Summary

The frequency of gun use in self-defense is a contentious topic with widely varying estimates. While some studies suggest that guns are used defensively millions of times each year, others argue that such instances are rare. The disparity in these estimates is largely due to differences in research methodologies and definitions of what constitutes self-defense. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of defensive gun use (DGU) in the United States.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of academic databases, reputable news sources, and specialized research centers. The search strategy included keywords such as "defensive gun use," "self-defense with firearms," and "gun use statistics." Tools like Google Scholar and institutional access to journals were employed to ensure a broad and credible range of sources.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Estimates of Defensive Gun Use**: Estimates of how often guns are used in self-defense vary significantly. According to a 1995 study by criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, there are between 2.2 and 2.5 million defensive gun uses annually[^1]. However, this figure is contested by other researchers who argue that such high numbers are implausible due to the lack of corresponding medical and police records[^2].

2. **Criticism of High Estimates**: Critics of the high estimates, such as David Hemenway from Harvard University, argue that the methodology used in studies like Kleck's leads to overestimation. Hemenway's analysis of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data suggests that guns are used in self-defense in only about 0.9% of crimes[^3]. This discrepancy is attributed to the challenges of accurately surveying rare events and the potential for respondents to exaggerate their experiences.

3. **Alternative Estimates**: Other studies, such as the 2021 National Firearms Survey, estimate that guns are used in self-defense approximately 1.67 million times per year[^4]. This survey, which involved a large sample size, suggests a middle ground between the extremes of previous estimates.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on self-reported data, which can be subject to bias and inaccuracies. Additionally, the lack of a standardized definition of "self-defense" complicates comparisons across studies. The estimates also vary widely due to differences in survey methodologies, sample sizes, and the populations surveyed. As such, any conclusions drawn from these data should be considered with caution.
