# Amazon's Initial Consideration for International Expansion

## Executive Summary
Amazon's decision to pursue international expansion was driven by several strategic factors. The company recognized the potential for growth beyond its domestic market, driven by the rapid increase in internet usage globally and the rising purchasing power in international markets. By expanding internationally, Amazon aimed to leverage its e-commerce platform to tap into new customer bases, diversify its revenue streams, and establish a global presence that would enhance its competitive edge.

## Methodology
To gather information on Amazon's international expansion strategy, I utilized a combination of academic resources, business case studies, and industry analyses. The search involved accessing online educational platforms, business blogs, and expert opinions on forums like Quora. Key search terms included "Amazon international expansion strategy," "reasons for Amazon's global growth," and "Amazon's market entry strategies."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Internet Growth and Market Potential**: One of the primary reasons Amazon considered international expansion was the explosive growth of internet usage worldwide. "Internet growth was 2,300 percent in 1994," which presented a significant opportunity for e-commerce platforms like Amazon to reach a broader audience [^1]. This growth indicated a burgeoning market for online retail, which Amazon was well-positioned to capitalize on.

2. **Strategic Market Selection**: Amazon's strategy involved entering markets with high GDP and good internet penetration. This approach allowed Amazon to establish itself in economically robust regions with a ready customer base. "The selection criteria was basically high GDP and good internet penetration and this got them involved early in UK, Germany, France, Japan, China, in addition to the US" [^2]. These markets provided a fertile ground for Amazon's business model to thrive.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**: By expanding internationally, Amazon aimed to diversify its operations and reduce dependency on the US market. This strategy was not only about capturing new revenue streams but also about mitigating risks associated with market saturation and economic fluctuations in a single region. "International expansion has always been a key factor for any industries or companies to expand their markets across the globe" [^3]. This diversification was crucial for Amazon's long-term sustainability and growth.
