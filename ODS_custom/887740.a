# Report on Colonial Reactions to the Stamp Act

## Executive Summary

The Stamp Act of 1765, imposed by the British Parliament, was met with vehement opposition from the American colonists. This legislation required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. The act was seen as a direct attempt by Britain to raise revenue in the colonies without the approval of the colonial legislatures. The colonists' reaction was marked by widespread protests, economic boycotts, and the formation of the Stamp Act Congress, which articulated a unified colonial response. The slogan "No Taxation Without Representation" became a rallying cry against the perceived overreach of British authority.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Widespread Protests and Boycotts**: The Stamp Act led to significant unrest across the colonies. "Collectively, all the 13 colonies started boycotting British goods and trade with them. Started protest with slogans like ‘No taxation without representation’" [^2]. This unified action demonstrated the colonies' willingness to resist British policies collectively.

2. **Violence and Intimidation**: The response to the Stamp Act was not only peaceful. Some colonists resorted to violence and intimidation against British officials. "Attacks and riots on duty collectors started increasing. Journalists started writing against this act in newspapers, magazines, and make colonists aware of the bad decision of the British parliament" [^2]. This indicates the depth of anger and frustration among the colonists.

3. **Formation of the Stamp Act Congress**: In a more organized response, the colonies convened the Stamp Act Congress. "In October 1765, 28 delegates from nine different colonies... gathered in New York to discuss possible responses to the stamp tax crisis" [^1]. This congress was pivotal in drafting the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, which asserted that only colonial assemblies had the right to tax the colonies.
