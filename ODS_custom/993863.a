# Report: Why Capital Punishment Should Be Banned

## Executive Summary

Capital punishment, or the death penalty, remains a contentious issue worldwide. This report explores the arguments for banning capital punishment, focusing on its ethical implications, economic inefficiencies, and lack of deterrence effect. The findings suggest that capital punishment is not only morally questionable but also economically burdensome and ineffective in reducing crime rates.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and academic resources. The search focused on articles, essays, and discussions that present arguments against capital punishment. Key search terms included "capital punishment ban," "death penalty ethics," and "economic impact of death penalty." The sources were selected based on their relevance and credibility.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Ethical and Moral Concerns**: Capital punishment is often criticized for its ethical implications. It is argued that no one has the right to take another person's life, regardless of the crime committed. As one source notes, "Capital punishment goes against almost all beliefs. No one has the right to say who lives and who dies" [^1]. This perspective aligns with the moral stance that taking a life, even legally, is fundamentally wrong.

2. **Economic Costs**: The financial burden of capital punishment is significant. The process involves extensive legal procedures, including trials and appeals, which are costly. One source highlights that "the death sentence costs millions to do because of court fees and the drug that is injected into the criminal takes years to acquire and cost thousands to get" [^2]. This makes capital punishment more expensive than life imprisonment without parole.

3. **Lack of Deterrence**: There is little evidence to support the claim that capital punishment deters crime more effectively than other forms of punishment. Research indicates that "there is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than a prison term" [^3]. In fact, some studies suggest that states without the death penalty have lower homicide rates.
