# Report: Should People in Prison Be Allowed to Vote?

## Executive Summary

The debate over whether prisoners should be allowed to vote is a contentious issue that touches on fundamental questions of democracy, citizenship, and human rights. Proponents argue that voting is a basic democratic right that should not be stripped away, even from those who are incarcerated. They suggest that allowing prisoners to vote could aid in their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Opponents, however, argue that committing a crime results in the forfeiture of certain civic rights, including voting, as part of the punishment. This report explores the arguments on both sides of the debate, drawing on various sources and perspectives.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online databases, debate forums, and scholarly articles. Key search terms included "prisoners voting rights," "felon disenfranchisement," and "democracy and incarceration." The sources were selected based on their relevance, credibility, and the diversity of perspectives they offered on the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Human Rights and Democracy**: Proponents of prisoner voting rights argue that voting is a fundamental democratic right. As noted by Bernie Sanders, "This is a democracy and we have got to expand that democracy, and I believe every single person does have the right to vote. Yes, even for terrible people" [^1]. This perspective emphasizes that disenfranchisement undermines the democratic principle that all citizens should have a voice in governance.

2. **Rehabilitation and Reintegration**: Allowing prisoners to vote is seen as a step towards rehabilitation. According to an article from The Sentencing Project, "Engagement in the political process provides an avenue for a connection to the health of the broader community" [^2]. This suggests that voting can help prisoners maintain ties to society, which is crucial for successful reintegration upon release.

3. **Punishment and Civic Death**: Opponents argue that prisoners have forfeited their right to vote by breaking the law. As one source articulates, "Being in prison means you are cut off from civic engagement... It is pointless, and wrong, to have the right to vote" [^3]. This view holds that losing the right to vote is part of the broader societal condemnation and punishment for criminal behavior.

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of recent data and the potential bias in sources advocating for or against prisoner voting rights. Additionally, the legal and cultural context varies significantly across different jurisdictions, which may affect the applicability of certain arguments. Further research could include empirical studies on the impact of prisoner voting on rehabilitation and recidivism rates.
