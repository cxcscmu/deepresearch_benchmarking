# Dubai's Value Creation from Resources and Capabilities

## Executive Summary

Dubai has transformed from a modest trading port to a global business hub, leveraging its strategic location, diversified economy, and robust infrastructure. The emirate's value creation is primarily driven by its non-oil sectors, including tourism, real estate, finance, and trade. This report explores how Dubai capitalizes on its resources and capabilities to sustain economic growth and maintain its competitive edge.

## Methodology

To gather information, I utilized a combination of online databases, academic articles, and reputable websites. Key search terms included "Dubai economic resources," "Dubai capabilities," and "value creation in Dubai." The primary tools used were Google Scholar, Wikipedia, and industry-specific websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Diversified Economy**: Dubai's economy is predominantly non-oil-based, with oil contributing less than 1% to its GDP. The emirate has successfully diversified into sectors such as tourism, real estate, and finance. "Most of Dubai's GDP (over 95%) is non-oil-based. So far oil has accounted for less than 1% of Dubai’s GDP and tourism to produce 20% of the GDP" [^1].

2. **Strategic Location and Infrastructure**: Dubai's geographical position between Europe, Asia, and Africa makes it a pivotal trade and logistics hub. The city has invested heavily in infrastructure, including the Jebel Ali Port and Dubai International Airport, which facilitate global trade and tourism. "Dubai is located strategically between the Far East and Europe on the East-West axis and between the central Americas and Africa on the north-south axis" [^2].

3. **Free Zones and Business Environment**: The establishment of free zones like Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza) has attracted foreign investment by offering tax incentives and full foreign ownership. These zones are crucial in creating a business-friendly environment that fosters economic growth. "In 1985, the first free zone in Dubai was established – Jafza, the Jebel Ali Free Zone. This became the largest free zone in the world" [^3].
