# Global Health Funding: Contributions from Wealthy Countries

## Executive Summary

The issue of global health funding is critical, especially in addressing health disparities between high-income and low-income countries. Wealthy nations have a significant role to play in bridging the financial gap necessary to provide essential health services worldwide. This report explores the appropriate level of contribution from wealthy countries to global health initiatives, considering both economic and moral imperatives.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive review of available literature and data was conducted using various online resources, including reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), academic articles, and expert opinions. The search focused on global health expenditure, the 10/90 gap, and the economic rationale for increased contributions from wealthy nations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Current Spending and Disparities**: The WHO estimates that the average expenditure per capita for health in low-income countries is about $20 per year, while in Western countries, it is approximately $947[^1]. The target to help the most disadvantaged countries is $44-60 per capita, which would ensure access to essential health services[^2].

2. **The 10/90 Gap**: The term "10/90 gap" highlights the disparity where only 10% of global health research resources are devoted to conditions that account for 90% of the global disease burden[^3]. This gap underscores the need for increased funding from wealthy countries to address neglected diseases prevalent in low-income regions.

3. **Economic and Moral Imperatives**: A study commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce found that vaccinating a fifth of the world's vulnerable population would cost less than $40 billion, while not doing so could incur losses of more than $1.8 trillion[^4]. This illustrates the economic rationale for wealthy countries to invest in global health, beyond the moral obligation to support equitable health access.
