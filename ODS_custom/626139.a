# Ethical Dilemmas Faced by Managers

## Executive Summary
Managers often encounter situations where their ethical values conflict with business decisions. These ethical dilemmas arise due to various factors, including pressure to meet business objectives, conflicting values, and organizational culture. Understanding these dilemmas is crucial for fostering ethical decision-making in business environments.

## Methodology
To address the query, I conducted a comprehensive search using online databases and articles related to business ethics and managerial decision-making. The search focused on identifying common causes of ethical dilemmas for managers and how these conflicts manifest in business settings. The tools used included Google Scholar, business ethics journals, and reputable business websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Pressure to Meet Business Objectives**: Managers often face intense pressure to achieve short-term business goals, which can lead to ethical compromises. "Managers have to weigh different obligations when making decisions. Policies and procedures, ethics guidelines, directions from superiors, customer needs, and strategic goals all affect the final outcome" [^1]. This pressure can lead to decisions that prioritize business outcomes over ethical considerations.

2. **Conflicting Values**: Ethical dilemmas frequently arise from conflicting values within an organization. For instance, "Ethical dilemmas may occur because of conflicting values between two or more people in an organization. One manager may value product quality over quantity while another manager may value thriftiness" [^1]. Such conflicts can force managers to make decisions that align with one set of values while compromising another.

3. **Organizational Culture and Lack of Accountability**: The culture within an organization can significantly influence ethical decision-making. "Another reason that managers and employees may find themselves in ethical dilemmas is because they're not held accountable by superiors" [^1]. When ethical guidelines are not enforced, managers may feel justified in making decisions that conflict with their personal values.

4. **Cognitive Dissonance and Self-Justification**: Managers may experience cognitive dissonance when their actions conflict with their ethical beliefs. "Dissonance is such an uncomfortable state, that we intuitively try to reduce it, sometimes by moderating our actions, but far more often through self-justification" [^2]. This self-justification can lead to a cycle of unethical behavior as managers rationalize their decisions.

## Limitations
The findings are based on available literature and may not encompass all possible scenarios of ethical dilemmas faced by managers. Additionally, the perspectives provided are primarily from Western business contexts, which may not fully apply to different cultural or organizational settings. Further research could explore a broader range of industries and cultural influences on managerial ethics.
