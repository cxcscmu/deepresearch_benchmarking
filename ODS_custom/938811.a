# Report: The Cruelty of Keeping Animals in Cages

## Executive Summary

The practice of keeping animals in cages, particularly in zoos, has been a subject of ethical debate. Critics argue that it is inherently cruel due to the deprivation of freedom, natural behaviors, and the psychological and physical harm it causes to animals. This report explores the reasons why caging animals is considered cruel, drawing on various perspectives and studies.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online databases and search engines to gather relevant articles and essays. The search terms included "cruelty of caging animals," "animals in zoos," and "ethical issues of animal captivity." The sources were selected based on their relevance and the diversity of viewpoints they offered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Deprivation of Natural Behaviors and Freedom**: Animals in cages are unable to exhibit their natural behaviors, which can lead to a loss of essential survival skills. "Animals are restrained in cages all day. They have no freedom at all, unlike the animals which live in the wild and have run free in forests and Savannah" [^1]. This confinement can lead to boredom and frustration, causing animals to develop abnormal behaviors.

2. **Psychological and Physical Harm**: The confinement of animals can lead to significant psychological stress and physical health issues. "Animals in and zoos and other confined areas cannot exercise, explore, play, forage and socialize in a way that they are meant to and they start to exhibit abnormal behavior after a time" [^2]. This stress can manifest in behaviors such as pacing, self-mutilation, and depression.

3. **Reduced Life Expectancy**: Despite the provision of food and medical care, animals in captivity often have a reduced life expectancy compared to their wild counterparts. "An example is the whale shark which can live at least 70 years, only can lives for 3 years in the zoo" [^1]. This reduction in lifespan is attributed to the stress and unnatural living conditions in captivity.

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of sources that predominantly focus on the negative aspects of animal captivity. While efforts were made to include a balanced view, the sources primarily highlight the cruelty and ethical concerns associated with caging animals. Further research could include more perspectives from zoological institutions and conservationists who may argue for the benefits of captivity in certain contexts.
