## Executive Summary

The Stuart period, spanning from 1603 to 1689, was a transformative era for the British monarchy. This period witnessed significant shifts in the balance of power between the monarchy and Parliament, leading to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Key events such as the English Civil War, the execution of King Charles I, the Interregnum under Oliver Cromwell, and the Glorious Revolution were pivotal in redefining the monarchy's role. By the end of this period, the monarchy had transitioned from an absolute to a constitutional form, with Parliament gaining supremacy.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive review of historical sources and scholarly articles was conducted. The primary sources included historical timelines, encyclopedic entries, and academic discussions on the Stuart period. Key search strategies involved identifying authoritative historical databases and cross-referencing multiple sources to ensure accuracy and depth of information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Shift from Absolute to Constitutional Monarchy**: The Stuart period began with James I, who believed in the Divine Right of Kings, asserting that he was answerable only to God and not to any earthly authority[^1]. However, by the end of the period, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had established parliamentary supremacy, effectively limiting the monarch's power and laying the groundwork for a constitutional monarchy[^2].

2. **Conflict and Civil War**: The reign of Charles I was marked by significant conflict with Parliament, leading to the English Civil War. Charles's belief in absolute monarchy and his attempts to govern without Parliament led to his execution in 1649[^3]. This event was a turning point, demonstrating the limits of monarchical power and the rising influence of Parliament.

3. **The Interregnum and Restoration**: Following the execution of Charles I, England experienced a period without a monarch, known as the Interregnum, under Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth. This period highlighted the challenges of governance without a monarchy and eventually led to the Restoration of Charles II in 1660[^4]. The Restoration reestablished the monarchy but with a clearer understanding of the need for cooperation with Parliament.

4. **The Glorious Revolution**: The overthrow of James II in 1688, known as the Glorious Revolution, was a decisive moment that further curtailed monarchical power. William III and Mary II ascended the throne under conditions that emphasized parliamentary authority and religious tolerance, marking a significant shift towards a constitutional monarchy[^5].
