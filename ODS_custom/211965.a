# The Impact of Littering on the Environment

## Executive Summary

Littering is a significant environmental issue that affects ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. It contributes to pollution in various forms, including soil, water, and air pollution, and poses a threat to biodiversity. This report explores the multifaceted impacts of littering on the environment, highlighting the detrimental effects on wildlife, ecosystems, and human communities. It also discusses potential solutions and preventive measures to mitigate these impacts.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on gathering information from reputable sources that discuss the environmental impacts of littering. The search strategy included keywords such as "littering effects on environment," "wildlife impact of litter," and "pollution from littering." The tools used included Google Scholar, environmental science databases, and educational websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact on Wildlife and Ecosystems**: Littering poses a severe threat to wildlife, particularly marine animals. "Plastic waste, water pollution, soil runoff, and jars and bottles make up just a few of the human-made products and byproducts that can harm the Earth and the species that live on it" [^1]. Animals often ingest litter, mistaking it for food, which can lead to choking, starvation, and death. "Marine wildlife such as seabirds, whales, fish, and turtles mistake plastic waste for prey; most then die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic" [^2].

2. **Pollution and Health Hazards**: Litter contributes to various forms of pollution. "Litter can also pollute the air. Researchers estimate that more than 40% of the worldâ€™s litter is burned in the open air, which can release toxic emissions" [^3]. These emissions can cause respiratory issues and other health problems in humans and animals.

3. **Economic and Social Impacts**: Littering affects local economies by reducing the aesthetic value of communities and deterring tourism. "Litter discourages economic development because it impacts real estate values. Good stores and important businesses will not locate in a community which lacks the pride to effectively control litter" [^4]. Additionally, the cost of cleaning up litter is a financial burden on local governments and communities.
