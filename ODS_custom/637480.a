Fiscal policy can be categorized into expansionary and contractionary policies, each serving different economic conditions. This report explores how fiscal policy works, its tools, and its impact on the economy.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including educational websites, financial advisory platforms, and economic encyclopedias. The search focused on understanding the mechanisms of fiscal policy, its historical context, and its practical applications. Key sources included articles from Bizfluent, Forbes, and the Library of Economics and Liberty.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Purpose**: Fiscal policy involves government decisions on taxation and spending to influence the economy. It aims to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as controlling inflation, stimulating economic growth, and reducing unemployment. "Fiscal policy is the legislative actions a government makes to regulate its economy to attain growth and alleviate poverty, usually through spending and taxation" [^1].

2. **Tools of Fiscal Policy**: The primary tools of fiscal policy are government spending and taxation. By adjusting these levers, governments can either inject money into the economy or withdraw it. "Fiscal policy is broken down into two categories: government spending and taxation. As a spender, the government has the power to create and remunerate public sector jobs, invest in public works like highways, and provide transfer payments to the citizenry" [^2].

3. **Types of Fiscal Policy**: 
   - **Expansionary Fiscal Policy**: Used during economic downturns to stimulate growth by increasing government spending or cutting taxes. This approach aims to increase disposable income and boost consumer spending. "Expansionary fiscal policy is meant to help the economy grow, recover or generally expand, such as after a large economic dip or crash" [^3].
   - **Contractionary Fiscal Policy**: Implemented to cool down an overheating economy by reducing spending or increasing taxes, thereby controlling inflation. "Contractionary fiscal policy aims to help cool off periods of too rapid growth that might pose a threat to a steady economic growth rate" [^3].

4. **Impact on the Economy**: Fiscal policy affects aggregate demand, employment, and inflation. It can also influence interest rates and exchange rates. "Fiscal policy has macroeconomic implications beyond consumer spending. In particular, it affects the interest rate and exchange rate" [^2].
