# Media Bias/Fact Check Credibility Report

## Executive Summary

Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) is a website that evaluates the bias and factual accuracy of media sources. Founded in 2015 by Dave Van Zandt, MBFC aims to educate the public on media bias and deceptive news practices. While it is widely used and cited by various institutions, its methodology has been criticized for being subjective and lacking scientific rigor. This report evaluates the credibility of MBFC by examining its methodology, funding, and reception from both supporters and critics.

## Methodology

To assess the credibility of Media Bias/Fact Check, the following strategies were employed:
- **Literature Review**: Analyzed articles and discussions from reputable sources such as Columbia Journalism Review and Poynter Institute.
- **Direct Source Analysis**: Reviewed MBFC's own descriptions of its methodology and operations.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Compared MBFC's ratings with those from other fact-checking organizations like Snopes and FactCheck.org.
- **Community Feedback**: Considered user reviews and feedback from platforms like Skeptics Meta Stack Exchange.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Methodology and Subjectivity**: MBFC's methodology involves rating media sources on a 0-10 scale across four categories: biased wording, factual sourcing, story choices, and political affiliation. Critics argue that this approach is subjective. "The Columbia Journalism Review has described MBFC reviews as subjective assessments that 'leave room for human biases, or even simple inconsistencies, to creep in'" [^1].

2. **Funding and Independence**: MBFC is funded through reader donations, third-party advertising, and membership subscriptions. The site claims that using third-party ads helps maintain independence, as they do not select the ads displayed. "We strictly rely on third-party advertising, meaning we do not pick the ads so that we can remain free of influence" [^2].

3. **Reception and Criticism**: MBFC is frequently cited by libraries and educational institutions, indicating a level of trust in its evaluations. However, it has faced criticism for its lack of scientific methodology. "Media Bias/Fact Check is a widely cited source for news stories and even studies about misinformation, despite the fact that its method is in no way scientific" [^3].
