# Late-Term Abortions in the United States: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

Late-term abortions, defined as those occurring after 20 weeks of gestation, are a contentious topic in the United States. Despite the political and ethical debates surrounding them, these procedures are relatively rare. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1.3% of all abortions in the U.S. occur after 21 weeks of gestation[^1]. The reasons for these procedures vary, including fetal abnormalities and risks to the mother's health, but logistical and financial barriers also play a significant role[^2]. This report synthesizes available data to provide a comprehensive overview of the incidence and context of late-term abortions in the U.S.

## Methodology

To gather information on late-term abortions, a variety of sources were consulted, including government reports, academic studies, and reputable news articles. The primary sources of data were the CDC and the Guttmacher Institute, both of which provide detailed statistics on abortion in the U.S. Additional insights were drawn from articles in The Guardian and The Washington Post, which offer context and analysis of the data. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "late-term abortion statistics," "CDC abortion data," and "Guttmacher Institute abortion report."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Incidence of Late-Term Abortions**: 
   - The CDC reports that in 2015, 1.3% of abortions were performed at or after 21 weeks of gestation[^1]. This percentage aligns with estimates from the Guttmacher Institute, which also found that 1.3% of abortions occurred at or over 21 weeks out of a total of 926,200 abortions in 2014[^3].
   - The vast majority of abortions (91%) occur at or before 13 weeks of pregnancy, highlighting the rarity of late-term procedures[^2].

2. **Reasons for Late-Term Abortions**:
   - Women may seek late-term abortions due to fetal abnormalities or health risks to the mother. However, logistical issues such as difficulty accessing services and financial constraints are also significant factors[^2].
   - A study by Foster and Kimport (2013) found that women seeking late-term abortions often faced barriers such as finding a provider, raising funds, and travel costs[^4].

3. **Public Perception and Misconceptions**:
   - There is a common misconception that late-term abortions are more frequent than they are. Media reports and political rhetoric often exaggerate their prevalence[^5].
   - The term "late-term" itself is often misunderstood, as it may imply abortions occurring much later in pregnancy than is typically the case[^6].

## Limitations

The data on late-term abortions is limited by inconsistent reporting across states and the lack of a federal mandate for comprehensive data collection. Additionally, the term "late-term" is not consistently defined across studies and reports, which can lead to variations in data interpretation. Furthermore, the sensitive nature of the topic means that data may be influenced by political and social biases.
