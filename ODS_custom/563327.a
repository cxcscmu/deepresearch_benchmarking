# Report: Arguments Against Abolishing the Death Penalty

## Executive Summary
The debate over the death penalty is a contentious issue with strong arguments on both sides. Proponents argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent to crime, provides justice and closure for victims' families, and is a necessary tool for dealing with the most heinous criminals. This report explores these arguments, drawing on various sources to present a comprehensive view of why some believe the death penalty should not be abolished.

## Methodology
To gather information for this report, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on Google and academic databases. I focused on reputable sources that present arguments in favor of retaining the death penalty. The search terms included "arguments for death penalty," "deterrence effect of capital punishment," and "justice and closure death penalty."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Deterrence of Crime**: One of the primary arguments for the death penalty is its potential deterrent effect on crime. Proponents argue that the fear of execution can prevent individuals from committing serious crimes. Ernest van den Haag, a Professor of Jurisprudence, stated, "Capital punishment is likely to deter more than other punishments because people fear death more than anything else" [^1]. This perspective suggests that the death penalty serves as a critical tool in reducing crime rates.

2. **Justice and Closure for Victims' Families**: The death penalty is also seen as a means of delivering justice and closure to the families of victims. It is argued that knowing the perpetrator has been executed can provide a sense of finality and peace. As noted in one source, "The death penalty gives victims closure. Victims and their families deserve to know that their tormentors will pay for their crimes" [^2]. This argument emphasizes the emotional and psychological benefits for those affected by violent crimes.

3. **Retribution and Moral Justification**: Some argue that the death penalty is a morally justified response to particularly egregious crimes. The notion of retribution is central to this argument, with the belief that certain crimes are so heinous that the only appropriate punishment is death. "The death penalty administers justice because some people deserve death. For justice to be done, a person's punishment must fit the severity of their crime" [^3]. This perspective holds that the death penalty is a necessary component of a just legal system.

## Limitations
This report is limited by the availability of sources that specifically argue against abolishing the death penalty. The arguments presented are based on the assumption that the death penalty is applied fairly and justly, which is a point of contention in broader debates. Additionally, the report does not address the ethical and moral arguments against the death penalty, which are significant in the overall discourse.
