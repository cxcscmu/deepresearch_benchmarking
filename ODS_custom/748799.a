# Report: Why Minimum Wage Should Be Increased

## Executive Summary

The debate over increasing the minimum wage is a significant socio-economic issue in the United States. Proponents argue that raising the minimum wage would reduce poverty, boost the economy, and improve the quality of life for millions of low-wage workers. Critics, however, caution about potential job losses and economic disruptions. This report synthesizes various perspectives and research findings to present a comprehensive view of the arguments for increasing the minimum wage.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online research tools and databases to gather information from reputable sources. The search strategy included keywords such as "minimum wage increase," "economic impact of raising minimum wage," and "minimum wage and poverty reduction." The sources were selected based on their relevance, credibility, and the diversity of perspectives they offer.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Reduction in Poverty and Inequality**: Increasing the minimum wage is seen as a direct method to lift millions out of poverty. According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, raising the minimum wage to $15 could benefit 40 million workers, significantly reducing poverty levels[^1]. Additionally, it would address racial and gender inequities, as marginalized groups disproportionately occupy low-wage jobs[^2].

2. **Economic Growth and Consumer Spending**: Higher wages would lead to increased consumer spending, which is crucial for economic growth. A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research suggests that if the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity, it would be around $24 per hour today[^3]. This increase in disposable income would stimulate demand for goods and services, creating a positive ripple effect across the economy.

3. **Job Creation and Employment Stability**: Contrary to the belief that raising the minimum wage leads to job losses, research indicates that it can lead to job creation. A comprehensive study of state-level minimum wage changes found no significant evidence of job losses[^4]. Instead, higher wages can reduce employee turnover, saving businesses money on recruitment and training.

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of recent data and the potential bias in sources advocating for or against minimum wage increases. Additionally, the economic impact of such policy changes can vary significantly across different regions and industries, which may not be fully captured in this analysis. Further empirical research and longitudinal studies are necessary to understand the long-term effects of minimum wage increases comprehensively.
