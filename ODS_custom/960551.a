# Assassination of Anwar Sadat: A Detailed Report

## Executive Summary

Anwar Sadat, the third President of Egypt, was assassinated on October 6, 1981, during a military parade in Cairo. The assassination was carried out by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, motivated by Sadat's peace treaty with Israel and his domestic policies. Sadat's shift towards peace with Israel, marked by the Camp David Accords, was seen as a betrayal by many in the Arab world, leading to his assassination by extremists who opposed his policies.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Motivation Behind the Assassination**: The primary motive for Sadat's assassination was his peace initiative with Israel, which was formalized in the Camp David Accords. This move was highly controversial among Arab nations and Islamist groups. "The assassination was undertaken by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad" who opposed Sadat's government and its recognition of Israel [^1].

2. **Execution of the Assassination**: The assassination took place during a military parade commemorating the Yom Kippur War. Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli led the assassination squad. "As it passed the tribune, Islambouli forced the driver at gunpoint to stop. From there, the assassins dismounted and Islambouli approached Sadat with three hand grenades concealed under his helmet" [^2]. The attack lasted about two minutes, resulting in Sadat's death and the deaths of several others.

3. **Aftermath and Reactions**: The assassination was met with mixed reactions. While it was condemned by many, some governments in the Islamic world viewed Sadat as a traitor. "The state newspaper of Syria, Tishreen, carried the headline 'Egypt Today Bids Farewell to the Ultimate Traitor,' while Iran named a street in Tehran after Islambouli" [^3].
