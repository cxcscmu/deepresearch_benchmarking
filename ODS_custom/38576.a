## Detailed Findings

1. **Personal Empowerment and Self-Care**: Individuals facing discrimination are encouraged to develop a positive self-image and challenge negative thinking.

"If you experience discrimination, report it to your manager, human resources department, or the regulating governmental authority" [^3]. Legal frameworks and advocacy can drive systemic change and hold perpetrators accountable.
