# World Hunger: Causes and Challenges

## Executive Summary

World hunger remains a significant global issue despite the fact that enough food is produced annually to feed the entire human population. The persistence of hunger is attributed to a complex interplay of factors including conflict, climate change, food wastage, economic instability, and historical legacies such as colonialism. Addressing these root causes is essential for achieving sustainable solutions to hunger.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive review of online resources was conducted. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "world hunger causes," "food insecurity," and "global hunger statistics." Sources were selected based on their relevance, credibility, and the depth of information provided. Tools like Google Scholar and online databases were utilized to access academic articles and reports.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Conflict and Displacement**: Armed conflicts disrupt food production and distribution, leading to severe food insecurity. "The ongoing decades-long conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia have severely disrupted food production, directly contributing to enduring hunger in both countries" [^1].

2. **Climate Change**: Climate change exacerbates food insecurity by affecting agricultural productivity. "Rising temperatures due to climate change may result in two percent cuts to global crop yields every decade, expected to be much more pronounced in tropical regions" [^1].

3. **Food Wastage**: A significant portion of food produced globally is wasted, which could otherwise feed millions. "Every year more than one third of food produced globally, estimated at 1.3 billion tons, is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain and is never consumed" [^1].

4. **Economic Factors**: Economic instability and poverty are closely linked to hunger. "Hunger is mainly caused by poverty. In many developing countries, poverty results from uneven income distribution, conflict, and hunger itself" [^2].

5. **Historical Legacies**: The colonial past has left many countries with an export-oriented agricultural framework, limiting their ability to feed their own populations. "Especially in Africa, many countries were designed to grow a select few cash crops for export under European colonization" [^1].

## Limitations

The report is based on available online resources and may not capture the most recent data or emerging trends in world hunger. Additionally, the complexity of the issue means that not all contributing factors can be fully explored in a single report. Further research and data collection are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding.
