## Executive Summary

The debate over the removal of Confederate statues is a contentious issue in the United States, with arguments rooted in historical, ethical, and social considerations. Proponents of removal argue that these statues symbolize racism, white supremacy, and a history of oppression, while opponents claim they represent heritage and historical memory. This report examines the arguments for the removal of Confederate statues, highlighting the moral and social imperatives driving this movement.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and news archives. The search focused on articles, opinion pieces, and scholarly essays discussing the reasons for and against the removal of Confederate statues. Key search terms included "Confederate statues removal," "arguments for removing Confederate monuments," and "Confederate statues and racism." The findings were synthesized from multiple sources to provide a balanced view of the arguments.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Symbols of Racism and Oppression**: Confederate statues are seen by many as symbols of racism and oppression. They were often erected during periods of racial tension, such as the Jim Crow era, to intimidate Black Americans and reinforce white supremacy. "These statues only represent and idolize a history of racism and oppression" [^1]. The original purpose of these statues was to celebrate white power and intimidate Black communities [^2].

2. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: There is a strong moral argument for the removal of Confederate statues. They are seen as causing harm by serving as constant reminders of America's racist past. "Public Confederate monuments unavoidably harm...those who suffer as a result of knowing the racist motivation behind the existence of most Confederate monuments" [^3]. The removal of these statues is seen as a necessary step in addressing historical injustices and promoting racial equality.

3. **Historical Context and Education**: While some argue that removing statues erases history, others contend that these monuments distort historical narratives. "Confederate monuments themselves impart much in the way of historical knowledge. They may even distort the historical record" [^3]. Placing these statues in museums, where they can be contextualized, is suggested as a way to preserve history without glorifying the Confederacy.
