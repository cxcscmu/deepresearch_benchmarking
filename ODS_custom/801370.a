# Report on How Hitler Addressed the German Economic Crisis

## Executive Summary

Adolf Hitler's approach to reviving the German economy during his regime was multifaceted, involving both economic and political strategies. His policies were aimed at reducing unemployment, stimulating industrial growth, and preparing Germany for war. These measures included large-scale public works, rearmament, and economic autarky. While these policies temporarily boosted the economy and reduced unemployment, they were also intertwined with aggressive militarization and expansionist policies that ultimately led to World War II.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including historical essays, economic analyses, and educational websites. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Hitler economic policies," "Nazi Germany economy," and "Hitler unemployment reduction." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Public Works and Employment Programs**: Hitler's regime focused on reducing unemployment through state-funded work-creation programs. "Hitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the economist Hjalmar Schacht who provided employment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This project produced the famous German superhighways and the people’s car, the Volkswagen" [^1].

2. **Rearmament and Military Expansion**: A significant part of Hitler's economic strategy was rearmament, which not only prepared Germany for war but also absorbed a large portion of the unemployed. "Hitler invested hugely in rearmament as the state still ran on deficit financing" [^2]. This military buildup was a key factor in reducing unemployment and stimulating industrial production.

3. **Economic Autarky and Industrial Growth**: Hitler aimed to make Germany economically self-sufficient to withstand potential blockades during wartime. "Part of the Nazi’s plan was to make Germany much more self-sufficient, in order that, in the event of war, they would be unaffected by economic sanctions" [^3]. This involved limiting imports, expanding exports, and increasing government spending in key industries.

## Limitations

The report is based on secondary sources, which may contain biases or incomplete information. The complexity of historical economic policies and their impacts can be difficult to fully capture in a brief report. Additionally, the intertwining of economic policies with political and military strategies under Hitler's regime complicates the analysis of purely economic outcomes. Further research using primary sources and scholarly analyses would provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic.
