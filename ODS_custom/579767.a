# Report on the Consequences of Children Not Liking to Share

## Executive Summary
The concept of sharing is often seen as a fundamental social skill that children are expected to learn early in life. However, many children naturally resist sharing, which can lead to various developmental and social consequences. This report explores the reasons behind children's reluctance to share, the potential impacts of not sharing, and strategies to encourage sharing behavior in a developmentally appropriate manner.

## Methodology
To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of online resources, including educational articles, parenting guides, and expert opinions. The search was conducted using Google and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Key search terms included "children not sharing consequences," "developmental impact of not sharing," and "teaching children to share."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Developmental Understanding and Empathy**: 
   - Children often struggle with sharing due to a lack of developmental readiness. According to Dr. Bill Sears, "True sharing implies empathy, the ability to get into anotherâ€™s mind and see things from their viewpoint. Children are seldom capable of true empathy under the age of six" [^1]. This suggests that forcing children to share before they are developmentally ready can be counterproductive.

2. **Impact on Social Skills**:
   - Forcing children to share can lead to negative social behaviors. Clinical psychologist Laura Markham notes that "forced sharing actually teaches some of the wrong lessons, such as: Crying loudly will help a child get what they want" [^2]. This can result in children developing manipulative behaviors rather than genuine generosity.

3. **Emotional Consequences**:
   - Children who are pressured to share may experience feelings of resentment and anxiety. Parenting educator Deanna Bosley highlights that "Often when children are made to share, feelings of resentment, unfairness, and anger are swirling in their heads rather than the feelings of kindness and generosity that one would hope for or expect" [^3]. This emotional turmoil can hinder the development of positive social interactions.
