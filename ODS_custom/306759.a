## Detailed Findings

### Long-Term Causes

1. **Militarism**: The early 20th century saw a significant buildup of military forces among European powers. "In the early 20th century, Germany had the strongest and largest army in the world. Britain dominated the oceans, and both countries were working furiously to better each other in both aspects" [^1]. This arms race created an environment ripe for conflict.

2. **Alliances**: The intricate system of alliances in Europe meant that any conflict could quickly escalate. "The two key alliances of the time were the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. These alliances were made up of Germany, Italy, and the empire of Austria-Hungary, and France, Russia, and Great Britain, respectively" [^2]. These alliances obligated countries to support each other in the event of war, leading to a domino effect.

3. **Imperialism**: The competition for colonies and global dominance heightened tensions. "Imperialism was carried out by the powerful European nations against the rest of the world in the decades before World War I began" [^3]. This struggle for power and resources contributed to the animosity between nations.

4. **Nationalism**: National pride and the desire for independence among various ethnic groups further fueled tensions. "Nationalism began to develop in Europe in the 1800s and helped to form alliances between countries that had a similar culture and spoke the same languages" [^1]. This often led to conflicts over territory and influence.

### Short-Term Causes

1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The immediate trigger for the war was the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir by a Serbian nationalist. "Franz Ferdinand was shot dead on June 28, 1914. He was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne" [^2]. This event set off a chain reaction of alliances being activated.

2. **Balkan Tensions**: The Balkans were a hotspot of nationalist tensions, often referred to as a "powder keg." "The assassination of Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand in June of 1914 was the 'spark' that lit the match of the Balkans Powder Keg and plunged Europe into World War I" [^3].
