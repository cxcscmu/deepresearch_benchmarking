# Practical and Realistic Nature of Research

## Executive Summary

Research is considered practical and realistic because it is designed to address real-world problems and provide actionable solutions. Practical research, often referred to as applied research, focuses on solving specific issues, improving processes, and enhancing the quality of life. This type of research is grounded in the scientific method, ensuring that findings are based on empirical evidence and can be implemented in everyday situations.

## Methodology

To gather information on why research is practical and realistic, I utilized a combination of online search tools and databases. I focused on sources that discuss the goals and applications of practical research, including forums, educational resources, and academic articles. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "practical research," "applied research," and "realistic research applications."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Goal of Practical Research**: Practical research aims to positively impact practice by solving problems and improving processes. Chloe McPhee, a former researcher in voting technologies, explains that "the goal of practical research would be to positively impact practice (by people, organizations, systems, tools, etc.) in that domain" [^1]. This highlights the direct application of research findings to real-world scenarios.

2. **Application in Everyday Problems**: Practical research is often directed towards solving day-to-day issues. Jose Soares Augusto, a professor at the University of Lisbon, notes that "practical research is research directed towards problems which have a practical, 'day-to-day' nature" [^2]. Examples include medical research aimed at improving health outcomes and environmental studies focused on combating global warming.

3. **Scientific Method and Realism**: Research is grounded in the scientific method, which ensures that it is both practical and realistic. According to a source from The Infinite Kitchen, "research is practical and realistic because it is based on the scientific method, which demands that research should start with a hypothesis, that should be falsifiable" [^3]. This approach ensures that research findings are reliable and applicable to real-world situations.

## Limitations

The findings are based on publicly available information and may not cover all aspects of practical research. The sources used are primarily from online forums and educational websites, which may not provide the depth of peer-reviewed academic research. Additionally, the interpretation of what constitutes "practical" and "realistic" can vary across different fields and contexts.
