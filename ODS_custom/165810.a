# Dream Catchers and Cultural Appropriation: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

Dream catchers, originally crafted by the Ojibwe people, have become widely popular across various cultures. This report examines whether the use of dream catchers by non-Native individuals constitutes cultural appropriation. The findings reveal a spectrum of opinions, with some Native Americans viewing the commercialization and misuse of dream catchers as disrespectful, while others see it as a form of cultural appreciation that can foster understanding and economic benefits for Native communities.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on articles, opinion pieces, and expert discussions related to dream catchers and cultural appropriation. Key sources included Native American perspectives, cultural analysis articles, and public opinion forums.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Significance and Misuse**: Dream catchers hold significant cultural value for the Ojibwe people and other Native American tribes. They are traditionally used to protect children from nightmares. However, their commercialization and use as decorative items have led to concerns about cultural appropriation. Millie Benjamin, a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, expressed dismay at seeing dream catchers used as trinkets, stating, "It has gotten out of hand. It's disrespectful for our people. It means something to us, it's a tradition" [^1].

2. **Economic and Cultural Exchange**: Some Native Americans see the sale of dream catchers as a means of economic support and cultural exchange. Colleen Heminger-Cordell, a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, noted the demand for dream catchers post-September 11, stating, "I just never thought there would be that big of a market" [^2]. This perspective highlights the potential for cultural appreciation and economic benefit when dream catchers are purchased from Native artisans.

3. **Diverse Opinions on Appropriation**: The debate on cultural appropriation is complex, with varying opinions even within Native communities. Dark Feather Red Eagle, a Lakota Sioux elder, remarked, "A dream catcher is supposed to serve a purpose as far as dreams are concerned, as far as children are concerned, and that's not something that's meant to be sacred" [^3]. This suggests that not all Native Americans view the use of dream catchers by non-Natives as inherently disrespectful.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of diverse perspectives, particularly from Native American voices. The complexity of cultural appropriation means that opinions can vary widely even within a single community. Additionally, the data is drawn from online sources, which may not fully capture the depth of cultural sentiments. Further research, including interviews with Native American cultural experts, could provide a more nuanced understanding.
