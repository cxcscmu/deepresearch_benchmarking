# Should the Death Penalty Be Legal?

## Executive Summary

The debate over the legality of the death penalty is a contentious issue with strong arguments on both sides. Proponents argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime and delivers justice for heinous acts, while opponents contend that it is inhumane, prone to errors, and does not effectively deter crime. This report examines various perspectives on the death penalty, highlighting key arguments and evidence from both sides of the debate.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized a variety of online resources, including opinion pieces, scholarly articles, and debate forums. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "death penalty legality," "capital punishment pros and cons," and "arguments for and against the death penalty." The sources were selected based on their relevance and the diversity of viewpoints they presented.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Proponents of the Death Penalty** argue that it serves as a necessary deterrent and a form of justice for the most egregious crimes. For instance, Kimberly Scott-Williams suggests that the death penalty is essential in today's society to deal with individuals who are a "menace to society" and that it can serve as a deterrent to others [^1]. Similarly, Charles Stimson from the Heritage Foundation argues that the death penalty serves three legitimate objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution [^2].

2. **Opponents of the Death Penalty** highlight the moral and ethical concerns associated with state-sanctioned executions. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argues that the death penalty is a "barbaric remnant of uncivilized society" and does not effectively deter crime [^3]. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for wrongful executions, as highlighted by the Death Penalty Information Center, which notes that at least 4.1% of all defendants sentenced to death in the U.S. are innocent [^4].

3. **Economic Considerations** also play a role in the debate. Some argue that the death penalty is more costly than life imprisonment due to lengthy and complex legal processes. Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, stated that the death penalty has "wasted billions of taxpayer dollars" and has not provided a public safety benefit [^5].

## Limitations

The findings in this report are based on available online resources and may not encompass all perspectives on the issue. The debate over the death penalty is complex and multifaceted, with cultural, legal, and ethical dimensions that vary across different regions and legal systems. Additionally, the data on the deterrent effect of the death penalty is mixed and often influenced by methodological differences in studies. Further research, including empirical studies and expert interviews, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
