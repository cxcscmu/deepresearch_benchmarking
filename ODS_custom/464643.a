# The Representation of the American Dream in "The Great Gatsby"

## Executive Summary

F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" is a profound exploration of the American Dream, encapsulated through the character of Jay Gatsby. The novel critiques the dream's transformation from a pursuit of happiness and self-fulfillment to a quest for wealth and status. Gatsby's life story, from humble beginnings to immense wealth, reflects both the allure and the ultimate failure of the American Dream. Despite his material success, Gatsby's inability to achieve his true dream—winning Daisy Buchanan's love—highlights the dream's inherent flaws and the societal corruption of the 1920s.

## Methodology

To analyze how Gatsby represents the American Dream, I utilized a combination of online literary essays, educational resources, and expert analyses. Key search strategies included querying specific themes such as "Gatsby and the American Dream" and "The Great Gatsby critique of the American Dream." Tools like Google Scholar and educational websites like eNotes provided comprehensive insights.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Gatsby's Pursuit of Wealth and Status**: Gatsby's transformation from James Gatz to Jay Gatsby is a classic "rags to riches" story, embodying the American Dream's promise of upward mobility. However, his wealth is amassed through dubious means, reflecting the moral decay associated with the dream. "Gatsby himself is a complex symbol of the corruption of the American Dream. He is a romantic dreamer who seeks to fulfill his life by earning his wealth as a gangster" [^1].

2. **The Illusion of Recreating the Past**: Gatsby's ultimate goal is not just wealth but to recreate a past with Daisy Buchanan, symbolizing the dream's unattainability. "Gatsby represents the dream of being able to correct the mistakes of the past... He wants to reunite with Daisy but to erase everything that happened during the five years they were separated" [^2].

3. **Materialism and Its Consequences**: The novel critiques the materialistic interpretation of the American Dream, suggesting it leads to destruction rather than fulfillment. Gatsby's lavish parties and opulent lifestyle fail to bring him true happiness or genuine relationships. "Despite his immense material wealth, Gatsby fails to win Daisy back permanently... The American Dream is portrayed as a failure" [^3].
