# Report on Ending Sexual Violence in the Military

## Executive Summary

Sexual violence in the military remains a pervasive issue, with numerous reports highlighting systemic failures in addressing and preventing such incidents. Despite legislative efforts and policy reforms, the problem persists, indicating a need for a comprehensive approach that includes cultural change, accountability, and structural reforms within the military justice system. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to propose strategies for effectively ending sexual violence in the military.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and news archives. Key search terms included "military sexual assault," "military justice reform," and "ending sexual violence in the military." The search focused on credible sources such as government reports, expert opinions, and reputable news outlets. Tools like Google Scholar and news aggregators were utilized to ensure a wide range of perspectives and up-to-date information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Change and Accountability**: A significant barrier to ending sexual violence in the military is the entrenched culture that often tolerates or minimizes such behavior. "A pervasive cultural flaw is plaguing our armed forces," noted Reps. Niki Tsongas and Mike Turner, emphasizing the need for a cultural shift that holds all levels of the military accountable[^1]. This includes implementing measures to ensure that commanders are assessed on their ability to handle reports of sexual assault and create a safe environment for reporting.

2. **Structural Reforms in Military Justice**: The current military justice system has been criticized for its lack of independence and accountability. Erin Scanlon, a survivor and advocate, argues that "sexual assault is a crime that does not pertain to military service, and thus should not be left in the hands of commanders"[^2]. There is a call for independent oversight of sexual assault cases to ensure impartiality and justice for victims.

3. **Legislative Efforts and Policy Changes**: Legislative measures such as the FAIR Military Act aim to eliminate bias in the military justice system and increase accountability. The act proposes limiting the "good soldier" defense and requiring assessments of commanders' actions related to sexual assault prevention[^3]. These efforts are part of a broader push to reform military policies and ensure that justice is served for victims of sexual violence.
