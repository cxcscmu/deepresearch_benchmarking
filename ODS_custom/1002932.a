## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Types of Neglect**: Neglect is defined as the failure to meet a child's basic physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs. It can be active, where neglect is intentional, or passive, resulting from a lack of knowledge or resources. Physical neglect involves failing to provide adequate food, clothing, or shelter, while emotional neglect includes ignoring a child's emotional needs [^1].

2. **Prevalence and Impact**: Neglect is the most common form of child maltreatment, accounting for approximately 78% of child abuse cases in the United States. It can lead to long-term consequences such as developmental delays, mental health issues, and difficulties in forming relationships. "Neglect can seriously impair a child’s health, physical and intellectual growth and development, and can cause long-term difficulties with social functioning, relationships, and educational progress" [^2].

3. **Legal and Social Perspectives**: Legally, neglect is considered a form of abuse, and caregivers can face criminal charges if neglect results in harm to the child. "Neglect of a child is considered a form of abuse. Generally, such neglect is described as the failure of a parent or caregiver to provide food, shelter, clothing, medical care, or the failure to supervise a child to a degree that the child’s health, safety, and well-being could result in physical or emotional harm and injury" [^3].
