# Report on the Origins of the Transatlantic Slave Trade

## Executive Summary

The transatlantic slave trade, a significant and tragic chapter in global history, began in the 15th century with the Portuguese exploration of the West African coast. This trade involved the forced transportation of millions of Africans to the Americas, where they were sold into slavery. The trade was driven by European colonial expansion and the demand for labor in the New World. Over the centuries, it became a cornerstone of the global economy, with profound impacts on Africa, Europe, and the Americas.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Origins and Early Development**: The transatlantic slave trade began in the mid-15th century when Portuguese explorers reached the West African coast. They discovered that they could profit not only from materials but also from the trade of enslaved people. Initially, small numbers of Africans were taken to Europe, but as the demand for labor in the New World grew, the trade expanded significantly. "The Atlantic Slave trade began in the 15th century, after Portuguese sailors explored the coast of West Africa" [^1].

2. **European Expansion and Demand for Labor**: The discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and subsequent European colonization increased the demand for labor, particularly for plantation agriculture. This demand was initially met by using indigenous peoples and indentured servants, but as these sources proved insufficient, the transatlantic slave trade became the primary means of supplying labor. "In 1492, the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus landed in the Bahamas and claimed the Americas for his sponsors, the King and Queen of Spain. European colonies were soon established in the ‘New World’ and the demand for slave labour grew" [^2].

3. **Economic and Social Impact**: The slave trade had a devastating impact on African societies, leading to the loss of millions of people and contributing to long-term economic and social disruptions. It also played a crucial role in the economic development of European colonial powers and the Americas. "The slave trade contributed to the wealth of Europe but devastated the African continent" [^3].
