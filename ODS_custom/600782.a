# Report: Correlation Between High Intelligence and Anxiety

## Executive Summary

Recent studies suggest a significant correlation between high intelligence and anxiety. While intelligence is often viewed as a beneficial trait, it appears to come with the downside of increased susceptibility to anxiety disorders. This relationship is thought to have evolutionary roots, where intelligence and anxiety co-evolved as adaptive traits. However, the exact mechanisms behind this correlation remain complex and multifaceted, involving both psychological and physiological factors.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and scientific journals. The search focused on peer-reviewed articles, reputable science news websites, and psychology blogs. Keywords used included "high intelligence," "anxiety," "correlation," and "mental health." The search aimed to gather diverse perspectives and findings from multiple studies to provide a well-rounded understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Evolutionary Perspective**: Research indicates that intelligence and anxiety may have evolved together as mutually beneficial traits. Dr. Jeremy Coplan, a study researcher, suggests that while excessive worry is generally seen as negative, it may have helped humans avoid dangerous situations, thus increasing survival rates. "Worry may make people ‘take no chances,’ and such people may have higher survival rates" [^1].

2. **Psychological Overexcitability**: A study led by Ruth Karpinski found that individuals with high IQs, such as members of Mensa, reported higher rates of anxiety disorders. This is attributed to psychological overexcitability, where intelligent individuals tend to ruminate and worry excessively, which are common features of anxiety disorders [^2].

3. **Neurological Correlates**: Brain scans have shown that activity in sub-cortical white matter correlates with both anxiety and intelligence. This suggests a neurological basis for the link between high intelligence and anxiety, where heightened cognitive abilities may lead to increased sensitivity to potential threats [^3].

## Limitations

The findings are based on a limited number of studies, many of which involve small sample sizes. The complexity of human intelligence and anxiety means that results can vary significantly across different populations and contexts. Additionally, the studies often rely on self-reported data, which can introduce bias. More extensive research is needed to fully understand the causal mechanisms and to generalize the findings to broader populations.
