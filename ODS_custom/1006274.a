# Report on Legislative Steps to Address Court Delays

## Executive Summary

The issue of court delays is a significant challenge in many judicial systems worldwide, leading to the maxim "justice delayed is justice denied." Various legislative measures have been introduced to address this problem, focusing on improving efficiency, reducing backlog, and ensuring timely justice. This report explores the legislative steps taken in different jurisdictions to mitigate court delays, highlighting key strategies and their intended outcomes.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online legal databases, government websites, and scholarly articles. The search focused on legislative measures addressing court delays, with particular attention to recent reforms and their impacts. Tools such as Google Scholar, legal news websites, and government publications were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Introduction of Statutory Timelines**: Many jurisdictions have implemented statutory timelines to expedite legal proceedings. For instance, the Commercial Courts Act in India mandates a strict 120-day limit for filing written statements in commercial disputes, beyond which the right to file is forfeited[^1]. This approach aims to ensure timely resolution of cases and prevent unnecessary delays.

2. **Shift Courts and Fast Track Courts**: Some regions have introduced shift courts and fast track courts to handle cases more efficiently. This involves utilizing existing court infrastructure in multiple shifts or establishing dedicated courts for specific types of cases, such as family or commercial disputes[^2]. These measures are designed to increase the throughput of cases and reduce backlog.

3. **Use of Technology and E-Courts**: The adoption of technology in the judiciary, such as e-courts, has been a significant legislative focus. E-courts facilitate online filing, virtual hearings, and digital case management, which can significantly reduce delays caused by logistical challenges[^3]. This transition is supported by legislative frameworks that mandate the integration of information technology in court processes.
