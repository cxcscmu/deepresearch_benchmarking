# Report: Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment

## Executive Summary

The study conducted by Nicholas Bloom and colleagues at CTrip, a large Chinese travel agency, provides compelling evidence on the effectiveness of working from home (WFH). The experiment demonstrated a significant increase in productivity and job satisfaction among employees who worked from home compared to those who remained in the office. However, it also highlighted some challenges, such as reduced promotion rates for remote workers. The findings suggest that WFH can be a viable option for companies looking to enhance productivity and employee satisfaction, provided they address the potential downsides.

## Methodology

The research utilized a randomized controlled trial at CTrip, involving 249 call center employees who volunteered to participate. These employees were randomly assigned to work from home or continue working in the office for nine months. The study measured various outcomes, including productivity, job satisfaction, and promotion rates, using CTrip's comprehensive employee database and additional surveys and interviews.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Productivity Increase**: The study found that employees working from home experienced a 13% increase in performance. This was attributed to a 9% increase in minutes worked per shift due to fewer breaks and sick days, and a 4% increase in calls per minute, which was linked to a quieter working environment [^1].

2. **Job Satisfaction and Turnover**: Home workers reported higher job satisfaction and experienced a 50% reduction in attrition rates compared to their office-based counterparts. This was partly due to the flexibility and quieter environment that WFH provided [^2].

3. **Promotion Rates**: Despite the productivity gains, employees working from home were less likely to be promoted than those in the office. This was attributed to reduced visibility and fewer face-to-face interactions with managers, which are often crucial for career advancement [^3].

## Limitations

- **Cultural Context**: The study was conducted in China, and the results may not be directly applicable to other cultural or organizational contexts.
- **Industry Specificity**: The experiment focused on call center employees, which may not represent the experiences of workers in other industries or roles.
- **Promotion Bias**: The reduced promotion rates for remote workers highlight a potential bias that may not be present in all organizations, depending on their management practices and culture.
