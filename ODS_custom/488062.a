# Report on Future Problems Resulting from Scarce Resources

## Executive Summary
Scarcity of resources is a pressing global issue that is expected to exacerbate in the future due to increasing population, climate change, and unsustainable consumption patterns. This report explores the potential problems that could arise from resource scarcity, including increased conflict, economic instability, and environmental degradation. The findings highlight the need for strategic resource management and policy interventions to mitigate these challenges.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online academic resources and databases. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "future problems of resource scarcity," "economic impact of scarce resources," and "environmental consequences of resource depletion." The tools used included academic databases like Course Hero, Brainly, and WorldAtlas, as well as specialized encyclopedias and economic investigation platforms.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Increased Conflict and Aggression**: Resource scarcity can lead to heightened aggression and conflict among populations. As resources become limited, individuals and groups may resort to desperate and violent measures to secure their needs. "When resources are limited, people tend to become desperate, aggressive, and violent. When people don't get food, water, and other basic necessities, they become endangered" [^1].

2. **Economic Instability and Inflation**: Scarcity can lead to economic challenges such as inflation and reduced economic growth. "Scarcity affects everyone because resources are limited. Even wealthy societies are limited in time, land, capital, and labor" [^2]. This limitation can lead to increased prices and economic slowdowns as countries struggle to allocate limited resources efficiently.

3. **Environmental Degradation and Food Insecurity**: The depletion of natural resources can exacerbate environmental issues and lead to food shortages. "With a global population on pace to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, shrinking water resources will make it difficult for food production to keep up with rising demand" [^3]. This could result in political turmoil and social unrest if not addressed through sustainable practices.

## Limitations
The report is based on available online resources and may not encompass all perspectives on the issue of resource scarcity. The findings are limited to the data and insights provided by the sources accessed, which may not reflect the most current research or global data. Additionally, the lack of specific publication dates for some sources may affect the timeliness of the information presented. Further research with access to more comprehensive databases and recent studies would provide a more detailed analysis.
