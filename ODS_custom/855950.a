The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Mass Production and Affordability**: Henry Ford's introduction of the moving assembly line in 1913 was a pivotal moment in industrial manufacturing. This innovation allowed for the mass production of the Model T, significantly reducing its price from $850 in 1908 to $300 by 1924[^1]. This price reduction made car ownership accessible to a broader segment of the population, fundamentally changing the automobile from a luxury item to a necessity.

2. **Economic and Social Impact**: Ford's manufacturing techniques not only revolutionized the automobile industry but also had a profound impact on the American economy. By 1914, Ford had doubled the wages of his workers to $5 a day, which was unprecedented at the time. This move ensured a stable workforce and increased consumer demand, as workers could now afford the products they were making[^2]. The economic model Ford pioneered laid the foundation for a consumer-driven economy.

3. **Urbanization and Infrastructure Development**: The widespread adoption of automobiles facilitated by Ford's innovations contributed to significant urbanization and infrastructure development. The demand for cars led to the growth of related industries such as steel, rubber, and glass, and necessitated the expansion of road networks[^3]. This transformation supported the growth of suburban areas and changed the landscape of American cities.
