# Herbert Hoover's Response to the Bonus Army: A Historical Analysis

## Executive Summary

In 1932, during the Great Depression, a group of World War I veterans known as the "Bonus Army" marched on Washington, D.C., to demand early payment of a promised bonus. President Herbert Hoover's response to this protest was marked by a refusal to meet their demands and the use of military force to disperse the veterans. This decision significantly impacted Hoover's public image and contributed to his loss in the subsequent presidential election.

## Methodology

To gather information on Herbert Hoover's response to the Bonus Army, I utilized a variety of online resources, including educational websites and historical archives. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Herbert Hoover Bonus Army response" and "Bonus Army 1932." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the events.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Rejection of Demands**: The Bonus Army, consisting of World War I veterans, demanded early payment of a bonus that was legislated to be paid in 1945. Hoover opposed this, fearing it would necessitate tax increases. "In essence, Hoover responded to these demands by rejecting them" [^1].

2. **Use of Military Force**: Hoover ordered the U.S. Army to forcibly remove the veterans from their camps in Washington, D.C. This action was led by General Douglas MacArthur and involved the use of tear gas and tanks. "President Hoover sent military police and the army to route the Bonus Army and force them to leave" [^2].

3. **Public Backlash**: The violent dispersal of the Bonus Army severely damaged Hoover's reputation. The public viewed the use of military force against veterans as excessive and unfeeling. "Hoover's public image and approval ratings, already low due to his inability to adequately address the Great Depression, sank even lower after the Bonus Army March" [^3].

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of online resources and the potential bias in historical interpretations. Some sources may present a more sympathetic view of Hoover's actions, while others may emphasize the negative aspects. Additionally, the lack of primary sources, such as government documents or personal accounts from the veterans, limits the depth of the analysis.
