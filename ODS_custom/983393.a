# Report: Factors Contributing to Southern Economic Concerns Pre-Civil War

## Executive Summary
The Southern economy in the United States prior to the Civil War was heavily reliant on slavery and agriculture, particularly the production of cotton. Several actions and events during this period contributed to the Southern belief that their economic stability was under threat. Key among these were the imposition of protective tariffs, the election of Abraham Lincoln, and the growing abolitionist movement in the North. These factors combined to create a sense of economic and social insecurity in the South, ultimately leading to secession and the Civil War.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online educational resources and historical databases. The search focused on identifying key historical events and policies that were perceived as threats to the Southern economy. Tools such as Google Scholar, educational websites like eNotes, and Q&A platforms like Brainly were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Protective Tariffs**: The imposition of tariffs was a significant concern for the Southern economy. The Tariff of 1828, known as the "Tariff of Abominations," was particularly contentious. It raised the prices of manufactured goods, which the South had to import, and hurt trade with Britain, a major buyer of Southern cotton[^1]. "The South’s reaction to the federal tariffs of the early 1800s stemmed from a belief that tariffs raised the price of manufactured goods and hurt trade with Britain"[^2].

2. **Election of Abraham Lincoln**: The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 was perceived as a direct threat to the institution of slavery, which was integral to the Southern economy. The South feared that Lincoln's presidency would lead to the abolition of slavery, thereby collapsing their economic structure. "The South believed Lincoln was going to end slavery... As a result, when Lincoln got elected, southern states began to secede from the Union leading to the Civil War"[^3].

3. **Dependence on Slavery**: The Southern economy was fundamentally dependent on slave labor for its agricultural output, particularly cotton. The potential end of slavery was seen as a threat to the economic and social order. "The Southern economy was heavily dependent upon slave labor... Cotton and tobacco were major commodities vitally important to the South, and slave labor made their cultivation far more profitable"[^4].

## Limitations
The analysis is based on secondary sources and interpretations of historical events, which may carry inherent biases. The lack of primary source documents limits the ability to verify the accuracy of the interpretations. Additionally, the complexity of historical economic systems means that multiple factors likely contributed to Southern economic concerns, and this report may not capture all nuances.
