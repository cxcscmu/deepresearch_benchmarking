# Armenia and Azerbaijan Conflict: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan primarily revolves around the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a territory internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but predominantly populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. The roots of this conflict trace back to the early 20th century, with significant escalations occurring post the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The dispute has led to multiple wars, the most notable being the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994) and the recent 2020 conflict. The geopolitical dynamics are further complicated by the involvement of regional powers like Russia and Turkey, each supporting different sides.

## Methodology

To gather information on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, I utilized a combination of online databases, news articles, and historical records. Key sources included NationMaster for statistical comparisons, Drishti IAS for geopolitical analysis, and CBS News for recent developments. The search strategy focused on identifying credible sources that provide a comprehensive overview of the conflict's history, current status, and international implications.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Territorial Dispute**: The Nagorno-Karabakh region has been a point of contention since the early 20th century. "Nagorno-Karabakh region has 95% of the population as ethnically Armenian and is controlled by them but it is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan" [^1]. This demographic and territorial mismatch has fueled the conflict, with both nations claiming historical and cultural ties to the region.

2. **Military and Economic Factors**: Azerbaijan's military advantage is largely attributed to its oil-funded defense budget, which significantly surpasses Armenia's. "Azerbaijan is seen to have the upper hand should the feared war take place; this is due to the oil-funded stockpiling of arms by Azerbaijan – a buildup which, according to analysts, Armenia cannot afford" [^2]. Despite this, Armenia has bolstered its defenses with Russian support, acquiring advanced military hardware.

3. **International Involvement and Implications**: The conflict has drawn in regional powers, with Russia traditionally supporting Armenia and Turkey backing Azerbaijan. "Turkey’s deepening involvement in Nagorno-Karabakh is a dangerous game... Turkey has sold Azerbaijan a wide range of weapons, including UAVs, missiles, and electronic warfare equipment" [^3]. This involvement risks escalating the conflict into a broader regional war, potentially involving other global powers.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of up-to-date information, as the situation is dynamic and subject to rapid changes. Additionally, the geopolitical nature of the conflict means that sources may have inherent biases based on their regional affiliations. The complexity of international relations and the involvement of multiple state and non-state actors further complicate the narrative, requiring continuous monitoring for the most accurate understanding.
