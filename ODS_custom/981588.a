## Detailed Findings

### Positive Effects of Globalization
1. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: Globalization has significantly contributed to economic growth by creating jobs and opening new markets. "Globalization enables jobs in areas where no other company could sustain itself without the money and power that a global company has" [^1]. This is particularly beneficial for developing countries where multinational companies invest in local economies.

2. **Cultural Exchange and Innovation**: The process facilitates cultural exchange and innovation. "Globalization has enriched the world culturally, scientifically, as well as economically" [^2]. It allows for the sharing of ideas and technologies, fostering innovation and cultural understanding.

3. **Improved Access to Goods and Services**: Consumers benefit from a wider variety of goods and services at lower prices due to increased competition. "Due to globalization, many companies have now moved to areas where the cost of production is cheaper. With low production costs, companies can offer goods to customers at more affordable rates" [^3].

### Negative Effects of Globalization
1. **Environmental Degradation**: Increased production and consumption have led to significant environmental challenges. "With a rise in production, the utilization of natural resources has also increased, causing a severe threat to the environment" [^4].

2. **Cultural Homogenization**: Globalization can lead to the erosion of local cultures and traditions. "Globalization has led to the spread of western culture and influence at the expense of local culture in developing countries" [^5].

3. **Economic Disparities and Job Insecurity**: While globalization creates jobs, it also leads to job insecurity and economic disparities. "Globalization takes jobs away from one country and provides it to another country; hence leaving lots of people without the opportunities that they deserve" [^6].
