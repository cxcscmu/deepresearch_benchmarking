This report explores various perspectives on the issue, drawing from a range of sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

To gather information on the topic, I utilized online debate platforms, academic essays, and opinion pieces from reputable websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Proponents of Capital Punishment**:
   - Advocates argue that capital punishment acts as a deterrent to serious crimes. One source states, "Capital punishment is the ultimate measure to scare people to keep them from committing serious crimes" [^1]. This perspective suggests that the fear of execution can prevent potential criminals from engaging in unlawful activities.
   - Another argument is based on retribution and justice. A proponent mentions, "Real justice requires people to suffer for their wrongdoing and to suffer in a way appropriate for the crime" [^2]. This view holds that capital punishment is a fair response to heinous crimes, ensuring that justice is served.
   - Some supporters believe that capital punishment can reduce crime rates. An article notes, "Capital punishment reduces the number of crimes. Capital punishment strongly deters killings and serves justice" [^3]. This suggests that the presence of the death penalty can lead to a decrease in violent crimes.

2. **Opponents of Capital Punishment**:
   - Critics argue that capital punishment is inhumane and violates basic human rights. One source highlights, "Capital punishment brutalizes the society that uses it. It normalizes killing and is not a good deterrent from crime" [^4]. This perspective emphasizes the moral and ethical concerns associated with state-sanctioned executions.
   - The risk of executing innocent individuals is a significant concern. An example cited is, "Johnny Garrett of Texas was executed... In March, 2004, cold-case DNA testing identified Leoncio Rueda as the rapist and murderer" [^5]. This highlights the potential for irreversible judicial errors.
   - Additionally, some argue that capital punishment does not effectively deter crime. A source states, "States in America where they use capital punishment do not have lower crime rates in comparison to states that don't use capital punishment" [^6]. This challenges the notion that the death penalty is an effective crime deterrent.
