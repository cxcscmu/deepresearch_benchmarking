# Report: How Society Contributes to Anorexia

## Executive Summary
Anorexia nervosa is a severe eating disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image. Society plays a significant role in the development and perpetuation of anorexia through various sociocultural pressures. These pressures include the glorification of thinness, media portrayals of ideal body types, and societal expectations regarding beauty and success. This report explores the societal factors contributing to anorexia, drawing on multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Methodology
To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online databases, academic journals, and articles from reputable websites. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "society and anorexia," "media influence on eating disorders," and "sociocultural factors in anorexia." The tools used included Google Scholar, PubMed, and general web searches to gather a diverse range of perspectives and data.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Media Influence and Societal Standards**: The media plays a crucial role in shaping societal standards of beauty, often promoting an unrealistic thin ideal. "The media can impact peopleâ€™s lives in many ways... Eating disorders are rarely about food or wanting to be thin but instead people that suffer from eating disorder use food and unhealthy behaviors like dieting and starving themselves to cope with unpleasant and overwhelming emotions and stressful situations" [^1]. This portrayal can lead individuals to develop unhealthy behaviors in pursuit of these ideals.

2. **Cultural and Social Pressures**: Western societies, in particular, emphasize thinness as a marker of beauty and success. "Eating Disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN) often occur in Western societies where food is in abundance but attractiveness is associated with thinness" [^2]. This cultural pressure can contribute to the development of anorexia, especially among those already predisposed to mental health issues.

3. **Role of Industries**: Various industries, including fashion, diet, and fitness, contribute to societal pressures by promoting unattainable body standards. "The diet and weight-loss industries are making billions on diet pills, creams and weight loss coaches or videos... The fitness industry is another industry that may be leading to the social development of Eating Disorders" [^3]. These industries capitalize on insecurities, further exacerbating the issue.

## Limitations
The findings in this report are based on available literature and may not encompass all societal factors contributing to anorexia. The data is primarily from Western contexts, which may not fully represent global perspectives. Additionally, the complexity of anorexia as a disorder means that societal factors are just one part of a multifaceted issue that includes genetic, psychological, and environmental components.
