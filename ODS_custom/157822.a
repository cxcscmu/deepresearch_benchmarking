# Canada's Involvement in World War II

## Executive Summary

Canada's involvement in World War II was a significant chapter in its history, marking its emergence as an independent actor on the global stage. Despite initial reluctance due to the aftermath of World War I, Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, a week after Britain. This decision was driven by its ties to the British Commonwealth and the growing threat posed by Nazi Germany. Throughout the war, Canada played a crucial role in various military operations, contributed significantly to the Allied war effort through industrial production, and experienced profound social and economic changes.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Declaration of War and Initial Involvement**: Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, following a parliamentary debate that reflected its newfound autonomy post-Statute of Westminster 1931[^1]. This decision was partly influenced by its commitment to the British Commonwealth and the need to support Britain against the Axis powers[^2].

2. **Military Contributions**: Canada contributed significantly to various military operations. Canadian forces were involved in the defense of Hong Kong, the Dieppe Raid, and the liberation of the Netherlands[^3]. The Royal Canadian Navy and Air Force expanded rapidly, with the navy becoming the third largest in the world by the end of the war[^4].

3. **Industrial and Economic Impact**: Canada's industrial sector played a vital role in the war effort, producing military vehicles, aircraft, and ships. It supplied 40% of the Allies' aluminum and 95% of their nickel[^5]. This industrial boom also led to significant economic growth and the elevation of women's roles in the workforce[^6].

4. **Social and Political Changes**: The war effort led to increased national unity and a stronger sense of Canadian identity. It also paved the way for Canada's membership in NATO and its role in post-war peacekeeping missions[^7].
