# Report: Why Steroids Shouldn't Be Allowed in Sports

## Executive Summary

The use of steroids in sports has been a contentious issue for decades, with arguments focusing on health risks, ethical concerns, and the integrity of sports. Steroids provide athletes with unfair advantages, pose significant health risks, and undermine the spirit of fair competition. This report delves into these issues, drawing on various sources to highlight why steroids should not be permitted in sports.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of academic databases, online libraries, and reputable websites. The search terms included "steroids in sports," "performance-enhancing drugs," and "health risks of steroids." The primary sources were articles and essays from Bartleby and the Internet Public Library, which provided comprehensive insights into the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Health Risks**: Steroids pose severe health risks, including cardiovascular issues, liver damage, and psychological effects. "Abusing steroids leads to bad cholesterol... it turns into liver disease and can sometimes turn into possible liver cancer" [^1]. The physical dangers extend to cardiovascular diseases, with steroids causing "the left heart ventricle to enlarge, high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes" [^1].

2. **Unfair Advantage**: Steroids provide users with an unfair advantage over non-users, compromising the integrity of sports. "Steroids are very unhealthy for multiple parts of the human body, many health issues can arise from the use of such a drug" [^2]. This unfair advantage is considered a form of cheating, as it violates the rules and contracts athletes have agreed to [^3].

3. **Ethical Concerns**: The use of steroids undermines the ethical foundation of sports, which is based on fair competition and hard work. "Athletes using steroids are not being good role models to the younger generation that looks up to them" [^3]. The ethical implications extend to the societal perception of athletes, who are often seen as role models.
