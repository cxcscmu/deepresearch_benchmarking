The Glorious Revolution of 1688 was a pivotal event in English history that marked the transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Religious and Political Conflicts**: The Glorious Revolution was primarily driven by religious and political tensions between the Catholic King James II and the predominantly Protestant Parliament. James II's attempts to promote Catholicism and his disregard for parliamentary authority were major catalysts. "Religious and political conflicts between Parliament and the monarch of England caused the Glorious Revolution" [^1].

2. **James II's Policies**: King James II's policies, such as the suspension of Parliament and the appointment of Catholics to key positions, alienated many of his subjects. His actions were perceived as attempts to establish an absolute monarchy and reintroduce Catholicism, which was met with resistance. "James II wanted to propagate Catholicism and impose it on his subjects... The Parliament did not approve his policy" [^2].

3. **The Birth of James II's Son**: The birth of a Catholic heir to James II intensified fears of a Catholic dynasty, prompting Parliament to act. This event directly led to the invitation of William of Orange to take the throne. "The event that most directly caused the Glorious Revolution was... the birth of a son to James II" [^3].
