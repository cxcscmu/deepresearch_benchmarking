# Report on Human Contribution to Climate Change

## Executive Summary

The consensus among scientists is clear: human activities are the primary drivers of recent climate change. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to elucidate how human actions, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly contributed to global warming. The evidence points to an increase in greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, as the main culprit behind the rising global temperatures and associated climate disruptions.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of academic essays, environmental studies, and expert analyses available online. The search strategy involved identifying credible sources that discuss the anthropogenic causes of climate change. Tools such as Google Scholar and academic databases were employed to ensure the reliability of the information gathered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have led to a significant increase in greenhouse gases. "The process of burning fossil fuels releases various pollutants, as well as an important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide" [^1]. This increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.

2. **Deforestation and Land Use**: Deforestation for agriculture and urban development has exacerbated climate change by reducing the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide. "Deforestation, especially associated with burning, allows a lot of the carbon stored in tree roots, branches, and leaves to be released into the atmosphere" [^2]. This contributes to the greenhouse effect and further warming.

3. **Industrial Activities**: The industrial revolution marked a significant increase in human-induced climate change. "Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have extracted large amounts of carbon-based resources, such as wood, peat, and fossil fuels from within the Earthâ€™s crust" [^3]. The combustion of these resources releases carbon dioxide, disrupting the natural carbon cycle and contributing to climate change.

## Limitations

This report is based on secondary data from online sources, which may not encompass the latest research findings. Additionally, the complexity of climate systems means that while human activities are a significant factor, natural processes also play a role, which this report does not extensively cover. Further research and updated data are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
