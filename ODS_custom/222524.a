# Illiteracy and Disability: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

Illiteracy, defined as the inability to read and write, is not classified as a disability in itself. However, it can significantly impact an individual's ability to function in society and may intersect with other conditions that qualify for disability benefits. Illiteracy can be a factor in disability claims, particularly when combined with age, education level, and residual functional capacity (RFC). This report explores the relationship between illiteracy and disability, the causes and effects of illiteracy, and how it is considered in disability claims.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including disability benefits centers, educational essays, and legal resources. The search focused on understanding the definition of illiteracy, its causes and effects, and its role in disability claims. The tools used included search engines and academic databases to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Impact of Illiteracy**: Illiteracy is defined as the inability to read or write, which can severely limit an individual's ability to communicate and function effectively in society. It is not considered a disability on its own but can exacerbate the challenges faced by individuals with other disabilities. "Illiteracy itself doesn’t qualify for disability benefits, but if you don’t qualify for disability using medical criteria, so you are using the medical-vocational allowance to be approved, you might qualify with the help of illiteracy being used in conjunction with your age and your residual functional capacity (RFC)" [^1].

2. **Causes and Effects of Illiteracy**: Illiteracy can result from various factors, including poverty, learning disabilities, and lack of educational opportunities. It has significant societal impacts, such as inhibiting communication and limiting career opportunities. "Learning disabilities, poverty, and education are the main factors/components which contribute to illiteracy" [^2]. Additionally, "illiteracy is one of the major problems facing society and the educational system" [^3].

3. **Illiteracy in Disability Claims**: The Social Security Administration (SSA) considers illiteracy when evaluating disability claims, particularly for older applicants. Illiteracy can be a factor in determining eligibility for benefits under the SSA's "grid" rules, which consider age, education level, and work capacity. "Older applicants are more likely to get disability benefits if they didn't graduate high school or can't read or write" [^4].
