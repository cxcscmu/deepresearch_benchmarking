# Public Opinion on American Institutions: Measurement and Insights

## Executive Summary

Public opinion about American institutions is measured through various surveys and polls conducted by organizations like Gallup, Statista, and Morning Consult. These surveys track the confidence and trust levels of Americans in different institutions over time. The findings reveal a general decline in trust across most institutions, with notable exceptions like the military and small businesses, which maintain relatively high confidence levels. The data also highlights significant political polarization in trust levels, with Republicans and Democrats showing divergent confidence in several key institutions.

## Methodology

To gather information on how public opinion about American institutions is measured, I utilized a combination of search strategies and tools:
- **Search Engines**: Used Google to find relevant articles and reports.
- **Database Access**: Accessed specific databases like Gallup and Statista for detailed reports.
- **Keyword Search**: Employed keywords such as "public opinion American institutions," "trust in institutions survey," and "Gallup confidence poll."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Gallup's Longitudinal Surveys**: Gallup has been tracking public confidence in U.S. institutions since 1973. Their surveys typically involve asking U.S. adults if they have "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in various institutions. For instance, in 2021, Gallup reported that "an average 33% of U.S. adults express 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in 14 institutions," marking a decline from previous years [^1].

2. **Statista's Trust Charts**: Statista provides visual representations of trust levels in institutions. In 2018, they reported that "the military remains the most trusted institution with 74 percent of Americans having some or quite a lot of confidence in it," while Congress and television news were among the least trusted [^2].

3. **Morning Consult's Weekly Tracking**: Morning Consult offers a real-time insight into trust levels by conducting weekly surveys. Their data shows shifts in trust over time, highlighting that "less than half of Republicans trust the public education system," indicating significant partisan divides in trust levels [^3].
