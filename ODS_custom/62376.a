## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized online educational resources and literary analysis platforms. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Helmer and Nora interaction," "A Doll's House plot advancement," and "Nora's realization." The primary tools used were search engines and academic websites that provide expert analyses and summaries of literary works.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Preservation of Masculinity Over Marriage**: The interactions between Helmer and Nora often underscore Helmer's desire to maintain his masculinity and control within the marriage. Nora realizes that Helmer's actions are more about preserving his masculinity than nurturing their marriage. This realization is crucial as it leads to her questioning the foundation of their relationship. "Nora realizes that Helmer's actions are intended to preserve his masculinity, not their marriage" [^1].

2. **Nora's Secret and Helmer's Disapproval**: The plot advances as Nora becomes aware that Helmer would disapprove of her having borrowed money, which she did to save his life. This secret creates tension and suspense, as Nora must keep it hidden to maintain the facade of their marriage. "Nora realizes that Helmer will completely disapprove of her having borrowed money, so she has to continue to keep it a secret from him" [^2].

3. **Nora's Transformation and Rebellion**: The culmination of their interactions leads to Nora's transformation. She recognizes that she has been living as a "doll" in both her father's and Helmer's homes, prompting her to leave in search of her identity. This decision marks a significant turning point in the plot, as it challenges the societal norms of the time. "Nora rebels at this... But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife" [^3].
