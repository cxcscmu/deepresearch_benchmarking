## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including historical articles, educational websites, and legal analyses. The search focused on the historical context of the 1920s, key events, and influential figures that contributed to the discourse on civil liberties.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Fear of Communism and the Red Scare**: The fear of communism, known as the Red Scare, was a significant factor in the 1920s that threatened civil liberties. Government actions against suspected communists often violated individual rights. "A number of government officials took strong, and sometimes unlawful, actions against labor leaders, foreigners, and others" due to fears of communism[^1]. This period highlighted the need for legal protections against government overreach.

2. **Civil Rights Movements**: The 1920s also saw the rise of civil rights movements, particularly for women and African Americans. The Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, was a landmark achievement. "The Civil Rights movement was established... It helped many people that were discriminated become equal"[^2]. These movements underscored the importance of civil liberties in achieving social justice and equality.

3. **Legal and Constitutional Developments**: The decade witnessed significant legal developments that reinforced civil liberties. The establishment of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was a critical step in advocating for individual rights. "The American Liberties Union is established" as a response to the need for organized advocacy[^3]. This period also saw court cases that expanded the interpretation of constitutional rights, further embedding civil liberties into American legal frameworks.
