# Should the Central Bank Aim for Zero Inflation?

## Executive Summary

The debate on whether central banks should aim for zero inflation is multifaceted, involving economic theories, historical precedents, and practical implications. Proponents argue that zero inflation eliminates the costs associated with inflation, such as wealth redistribution and price instability. Critics, however, highlight the potential economic drawbacks, including increased unemployment and the challenges of maintaining such a target in a dynamic economy. This report synthesizes various perspectives to provide a comprehensive overview of the arguments for and against zero inflation targeting.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of online databases, economic journals, and reputable news sources. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "zero inflation," "central bank policy," and "inflation targeting." Tools like Google Scholar and JSTOR were employed to access academic papers, while mainstream media sources provided current opinions and debates.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Costs of Inflation**: Proponents of zero inflation argue that inflation imposes several costs on society. These include "shoeleather costs associated with reduced money holdings" and "menu costs associated with more frequent adjustment of prices" [^1]. Additionally, inflation can lead to "arbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with dollar-denominated debts" [^2].

2. **Historical Precedents**: The case of Paul Volcker in the early 1980s is often cited as a successful example of reducing inflation. Volcker's policies reduced U.S. inflation from about 10% in 1980 to about 4% in 1983, albeit at the cost of high unemployment [^3]. This historical example is used to argue that the benefits of zero inflation, such as price stability, outweigh the temporary costs.

3. **Economic Drawbacks**: Critics argue that aiming for zero inflation can lead to significant economic drawbacks. For instance, "zero inflation would require a forced contraction (via tight money) of spending to offset the normal tendency for the prices of scarcer goods to rise" [^4]. This could result in increased unemployment and economic stagnation.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on available online sources, which may not cover all perspectives or the latest empirical data. Additionally, the complexity of economic systems means that theoretical models may not fully capture real-world dynamics. Further research, including expert interviews and more recent data, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of zero inflation targeting.
