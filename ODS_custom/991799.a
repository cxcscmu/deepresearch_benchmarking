# Report on the Origins of Racism

## Executive Summary

Racism, as a social construct, has deep historical roots that predate modern history. It is a complex phenomenon that has evolved over centuries, influenced by various socio-political and economic factors. This report explores the origins of racism, tracing its beginnings from early human societies to its more structured forms in the modern era. The findings indicate that racism is not a new phenomenon but has been present in various forms throughout human history.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and resources. The search strategy included using keywords such as "origin of racism," "history of racial discrimination," and "when did racism start." The tools used for this research included academic databases, historical websites, and educational platforms. The information was cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Early Human Societies and Tribalism**: Racism can be traced back to early human societies where tribalism was prevalent. "Racism at some level, and basic xenophobia, has been around since the beginning of humanity. Our tribe is not their tribe and our tribe is the best because it is our tribe" [^1]. This tribal mentality laid the groundwork for later racial discrimination.

2. **Colonialism and the Slave Trade**: The structured form of racism as we know it today began to take shape during the colonial era. "Racism in the United States has been around since the 1400s, beginning when European settlers began colonizing America" [^2]. The transatlantic slave trade further institutionalized racism, as Africans were dehumanized and treated as property.

3. **Religious and Cultural Justifications**: Throughout history, religious and cultural narratives have been used to justify racial discrimination. "The roots of racism stem from differing religions, the mission to Christianize, and the global acceptability of owning those of a different faith" [^3]. This justification evolved into pseudo-scientific theories like eugenics, which further entrenched racial hierarchies.
