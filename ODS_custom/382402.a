# Report on the Need for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

## Executive Summary

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global objectives established by the United Nations in 2015, aimed at addressing a wide range of global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice. These goals are designed to be a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. The SDGs build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and aim to address their shortcomings by incorporating a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to sustainable development.

## Methodology

To gather information on the necessity of the SDGs, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, official UN publications, and reputable news outlets. The search focused on understanding the rationale behind the SDGs, their intended impact, and the challenges they aim to address. Key search terms included "Sustainable Development Goals," "importance of SDGs," and "global challenges addressed by SDGs."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Comprehensive Approach to Global Challenges**: The SDGs are designed to address the root causes of poverty and inequality by promoting a holistic approach to development that integrates economic, social, and environmental dimensions. "The SDGs are a global call to action to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity" [^1].

2. **Continuation and Expansion of MDGs**: The SDGs build on the successes of the MDGs but expand their scope to include new areas such as climate change, economic inequality, and sustainable consumption. "The SDGs follow and expand on the millennium development goals (MDGs), which were agreed by governments in 2001 and are due to expire at the end of this year" [^2].

3. **Universal and Inclusive Framework**: Unlike the MDGs, which were primarily targeted at developing countries, the SDGs are designed to be universally applicable, encouraging all countries to work towards achieving them. "The SDGs are a new, universal set of goals, targets and indicators that UN member states will be expected to use to frame their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years" [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not capture the full complexity and nuances of the SDGs' implementation and impact. Additionally, the rapidly evolving nature of global challenges means that the relevance and effectiveness of the SDGs may change over time, necessitating ongoing evaluation and adaptation. Furthermore, the report does not include primary data or firsthand accounts from stakeholders involved in the implementation of the SDGs, which could provide deeper insights into their practical challenges and successes.
