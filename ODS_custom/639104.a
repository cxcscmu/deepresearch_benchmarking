## Detailed Findings

1. **Scientific Advancement and the Medical Model**: American culture places a high value on scientific progress, which has led to the development and reliance on advanced medical technologies. "The advancement of science has had a direct impact in the creation of the medical model...focusing on the physical and biological aspects of specific diseases and conditions" [^1]. This model emphasizes the use of technology for diagnosis and treatment, often prioritizing it over preventive measures.

2. **Capitalism and Healthcare as an Economic Good**: The capitalist ethos in American society views healthcare as an economic commodity rather than a public resource. This perspective encourages the development and use of costly medical technologies. "A strong belief in capitalism...has led to health care being viewed as an economic good...resulting in the fee-for-service model" [^2]. This model incentivizes the use of technology to maximize financial returns.

3. **Individualism and Technological Adoption**: The American value of individualism supports the adoption of personalized medical technologies. "Basic to the value placed on individualism are the beliefs that 'individuals have the ability to pull themselves up by their bootstraps'" [^3]. This belief system encourages the use of technology that offers personalized solutions, such as genetic testing and personalized medicine.
