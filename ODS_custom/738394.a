# Report on the Origins of Racial Discrimination

## Executive Summary

Racial discrimination has deep historical roots, primarily emerging from the interactions between different racial and ethnic groups. It began as a means of asserting dominance and control, often justified by pseudo-scientific theories and cultural superiority. This report explores the origins of racial discrimination, focusing on its historical context and the factors that contributed to its development.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including educational websites, historical essays, and academic platforms. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the historical origins and causes of racial discrimination. The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a wide range of perspectives and historical accounts were considered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and European Colonization**: Racial discrimination in America can be traced back to the 1400s with the arrival of European settlers. These settlers viewed themselves as superior and sought to "civilize" indigenous populations, leading to the subjugation and exploitation of Native Americans and Africans. "Racism in the United States has been around since the 1400s, beginning when European settlers began colonizing America" [^1].

2. **Pseudo-Scientific Justifications**: Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, racial discrimination was often justified through pseudo-scientific theories that claimed white superiority. This belief system, known as scientific racism, provided a supposed empirical basis for treating non-white people as inferior. "This theory, known as scientific racism, used pseudo-scientific perspectives to provide empirical evidence that white people were superior to people of other races" [^2].

3. **Cultural and Economic Factors**: The economic benefits of slavery and the cultural belief in white superiority further entrenched racial discrimination. The exploitation of African slaves for labor was justified by a belief in their supposed inferiority. "Slavery was a common solution for farmers who could not complete their tasks themselves. They bought African-American slaves to complete tremendous amounts of hard tasks" [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not capture the full complexity of historical events and perspectives. Additionally, the historical context of racial discrimination is vast and multifaceted, making it challenging to cover all aspects comprehensively in a brief report. Further research into primary historical documents and scholarly analyses would provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic.
