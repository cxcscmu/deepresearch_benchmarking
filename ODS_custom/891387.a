# Report: Why Marijuana Should Remain Illegal

## Executive Summary

The debate over the legalization of marijuana remains a contentious issue, with arguments both for and against its legalization. This report explores the reasons why marijuana should remain illegal, focusing on health concerns, societal impacts, and economic implications. The arguments presented are based on various sources that highlight the potential negative effects of marijuana use and the broader consequences of its legalization.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online debate platforms, opinion articles, and academic essays. The primary sources include Debate.org, Townhall, StudyMode, and other opinion pieces. The search strategy involved identifying key arguments against marijuana legalization and extracting direct quotes to support these points.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Health Concerns**: Marijuana is often criticized for its negative impact on both mental and physical health. According to a Northwestern University study, "marijuana users have abnormal brain structure and poor memory, and chronic marijuana abuse may lead to brain changes resembling schizophrenia" [^1]. Additionally, the American Medical Association reports that "heavy cannabis use in adolescence causes persistent impairments in neurocognitive performance and IQ" [^2].

2. **Societal Impact**: Legalizing marijuana could lead to increased societal issues, such as higher crime rates and reduced productivity. One argument states, "Marijuana is an outlet for people to seek an artificial endorphin release, this deters these people from seeking real life endorphin releases that help drive discovery, the economy, and society" [^3]. Furthermore, the experience in Amsterdam, where marijuana is effectively legalized, shows that "crime is now centering around the coffeehouses where marijuana is sold" [^4].

3. **Economic Implications**: While some argue that legalization could boost the economy through taxation, others believe the costs outweigh the benefits. The argument is made that "there is certainly a financial and human cost to keeping marijuana illegal, but there would be an even larger cost to making it legal" [^5]. This includes potential increases in healthcare costs due to marijuana-related health issues.
