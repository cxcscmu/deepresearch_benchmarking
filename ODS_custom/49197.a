## Detailed Findings

1. **Jane Addams' Advocacy**: Jane Addams, a prominent progressive reformer, argued that women had a responsibility to vote, emphasizing that their participation was crucial for societal improvement. She targeted women who were against suffrage, aiming to unify them in the cause for voting rights. Addams used "housekeeping arguments" to appeal to women, suggesting that their involvement in politics was an extension of their domestic responsibilities [^1].

2. **Susan B. Anthony's Perspective**: Susan B. Anthony, a key figure in the suffrage movement, asserted that women should vote because they are individuals with the right and duty to choose representatives who align with their values. She argued that voting rights should not be determined by gender but by one's ability to make informed decisions [^2].

3. **New Zealand's Suffrage Movement**: The Women's Christian Temperance Union in New Zealand provided ten reasons why women should vote, including the inherent right of every adult to participate in law-making and the belief that women's votes would contribute to a more ethical and less corrupt political environment. They argued that women, being less susceptible to bribery and corruption, would bring a purifying influence to politics [^3].
