# Report: Factors Leading to Poverty

## Executive Summary
Poverty is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects millions globally. Understanding the factors that lead to poverty is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat it. This report identifies several key factors contributing to poverty, including lack of access to clean water, poor education, unreliable labor markets, and unequal wealth distribution. These factors are interrelated and often exacerbate each other, creating a cycle that is difficult to break.

## Methodology
To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, focusing on reputable organizations and publications that specialize in poverty research. The primary tool used was a search engine to locate relevant articles and reports. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "factors leading to poverty," "causes of poverty," and "poverty determinants." The information was then synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Lack of Access to Clean Water and Sanitation**: Access to clean water is a fundamental human need, yet "2.1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe, readily available water" [^1]. This deficiency leads to preventable diseases and increased healthcare costs, trapping individuals in poverty as they spend limited resources on medical expenses.

2. **Poor Education**: Education is a powerful tool for escaping poverty. However, "35 percent of people with less than a high school education are likely to be impoverished" [^1]. Education provides individuals with skills and opportunities for better-paying jobs, acting as a significant equalizer in society.

3. **Unreliable Labor Markets**: The availability of stable and well-paying jobs is crucial for economic stability. Unfortunately, "about 11 percent of the worldâ€™s population lives in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day" due to unreliable job markets and insufficient wages [^1].

4. **Unequal Wealth Distribution**: Economic inequality is a significant driver of poverty. In 2005, "the wealthiest 10 percent of the world accounted for 59 percent of total private consumption, while the poorest 10 percent consumed only 0.5 percent" [^1]. This disparity limits opportunities for the poor to improve their living conditions.

5. **Political and Social Factors**: Political instability and social injustices, such as discrimination and lack of labor rights, further entrench poverty. Political strife can lead to economic volatility and disrupt daily life, exacerbating poverty conditions [^2].

## Limitations
This report is based on available online resources and may not cover all aspects of poverty due to the complexity and variability of the issue across different regions. Additionally, the data and statistics cited are subject to change as new research emerges. The report focuses primarily on general factors and may not address specific local or regional causes of poverty.
