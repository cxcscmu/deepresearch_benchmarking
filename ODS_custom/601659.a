# Brexit: Why Britain Left the European Union

## Executive Summary

The United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, was driven by a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors. The referendum held on June 23, 2016, resulted in a narrow victory for the Leave campaign, with 51.9% voting to exit the EU. Key motivations for Brexit included the desire for national sovereignty, control over immigration, and economic independence from EU regulations. The decision has had significant implications for the UK, the EU, and the global economy.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online search tools and databases to gather information from reputable sources. The search focused on articles, reports, and analyses published around the time of the Brexit referendum and subsequent developments. Key search terms included "Brexit reasons," "UK EU referendum," and "Britain EU exit." The findings were cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Sovereignty and Control**: A significant factor driving the Brexit vote was the desire to regain national sovereignty. Many Britons felt that EU membership diluted their control over domestic affairs. As noted by The Economic Times, "Opting out of the EU will now help UK establish full sovereignty as Britain will not have to comply with EU regulations, which are mostly constituted in Brussels" [^1].

2. **Economic Considerations**: The economic burden of EU regulations and contributions to the EU budget were also contentious issues. The UK was a net contributor to the EU, and many believed that these funds could be better utilized domestically. According to Vox, "The two most common arguments in favor of Brexit focused on the EU's liberal rules for internal migration and the EU's burdensome economic regulations" [^2].

3. **Immigration Concerns**: Immigration was a central theme in the Brexit debate. The free movement of people within the EU led to increased immigration to the UK, which some voters believed strained public services and depressed wages. The Atlantic highlighted that "The force that turned Britain away from the European Union was the greatest mass migration since perhaps the Anglo-Saxon invasion" [^3].
