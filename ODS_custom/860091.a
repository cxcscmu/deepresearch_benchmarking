# Report on the Impact of Trump's Tax Cuts on the Middle Class

## Executive Summary

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, enacted under President Donald Trump, has been a subject of significant debate regarding its impact on the middle class. While critics argue that the tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy, several analyses suggest that middle-income and working-class Americans experienced substantial benefits. This report examines the available data and analyses to assess the impact of the TCJA on the middle class.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including news articles, opinion pieces, and data analyses from reputable sources. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Trump tax cuts middle class impact," "TCJA benefits," and "IRS data on tax cuts." The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Middle-Class Benefits**: According to an analysis by the Heartland Institute, the TCJA reduced average effective income tax rates for all IRS income brackets, with the most significant benefits accruing to lower- and middle-income households. "Filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $40,000 to $50,000 received an average tax cut of 18.2 percent" [^1].

2. **Economic Mobility**: The TCJA appeared to have a positive effect on economic mobility. The number of filers with an AGI of $1 to $25,000 decreased by more than 2 million in one year, while households reporting incomes above $25,000 increased across all brackets [^2].

3. **Increased Tax Burden on Higher Incomes**: Despite criticisms, the TCJA made the tax code slightly more progressive. Higher-income earners paid a larger share of the total tax burden in 2018 than in 2017. "Tax filers earning $500,000 or more paid 41.5% of total income tax revenues in 2018, up from 38.9% in 2017" [^3].

## Limitations

This report is based on data and analyses available up to October 2023. The findings are subject to the limitations of the data sources, including potential biases in the analyses conducted by various organizations. Additionally, the long-term effects of the TCJA on the middle class may not be fully captured in the data from the initial years following its implementation. Further research and updated data would be necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation.
