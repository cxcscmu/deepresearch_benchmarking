# Climate Change and Its Impact on Human Health

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses a significant threat to human health, affecting both physical and mental well-being. The rise in global temperatures and the increase in extreme weather events have led to a range of health issues, including heat-related illnesses, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mental health disorders. Vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly, and low-income communities, are disproportionately affected. The World Health Organization projects that climate change could result in an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 if no significant mitigation efforts are undertaken.

## Methodology

To gather information on the health impacts of climate change, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including scientific articles, health organization reports, and environmental health websites. Key search terms included "climate change health effects," "global warming health risks," and "climate-sensitive diseases." The search focused on reputable sources such as Discover Magazine, NIHCM, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Physical Health Risks**: Climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, leading to direct health impacts such as heat stroke and dehydration. "Warmer global temperatures lead to more frequent and longer heat waves, which can cause heat stroke and dehydration" [^1]. Additionally, air pollution from wildfires and increased pollen levels can worsen respiratory conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^2].

2. **Infectious Diseases**: The changing climate affects the distribution of disease vectors, increasing the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and Lyme disease. "Vectors like mosquitos and ticks also do better in hotter temperatures, potentially increasing the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease or malaria" [^1]. Waterborne diseases are also on the rise due to flooding and contamination of water supplies [^3].

3. **Mental Health Impacts**: The psychological effects of climate change are profound, with increased anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) reported among those affected by climate-related disasters. "People whoâ€™ve directly experienced a climate-fueled disaster often experience chronic anxiety and depression in the aftermath" [^1]. The stress of living in a changing climate can also lead to mental health issues even in those not directly affected by disasters [^2].

## Limitations

The findings are based on available data and projections, which may change as new research emerges. The complexity of climate change and its multifaceted impacts on health make it challenging to predict specific outcomes accurately. Additionally, the focus on certain regions or populations may not fully represent global variations in climate change effects. Further research is needed to explore the long-term health impacts and effective mitigation strategies.
