## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive review of available online resources was conducted.

The primary sources of information were historical articles, timelines, and scholarly analyses from reputable websites and databases.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Initial Resistance**: The roots of Algerian discontent can be traced back to the French invasion of Algiers in 1830. Over time, the French implemented policies that marginalized the native Algerian population, leading to widespread resentment. "The Algerian war for independence began in 1954 and ended in 1962 when French President Charles De Gaulle pronounced Algeria an independent country on July 3" [^1].

2. **Formation of the FLN and Escalation of Conflict**: The FLN was established in 1954 as a response to the oppressive French colonial regime. The organization aimed to unify various nationalist factions and lead the struggle for independence. "The Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) waged war against France to gain their independence" [^2]. The conflict intensified with the FLN's strategic use of guerrilla tactics and urban warfare, notably during the Battle of Algiers.

3. **International Pressure and the Évian Accords**: The war drew significant international attention, with the United Nations and various countries urging France to resolve the conflict. The turning point came with the Évian Accords in 1962, which facilitated a ceasefire and paved the way for a referendum on Algerian independence. "On March 18, 1962, the Évian Accords were signed, ushering in a newly independent Algeria and thus ending the 8-year long Algerian War" [^3].
