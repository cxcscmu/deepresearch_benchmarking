# Coping with the Pressures of Fame: Simone Biles

## Executive Summary

Simone Biles, one of the most celebrated gymnasts in history, has faced immense pressure throughout her career, both from the expectations of her sport and the public eye. Her decision to prioritize mental health during the Tokyo Olympics brought global attention to the mental health challenges faced by elite athletes. Biles has employed various strategies to cope with these pressures, including setting personal boundaries, seeking therapy, and utilizing self-help resources. Her approach has not only helped her manage the stress of fame but also inspired others to prioritize their mental well-being.

## Methodology

To gather information on how Simone Biles has coped with the pressures of fame, I utilized a combination of online searches and database queries. The primary sources included reputable news outlets, interviews, and articles focusing on Biles' personal experiences and public statements. Key search terms included "Simone Biles mental health," "Simone Biles coping strategies," and "Simone Biles therapy."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Setting Boundaries and Prioritizing Mental Health**: Biles made headlines when she withdrew from several events at the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health. She stated, "I have to do what’s right for me and focus on my mental health and not jeopardize my health and well-being" [^1]. This decision highlighted her commitment to setting personal boundaries, even at the cost of public criticism.

2. **Therapy and Support Systems**: Biles has been open about her use of therapy to manage anxiety and stress. She maintains "close contact" with her therapist and uses tools like a "worry journal" to manage her anxiety [^2]. Biles has emphasized the importance of having a supportive team around her, stating, "I had the correct people around me to do that" when discussing her decision to withdraw from Olympic events [^3].

3. **Self-Help and Personal Development**: Biles has also turned to self-help literature to develop a mindset that aligns with her values. She found inspiration in the book "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" by Mark Manson, which advocates for focusing on what truly matters and letting go of unnecessary concerns [^4]. This philosophy has helped her navigate the criticisms and expectations that come with fame.
