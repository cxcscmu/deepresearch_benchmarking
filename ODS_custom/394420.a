To compile this report, a comprehensive review of available literature and online resources was conducted.

Key search terms included "education and society," "sociological perspectives on education," and "impact of education on social change." The tools used for this research included academic databases and search engines.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Functionalist Perspective**: Education is viewed as a sub-system of society that performs essential functions such as socialization, skill development, and role allocation. Emile Durkheim emphasized that education transmits society's norms and values, fostering social solidarity. He stated, "society can survive only if there exists among its members a sufficient degree of homogeneity; education perpetuates and reinforces this homogeneity" [^1].

2. **Marxian Perspective**: From a Marxian viewpoint, education is seen as a tool for reproducing class structures and serving the interests of the capitalist ruling class. Louis Althusser argued that education transmits ruling class ideology, creating a submissive workforce. He noted, "the role of education in capitalist society is the reproduction of such a work force" [^1].

3. **Interconnectedness of Education and Society**: Education and society are mutually influential. Emmanuel Jean-Francois highlighted that "education is a reflection of a society, or is influenced by society" and that the two are interconnected through various sociological theories [^2]. This interconnectedness is evident in how educational systems evolve in response to social changes and needs.

4. **Education as a Catalyst for Social Change**: Education is a powerful instrument for social change, promoting modernization and development. It helps in "moving away from traditionalism to modernity" and plays a crucial role in political and economic transformations [^3]. Education fosters critical thinking, innovation, and social mobility, contributing to societal progress.
