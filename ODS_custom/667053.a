# The Importance of Business Strategy as a Driver

## Executive Summary
Business strategy is crucial in guiding organizational and information systems (IS) strategies. It serves as the backbone for aligning various departments and ensuring that all efforts are directed towards common organizational goals. If business strategy does not drive these other strategies, organizations risk misalignment, inefficiencies, and potential failure. This report explores the implications of not having business strategy as the primary driver and provides insights from various sources.

## Methodology
To gather information on the importance of business strategy as a driver, I utilized a combination of academic databases, business strategy articles, and online educational resources. The search focused on understanding the relationship between business strategy, organizational strategy, and IS strategy, and the potential consequences of misalignment.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Alignment and Synchronization**: Business strategy provides the framework for organizational and IS strategies, ensuring that all departments work towards the same objectives. "The business strategy provides the organizational and IS strategy with the guidelines and mission of their departments" [^1]. This alignment is crucial for the efficient functioning of an organization.

2. **Consequences of Misalignment**: When business strategy is not the driver, organizations may face operational inefficiencies and strategic failures. For instance, "If the business strategy is to follow a cost-leadership strategy, but IS continually has to replace hardware and ultimately raising their expenditures, it is not conducive to ensuring that the company is able to offer the lowest-cost product" [^1]. This highlights the potential for increased costs and reduced competitiveness.

3. **Case Study of Failure**: The downfall of Borders Books & Music serves as a cautionary tale. The company suffered from a lack of coherent strategy, frequently changing directions without allowing time for strategies to prove effective. "Without strong strategic decisions, your customers will feel lost, your products or pitches will feel unfocused, and the purpose behind your business will be unclear" [^3]. This lack of strategic direction contributed to their eventual bankruptcy.
