# Report on Interprofessional Collaboration During Patient Transitions

## Executive Summary
Interprofessional collaboration is crucial during patient transitions to ensure continuity of care and prevent adverse outcomes. Effective collaboration involves clear communication, shared responsibilities, and the use of standardized processes. This report explores best practices and tools that facilitate interprofessional collaboration during patient transitions, drawing insights from various healthcare resources.

## Methodology
To gather information on interprofessional collaboration during patient transitions, I utilized a combination of online databases and healthcare-focused websites. The search strategy included keywords such as "interprofessional collaboration," "patient transitions," and "care coordination." The tools used included Google Search and specific healthcare resource platforms like Wolters Kluwer, Connect Care, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).

## Detailed Findings

1. **Foundations for Safe Care Transitions**: According to Wolters Kluwer, effective patient care transitions rely on several foundational elements, including multidisciplinary collaboration and the transfer of information. These foundations help reduce readmissions and improve patient satisfaction. "The Joint Commission (TJC) names seven foundations for safe, effective patient care transitions... Multidisciplinary collaboration" is emphasized as a key component[^1].

2. **Role of Communication**: The Connect Care Manual highlights the importance of communication in patient transitions, stating that "patient movement is about how information flow supports healthcare flow." It emphasizes the need for shared understanding between sending and receiving teams to ensure smooth transitions[^2].

3. **Engaging Patients and Care Partners**: The AHRQ toolkit underscores the importance of engaging patients and their care partners in the transition process to prevent errors. It notes that "patients who transition from one ambulatory care facility clinician to another are especially vulnerable to patient safety errors" due to communication gaps[^3].
