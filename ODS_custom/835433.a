# Short-Term Causes of World War I

## Executive Summary
The short-term causes of World War I are often overshadowed by the long-term factors such as militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. However, the immediate catalyst for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary. This event set off a chain reaction among the European powers, leading to a full-scale war. The assassination, combined with existing tensions and alliances, rapidly escalated into a global conflict.

## Methodology
To gather information on the short-term causes of World War I, I utilized a variety of online resources, including historical essays, educational websites, and scholarly articles. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "short-term causes of WWI," "assassination of Franz Ferdinand," and "immediate causes of World War I." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist is widely recognized as the immediate trigger for World War I. This event led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, setting off a chain reaction among the allied nations[^1]. "The immediate cause of World War I was the assassination, in Sarajevo, of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne"[^1].

2. **Alliance System**: The complex web of alliances in Europe meant that a conflict between two countries could quickly involve others. After Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Russia mobilized in defense of Serbia, prompting Germany to declare war on Russia and subsequently on Russia's allies, France and Britain[^2]. "The assassination of Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand and the resulting crisis between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire caused each system of alliances to enact and World War I began"[^2].

3. **Balkan Tensions**: The Balkans were a region of significant tension due to nationalist movements and territorial disputes. The annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary in 1908 had already strained relations with Serbia, contributing to the volatile situation that led to the war[^3]. "Austria-Hungary took over Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908, making the Serbian people fuming with national pride for their independence"[^3].
