# Report on Changes in U.S. Foreign Policy Over Time

## Executive Summary

U.S. foreign policy has evolved significantly from its early days of isolationism to a more complex and interconnected approach in the modern era. This report examines the shifts in U.S. foreign policy from the late 1800s to the present, highlighting key changes and continuities. The analysis reveals that while the rhetoric and specific strategies may vary, certain underlying themes, such as a focus on domestic priorities and a cautious approach to international engagement, have persisted across different administrations.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive review of available literature and online resources was conducted. The search strategy included using academic databases, news articles, and historical timelines to gather information on U.S. foreign policy changes. Key sources included NPR interviews, historical essays, and educational websites. The focus was on identifying direct quotes and expert opinions to provide a well-rounded perspective.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Continuity in Recent Administrations**: Despite apparent differences in leadership styles, recent U.S. presidents have maintained a consistent foreign policy direction. Richard Haass, head of the Council on Foreign Relations, notes that "three very different presidents - Obama, then Trump, then Biden - have been pushing the United States in the same direction" with a "domestic-first bias" and a reaction against "forever wars" [^1].

2. **Historical Shifts from Isolationism**: In the late 1800s, U.S. foreign policy began shifting from isolationism to a more interventionist stance. This change was driven by economic needs and geopolitical considerations, as seen in the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of territories like Guam and the Philippines [^2]. The early 20th century further solidified this shift with America's involvement in World War I and the establishment of international alliances.

3. **Impact of Globalization**: The era of globalization has significantly altered the conduct of foreign policy. The integration of global economies and the rise of non-state actors have necessitated a more collaborative approach. As one analysis points out, "globalization has allowed for a change in attitudes overall towards foreign policy," emphasizing the importance of international cooperation and the role of intergovernmental organizations [^3].
