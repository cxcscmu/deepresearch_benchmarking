# Report: Should the Electoral College Be Abolished?

## Executive Summary

The debate over whether the Electoral College should be abolished is a contentious issue in American politics. Proponents of abolition argue that the system is outdated, undemocratic, and does not reflect the popular will. Critics of the Electoral College point to instances where candidates have won the presidency without winning the popular vote, suggesting that the system undermines democratic principles. On the other hand, supporters argue that the Electoral College protects the interests of smaller states and maintains a balance in the federal system. This report explores the arguments for and against the abolition of the Electoral College, drawing on various sources and expert opinions.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online databases, opinion pieces, and academic essays. Key search terms included "Electoral College abolition," "Electoral College debate," and "Electoral College reform." Sources were selected based on their relevance, credibility, and the diversity of perspectives they offered on the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Arguments for Abolition**:
   - Critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This has occurred in several elections, most notably in 2000 and 2016. "In modern US politics, the Electoral College has become a huge issue among young voters... Donald Trump won through an Electoral College system even though his rival, Hillary Clinton, received more votes" [^1].
   - The system is seen as outdated, having been designed for a time when communication and information dissemination were limited. "The Electoral College was created in a time when votes were more difficult to collect and count. With everything done electronically today, a simple popular vote would suffice" [^2].
   - Abolishing the Electoral College could lead to a more equitable representation of voters across the country. "A national popular vote would eliminate the 'battleground state' phenomenon... fostering a deeper sense of engagement across the whole population" [^3].

2. **Arguments Against Abolition**:
   - Supporters argue that the Electoral College protects the interests of smaller states, ensuring that presidential candidates must consider the needs of less populous areas. "The Electoral College makes sure that the states count in the presidential elections. As such, it is an important part of our federalist system" [^4].
   - The system is said to promote a two-party system, which some argue is beneficial for political stability. "It channels presidential politics into a two-party system, which is superior to multiparty systems where fringe factions can exercise too much leverage" [^5].
   - Abolishing the Electoral College could lead to increased campaign costs and logistical challenges, as candidates would need to campaign nationwide rather than focusing on key states. "It would cost way too much money campaigning in presidential elections if it was abolished" [^6].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of sources and the potential bias inherent in opinion pieces. The debate over the Electoral College is highly polarized, and sources may reflect partisan perspectives. Additionally, the report does not cover all possible reform proposals, focusing instead on the binary question of abolition versus retention. Further research could explore alternative electoral systems and their potential impact on American democracy.
