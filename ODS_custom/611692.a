# The Influence of Emotional, Cognitive, and Practical Intelligence on Authentic Leadership

## Executive Summary

Authentic leadership is a leadership style characterized by self-awareness, relational transparency, balanced processing, and an internalized moral perspective. Emotional, cognitive, and practical intelligence play significant roles in shaping authentic leadership. Emotional intelligence (EI) enhances leaders' ability to connect with followers, cognitive intelligence (CI) aids in strategic decision-making, and practical intelligence (PI) helps in applying knowledge effectively in real-world situations. This report explores how these forms of intelligence influence authentic leadership.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and credible online resources. The search focused on scholarly articles, books, and expert opinions on authentic leadership and the role of different types of intelligence. Tools like Google Scholar, JSTOR, and specific leadership-focused websites were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Authentic Leadership:**
   Emotional intelligence is crucial for authentic leaders as it involves self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy, which are essential for building trust and transparency with followers. According to Daniel Goleman, "the most effective leaders all have a high degree of Emotional Intelligence" [^1]. This aligns with the authentic leadership model, which emphasizes relational transparency and self-awareness.

2. **Cognitive Intelligence (CI) and Authentic Leadership:**
   Cognitive intelligence contributes to a leader's ability to process information and make informed decisions. It is linked to the balanced processing component of authentic leadership, where leaders objectively analyze data before making decisions. "Authentic leaders aren’t narcissistic or self-aggrandizing. They recognize that they don’t know all the answers and need help from others" [^2]. This statement underscores the importance of cognitive intelligence in authentic leadership.

3. **Practical Intelligence (PI) and Authentic Leadership:**
   Practical intelligence involves the application of knowledge to solve real-world problems. Authentic leaders use practical intelligence to implement their values and strategies effectively. "Authentic leaders are dedicated to developing themselves because they know that becoming a leader takes a lifetime of personal growth" [^3]. This growth often involves applying practical intelligence to navigate complex leadership challenges.
