## Detailed Findings

### Advantages of Globalisation

1. **Economic Growth and Trade Opportunities**: Globalisation has significantly enhanced global trade opportunities, allowing countries to access larger markets and benefit from comparative advantages. "Globalisation has brought immense enhancement in global trade opportunities... business organizations can export their goods to foreign markets and enjoy access to bigger markets" [^1].

2. **Technological and Cultural Exchange**: The spread of technology and cultural practices across borders has been a hallmark of globalisation. "Globalisation is giving rise to global technological advancements... developing countries are getting equal access to technology advancements as the developed ones" [^1].

3. **Improved Quality of Life**: Globalisation has contributed to improved living standards by increasing job opportunities and access to goods and services. "With all these changes happening simultaneously, the world's people now witness a comparatively better quality of life" [^1].

### Disadvantages of Globalisation

1. **Cultural Homogenization**: The spread of global culture can threaten local traditions and identities. "Such adaptation of practices between cultures is posing a threat to local native cultures... cultural homogeneity may take place" [^1].

2. **Environmental Impact**: Globalisation has exacerbated environmental challenges due to increased industrial activity and resource exploitation. "Globalisation has increased the environmental threats... business organizations prefer to set themselves up in places where there are no strict environmental laws" [^1].

3. **Economic Inequality**: While globalisation has created wealth, it has also widened the gap between rich and poor. "Globalisation has somehow widened the gap between the rich and the poor where the richer have continued to get rich while the poor people have also become poorer" [^2].
