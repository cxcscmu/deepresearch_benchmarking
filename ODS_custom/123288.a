# Climate Change and Its Impact on Seals

## Executive Summary

Climate change is significantly impacting seal populations across the globe, particularly those that rely on sea ice for critical life events such as breeding, molting, and resting. The reduction in sea ice due to rising global temperatures poses a threat to various seal species, including the Antarctic fur seal, harp seals, and others. These changes affect their habitat, food availability, and increase mortality rates, which could lead to long-term population declines.

## Methodology

To gather information on the impact of climate change on seals, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and reputable science news websites. The search focused on peer-reviewed articles, scientific reports, and expert analyses. Tools such as Google Scholar, ScienceDaily, and PLOS ONE were utilized to ensure a wide range of perspectives and data were considered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Antarctic Fur Seals**: The climate crisis is reducing the availability of krill, a primary food source for Antarctic fur seals, during the summer months. This reduction in food supply has led to decreased reproductive success among female seals. Additionally, increased predation by leopard seals, due to a decline in penguin populations, further threatens fur seal pups[^1].

2. **Harp Seals**: Harp seals are experiencing increased neonatal mortality due to declining sea ice cover, which is essential for pupping and nursing. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been linked to changes in sea ice conditions, affecting seal mortality rates. Studies have shown that lighter ice years correlate with higher mortality rates among young seals[^2].

3. **General Impact on Ice-Dependent Seals**: Many seal species, including bearded and ringed seals, are threatened by diminishing sea ice. These species rely on ice for breeding and resting. The loss of ice habitat due to climate change is expected to lead to population declines, as seals struggle to find suitable environments for critical life processes[^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on available literature up to October 2023. The rapidly evolving nature of climate science means that new findings could alter current understandings. Additionally, the complexity of ecological interactions and the variability of climate impacts across different regions and species may not be fully captured in the existing studies. Further research is needed to continuously update and refine these findings.
