# Euthanasia: An Overview

## Executive Summary

Euthanasia, often referred to as "mercy killing," is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. It is a highly controversial topic with ethical, legal, and moral implications. The process of euthanasia can vary depending on the type and the legal framework within which it is performed. This report explores the methodologies, types, and ethical considerations surrounding euthanasia.

## Methodology

To gather information on euthanasia, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including medical and legal dictionaries, encyclopedias, and dedicated euthanasia information websites. The search focused on understanding the process, types, and legal status of euthanasia across different jurisdictions.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Process of Euthanasia**: Euthanasia is typically performed by administering a lethal dose of medication. "Euthanasia is performed by the attending physician administering a fatal dose of a suitable drug to the patient on his or her express request" [^1]. This can be done through intravenous injection or oral ingestion, depending on the legal and medical guidelines in place.

2. **Types of Euthanasia**: There are several types of euthanasia, including active, passive, voluntary, and involuntary. Active euthanasia involves "the direct administration of a lethal substance to the patient by another party with merciful intent" [^2]. Passive euthanasia, on the other hand, involves withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments, allowing the patient to die naturally.

3. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: The legality of euthanasia varies widely across the globe. In some countries, such as the Netherlands and Belgium, euthanasia is legal under strict conditions. In the United States, euthanasia is illegal in all 50 states, but physician-assisted suicide is legal in some jurisdictions [^3]. Ethical debates often center around the sanctity of life, patient autonomy, and the potential for abuse.
