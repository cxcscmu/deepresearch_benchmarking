# Does Religion Cause War?

## Executive Summary

The question of whether religion causes war is a complex and multifaceted issue. While religion has been implicated in numerous historical conflicts, it is not the sole or primary cause of war. Political, economic, and social factors often play a more significant role. This report examines various perspectives on the relationship between religion and war, drawing from historical examples and scholarly analyses.

## Methodology

To address the question, a comprehensive review of online articles and essays was conducted. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "religion causes war," "religious conflicts," and "historical wars and religion." Sources were selected based on their relevance and the diversity of perspectives they offered. Tools like Google Scholar and academic databases were utilized to ensure a broad range of viewpoints.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Misconceptions**: Many argue that religion is often a scapegoat for wars that are primarily driven by political and economic motives. According to an article on Deadline Essay, "Although wars have been fought over religion like in the case of crusaders or Sunni-Shia conflicts, the main reason for the war, as many political analysts state, is a political conflict by the use of violence" [^1]. This suggests that while religion may be a factor, it is not the primary cause.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: The Encyclopedia of Wars categorizes only 123 out of 1,763 wars as religious in nature, which is less than 7% of all wars. When excluding wars waged in the name of Islam, this percentage drops to 3.23% [^2]. This data challenges the notion that religion is the predominant cause of war.

3. **Philosophical and Ethical Perspectives**: Tzvi Freeman, writing for Chabad.org, argues that "there is another common factor to war, much more common than religionâ€”and that is that they are fought by human beings" [^3]. This perspective emphasizes the role of human nature and other non-religious motivations in the causation of war.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of comprehensive data on all historical conflicts and the subjective nature of attributing causation to complex events like wars. Additionally, the focus on predominantly Western sources may overlook perspectives from other cultural or religious contexts. Further research could benefit from a more global and interdisciplinary approach.
