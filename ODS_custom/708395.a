# Gender Pay Gap: Why Women Earn Less Than Men

## Executive Summary

The gender pay gap remains a persistent issue globally, with women earning less than men across various sectors. This disparity is not solely due to women being paid less for the same job but is influenced by a complex interplay of factors including occupational segregation, the motherhood penalty, and systemic biases. Despite advancements in education and workforce participation, women continue to face significant economic disadvantages.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive review of available literature and articles was conducted using online platforms such as Medium, The Economist, and various economic and sociological studies. The search focused on identifying key reasons for the gender pay gap and included perspectives from different regions and industries.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Occupational Segregation and Career Choices**: Women often work in lower-paying fields compared to men, which contributes significantly to the pay gap. "The data indicate that women's 'choice' to enter lower-paying career fields accounts for somewhere between 15% and 49% of the gender difference in pay" [^1]. This occupational segregation is often a result of societal norms and educational guidance that steer women towards certain professions.

2. **Motherhood Penalty**: Women face a significant economic penalty for motherhood, which affects their career progression and earnings. "The biggest pay hit happens when women have children, leading to what researchers call a 'motherhood penalty'" [^2]. This penalty is reflected in reduced working hours, lower pay, and fewer promotions compared to their male counterparts.

3. **Systemic Bias and Discrimination**: Despite legal frameworks against discrimination, biases persist in the workplace. "Even when women pursue the same degree, the same major, the same job, and the same work hours as men, they STILL get paid less" [^1]. Studies have shown that women are often perceived as less competent and are offered lower salaries than men for identical roles.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of data and the scope of the sources reviewed. While the sources provide a broad overview, they may not capture all nuances of the gender pay gap across different cultures and industries. Additionally, the data is primarily from Western contexts, which may not fully represent global disparities. Further research could explore more diverse geographical and cultural perspectives to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
