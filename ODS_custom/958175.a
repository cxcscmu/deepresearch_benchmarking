# Business Insider Bias Analysis

## Executive Summary

Business Insider, now known as Insider, is generally perceived as having a left-center bias. This assessment is based on its story selection and the language used in its articles, which often favor liberal causes. Despite this bias, Business Insider is rated highly for factual reporting due to its proper sourcing and a clean fact-check record. The publication is owned by Axel Springer, a German media company, and is funded through online advertising.

## Methodology

To assess the bias of Business Insider, I utilized a variety of sources, including Media Bias/Fact Check, AllSides, and Ad Fontes Media. These platforms provide comprehensive analyses of media bias and reliability. I also reviewed user-generated content on Quora to gather public perception and anecdotal evidence regarding Business Insider's bias.
