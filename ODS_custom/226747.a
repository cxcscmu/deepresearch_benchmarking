## Detailed Findings

1. **John Locke's Influence**: John Locke's ideas on natural rights and government by consent were pivotal. Locke argued for the protection of life, liberty, and property, which directly influenced the Declaration of Independence. "The Founding Fathers drew heavily upon English philosopher John Locke in establishing America's First Principles, most notably the recognition of unalienable rights, the Social Compact, and limited government" [^1].

2. **Montesquieu's Contribution**: Montesquieu's concept of the separation of powers was integral to the structure of the US government. His work, "The Spirit of the Laws," advocated for dividing government authority into three branches, which was adopted in the US Constitution. "Montesquieu saw the dangers of a government ruled by one person with all the power" [^2].

3. **Religious and Historical Documents**: The Magna Carta and the Virginia Bill of Rights were also significant. The Magna Carta served as a symbol of liberty and influenced the Founding Fathers' views on justice and governance. "The Magna Carta eventually served as the basis for English common law and became a symbol of freedom from oppression to Englishmen â€“ including the Founding Fathers who found inspiration in it" [^3].
