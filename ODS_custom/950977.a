## Detailed Findings

1. **Causes of World War I**:
   - The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian nationalist was the immediate trigger for the war. This event set off a chain reaction among the major European powers due to existing alliances[^1].
   - Long-term causes included militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. These factors created a tense environment ripe for conflict. Militarism involved the arms race and military planning that made war more likely[^2].
   - The complex system of alliances, such as the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, meant that a conflict between two countries could quickly involve others[^3].

2. **Consequences of World War I**:
   - The war resulted in the downfall of four major empires: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires. This led to significant political changes and the creation of new countries in Europe and the Middle East[^4].
   - Economically, the war left many European countries in debt and led to the United States emerging as a major creditor and economic power. The war also contributed to the Great Depression due to the economic instability it caused[^5].
   - Socially, the war had a profound impact, including the loss of a generation of young men, changes in gender roles as women took on roles traditionally held by men, and the spread of new ideologies such as communism and fascism[^6].
