# Report: To What Extent Do Conservatives Agree on Society?

## Executive Summary

Conservatism, as a political ideology, encompasses a range of beliefs about society, often leading to both unity and division among its adherents. While traditional and one-nation conservatives generally emphasize the importance of hierarchy, community, and gradual change, libertarian and neo-conservative strands often prioritize individualism and free-market principles. This report explores the extent to which conservatives are united in their views on society, highlighting areas of agreement and divergence.

## Methodology

To address the query, I utilized a combination of online educational resources, discussion forums, and academic essays. The primary tools included search engines and educational platforms like Quizlet and Course Hero. The search strategy focused on identifying key themes and perspectives within conservative thought regarding society.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Unity in Tradition and Hierarchy**: Traditional and one-nation conservatives often agree on the importance of maintaining societal traditions and hierarchies. They view these as essential for stability and continuity. As one source notes, "Most conservatives fundamentally believe in the idea of tradition, community and the prevention of drastic social change" [^1]. This perspective is rooted in the belief that society should evolve gradually, respecting the accumulated wisdom of the past.

2. **Divergence in Views on Individualism**: A significant point of contention within conservatism is the role of individualism versus community. Libertarians, for instance, argue that "individuals owe no duty to one another unless contractual" and emphasize a society composed of independent beings [^1]. In contrast, traditional conservatives stress the importance of community and social bonds, as exemplified by the concept of "noblesse oblige," where the elite have a duty to care for those less fortunate [^2].

3. **Disagreement on Social Change**: Conservatives are divided on the issue of social change. Traditional conservatives advocate for change only when it serves to conserve existing societal structures, whereas libertarians and neo-conservatives may support more radical changes to promote individual freedom and market efficiency. This is reflected in the statement that "radical change is essential to achieve moral purpose of 'objectivist' self-fulfillment" [^1].
