# Revolutionary War: Causes and Motivations

## Executive Summary
The Revolutionary War, also known as the American War of Independence, was fought between 1775 and 1783. It was primarily a conflict between Great Britain and its thirteen American colonies, which sought independence. The war was driven by a combination of political, economic, and social factors, including taxation without representation, British military presence, and the desire for self-governance. The conflict ultimately led to the establishment of the United States as an independent nation.

## Methodology
To gather information on the causes of the Revolutionary War, I utilized a variety of online resources, including educational websites, historical articles, and digital archives. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Revolutionary War causes," "American War of Independence," and "colonial grievances." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Taxation Without Representation**: One of the primary grievances of the American colonists was the imposition of taxes by the British Parliament, in which they had no representation. This led to the rallying cry of "No taxation without representation." The colonists felt that they were being unfairly taxed to pay for British debts, particularly those incurred during the French and Indian War. "Parliament said it was right to tax the American colonists to help pay the bills for the war" [^1].

2. **British Military Presence and Control**: The presence of British troops in the colonies and the enforcement of British laws were seen as oppressive. The Boston Massacre, where British soldiers killed five colonists, exemplified the tensions between the colonists and British authorities. "The British were controlling all their trade and industry... The army started using brutality to make the common people pay taxes" [^2].

3. **Desire for Self-Governance**: The colonists' desire for self-governance and independence from British rule was a significant factor. The Continental Congress and the drafting of the Declaration of Independence were pivotal in formalizing the colonies' quest for autonomy. "The Americans believed that they were entitled to the full democratic rights of Englishmen" [^3].
