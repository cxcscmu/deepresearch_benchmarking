# Chlorine Shortage of 2021: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

The chlorine shortage of 2021, often referred to as "Pool-mageddon" or "poolocalypse," has been a significant issue for pool owners and the swimming pool industry. This shortage is primarily due to a combination of increased demand for swimming pools during the COVID-19 pandemic and a critical supply disruption caused by a fire at a major chlorine manufacturing plant. The shortage has led to increased prices and limited availability of chlorine products, prompting pool owners to seek alternative sanitization methods.

## Methodology

To gather information on the chlorine shortage, I utilized a variety of online resources, including industry reports, news articles, and expert opinions. The search was conducted using Google and other search engines, focusing on credible sources such as industry experts, news outlets, and pool maintenance companies. The goal was to compile a comprehensive overview of the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the chlorine shortage.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Supply Chain Disruption**: The primary cause of the chlorine shortage was a fire at the BioLab plant in Louisiana, which occurred in August 2020 following Hurricane Laura. This plant was a major producer of Trichlor chlorine tablets, and its destruction significantly reduced the supply of chlorine in the U.S. market. "BioLab, one of the nationâ€™s primary chlorine tablet manufacturers, burned down in August 2020" [^1].

2. **Increased Demand**: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in the construction of residential swimming pools as people sought home-based leisure activities. This increased demand for chlorine products exacerbated the supply issues. "Stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, people who found themselves sitting on savings from canceled vacations and other cutbacks built pools in record numbers last year" [^2].

3. **Economic Impact**: The shortage has led to significant price increases for chlorine products. Reports indicate that the price of chlorine tablets has doubled, with some retailers imposing purchase limits. "Financial services company IHS Markit predicted that chlorine prices will rise 70 percent this year" [^3].

## Limitations

The analysis is based on information available up to October 2023, and the situation may have evolved since then. Additionally, while the sources used are credible, there may be other factors contributing to the shortage that were not covered in the available literature. The focus was primarily on the U.S. market, and the situation may differ in other regions.
