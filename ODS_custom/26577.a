# Report on the Purpose of the 9/11 Attacks

## Executive Summary

The September 11, 2001, attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist acts carried out by the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda. The primary purpose of these attacks was to inflict significant damage on the United States, both physically and psychologically, and to provoke a broader conflict between the Islamic world and the West. The attacks were intended to serve as a statement against U.S. foreign policies, particularly its support for Israel and its military presence in the Middle East. The events of 9/11 led to significant global repercussions, including the U.S.-led War on Terror.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online research tools and databases, including Wikipedia and educational platforms like Brainly. The search strategy involved identifying credible sources that provide detailed accounts of the motivations and objectives behind the 9/11 attacks. The focus was on extracting direct quotes and insights from verified sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Motivations Behind the Attacks**: The 9/11 attacks were primarily motivated by al-Qaeda's opposition to U.S. foreign policies. Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, cited several grievances, including U.S. support for Israel, military presence in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq. In his 2002 "Letter to America," bin Laden stated, "The expansion of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals" [^1].

2. **Strategic Objectives**: The attacks aimed to provoke the United States into a military response that would unite Muslims against the West. Middle East scholars like Michael Scott Doran have argued that the attacks were part of a strategy to incite a pan-Islamist revolution. Doran noted that bin Laden's followers "consider themselves an island of true believers surrounded by a sea of iniquity" [^2].

3. **Impact and Consequences**: The attacks were designed to cause maximum casualties and economic disruption. According to a Brainly source, the main goal was "to kill as many Americans as possible and damage the US economy" [^3]. The attacks led to the U.S. declaring a War on Terror, resulting in military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
