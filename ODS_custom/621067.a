## Executive Summary

The United States' entry into World War I in 1917 was a pivotal moment in the conflict, significantly impacting the war's outcome. The decision to join the war was driven by several factors, including Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, the Zimmermann Telegram, and economic interests tied to the Allies. This report examines the justification for U.S. involvement in WWI, analyzing the motivations and consequences of this decision.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and educational resources. The search focused on historical analyses, essays, and expert opinions regarding the U.S. entry into WWI. Key sources included academic essays, historical websites, and Q&A platforms like Quora and Brainly.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Unrestricted Submarine Warfare**: Germany's aggressive naval strategy was a significant factor in the U.S. decision to enter the war. German U-boats targeted neutral ships, including American vessels, which escalated tensions. "Germany's submarine warfare, threats to democracy, and contacts with Mexico threatened the security and honor of the United States and could not be tolerated" [^1].

2. **The Zimmermann Telegram**: This secret communication from Germany to Mexico proposed a military alliance against the U.S. if America entered the war. The British interception and disclosure of the telegram outraged the American public and government. "The biggest mistake was the Zimmermann Telegram. British intelligence intercepted and decoded the message. It requested the Mexicans to join the war against USA" [^2].

3. **Economic Interests**: The U.S. had substantial economic ties with the Allies, and their victory was crucial for American financial interests. "One of the main reasons the US got into WWI was its fiscal policy... we had strong economic ties to the Allied Powers, because if they lost they couldn't pay back our loans" [^3].
