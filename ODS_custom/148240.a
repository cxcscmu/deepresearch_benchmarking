# The Significance of Studying Rizal in Contemporary Times

## Executive Summary

The study of Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, remains significant in contemporary times due to his enduring influence on Filipino nationalism, education, and moral values. Rizal's life and works continue to inspire the youth and provide a framework for understanding and addressing current societal issues. His writings, particularly "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," remain relevant as they address themes of social justice, corruption, and national identity, which are still pertinent today.

## Methodology

To assess the contemporary relevance of studying Rizal, a comprehensive review of online resources was conducted. This included academic papers, essays, and blog posts that discuss Rizal's impact on modern society. The search was performed using Google and academic databases, focusing on sources that provide insights into the educational and societal implications of Rizal's teachings.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Educational and Moral Influence**: Rizal's life and works are integral to the educational curriculum in the Philippines, mandated by Republic Act 1425, also known as the Rizal Law. This law aims to "rededicate the lives of youth to the ideals of freedom and nationalism" and to "gain an inspiring source of patriotism through the study of Rizal’s life, works, and writings" [^1]. His teachings encourage students to apply his ideals to current social and personal problems, fostering a deeper understanding of citizenship and national identity.

2. **Relevance to Modern Issues**: Rizal's writings address issues such as corruption and social injustice, which remain relevant today. "The writings of Rizal talk about brutality and corruption during the Spanish rule, it could also apply to today’s era because the Philippines is always listed as one of the most corrupt countries in the world" [^2]. His works serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle against these societal issues and inspire action towards reform.

3. **Inspiration for Nationalism and Patriotism**: Rizal's life and legacy continue to inspire a sense of nationalism and patriotism among Filipinos. "Rizal renews the Spirit of Nationalism in the hearts of the youth... there is a greater need to study Rizal. The life of our national hero will allow us to invoke the nationalism within our hearts and a hopeful aspiration to build a better country" [^3]. His example encourages the youth to engage in nation-building and to strive for a better future for the Philippines.
