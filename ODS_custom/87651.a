# Report on High Home Prices

## Executive Summary

The surge in home prices has been a significant concern for potential homeowners and policymakers alike. The primary drivers of high home prices include a combination of increased demand, limited supply, and financial policies. Factors such as low interest rates, insufficient new home construction, and speculative investment have exacerbated the situation. This report delves into these elements to provide a comprehensive understanding of why home prices remain elevated.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a thorough review of recent articles and studies from reputable sources was conducted. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "high home prices," "housing market," and "real estate trends." Tools like Google Scholar and news databases were utilized to gather diverse perspectives and data on the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Bank Lending and Speculation**: One significant factor contributing to high home prices is the role of banks in creating money through mortgage lending. "Banks created hundreds of billions of pounds and put it into property... the amount of money banks created through mortgage lending more than quadrupled"[^1]. This influx of money into the housing market has driven prices up significantly.

2. **Supply and Demand Imbalance**: The housing market is experiencing a severe imbalance between supply and demand. "There simply arenâ€™t enough homes to meet the demand, pushing prices up to the heavens"[^2]. The shortage of new construction, coupled with increasing demand from millennials and baby boomers, has intensified competition for available homes.

3. **Regulatory and Zoning Constraints**: In certain areas, stringent zoning laws and regulations have limited the ability to build new homes, further constraining supply. "Zoning and other land use controls play the dominant role in making housing expensive"[^3]. This has been particularly evident in high-demand areas like California and New York.
