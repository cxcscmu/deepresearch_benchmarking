# The Beginning of the American Civil War

## Executive Summary

The American Civil War, a pivotal conflict in United States history, began on April 12, 1861, with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in Charleston Bay, South Carolina. This war was primarily ignited by deep-seated tensions over slavery, states' rights, and economic disparities between the North and South. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, who opposed the expansion of slavery, was a significant catalyst that led to the secession of Southern states and the eventual outbreak of war.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including historical websites and articles, to gather comprehensive information on the origins of the Civil War. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Civil War beginning," "Fort Sumter," and "causes of the Civil War." Tools like Google Search and academic databases were employed to ensure a wide range of perspectives and historical accuracy.

## Detailed Findings

1. **The Election of Abraham Lincoln**: The election of Lincoln in 1860 was a turning point that led to the secession of Southern states. Lincoln's stance against the expansion of slavery was perceived as a direct threat to the Southern way of life and economy, which heavily relied on slave labor. "The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 caused seven southern states to secede and form the Confederate States of America; four more states soon joined them" [^2].

2. **Secession and Fort Sumter**: The immediate cause of the Civil War was the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. "On April 12, 1861, the war began when Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor forcing its surrender" [^7]. This act of aggression marked the official start of hostilities between the North and South.

3. **Underlying Causes**: The war was rooted in longstanding issues such as slavery, economic differences, and states' rights. "The American Civil War was fought between 1861 and 1865 when a total of eleven states seceded to form the Confederate States of America. They were spurred to leave by the election of President Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 and by the outbreak of hostilities in April 1861" [^5].
