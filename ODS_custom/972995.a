# The Failure of the League of Nations: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

The League of Nations, established after World War I, was the first major international organization aimed at maintaining global peace and preventing future conflicts. Despite its noble intentions, the League ultimately failed to prevent the outbreak of World War II. This report explores the primary reasons for its failure, including structural weaknesses, lack of enforcement mechanisms, and the absence of key global powers.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including historical articles, academic analyses, and expert opinions. The search focused on identifying the key factors that contributed to the League's failure, utilizing tools such as Google Scholar, historical databases, and educational websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Structural and Constitutional Weaknesses**: The League of Nations was hampered by its structural design, which required unanimity for decisions, making it difficult to take decisive action. "The rule of unanimity made the working of the League impossible because it was always difficult to reach it in the face of conflicting interests being present in the League" [^1].

2. **Absence of Major Powers**: The United States, despite being a key proponent of the League's creation, never joined, significantly weakening its influence. "The League was supposed to present the world and encompass all countries, but many countries never even joined the organization, of which the U.S. was the most prevalent one" [^2]. Additionally, Germany and the Soviet Union were initially excluded, further diminishing the League's authority.

3. **Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms**: The League had no military force of its own and relied on member states to enforce its resolutions, which they were often unwilling to do. "The League didn’t have its own armed forces and depended on members to act, but none of the member countries were ready for another war and didn’t want to provide military support" [^3].

4. **Economic and Political Factors**: Economic nationalism and the political climate of the time also played significant roles in the League's failure. "Economic nationalism was also the main reason for the League’s failure. The desire for more and more territories and the craze for new markets became a mania with every state" [^1].
