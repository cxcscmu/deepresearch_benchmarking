# Report: Comparison of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells and the Impact of Viruses

## Executive Summary
This report explores the fundamental differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and examines how viruses interact with these cell types. Prokaryotic cells, which include bacteria and archaea, are simpler and lack a nucleus, while eukaryotic cells, found in animals, plants, and fungi, are more complex with membrane-bound organelles. Viruses, which are not considered living organisms, interact with these cells differently due to their structural differences.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online academic resources, educational websites, and scientific forums. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and the mechanisms by which viruses impact these cells. Tools such as Google Scholar and educational platforms like Quora and The Student Room were utilized.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Structural Differences**:
   - Prokaryotic cells are characterized by the absence of a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They are generally smaller and simpler in structure compared to eukaryotic cells. "Prokaryotes are molecules surrounded by a membrane and cell wall" [^1].
   - Eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and various organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are enclosed within membranes. "Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not" [^2].

2. **Viral Impact on Prokaryotic Cells**:
   - Viruses that infect prokaryotic cells, known as bacteriophages, can either integrate their DNA into the host genome (lysogenic cycle) or replicate rapidly, causing cell lysis (lytic cycle). "In prokaryotic cells e.g. bacterium, a virus can be deterred out because of different methylation patterns which the bacterium can detect" [^3].

3. **Viral Impact on Eukaryotic Cells**:
   - In eukaryotic cells, viruses often enter through specific receptors and replicate within the nucleus, disrupting cellular functions. "In eukaryotes cells, the virus has receptors for the cells that it can attack. It then enters and replicates its genetic material in the nucleus" [^3].

## Limitations
The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not provide the most current research findings. Additionally, the complexity of viral interactions with cells means that some nuances may not be fully captured in this summary. Further research, including primary scientific literature, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of these interactions.
