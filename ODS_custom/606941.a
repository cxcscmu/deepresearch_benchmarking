# Causes of the Syrian Civil War: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, is a complex conflict with multiple causes rooted in political, economic, and social issues. The war has resulted in significant humanitarian crises, with millions displaced and hundreds of thousands killed. The primary causes of the conflict include authoritarian governance, sectarian tensions, economic hardships, and foreign interventions. This report delves into these factors, providing a detailed understanding of the origins and escalation of the Syrian Civil War.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive review of available online resources was conducted. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "causes of the Syrian Civil War," "Syrian conflict origins," and "Syria 2011 uprising." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a wide range of perspectives and data points were considered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Authoritarian Governance and Political Repression**: The Assad regime's authoritarian rule is a significant factor in the conflict. Bashar al-Assad's government, characterized by political repression and lack of democratic freedoms, sparked widespread discontent. "The conflict in Syria began as a protest against the corruption that blighted every aspect of people’s lives and the lack of freedom; the people demanded radical reforms in how Syria was governed" [^1].

2. **Sectarian Tensions**: Sectarian divisions, particularly between the ruling Alawite minority and the Sunni majority, have exacerbated the conflict. The Assad regime's reliance on Alawite support has fueled sectarian violence. "Sectarianism was not a part of a Syrian lifestyle until recently. It has been imported by foreign religious fanatics" [^2].

3. **Economic Hardships**: Economic decline, marked by high unemployment and inflation, contributed to the unrest. The World Bank reported significant GDP losses due to the conflict, further straining the economy. "The Syrian economy suffered from conflict-related hyperinflation. The Syrian annual inflation rate is one of the highest in the world" [^3].

4. **Foreign Intervention**: The involvement of foreign powers has turned the Syrian conflict into a proxy war. Countries like Russia and Iran support the Assad regime, while the US, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia back various rebel groups. "The conflict has not only pitted the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad against a band of rebels, but drawn the U.S., Iran, Russia and Turkey, among others, into a complex proxy war" [^4].
