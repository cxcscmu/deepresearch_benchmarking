# Report on Cuban Protests

## Executive Summary

In July 2021, Cuba witnessed its largest anti-government protests in decades. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with the government, driven by severe economic hardships, food and medicine shortages, and the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The protests were marked by calls for freedom and demands for President Miguel Díaz-Canel to step down. The Cuban government attributed the unrest to U.S. sanctions and external provocations, while the international community, including the U.S., expressed support for the protesters' rights to peaceful assembly.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online news sources, including The Sun, Forbes, CBS News, PBS NewsHour, ABC News, CBC News, The New York Times, and NBC News. These sources provided a comprehensive overview of the events, motivations, and international reactions related to the protests in Cuba. The search strategy involved identifying credible news outlets and extracting relevant information from their reports on the protests.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Hardships and Shortages**: The protests were largely fueled by Cuba's worst economic crisis in decades, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. sanctions. "Cubans have taken to the streets in protest amid the country’s worsening economic crisis" [^1]. The shortages of food, medicine, and basic goods have led to widespread public discontent.

2. **Government Response and Blame**: President Miguel Díaz-Canel blamed the U.S. sanctions for the economic difficulties and accused the U.S. of orchestrating the protests. "Diaz-Canel blamed U.S. sanctions tightened during President Donald Trump’s time in office for the country’s 'economic asphyxiation'" [^2]. The government also accused Cuban Americans and social media campaigns of inciting unrest.

3. **Public Sentiment and International Reaction**: The protests were marked by chants of "freedom" and "down with the dictatorship," reflecting deep-seated frustrations with the communist regime. "The Cuban people are demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime" [^3]. The U.S. and other international actors have expressed support for the protesters, urging the Cuban government to respect their rights to peaceful protest.
