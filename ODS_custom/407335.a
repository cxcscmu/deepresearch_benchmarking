# Report on the Effect of Increased Automation on the 'Service Desk' Practice

## Executive Summary
The integration of automation into the service desk practice has significantly transformed its operations. Automation has led to reduced manual tasks, allowing service desk personnel to focus more on enhancing customer experience during personal interactions. This shift has resulted in decreased phone contact and less low-level work, enabling service desks to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Methodology
To gather information on the impact of automation on service desk practices, I utilized a combination of online educational resources, industry blogs, and research articles. Key search strategies included querying terms like "service desk automation impact," "ITIL 4 service desk," and "automation in IT service management." Tools used included Google Search and specific educational platforms like Quizlet.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Focus on Customer Experience**: Automation has allowed service desks to reduce phone contact and low-level work, thereby enhancing their ability to focus on customer experience when personal contact is necessary. As noted, "With increased automation... The impact on service desks is reduced phone contact, less low-level work, and a greater ability to focus on excellent CX when personal contact is needed" [^1].

2. **Reduction in Manual Tasks**: The implementation of AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and chatbots has facilitated more self-service options, reducing the need for manual intervention. This shift has been described as leading to "less low-level work and a greater ability to focus on user experience" [^2].

3. **Improved Efficiency and Productivity**: Automation has been pivotal in improving service desk efficiency by handling repetitive tasks and enabling faster resolution of incidents. This is supported by the assertion that "Automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency" [^3].
