# Climate Change: Causes of Long-Term Climate Change

## Executive Summary
Long-term climate change is driven by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Natural causes include variations in Earth's orbit, volcanic activity, and solar radiation changes. Human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, have significantly accelerated climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases. This report explores these causes in detail, highlighting the complex interplay between natural processes and human influence.

## Methodology
To compile this report, I utilized a combination of academic databases, educational websites, and expert-verified platforms. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss both natural and human-induced causes of long-term climate change. Tools like Google Scholar and educational platforms such as National Geographic and USGS were instrumental in gathering relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Natural Causes of Climate Change**:
   - Earth's orbit and axial tilt play a significant role in long-term climate cycles. "Over hundreds of thousands of years, Earth's climate undergoes cyclic changes from warmer to colder climates. These cycles are a result of variations in Earth's orbit" [^1].
   - Volcanic activity can also influence climate by releasing particles that reflect solar energy, leading to temporary cooling. "Volcanic eruptions spew rocks, dust, and gases high into the atmosphere... These particles reflect the Sun's energy back out to space" [^2].

2. **Human-Induced Causes**:
   - The burning of fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change. "The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like natural gas, oil, and coal" [^3].
   - Deforestation and industrial activities have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect. "The build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to an enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect" [^4].

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Climate change is further complicated by feedback mechanisms that can amplify initial changes. "Positive feedback effects then enhance this small change. The climate system rebalances again but at a different global temperature" [^1].

## Limitations
The report is limited by the availability of up-to-date data and the inherent complexity of climate systems, which involve numerous interacting variables. Additionally, while the sources used are credible, the interpretations of data can vary, and ongoing research may provide new insights into the causes and effects of climate change.
