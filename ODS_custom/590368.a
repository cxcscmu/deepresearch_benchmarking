## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Motivations:**
   - The primary economic driver for the Age of Exploration was the search for new trade routes to the Far East. European nations sought to bypass the land-based Silk Road, which was time-consuming and controlled by the Ottoman Empire after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453[^1]. "European countries were interested in speeding up trade by finding a quicker sea route"[^2].
   - The desire for wealth, particularly in the form of gold, silver, and spices, was a significant motivator. Explorers aimed to find new sources of these valuable commodities to enhance their nations' economies[^3].

2. **Religious and Cultural Motivations:**
   - The spread of Christianity was a crucial factor, as European rulers and explorers believed in the need to convert non-Christian populations. This religious zeal was often intertwined with the quest for glory and national pride[^4].
   - The Renaissance period in Europe sparked a renewed interest in learning and discovery, leading to a cultural curiosity about foreign lands and peoples[^5].

3. **Technological Advancements:**
   - Innovations in navigation and shipbuilding, such as the development of the caravel and the use of the compass and astrolabe, made long-distance sea voyages more feasible. These advancements allowed explorers to travel further and more accurately[^6].
