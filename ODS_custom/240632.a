# School Bus Driver Shortage: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

The shortage of school bus drivers in the United States has become a significant issue, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This shortage is not a new phenomenon but has reached critical levels due to a combination of factors including low wages, poor working conditions, and the impact of the pandemic. The shortage has led to severe disruptions in school transportation, affecting students, parents, and school districts nationwide.

## Methodology

To understand the reasons behind the school bus driver shortage, a comprehensive review of recent articles and reports was conducted. The search focused on credible sources that discuss the labor market dynamics, the impact of COVID-19, and structural issues within the school transportation sector. Tools used included Google Search and academic databases to gather a wide range of perspectives and data.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic has significantly worsened the existing shortage. Many drivers were furloughed or laid off during school closures, and some have not returned due to health concerns or finding alternative employment. "COVID just completely exacerbated the bus driver shortage," said Paul Abbott, executive director for transportation for the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System [^1].

2. **Low Wages and Poor Working Conditions**: School bus drivers often face low pay and limited hours, making the job less attractive compared to other opportunities. "Bus drivers typically work a split schedule... making it harder for them to take on side hustles or second jobs to supplement their income" [^2]. The average hourly wage is around $16, which is less competitive compared to other driving jobs.

3. **Structural and Systemic Issues**: The shortage is also attributed to systemic issues such as the requirement for a commercial driver's license (CDL), which can be a barrier due to the cost and time required to obtain it. "Brand-new bus drivers can't be hired on the spot like retail or fast-food workers; they need commercial driver's licenses" [^3]. Additionally, the lack of support from school administrations and the challenging work environment contribute to high turnover rates.

## Limitations

The analysis is based on available data and reports up to October 2023. The situation is dynamic, and ongoing developments in the labor market and public health policies may influence the shortage. Additionally, regional variations in the shortage and responses by different school districts may not be fully captured in this report. Further research could explore long-term solutions and the effectiveness of current interventions.
