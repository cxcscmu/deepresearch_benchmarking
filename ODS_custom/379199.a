# Understanding the Causes of Sexism

## Executive Summary

Sexism, defined as prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, is a pervasive issue affecting various aspects of society, from personal relationships to institutional structures. It primarily impacts women and marginalized genders, although it can also indirectly affect men. The causes of sexism are multifaceted, involving cultural, social, and institutional factors that perpetuate gender inequality. This report explores the underlying causes of sexism, drawing on various sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Methodology

To gather information on the causes of sexism, a combination of search strategies was employed, including keyword searches on academic databases, reputable news sites, and specialized publications on gender studies. Tools such as Google Scholar and institutional databases were used to access peer-reviewed articles and reports. The search focused on identifying both historical and contemporary perspectives on sexism.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural and Social Norms**: Sexism is deeply rooted in cultural and social norms that dictate gender roles and expectations. These norms often value masculine traits over feminine ones, leading to systemic discrimination. "Sexism includes attitudes or ideology, including beliefs, theories, and ideas that hold one group (usually male) as deservedly superior to the other (usually female)" [^1].

2. **Gender Stereotypes**: Stereotypes about gender roles contribute significantly to sexism. These stereotypes are often perpetuated through media, education, and family structures, reinforcing the idea that men and women have inherently different capabilities and roles. "Gender stereotypes underpin sexist behavior and practices. Gender stereotypes do not need to be hostile to be harmful" [^2].

3. **Institutional Structures**: Institutional sexism occurs when discriminatory practices are embedded within the policies and operations of organizations and governments. This can manifest in unequal pay, lack of representation in leadership roles, and biased legal systems. "Sexism affects every level of society, from institutions and governments to personal relationships" [^3].

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of up-to-date data and the potential bias in sources that may not fully represent the diversity of perspectives on sexism. Additionally, the complexity of sexism as a social issue means that not all causes and effects can be comprehensively covered in a single report. Further research is needed to explore the intersectionality of sexism with other forms of discrimination, such as racism and classism.
