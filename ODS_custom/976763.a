Television shows, movies, and literature often reflected the tensions of the time, portraying themes of espionage and nuclear threat. "The Cold War was reflected in culture through music, movies, books, television and other media, as well as sports and social beliefs and behavior" [^2].

3. **Economic and Technological Advancements**: The Cold War spurred significant advancements in technology and defense. The arms race and space race led to increased government spending on defense and scientific research. "The Cold War also had an impact on the American people economically. The impact was caused mainly by the increase in the amount of taxes" [^3].
