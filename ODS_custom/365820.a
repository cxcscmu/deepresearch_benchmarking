# Steroid Use in Sports: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The use of steroids in sports is a contentious issue that has sparked debate for decades. While some argue that steroids enhance performance and level the playing field, others contend that they pose significant health risks and undermine the integrity of sports. This report delves into the arguments for and against the use of steroids in sports, examining the ethical, health, and competitive implications.

## Methodology

To gather information for this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and resources. The search focused on scholarly articles, opinion pieces, and expert analyses related to steroid use in sports. Key search terms included "steroids in sports," "performance-enhancing drugs," and "health risks of steroids." The search aimed to capture a balanced view of the topic by including both pro and con perspectives.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Health Risks and Ethical Concerns**: Steroids are associated with numerous health risks, including cardiovascular issues, hormonal imbalances, and psychological effects. "Steroids cause the left heart ventricle to enlarge, high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes" [^1]. Additionally, the use of steroids is often viewed as unethical, as it provides an unfair advantage and violates the spirit of fair competition. "Steroid use in sports is cheating, if found out that a team is doping in sports they can be eliminated from the event" [^2].

2. **Impact on Sports Integrity**: The use of steroids undermines the integrity of sports by creating an uneven playing field. Athletes who use steroids gain an unfair advantage over those who rely solely on their natural abilities. "Performance-enhancing drugs create a disadvantage for the athletes that don't use PEDs since they will not perform as well as the athletes that used the drugs during the game or competition" [^3].

3. **Arguments for Steroid Use**: Some proponents argue that allowing steroids could enhance the entertainment value of sports and level the playing field by compensating for genetic inequalities. "By allowing everyone to take performance-enhancing drugs, we level the playing field. We remove the effects of genetic inequality" [^4]. However, this perspective is controversial and raises questions about the long-term implications for athlete health and sportsmanship.
