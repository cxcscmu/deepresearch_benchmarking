## Executive Summary

The American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, ended with the defeat of the Confederate States of America. The reasons for the South's loss are multifaceted, involving a combination of military, economic, and social factors. Key reasons include the North's superior resources and manpower, strategic military leadership, and the internal weaknesses of the Confederacy, such as its reliance on slavery and lack of industrial capacity. This report delves into these aspects to provide a detailed understanding of why the South lost the Civil War.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Resource Disparity**: The North had a significant advantage in terms of resources and manpower. "The Confederacy lost the Civil War for a variety of reasons, chief among them a lack of resources and manpower. The North had more soldiers, more manufacturing and agricultural capacity, and the ability to blockade Southern ports" [^1]. This disparity in resources was a critical factor in the South's inability to sustain a prolonged war effort.

2. **Military Leadership and Strategy**: The Union's military leadership, particularly under Ulysses S. Grant, played a crucial role in the North's victory. "Grant is now considered the 'architect of northern military victory.' Grantâ€™s strategy, which began to fully develop in mid-1864, was to tire the South out then shock it into surrender" [^2]. The strategic acumen of Union leaders contrasted with the internal conflicts and incompetence among some Confederate commanders.

3. **Internal Weaknesses and Slavery**: The institution of slavery, which was central to the Southern economy, also contributed to its downfall. "The most convincing 'internal' factor behind southern defeat was the very institution that prompted secession: slavery. Enslaved people fled to join the Union army, depriving the South of labor and strengthening the North by more than 100,000 soldiers" [^3]. This internal weakness was compounded by the South's lack of industrial infrastructure and a cohesive political strategy.
