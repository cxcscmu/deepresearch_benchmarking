# Factors Determining Organizational Disasters

## Executive Summary
Organizations face a myriad of potential disasters that can disrupt operations and impact business continuity. Understanding the factors that determine these disasters is crucial for effective disaster recovery planning. This report explores the various factors that influence the types of disasters an organization might encounter, including technological, social, environmental, and economic elements. By identifying these factors, organizations can better prepare and mitigate the risks associated with potential disasters.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and resources related to disaster management and contingency planning. Key sources included DisasterRecovery.org, Colors-NewYork.com, and ResearchGate. The search focused on identifying factors that influence disaster occurrence and impact on organizations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Technological and Operational Factors**: Technological failures such as hard drive meltdowns, internet failures, and data line disruptions are common risks for organizations. Operational factors, including inadequate internal controls and lack of cross-training, can exacerbate these risks. "Risk mitigation efforts influence contingency planning by reducing the chance that an event or issue will occur and by reducing negative effects if the event or issue does take place" [^1].

2. **Environmental and Natural Factors**: Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and epidemics pose significant threats. Environmental degradation, such as deforestation and poor urban planning, can increase vulnerability to these events. "Environmental degradation... can remove the ability of rainfall absorption into the soil and aquifer causing larger volumes of surface runoff after a tropical storm" [^2].

3. **Social and Economic Factors**: Social vulnerabilities, including poverty and population density, can amplify the impact of disasters. Economic factors, such as business interruptions and increased expenses, also play a critical role. "Families with low incomes often live in high-risk areas around cities, because they canâ€™t afford to live in safer (and more expensive) places" [^3].

## Limitations
The report is based on available online resources and may not cover all possible factors influencing organizational disasters. Additionally, the dynamic nature of disasters means that new risks may emerge that are not covered in this report. Further research and continuous monitoring of emerging threats are recommended for comprehensive disaster preparedness.
