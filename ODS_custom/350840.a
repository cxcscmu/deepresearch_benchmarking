# Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices

## Executive Summary

Ethical individuals often find themselves making unethical decisions due to a complex interplay of organizational pressures, personal biases, and systemic issues. Despite having ethics and compliance policies in place, many organizations inadvertently create environments that encourage unethical behavior. This report explores the reasons behind such choices, emphasizing the role of psychological safety, unrealistic performance targets, and leadership examples in shaping ethical behavior.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive review of available literature and articles was conducted using search engines and databases. Key sources included articles from Harvard Business Review, Lighthouse Services, and EVERFI, among others. The search focused on understanding the factors that lead ethical individuals to make unethical decisions, drawing insights from behavioral ethics and organizational studies.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Psychological Safety and Speaking Up**: Many organizations claim to have open-door policies, yet employees often feel unsafe to voice concerns. Elizabeth Morrison from New York University highlights two main challenges: the futility of speaking up and fear of retribution. "If a leader reacts with even the slightest bit of annoyance, they are signaling they donâ€™t really want to hear concerns" [^1].

2. **Pressure to Achieve Unrealistic Goals**: High-pressure environments can lead employees to compromise ethical standards. Lisa Ordonez from the University of Arizona notes, "Goals have a strong effect of causing tunnel vision, narrowly focusing people at the expense of seeing much else around them, including the potential consequences of compromised choices made to reach goals" [^1].

3. **Leadership and Ethical Examples**: The behavior of leaders significantly influences organizational ethics. If leaders set poor examples, it can normalize unethical behavior. "Managers should always be conscious of their actions and how employees view them," as noted by EVERFI [^3]. This highlights the importance of ethical leadership in setting the tone for the entire organization.

4. **Cultural and Personal Factors**: Cultural pressures and personal needs can also drive unethical behavior. According to Lighthouse Services, "The pressure to meet exceedingly high expectations... can cause employees to cut corners or make compromising choices" [^2]. Additionally, personal factors such as financial need or opportunity can lead individuals to rationalize unethical actions.
