# Report: Why Do People Prioritize Physical Appearance Over Mental Health?

## Executive Summary
The question of why individuals often prioritize their physical appearance over mental health is multifaceted, involving societal norms, personal perceptions, and psychological factors. This report explores the reasons behind this phenomenon, drawing from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding. The findings suggest that societal judgments based on physical appearance, the visibility of physical attributes, and a lack of awareness about the importance of mental health contribute to this trend.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online educational platforms, discussion forums, and academic resources. The primary tools included Course Hero, Brainly, and Debate.org, which provided diverse perspectives on the topic. The search focused on extracting direct quotes and insights from these platforms to ensure a well-rounded analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Societal Judgments and First Impressions**: 
   - Many people focus on their physical appearance because it is often the first aspect others notice and judge. "People give more importance to their bodies than their minds. They focus on their physical looks since others judge them based on their physical attributes, not their intellectual capacity" [^1]. This societal pressure to conform to beauty standards can overshadow the importance of mental health.

2. **Visibility and Tangibility of Physical Health**:
   - Physical health is more visible and tangible compared to mental health, making it easier for individuals to focus on. "More people give importance to their body than their mind because the body is more visible than the mind. It is what other people see" [^2]. This visibility often leads to a greater emphasis on maintaining physical appearance.

3. **Lack of Awareness and Understanding of Mental Health**:
   - There is a general lack of awareness about the significance of mental health, which contributes to its neglect. "People tend to think that being healthy is only seen/measured in the body but that is not that. Being healthy includes both your physical which is your body and psychological which is your mind" [^3]. This misconception can lead to an imbalance in how individuals prioritize their health.
