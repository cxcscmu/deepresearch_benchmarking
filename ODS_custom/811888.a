# Reliance on Third-Party Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures

## Executive Summary

The concept of relying on third-party Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedures is a recognized practice in various regulatory frameworks, particularly in the context of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations. This practice, known as "reliance," allows entities to depend on the CDD procedures conducted by other reliable parties, thereby streamlining processes and reducing redundancy. However, this reliance is subject to strict conditions and oversight to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online regulatory resources, institutional guidelines, and industry publications. The primary focus was on understanding the legal frameworks and practical implications of relying on third-party CDD procedures. Key sources included AUSTRAC guidelines, UCSF IRB reliance policies, and industry insights on Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

## Detailed Findings

1. **AUSTRAC Guidelines on Reliance**: According to AUSTRAC, reliance on third-party CDD procedures is permissible under specific conditions. Entities can rely on other reporting entities or AML/CTF-regulated foreign equivalents to complete their own CDD requirements. This can be done through ongoing arrangements or on a case-by-case basis, provided there is a written agreement and reasonable grounds to believe the third party has appropriate AML/CTF systems in place[^1].

2. **Benefits and Risks**: The reliance on third-party CDD can reduce the costs and inconvenience associated with duplicating CDD efforts. However, entities remain responsible for any breaches and must ensure that the third party's procedures meet the required standards. This includes ongoing monitoring and the ability to remediate any identified breaches[^1].

3. **UCSF IRB Reliance Agreements**: In the context of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), reliance agreements allow institutions like UCSF to depend on the review conducted by another IRB. This is particularly useful in multi-site research studies, where duplicating reviews can be inefficient. However, UCSF maintains oversight responsibilities and must ensure compliance with local and federal regulations[^2].

4. **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Considerations**: For high-risk customers, Enhanced Due Diligence procedures are necessary. These procedures involve a more thorough examination of the customer's background and activities. While reliance on third-party CDD is possible, it requires a robust risk assessment and control framework to ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks[^3].
