# The Influence of Social Factors on the Development of Correctional Philosophies

## Executive Summary

Correctional philosophies have evolved significantly over time, influenced by various social, economic, and political factors. These philosophies, which include retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, reflect society's changing attitudes towards crime and punishment. This report explores how specific social factors have shaped these correctional philosophies, highlighting the interplay between societal trends and the evolution of correctional practices.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases, online educational resources, and scholarly articles. The search focused on historical and contemporary perspectives on correctional philosophies, examining how social factors have influenced their development. Key search terms included "correctional philosophies," "social factors in corrections," and "history of punishment."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Retribution and Social Justice**: Retribution as a correctional philosophy is deeply rooted in the idea of justice and moral balance. Historically, it has been influenced by societal demands for fairness and equity. "Retribution is a form of punishment that is sometimes mistaken as revenge but is actually a legitimate punishment philosophy because it has three key elements: formal penal sanction, equity, and just deserts" [^1]. This philosophy reflects a societal desire to ensure that punishment is proportionate to the crime, maintaining social order and moral balance.

2. **Deterrence and Crime Rates**: The philosophy of deterrence has been shaped by societal concerns about crime rates and public safety. During periods of rising crime, there is often increased public pressure for harsher penalties to deter criminal behavior. "Correctional policies have reflected changes in social, political, and economic environments throughout the years. The United States imprisons far more people than other industrialized countries do. One factor for this is that a political environment to get tough on crime developed, which was related to the war on drugs" [^2]. This reflects how societal fears and perceptions of crime can drive policy changes aimed at deterrence.

3. **Rehabilitation and Social Reform**: Rehabilitation has been influenced by social reform movements that emphasize the potential for individuals to change and reintegrate into society. "Rehabilitation is a punishment philosophy based on the belief that the offender can and will change into a law-abiding citizen through treatment programs and facilities" [^3]. This philosophy aligns with broader social trends that prioritize human rights and the potential for personal growth and redemption.
