## Executive Summary
Performance management systems (PMS) are integral to aligning an organization's mission, goals, and objectives with its resources. They serve as a tool for measuring and evaluating employee performance, identifying performance gaps, and facilitating decisions related to promotions, salary increments, and terminations. This report explores how PMS connects with training, development, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the role of performance-based compensation and continuous employee development.
