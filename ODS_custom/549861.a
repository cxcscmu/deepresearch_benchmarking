# Why Do So Many Young People Like Communism?

## Executive Summary

The increasing interest in communism among young people, particularly in the United States, is a multifaceted phenomenon. This trend is often attributed to disillusionment with capitalism, historical amnesia regarding the atrocities committed under communist regimes, and the influence of modern political rhetoric. Surveys indicate that a significant portion of younger generations, such as Millennials and Generation Z, view communism and socialism favorably. This report explores the reasons behind this trend, drawing on various sources and perspectives.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on articles, opinion pieces, and surveys that discuss the attitudes of young people towards communism. Key search terms included "young people communism," "millennials socialism," and "Generation Z communism." The search aimed to gather a diverse range of opinions and data to provide a balanced view of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Disillusionment with Capitalism**: Many young people are turning to communism as a response to perceived failures of capitalism. A political science professor noted, "Capitalism is clearly and undeniably failing. It’s directly responsible for the climate catastrophe and everybody knows it" [^1]. This sentiment is echoed by others who argue that economic inequality and lack of opportunities under capitalism drive interest in alternative systems.

2. **Historical Amnesia**: There is a concern that younger generations are not adequately educated about the historical realities of communism. Marion Smith, Executive Director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, stated, "When we don’t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn’t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas" [^2]. This lack of historical awareness may contribute to a romanticized view of communism.

3. **Influence of Modern Political Rhetoric**: The rhetoric of modern politicians and movements also plays a role. Some argue that political figures and organizations have softened the image of communism by associating it with socialism and social justice. "Republican rhetoric has softened communism by associating socialism with communism, making redistributive political systems more appealing to young people disillusioned with American inequality" [^3].

## Limitations

The findings are based on available online sources and may not capture the full spectrum of opinions and data on the topic. The reliance on surveys and opinion pieces means that the conclusions drawn may be influenced by the biases inherent in these sources. Additionally, the complexity of individual motivations and the diversity within generational cohorts mean that broad generalizations may not apply to all young people. Further research, including qualitative studies and interviews, would provide a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon.
