# Report on How Immigrants Become U.S. Citizens

## Executive Summary
Immigrants can become U.S. citizens through several pathways, primarily through naturalization, marriage, military service, or by having U.S. citizen parents. The process is complex, involving multiple steps and requirements, including residency, language proficiency, and knowledge of U.S. civics. Each pathway has specific criteria and procedures that must be followed to achieve citizenship.

## Methodology
To gather information on how immigrants become U.S. citizens, I utilized a variety of online resources, including educational websites, government publications, and immigration-focused articles. The search was conducted using keywords such as "U.S. citizenship process," "naturalization," and "immigrant pathways to citizenship." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Naturalization Process**: The most common pathway for immigrants to become U.S. citizens is through naturalization. This process requires applicants to be at least 18 years old, have a green card for at least five years (or three years if married to a U.S. citizen), and demonstrate good moral character. Applicants must also pass English and civics tests. "Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted to a foreign citizen or national after he or she fulfills the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)" [^1].

2. **Citizenship Through Marriage**: Immigrants married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship after three years of residency. They must prove the legitimacy of their marriage and meet similar requirements as those applying through naturalization. "If youâ€™re married to a U.S. citizen, you can apply for a green card by submitting Form I-130, Petition for an Alien Relative" [^2].

3. **Military Service**: Serving in the U.S. military can expedite the citizenship process. Those who serve during periods of hostility may apply for naturalization immediately. "U.S. Citizenship can be gained through the military. If you served honorably in the armed forces, you could be eligible to apply for naturalization" [^3].
