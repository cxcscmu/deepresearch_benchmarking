# IPO Underpricing: New Evidence from China's SME Market

## Executive Summary

IPO underpricing is a well-documented phenomenon where the initial public offering (IPO) price is set below the market price, leading to a significant price increase on the first trading day. This report explores the causes of IPO underpricing with a focus on China's Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) market. Recent reforms in China's IPO system, particularly the shift from an approval-based to a registration-based system, have provided new insights into the dynamics of IPO underpricing. Despite expectations that market-oriented reforms would reduce underpricing, evidence suggests that underpricing persists, driven by speculative trading and regulatory influences.

## Methodology

To investigate the causes of IPO underpricing in China's SME market, a comprehensive review of recent academic literature and empirical studies was conducted. The primary source of data was the article "IPO policy and IPO underpricing: Evidence from the registration-based IPO reform in China" from ScienceDirect. Additional insights were gathered from related studies on IPO underpricing theories and empirical evidence from other markets.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Regulatory Influence and Market Reforms**: The transition to a registration-based IPO system in China was expected to mitigate underpricing by reducing regulatory constraints. However, the evidence indicates that underpricing has not only persisted but increased in some cases. "We demonstrate that the market-oriented IPO reform even exacerbates the IPO underpricing" [^1]. This suggests that regulatory changes alone are insufficient to address the underlying causes of underpricing.

2. **Speculative Trading**: The presence of aggressive traders, often referred to as "dare-to-die traders," contributes significantly to IPO underpricing in China. These traders focus on newly listed stocks, driving up prices through speculative activities. "We argue that it may be driven by crazy speculators... the price could be manipulated by such large amounts of hot money in the short run" [^1]. This speculative behavior is a critical factor in the observed underpricing.

3. **Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior**: Theories such as information asymmetry and investor sentiment play a role in IPO underpricing. Uninformed investors may drive up demand for IPOs, leading to higher initial returns. "The information asymmetry theory suggests that investors are not informed about a firm going public... hence the investors are compensated for that risk" [^2]. This compensation for perceived risk contributes to the underpricing phenomenon.

## Limitations

The analysis is primarily based on available literature and empirical studies, which may not capture all market dynamics or recent developments post-2021. The focus on China's SME market may limit the generalizability of findings to other markets or larger enterprises. Additionally, the speculative nature of trading and its impact on underpricing can vary significantly across different market conditions and regulatory environments.
