# Report on the Impact of Abortion on Women's Health

## Executive Summary

The impact of abortion on women's health is a contentious issue with varying perspectives. Some sources argue that abortion poses significant physical and psychological risks to women, while others maintain that it is a safe medical procedure with fewer risks than childbirth. This report synthesizes findings from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential health implications of abortion for women.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including articles from health organizations, opinion pieces, and research studies. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "abortion health risks," "abortion safety," and "psychological effects of abortion." The sources were selected based on their relevance and the diversity of perspectives they offer.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Physical Health Risks**: Some studies suggest that abortion can lead to increased risks of certain health issues. For instance, Dr. Elizabeth Shadigan testified that "abortion increases rates of breast cancer, placenta previa, pre-term births, and maternal suicide" [^1]. Additionally, a meta-analysis indicated that induced abortion is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among Chinese females [^2].

2. **Psychological Health Risks**: There is evidence linking abortion to psychological complications. According to a study, "women who abort are five times more likely to abuse drugs" and experience higher rates of mental health issues such as anxiety and depression [^1]. Another source notes that "women who were denied abortions actually experienced more anxiety and lower self-esteem at the time of abortion denial than those who received their abortion" [^3].

3. **Safety and Comparisons to Childbirth**: Contrasting views highlight that abortion is a medically safe procedure. Dr. Sarah Prager stated, "Abortion is actually significantly safer than carrying a child to term and many other minor procedures" [^4]. The mortality rate associated with legal abortion is significantly lower than that of childbirth, with 0.7 deaths per 100,000 procedures compared to nine deaths per 100,000 deliveries [^4].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of data and the potential biases in the sources. The topic of abortion is highly politicized, which may influence the presentation and interpretation of data. Additionally, the lack of standardized reporting on abortion complications can lead to discrepancies in findings. Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, is needed to provide more definitive conclusions on the long-term health impacts of abortion on women.
