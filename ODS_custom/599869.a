# Reward Systems as Barriers to Integration

## Executive Summary
Reward systems are designed to motivate employees and enhance organizational performance. However, they can also serve as barriers to integration within organizations, particularly when they are not aligned with collaborative goals. This report explores how reward systems can impede integration, drawing on various sources to highlight the complexities involved.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases, organizational behavior textbooks, and online resources. The focus was on identifying literature that discusses the impact of reward systems on organizational integration. Key search terms included "reward systems," "organizational integration," and "barriers to collaboration."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Coordination Challenges**: Reward systems that focus solely on individual performance can create silos within organizations, making it difficult to achieve integration. Kretschmer and Puranam (2008) argue that "ignoring the coordination challenges created by differentiation does not merely impede the achievement of gains from integration through incentives, but can lower organizational performance below the levels achieved when such gains are simply ignored" [^1]. This suggests that reward systems need to be designed with a focus on collaborative efforts to avoid these pitfalls.

2. **Disparities in Reward Distribution**: Inequities in reward distribution can lead to resentment and hinder collaboration. According to OpenStax, "a common reality in many contemporary work organizations is the inequity that exists in the distribution of available rewards" [^2]. When employees perceive that rewards are not fairly distributed, it can create divisions and reduce the willingness to work collaboratively.

3. **Cultural Misalignment**: Reward systems that do not align with the organizational culture can act as barriers to integration. Kerr and Slocum (2005) found that "traditional reward systems typically involve the payment of a base pay to employees that is determined by the job specification, the need to pay a going competitive rate in the job market and the need to maintain equity among employees" [^3]. If these systems do not support the cultural values of collaboration and teamwork, they can undermine efforts to integrate different parts of the organization.

## Limitations
The findings are based on available literature and may not cover all aspects of how reward systems can act as barriers to integration. The research is limited to sources accessible online and may not include the latest empirical studies. Additionally, the impact of reward systems can vary significantly across different organizational contexts, which may not be fully captured in this report.
