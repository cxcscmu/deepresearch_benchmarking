# Report: Why Did Apartheid End in South Africa?

## Executive Summary

Apartheid, the institutionalized system of racial segregation in South Africa, ended in the early 1990s due to a combination of internal resistance, international pressure, economic struggles, and geopolitical changes. The dismantling of apartheid was a complex process influenced by years of activism, economic sanctions, and the end of the Cold War, culminating in the democratic election of Nelson Mandela as South Africa's first black president in 1994.

## Methodology

To gather information on the end of apartheid, I utilized a combination of online resources, including historical articles, government archives, and educational websites. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "end of apartheid," "South Africa 1990s," and "Nelson Mandela." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Internal Resistance and Activism**: The internal resistance against apartheid was a significant factor in its downfall. The African National Congress (ANC) and other groups organized protests, boycotts, and strikes. "Black South Africans resisted apartheid from the very beginning... the African National Congress, or ANC, launched a Defiance Campaign" [^1]. The United Democratic Front (UDF) also played a crucial role in mobilizing mass protests against the regime.

2. **International Pressure and Sanctions**: The international community's response to apartheid included economic sanctions and cultural boycotts. The United States Congress passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in 1986, which imposed significant economic sanctions on South Africa. "The sanctions imposed by the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act... drove many large multinational companies out of South Africa" [^2]. This economic pressure contributed to the weakening of the apartheid regime.

3. **Geopolitical Changes**: The end of the Cold War diminished the strategic importance of South Africa as an anti-communist ally, which had previously justified some Western support for the apartheid regime. "The end of the Cold War rendered this argument obsolete... even the most ardent anti-communists in the United States lost their justification for support of the Apartheid regime" [^3]. This shift in global politics facilitated negotiations for a peaceful transition to democracy.
