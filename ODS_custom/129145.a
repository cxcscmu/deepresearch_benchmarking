# Report on Rising Crude Oil Prices

## Executive Summary

Crude oil prices have been on the rise throughout 2021, reaching levels not seen since 2014. This increase is attributed to a combination of factors including heightened global demand as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, supply constraints due to OPEC+ production cuts, and disruptions caused by natural events. The implications of these rising prices are significant, affecting global economic growth, inflation, and energy markets.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search focused on reputable news outlets, economic research publications, and energy market analyses. Key search terms included "crude oil price rise 2021," "OPEC+ production cuts," and "global oil demand and supply." The information was cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Global Demand and Economic Recovery**: As COVID-19 vaccination rates increased and pandemic restrictions eased, global economic activity surged, leading to a rise in oil demand. "Crude oil prices rose in 2021 as rising COVID-19 vaccination rates, easing of pandemic restrictions and growing economy led to increased global demand for oil faster than the supply of oil" [^1].

2. **Supply Constraints and OPEC+ Cuts**: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) have maintained production cuts to support oil prices. "OPEC and other countries, such as Russia, which coordinate production with OPEC (referred to as OPEC+) announced in December 2020 that they would continue to limit production increases throughout 2021 to support rising crude oil prices" [^2].

3. **Natural Disruptions and Energy Crisis**: Natural events such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and coal shortages in Asia have further strained oil supply. "Hurricanes Ida and Nicholas damaged US oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico... Coal shortages in Asia have seen countries on that continent use more oil than they used to" [^3].
