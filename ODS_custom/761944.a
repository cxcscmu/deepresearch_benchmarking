# Corruption in George Orwell's "Animal Farm"

## Executive Summary

George Orwell's "Animal Farm" is a profound allegorical novella that explores the theme of corruption through the lens of a farm animal rebellion. The story serves as a critique of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent rise of Stalinism, illustrating how power can corrupt even the most idealistic of revolutions. The pigs, who lead the rebellion, gradually become indistinguishable from the oppressive humans they overthrew, highlighting the corrupting influence of power.

## Methodology

To gather insights on the theme of corruption in "Animal Farm," I utilized a combination of online literary analysis platforms and educational resources. The primary tools included eNotes and Bartleby, which offer expert analyses and interpretations of literary works. I searched for specific discussions on corruption within "Animal Farm" to extract relevant information and direct quotes.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Physical Intimidation and Psychological Manipulation**: The pigs, particularly Napoleon, use various methods to maintain control over the other animals. "Power is expressed a number of ways in Animal Farm. Sometimes it is physical intimidation, such as when Napoleon's dogs ran off Snowball. Sometimes it's psychological manipulation, such as when Napoleon suggests that Jones comes back at night" [^1]. This manipulation is a key aspect of the corruption theme, as it shows how those in power can exploit fear to maintain their authority.

2. **Alteration of Ideals**: The initial revolutionary ideals are gradually corrupted as the pigs gain power. "The pigs change a founding revolutionary slogan, 'All animals are equal,' by adding a clause: '...but some are more equal than others'" [^1]. This alteration of the farm's commandments symbolizes the betrayal of the revolution's original goals and the emergence of a new oppressive regime.

3. **Resemblance to Human Oppressors**: As the pigs consolidate power, they begin to adopt human traits and behaviors, further illustrating their corruption. "The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which" [^2]. This transformation underscores the theme that those who seek power often become indistinguishable from the oppressors they replace.
