# Executive Summary

The American Civil War, initially fought to preserve the Union, evolved into a war to end slavery due to strategic, political, and moral shifts. President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was a pivotal moment that redefined the war's objectives. Initially, Lincoln's primary goal was to maintain the Union, even if it meant tolerating slavery. However, as the war progressed, the abolition of slavery became intertwined with the Union's preservation, transforming the conflict into a moral crusade against slavery.

# Methodology

To address the query, I utilized a combination of online educational resources, historical analysis articles, and expert commentary. The search strategy involved identifying credible sources that discuss the transformation of the Civil War's objectives, focusing on Lincoln's policies and the broader socio-political context. Tools like Google Scholar and educational websites such as eNotes and AP Study Notes were instrumental in gathering relevant information.

# Detailed Findings

1. **Lincoln's Initial Stance**: At the outset of the Civil War, President Lincoln was primarily focused on preserving the Union. He stated, "If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it" [^1]. This highlights his initial willingness to tolerate slavery if it meant keeping the Union intact.

2. **Shift in War Aims**: The issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 marked a significant shift. Lincoln realized that ending slavery could weaken the Confederacy and bolster the Union's moral and political standing. The Proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate states would be free, thus aligning the war with the abolitionist cause [^2].

3. **Strategic and Moral Considerations**: The transformation of the war's aims was also driven by strategic needs. By making the war about ending slavery, Lincoln hoped to prevent European powers from supporting the Confederacy and to encourage African Americans to join the Union army. This strategic shift was coupled with a growing moral imperative to align the war with the ideals of freedom and equality [^3].

# Limitations

The analysis is based on secondary sources and interpretations of historical events, which may introduce biases or differing perspectives. The lack of primary source documents limits the ability to verify the authenticity of some claims. Additionally, the complexity of historical motivations and the evolving nature of political strategies during the Civil War mean that interpretations can vary significantly among historians.
