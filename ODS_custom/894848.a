# Viking Attacks: Responses from England and East Francia

## Executive Summary

The Viking invasions during the 8th to 11th centuries posed significant challenges to European territories, including England and East Francia. Both regions developed distinct strategies to counter these incursions. England, under leaders like Alfred the Great, engaged in military confrontations and negotiated treaties, while East Francia, under rulers like Charles the Simple, opted for strategic settlements and alliances with Viking leaders. These responses were shaped by the need to protect territories, maintain political stability, and integrate Viking settlers into existing societal structures.

## Methodology

To gather information on how England and East Francia responded to Viking attacks, I utilized a combination of academic databases, historical websites, and educational resources. The search focused on primary and secondary sources detailing the historical context and specific actions taken by these regions. Tools like Google Scholar and educational platforms such as Course Hero and Brainly were instrumental in compiling relevant data.

## Detailed Findings

1. **England's Military and Diplomatic Strategies:**
   - Alfred the Great of England played a pivotal role in defending against Viking invasions. After a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington in 878, he negotiated the Treaty of Wedmore, which established the Danelaw, a region governed by Danish law in northern England[^1]. This treaty allowed for a temporary peace and the conversion of the Viking leader Guthrum to Christianity.
   - The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle notes that Alfred's victory at Edington was crucial in preserving Wessex's independence and led to the unification of the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms[^2].

2. **East Francia's Settlement Approach:**
   - In East Francia, King Charles the Simple adopted a different strategy by allowing Vikings to settle in northern France. In 911, he granted land to the Viking leader Rollo, who agreed to recognize Charles as his overlord. This agreement, known as the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, marked the beginning of the region known as Normandy[^3].
   - This settlement strategy was partly a response to the inability of Frankish rulers to prevent Viking raids through military means alone, leading to a pragmatic approach of integrating Vikings into the feudal system[^4].

3. **Long-term Impacts and Integration:**
   - The establishment of the Danelaw in England and Normandy in France facilitated the integration of Viking settlers into local societies. Over time, these regions saw a blending of cultures, laws, and languages, which influenced the development of medieval European societies[^5].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may contain interpretations or biases of historical events. Additionally, the availability of detailed primary sources from the Viking era is limited, which can affect the comprehensiveness of the analysis. Furthermore, the historical context and motivations behind the responses of England and East Francia are complex and may not be fully captured in a brief report.
