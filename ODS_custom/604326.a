# Report: Why Are People Against Abortions?

## Executive Summary

The debate over abortion is one of the most contentious issues in contemporary society, with strong arguments presented by both pro-life and pro-choice advocates. Those against abortion, often termed pro-life, argue from moral, ethical, religious, and legal perspectives. They believe that life begins at conception, and thus, abortion is equivalent to murder. This report explores the reasons why many people oppose abortion, drawing on various sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the arguments against it.

## Methodology

To gather information for this report, I utilized a combination of online search strategies, including keyword searches on Google and academic databases. The search terms included "reasons against abortion," "pro-life arguments," and "abortion opposition." I reviewed articles, essays, and opinion pieces from reputable websites and academic sources to ensure a balanced representation of viewpoints.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: Many people oppose abortion on the grounds that it is morally and ethically wrong to terminate a potential human life. They argue that life begins at conception, and thus, abortion is akin to murder. As one source notes, "If a child is a child from the moment of conception, then aborting him or her would mean it is murder" [^1].

2. **Religious Beliefs**: Religious convictions play a significant role in the opposition to abortion. Many religious groups believe that life is sacred from the moment of conception and that only a higher power has the right to end it. "Many religious authorities have followed a fundamental view of the rights of the child. As soon as the egg is fertilised, it is fulfilling its potential to become a human being and should be protected as one" [^2].

3. **Legal and Human Rights Arguments**: Some opponents of abortion argue from a legal standpoint, suggesting that the fetus has a right to life that should be protected by law. They often cite historical legal precedents and human rights frameworks to support their stance. "The pro-life proponents claim that the fetus has the right to life. This is based on the idea that regardless of age, religion, gender, or race, all human beings have the right to life" [^3].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of sources and the potential bias inherent in opinion pieces and essays. The complexity of the abortion debate means that not all perspectives can be fully captured in a brief report. Additionally, the data is current up to October 2023, and new developments in the legal and social landscape may influence future arguments and positions on abortion.
