# Report on the Evolution of Racism Over Time

## Executive Summary

Racism has been a persistent issue throughout history, evolving in its manifestations and societal impact. While overt forms of racism, such as segregation and explicit discrimination, have decreased over the years, more subtle and systemic forms of racism continue to persist. This report explores how racism has changed from the early 1900s to the present day, highlighting both progress and ongoing challenges.

## Methodology

To gather information on the evolution of racism, a variety of online resources were consulted, including academic essays, opinion pieces, and historical analyses. Key search terms included "racism changes over time," "modern racism," and "historical racism." Tools such as Google Scholar and general web searches were employed to find relevant articles and essays.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Changes**: In the early 1900s, racism was characterized by explicit segregation and discrimination, particularly against African Americans. "In the early 1900s, African-Americans were treated differently because of the color of their skin. Segregation was really big at the time when it came to the rights that the blacks had compared to the whites" [^1]. Over time, legal changes such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have reduced overt discrimination, but systemic issues remain.

2. **Modern Racism**: Racism today is often more subtle and systemic, manifesting in ways that are less overt but equally damaging. "Modern racism reveals itself at opportune moments, is more oblique than confrontational, and often leads to a conflict in our own personal values" [^2]. This includes practices like racial profiling and disparities in the criminal justice system.

3. **Perception and Reality**: Despite progress, perceptions of racism vary widely. Some believe that significant progress has been made, citing examples like the election of a Black president, while others argue that these changes are superficial. "There is a popular perception of the US as a highly racist country when in reality it isn't. That we have a race problem is absolutely and without question true but it's not as bad as the problem is in many, maybe most, other countries" [^3].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of sources and the subjective nature of perceptions regarding racism. The complexity of racism as a social issue means that it is difficult to capture all nuances in a single report. Additionally, the reliance on online sources may not fully represent the breadth of academic research on the topic. Further research, including empirical studies and historical data analysis, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the changes in racism over time.
