2. **Criticisms of Dress Codes**:
   - Critics argue that dress codes can be sexist and disproportionately target female students, often focusing on modesty and perpetuating gender stereotypes [^4].

   - There is a concern that dress codes do not prepare students for the real world, where adaptability and personal choice in attire are often valued over conformity [^6].

3. **Cultural and Social Implications**:
   - Dress codes can diminish cultural diversity by enforcing a standard that may not align with all students' backgrounds. This can lead to a lack of appreciation for cultural differences [^7].
