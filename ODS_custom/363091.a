# Vietnam War: Causes and Origins

## Executive Summary
The Vietnam War, a protracted conflict from 1955 to 1975, was primarily rooted in the geopolitical tensions of the Cold War. The war was a manifestation of the ideological struggle between communism and democracy, with the United States aiming to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. The conflict was further fueled by historical colonial tensions, the rise of nationalist movements, and the strategic interests of global superpowers.

## Methodology
To gather information on the causes of the Vietnam War, I utilized a combination of online resources, including historical websites and educational platforms. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Vietnam War causes," "Vietnam War origins," and "Cold War Vietnam." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Cold War Context and Containment Policy**: The Vietnam War was significantly influenced by the U.S. policy of containment during the Cold War. This policy aimed to prevent the spread of communism globally. "In short, the Vietnam War started as a result of the U.S.â€™s strategy of containment during the Cold War, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism throughout the world" [^1].

2. **Domino Theory**: The U.S. involvement was also driven by the Domino Theory, which suggested that the fall of one Southeast Asian country to communism would lead to the fall of its neighbors. "Kennedy believed that if communism thrived in one Southeast Asian country, the rest would be compromised and communism would spread uncontrollably" [^2].

3. **Historical and Colonial Context**: The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the colonial history of Vietnam under French rule and the subsequent rise of nationalist movements. "The Vietnam War had its beginnings at the end of World War II. The outbreak of the war began when a French colony named Indochina, which included Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, was invaded by the Japanese during World War II" [^3].

## Limitations
The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may present varying interpretations of historical events. Additionally, the complexity of the Vietnam War's causes means that not all factors could be exhaustively covered in this brief report. Further research into primary sources and scholarly articles would provide a more nuanced understanding of the war's origins.
