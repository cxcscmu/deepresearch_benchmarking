# Report: Reasons for Overturning Roe v. Wade

## Executive Summary
The debate over Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide, remains a contentious issue in American society. Various groups and individuals advocate for its overturning, citing reasons ranging from constitutional interpretations to moral and societal implications. This report explores the primary arguments presented by those who support overturning Roe v. Wade.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive review of opinion pieces, legal analyses, and public statements from various sources was conducted. The search focused on identifying recurring themes and arguments presented by those advocating for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Sources included opinion articles, legal commentaries, and statements from public figures and organizations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Constitutional Arguments**: Critics argue that Roe v. Wade lacks a solid constitutional foundation. As noted by Robert P. George and Christopher Kaczor, "Most jurists and constitutional scholars recognize that the decision lacked any basis in the text, logic, structure or original understanding of the Constitution" [^1]. This perspective suggests that the decision was more an imposition of judicial will than a legitimate interpretation of constitutional rights.

2. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: Many opponents of Roe v. Wade view abortion as a moral travesty. Jerry Newcombe highlights this by stating, "Abortion kills millions of unborn babies. Sixty million American lives have been snuffed out since 'Roe.' What a moral travesty" [^2]. This argument is often rooted in religious and ethical beliefs about the sanctity of life.

3. **Impact on Women and Society**: Some argue that Roe v. Wade has had negative societal impacts, particularly on women. Dave Andrusko cites the opinion that Roe "pitted mothers against their unborn children," creating an "untenable, unworkable, and utterly undesirable" situation [^3]. This perspective suggests that the decision has distorted societal values and women's roles.
