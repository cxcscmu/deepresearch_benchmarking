# Climate Change: Causes and Impacts

## Executive Summary

Climate change is a significant alteration in global or regional climate patterns, primarily attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. The phenomenon is characterized by rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of these changes. The impacts of climate change are profound, affecting ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide.

## Methodology

To gather information on why the climate is changing, I utilized a combination of academic databases, reputable websites, and scientific reports. Key sources included ResearchGate, Wikipedia, and various governmental and non-governmental organizations focused on climate science. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "climate change causes," "greenhouse gases," and "global warming."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The primary cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. "All the weather statistics and meteorological data showed that Greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide, methane are increasing day by day on the atmosphere. That is why the earth is getting more hotter than usual temperatures" [^1].

2. **Fossil Fuels and Deforestation**: Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy and deforestation, significantly contribute to the rise in greenhouse gases. "Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Certain agricultural practices, industrial processes, and forest loss are additional sources" [^2].

3. **Impact on Natural Systems**: The consequences of climate change are evident in the natural world, with increased temperatures leading to the melting of ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. "Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss" [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not capture the latest scientific findings. Additionally, while the sources used are reputable, the complexity of climate systems means that some nuances may not be fully addressed. Further research, particularly peer-reviewed studies, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ongoing changes in the climate.
