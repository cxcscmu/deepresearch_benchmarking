## Detailed Findings

### Pros of Paying College Athletes

1. **Financial Relief and Focus on Academics**: Paying college athletes could alleviate financial burdens, allowing them to focus more on their studies and sports. "Paying college athletes for their participation in sports eliminates the need for them to find outside employment to support themselves" [^1].

2. **Reduction of Corruption**: Compensating athletes could reduce the prevalence of under-the-table deals and corruption in college sports. "If college players are well compensated, however, light could be shed on shady businesses that happen on the sidelines" [^2].

3. **Attracting and Retaining Talent**: Offering financial incentives could attract more talented athletes to college programs and encourage them to complete their degrees. "If these athletes could be paid while they are attending a college program, then they would be more likely to stick with the program to eventually earn their degree" [^1].

### Cons of Paying College Athletes

1. **Blurring the Line Between Amateur and Professional Sports**: Paying athletes could erode the distinction between amateur and professional sports, potentially impacting the educational focus of college athletics. "The reason why student athletes are not currently paid, according to the NCAA, is that it would eliminate the separation between amateurism and professionalism in sports" [^1].

2. **Financial Burden on Smaller Schools**: Smaller institutions may struggle to afford paying athletes, leading to potential cuts in other programs. "If they had to pay their athletes, they might be forced to cut back on other things, such as their staffâ€™s salaries and their funds for infrastructure improvement" [^3].

3. **Potential for Unfair Compensation**: Determining fair compensation across different sports and genders could be challenging, leading to perceptions of inequality. "If the players are paid based on the amount of revenue that they bring in, some players may not receive nearly as much compensation as others" [^4].
