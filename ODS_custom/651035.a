# Criminal Minds: Why the Series Ended

## Executive Summary

"Criminal Minds," a popular crime drama series, concluded its 15-season run on February 19, 2020. The decision to end the series was influenced by a combination of factors, including declining ratings, network strategy shifts, and the natural progression of the show's narrative. Despite its end, the series finale was well-received, providing closure to long-standing character arcs and celebrating the show's legacy.

## Methodology

To gather information on why "Criminal Minds" ended, I utilized a combination of online search strategies, including keyword searches like "Criminal Minds series finale reasons" and "why Criminal Minds ended." I accessed various entertainment news websites and articles to compile a comprehensive understanding of the factors leading to the show's conclusion.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Network Strategy and Ratings**: CBS's decision to end "Criminal Minds" was partly due to a shift in network strategy and declining ratings. "Criminal Minds" was no longer fitting into CBS's vision for future programming, as the network was moving away from long-running series to make room for new content. "Criminal Minds' most recent numbers are nowhere near its highest levels. In the 2018-19 season, it placed just outside the top 40 most-watched shows on broadcast TV" [^1].

2. **Production Costs and Cast Changes**: The increasing production costs and frequent cast changes also contributed to the decision. As shows age, production costs rise, especially with long-standing cast members negotiating higher salaries. "The longer a show sticks around, the more expensive it is to produce. Actors can earn more money each time they re-negotiate their contracts" [^2].

3. **Creative Closure**: The creators wanted to provide a satisfying conclusion to the series. The final season was designed to tie up loose ends and give characters a proper send-off. "The makers originally wanted season 14 to be the last and focused on building a proper ending for it. They later decided that it would make more sense to have another season but with fewer episodes to give the show a justified ending" [^3].
