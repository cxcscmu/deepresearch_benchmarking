# Centers of Excellence: Why They Fail

## Executive Summary

Centers of Excellence (CoEs) are established within organizations to centralize expertise, standardize best practices, and drive innovation. Despite their potential benefits, many CoEs fail to achieve their objectives due to various challenges. This report explores the reasons behind the failure of CoEs, drawing insights from multiple sources.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and resources, including industry reports, academic articles, and expert opinions. The search focused on identifying common pitfalls and challenges associated with the implementation and operation of CoEs.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Lack of Clear Objectives and Strategy**: Many CoEs fail because they lack a well-defined strategy and clear objectives. Without a strategic vision, CoEs struggle to align their activities with organizational goals. "The crucial part of creating success is to define the strategy and vision of the CoE. Without a clear strategy and a vision, it’s unlikely the CoE will improve the business" [^1].

2. **Insufficient Executive Support**: Executive buy-in is critical for the success of a CoE. Without strong support from top management, CoEs often lack the necessary resources and authority to implement changes. "To function well, COEs first need buy-in from the top to get them planned and implemented" [^2].

3. **Inadequate Resource Allocation**: CoEs often fail due to insufficient funding and staffing. Many are staffed by individuals who already have full-time responsibilities elsewhere, leading to limited bandwidth and engagement. "High expectations combined with limited bandwidth is a recipe for disappointment" [^3].

4. **Resistance to Change**: Organizational resistance to change can hinder the effectiveness of CoEs. Employees may be reluctant to adopt new practices or technologies, especially if they perceive them as threats to their current roles. "Complacency: This comes from the 'if it’s not broken, don’t try to fix it' attitude" [^4].

5. **Poor Governance and Oversight**: Effective governance is essential for CoEs to maintain focus and accountability. Without proper oversight, CoEs can become disorganized and lose sight of their objectives. "A consistency and governance plan are other key features of an effective COE" [^2].
