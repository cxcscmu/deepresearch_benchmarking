# Global Warming: Causes and Mechanisms

## Executive Summary

Global warming refers to the ongoing rise in global average temperatures, primarily due to human activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This phenomenon is largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes that release carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), among other gases. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. The consequences of global warming include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and human societies.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including educational websites, scientific articles, and encyclopedic entries. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "global warming causes," "greenhouse effect," and "climate change mechanisms." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Greenhouse Effect**: Global warming occurs when greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. "The energy from the Sun is absorbed by the Earthâ€™s surface and then radiated back into space. However, some of this energy is then absorbed by gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor" [^1]. This process is essential for maintaining life-supporting temperatures on Earth but has been intensified by human activities.

2. **Human Activities**: The primary contributors to increased greenhouse gases are human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. "Global warming is mostly because of people burning things, like gasoline for cars and natural gas to keep houses warm" [^2]. These activities release significant amounts of CO2 and CH4, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect.

3. **Historical Context and Projections**: Since the Industrial Revolution, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased significantly. "Before the Industrial Revolution, levels of carbon dioxide were around 280 parts per million. In 2010, the level was measured at 380 parts per million" [^1]. This increase correlates with a rise in global temperatures, with projections indicating further warming if current trends continue.

## Limitations

The report is based on available online resources and may not cover all aspects of global warming comprehensively. Some sources may not be peer-reviewed, and the information is subject to updates as new scientific data becomes available. Additionally, the complexity of climate systems means that some mechanisms and feedback loops are still not fully understood.
