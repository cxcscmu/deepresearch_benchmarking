# Racial Discrimination Faced by Black Veterans at the VA

## Executive Summary

Black veterans have long reported facing racial discrimination within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This issue has been highlighted by various advocacy groups and has led to legal actions and legislative measures aimed at addressing these disparities. Reports indicate that Black veterans receive disability compensation at lower rates, face barriers to advancement within the VA, and encounter systemic racism in accessing benefits and services. Recent legislative efforts and investigations aim to uncover and address these inequities.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches related to racial discrimination at the VA, Black veterans, and systemic racism. I accessed reputable news sources, advocacy group reports, and government documents to compile a comprehensive overview of the issue.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Legal Actions and Advocacy**: The Black Veterans Project and the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress have sued the VA for failing to provide comprehensive data on racial disparities in disability compensation and healthcare services. Richard Brookshire, co-founder of the Black Veterans Project, stated, "Following a widely known history of long-standing benefit obstruction and anti-black racism and discrimination by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Black Veterans Project seeks to compel transparency and accountability" [^1].

2. **Survey Results and Employee Testimonies**: A survey conducted by the American Federation of Government Employees revealed that nearly 80% of VA employees believe racism is a significant issue within the agency. Nuwanna Franklin, an Army veteran and union representative, noted, "The higher it goes, the whiter it goes," highlighting the lack of representation of Black employees in leadership roles [^2].

3. **Legislative Measures**: In response to these issues, President Joe Biden signed a bill mandating a Government Accountability Office study on racial disparities in VA benefits. The bill aims to "expose the facts to the light of day and allow us to do the necessary work making sure that all of our nation's veterans -- all of them -- are treated with equal dignity," as stated by President Biden [^3].

## Limitations

The findings are based on available reports and statements from advocacy groups and government sources. The ongoing nature of legal actions and investigations means that new information may emerge, potentially altering the current understanding of the issue. Additionally, the data provided by the VA is limited, which constrains a comprehensive analysis of racial disparities in benefits and services.
