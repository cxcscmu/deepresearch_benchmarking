# Euthanasia: Can It Be Justified?

## Executive Summary

Euthanasia, often referred to as "mercy killing" or "physician-assisted suicide," remains a contentious ethical issue worldwide. The debate centers on whether euthanasia can be morally justified, with arguments both for and against its practice. Proponents argue that euthanasia can relieve unbearable suffering and respect individual autonomy, while opponents contend that it undermines the sanctity of life and could lead to a slippery slope of moral decay. This report explores various perspectives on the justification of euthanasia, drawing from philosophical, ethical, and practical viewpoints.

## Methodology

To address the question of whether euthanasia can be justified, a comprehensive review of available literature and online resources was conducted. The search strategy included using keywords such as "euthanasia justification," "moral arguments for euthanasia," and "ethical implications of euthanasia." Sources were selected based on their relevance, credibility, and diversity of perspectives, including academic articles, opinion pieces, and philosophical essays.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Moral and Ethical Justifications**: Proponents of euthanasia argue that it can be morally justified in cases where patients are terminally ill and experiencing unbearable suffering. Aminah Suhail Qureshi notes that "euthanasia is deemed appropriate and justified in cases where patients are terminally ill because they have the right to exercise free will, it ends their prolonged suffering, they die with dignity and it makes scarce medical resources available" [^1]. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and the ethical duty to alleviate suffering.

2. **Concerns About Slippery Slope**: Opponents warn of a slippery slope effect, where legalizing voluntary euthanasia could lead to involuntary euthanasia. Margaret Somerville highlights that "the Netherlands' 30-year experience with euthanasia shows clearly the rapid expansion, in practice, of what is seen as an acceptable justification for euthanasia" [^2]. This expansion raises concerns about potential abuses and the erosion of ethical standards in medical practice.

3. **Philosophical Perspectives**: Philosophical arguments often focus on the balance between individual rights and societal values. Some philosophers argue that euthanasia respects the individual's right to self-determination, while others, like Thomas Aquinas, would likely oppose it on the grounds that it contradicts the natural order and divine will. A Bartleby essay suggests that "denying someone their right to take back control of their life after being handed a debilitating illness, is the actual injustice" [^3].
