## Detailed Findings

1. **Escape to Freedom**: Sojourner Truth escaped from slavery in late 1826 with her infant daughter, Sophia. She left her other children behind because they were not legally freed under the emancipation order until they had served as bound servants into their twenties. Truth later recounted, "I did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right" [^1].

2. **Legal Battle for Her Son**: After her escape, Truth learned that her five-year-old son, Peter, had been illegally sold to an owner in Alabama. With the help of the Van Wagenen family, who had taken her in, she took the issue to court. In 1828, after months of legal proceedings, she won the case, becoming the first black woman to win a lawsuit against a white man [^2].

3. **Religious Transformation and Advocacy**: During her stay with the Van Wagenens, Truth experienced a profound religious conversion, becoming a devout Christian. This spiritual awakening inspired her to adopt the name Sojourner Truth in 1843, reflecting her mission to travel and preach about the abolition of slavery and women's rights. She stated, "The Spirit calls me, and I must go" [^3].
