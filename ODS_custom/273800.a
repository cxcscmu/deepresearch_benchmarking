# Report on the End of Slavery in the United States

## Executive Summary

Slavery in the United States officially ended with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment on December 6, 1865. This amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. The journey to this legal conclusion was marked by significant events, including the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, which declared the freedom of slaves in Confederate states. The end of slavery was a complex process influenced by political, social, and economic factors, culminating in the Civil War and subsequent legislative actions.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including historical websites, academic articles, and encyclopedic entries. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "end of slavery in the US," "Thirteenth Amendment," and "Emancipation Proclamation." Tools like Google Scholar and online databases were employed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Thirteenth Amendment**: The Thirteenth Amendment was crucial in abolishing slavery in the United States. It was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the states on December 6, 1865. The amendment states, "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction" [^1].

2. **Emancipation Proclamation**: President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which declared that all persons held as slaves in the rebellious states "shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free" [^2]. However, this proclamation did not immediately free all slaves but was a significant step towards the abolition of slavery.

3. **Juneteenth**: Despite the Emancipation Proclamation, many slaves in Texas were unaware of their freedom until June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger announced the end of the Civil War and the freedom of slaves in Galveston, Texas. This day is now celebrated as Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the United States [^3].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of online resources and the potential bias in historical interpretations. Some sources may present a particular perspective, and the complexity of historical events means that not all nuances can be captured in a brief report. Additionally, the focus was primarily on the United States, and broader global contexts were not extensively covered.
