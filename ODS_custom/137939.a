# Obesity: When Did It Become a Problem?

## Executive Summary
Obesity has emerged as a significant global health issue over the past few decades. While it is challenging to pinpoint an exact date when obesity became a problem, historical data suggests that the prevalence of obesity began to rise noticeably in the latter half of the 20th century. This report explores the timeline of obesity's emergence as a public health concern, the factors contributing to its rise, and the implications for global health.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive review of online articles and historical data was conducted. Sources included health-focused websites, historical analyses, and epidemiological studies. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "history of obesity," "obesity epidemic," and "obesity timeline." Tools like Google Scholar and online databases were utilized to access relevant articles and studies.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Early Indicators**:
   - Obesity has been observed throughout human history, but it was not until the 20th century that it became common. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized obesity as a global epidemic in 1997, noting that the worldwide prevalence of obesity had nearly tripled since 1975 [^1].
   - In the United States, obesity rates have nearly tripled since the 1960s. In 1962, about 13% of adult Americans were obese, and by 2002, this figure had risen to 33% [^2].

2. **Factors Contributing to the Rise of Obesity**:
   - The introduction of high fructose corn syrup in the 1970s is often cited as a significant factor in the rise of obesity. This type of sugar is sweeter, cheaper, and more stable in acidic foods, leading to its widespread use in processed foods [^3].
   - The 1980s marked a sharp increase in obesity rates in the United States, with the prevalence rising from 13.4% in 1980 to 34.9% by 2011-2012 [^4].

3. **Global Perspective**:
   - Obesity was initially a problem in high-income countries but has since become a global issue. By 2013, an estimated 2.1 billion adults were overweight, with 31% classified as obese [^5].
   - Urbanization and modernization have been linked to rising obesity rates in developing countries, as these changes often lead to decreased physical activity and increased consumption of high-calorie foods [^6].
