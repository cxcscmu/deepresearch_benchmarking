# Gender Pay Gap: Why Women Earn Less Than Men

## Executive Summary

The gender pay gap remains a persistent issue globally, with women earning significantly less than men across various sectors. Despite advancements in education and workforce participation, women face systemic barriers that contribute to this disparity. Key factors include occupational segregation, the motherhood penalty, and inherent biases in workplace practices. This report delves into these factors, providing insights into why women continue to earn less than men.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and reputable news sources. The search focused on articles and studies discussing the gender pay gap, its causes, and potential solutions. Tools such as Google Scholar and news aggregators were utilized to gather diverse perspectives and data.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Occupational Segregation**: Women are often steered towards lower-paying professions, a phenomenon known as occupational segregation. "Economists are increasingly examining the role of 'occupational segregation,' or how women and men are steered toward different occupations" [^1]. This segregation is a significant contributor to the pay gap, as women are underrepresented in high-paying fields like finance and technology.

2. **Motherhood Penalty**: Women experience a significant pay reduction after having children, known as the motherhood penalty. "University of Massachusetts sociology professor Michelle Budig found women's earnings slip 4 percent for each child they have" [^1]. This penalty is compounded by societal expectations that women should prioritize family over career, leading to reduced work hours and career advancement opportunities.

3. **Bias and Discrimination**: Despite similar qualifications and experience, women often earn less than their male counterparts due to biases in hiring and promotion practices. "Even when women pursue the same degree, the same major, the same job, and the same work hours as men, they STILL get paid less" [^3]. This discrimination is often subtle and difficult to prove, yet it significantly impacts women's lifetime earnings.
