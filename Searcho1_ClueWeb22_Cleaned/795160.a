So I have this question: "How did Sojourner Truth escape slavery?" I know that Sojourner Truth was an African American woman who was born into slavery in the late 18th century and became a prominent abolitionist and women's rights activist. But I'm not exactly sure how she managed to escape slavery. I think I need to do some research to find out the details.

First, I should probably look up some basic information about Sojourner Truth's life. I remember that she was born around 1797 in New York State, and that she was enslaved by a family named Isaac Van Wagener. I think his name might be important here because, according to some sources, he promised to free her, but didn't follow through immediately.

Let me try to recall what happened. So, Sojourner Truth was born into slavery, and at some point, she was freed, but I need to find out how that came about. Maybe I should start by searching for information about her early life and her path to freedom.

I should consider that laws regarding slavery varied by state and over time. Since she was enslaved in New York, I should look into when and how slavery was abolished there, as that might relate to her emancipation.

Wait, I think Sojourner Truth actually escaped to freedom rather than being freed by her owner. I seem to recall that she took matters into her own hands. Let me think about that.

From what I remember, Sojourner Truth had children who were also enslaved. One of her children was sold illegally, and that might have been a catalyst for her decision to escape. Yes, that rings
