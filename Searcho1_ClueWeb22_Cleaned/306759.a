Alright, so I need to figure out the short-term and long-term causes of World War I. I don't remember a lot about this off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information. Let me start by understanding what short-term and long-term causes mean in this context.

I think short-term causes are the immediate events or triggers that set off the war, while long-term causes are the underlying tensions and developments that made the war more likely over time. For World War I, which started in 1914, there must have been a buildup of various issues between nations that finally reached a boiling point.

First, I should recall some basic facts about WWI. I know it involved major powers in Europe, divided into the Allies and the Central Powers. The Allies included countries like Britain, France, and Russia, while the Central Powers were Germany, Austria-Hungary, and others. The war was devastating and led to huge losses in lives and resources.

Now, to identify the short-term causes, I need to look at what happened right before the war started that directly led to the fighting. I believe the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary is considered a key short-term cause. Let me confirm that.

Alright, so from the search results, it seems that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is indeed considered a key short-term cause of WWI. It's described as the immediate trigger that set off the chain of events leading to the war. This makes sense because it was an act of violence that escalated tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, leading to declarations of war.

But I also need to consider other short-term causes. Looking at Doc 2, it mentions the Balkan Wars in 1912 as a short-term cause. It seems that the tensions in the Balkans were high, and the wars in that region added to the overall instability in Europe. So, maybe the Balkan Wars could be considered another short-term cause.

Additionally, Doc 1 talks about the political alignment of Europe in 1914, with the complex web of alliances between countries. It mentions that this network of alliances turned a local conflict into a global war. So, perhaps the system of alliances can be seen as a short-term cause, although it might also have elements of a long-term cause.

Now, moving on to long-term causes. I recall that imperialism, nationalism, and militarism are often cited as long-term causes of WWI. Let me see if the search results confirm this.

Doc 1 mentions that the underlying reason for the domino-like progression of declarations of war was the political alignment of Europe in 1914, which was rooted in the ongoing rivalry between Germany and the British Empire over control of the seas and access to colonial markets. This sounds like imperialism was a significant long-term cause.

Furthermore, Doc 4 talks about militarism, nationalism, and alliances as long-term causes. It also mentions industrialization as a long-term factor. So, it seems that these are indeed the key long-term causes.

Let me try to understand each of these long-term causes in more detail.

First, imperialism. This refers to the competition among European powers to build empires by acquiring colonies in other parts of the world. This led to rivalries and tensions, particularly between Germany and Britain, as mentioned in Doc 1. Germany was a latecomer to imperialism and sought to challenge Britain's dominance, which created friction.

Second, nationalism. This is the idea that people who share a common language, culture, or history should have their own nation-state. In the context of WWI, nationalism was a double-edged sword. On one hand, it fostered unity within nations. On the other hand, it led to ethnic tensions and irredentist claims, particularly in the Balkans, where different national groups sought independence or unification.

Third, militarism. This involves the glorification of the military and the buildup of armed forces. Prior to WWI, there was an arms race, especially between Germany and Britain in terms of naval power, and among other European powers in terms of land armies. This militaristic atmosphere contributed to the likelihood of conflict.

Lastly, alliances. The system of alliances divided Europe into two main camps: the Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia) and the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy). These alliances meant that a conflict between two countries could quickly draw in their allies, turning a localized dispute into a broader war.

It's also worth noting that industrialization played a role, as it enabled the mass production of weapons and the mobilization of large armies, making modern warfare possible on an unprecedented scale.

Now, to organize my thoughts, I need to clearly distinguish between short-term and long-term causes.

Short-term causes would include:

1. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: This was the immediate trigger that set off the chain reaction leading to war.

2. The Balkan Wars: These conflicts in the years leading up to WWI increased tensions in the region and destabilized the Balkans, making it a powder keg.

3. The system of alliances: While alliances can be considered a long-term cause due to their development over time, their activation in the summer of 1914 in response to the assassination can be seen as a short-term cause, as they directly led to the widening of the conflict.

Long-term causes would include:

1. Imperialism: The competition for colonies and spheres of influence created rivalries and tensions between European powers over decades.

2. Nationalism: The rise of nationalist movements and sentiments fueled irredentism and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the Balkans, over an extended period.

3. Militarism: The buildup of military forces and the glorification of military power created an environment conducive to war, developed over years.

4. Alliances: The formation of mutual defense pacts over time created a web of obligations that could lead to widespread conflict, as was the case in WWI.

So, in summary, the short-term causes were the specific events and circumstances in the immediate lead-up to the war that triggered the conflict, while the long-term causes were the underlying tensions and developments that made such a conflict more likely over time.

I think this should give me a solid understanding of the causes of WWI. Now, I need to make sure I can articulate this clearly in my answer.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{Short-term causes of WWI included the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Balkan Wars, and the system of alliances that rapidly drew nations into conflict. Long-term causes comprised imperialism, nationalism, militarism, and the intricate web of alliances that exacerbated existing tensions.}} \]
