I'm trying to figure out if the American Dream is still alive for immigrants. Now, the American Dream is this idea that anyone can come to America and, through hard work and determination, achieve success and a better life. It's a pretty powerful concept that has drawn people from all over the world to the United States for centuries. But is it still reality for immigrants today? I need to think about this carefully and see what evidence there is to support or contradict this idea.

First off, I should probably define what the American Dream means in this context. Traditionally, it includes things like homeownership, financial stability, good jobs, education opportunities for children, and the possibility of upward social mobility. So, for immigrants, does coming to America still offer these possibilities?

I know that immigration policies have changed over the years, and lately, there's been a lot of debate about immigration in the U.S. Maybe I should look into how current policies affect immigrants' ability to achieve the American Dream. Perhaps starting with some research on recent immigration policies and their impact would be a good idea.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Is the American Dream still alive for immigrants?" It seems like a pretty big topic, and I need to think carefully about it. First off, I should probably understand what the American Dream is. From what I know, it's this idea that anyone can come to America and, through hard work and determination, achieve success and a better life. It's kind of the reason why so many people have come to the US over the years, right? So, is that still true today?

I think to answer this, I need to look at different aspects of life for immigrants in the US nowadays. Things like job opportunities, education, homeownership, and social mobility. Also, considering the current political climate and immigration policies would be important.

Let me start by thinking about immigration policies. I know that in recent years, there have been a lot of changes and debates around immigration in the US. Maybe I should look into what the current policies are and how they affect immigrants.

Okay, so I've got some search results here about US immigration policies and their impacts. Let's see what I can gather from these documents to answer the question about whether the American Dream is still alive for immigrants.

First, from Doc 1, it seems like there's a lot of focus on immigration policies under the Trump administration and how they've changed things. It mentions deep changes and lasting impacts, which probably affected immigrants' experiences. There's talk about enhanced enforcement, cutting back on humanitarian programs, and increasing vetting for legal immigration. Also, ending DACA is mentioned, which was a program that protected young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. That must have been pretty impactful for a lot of people.

Then, Doc 2 is a primer for state policy makers on US immigration. It provides a general overview of immigration policy, trends in state legislation, and studies on the fiscal and economic impacts of immigrants. It seems like states play a role in how immigrants are integrated into society, beyond just federal policies. So, even if federal policies are tough, some states might be more welcoming and supportive, which could keep the American Dream alive in those areas.

Doc 3 is a student's forum post from a course, discussing how current immigration policy impacts economic, security, and humanitarian policies. It's interesting because it shows how students are thinking about these issues. The post mentions that prior to 9/11, border enforcement was handled differently, with more focus on detecting and arresting illegal aliens at the border. After 9/11, there was a shift towards preventing entry in the first place, which makes sense given the security concerns.

Doc 4 is a research report from the Migration Policy Institute, reviewing policy shifts under Trump in the year since his election. It lists several major actions, like banning nationals from certain countries, reducing refugee admissions, increasing interior enforcement, ending DACA, and取消临时保护身份 for some groups. These are all pretty significant changes that likely made it harder for certain immigrants to come to or stay in the US.

Doc 5 is another research piece from the Migration Policy Institute, focusing on immigration under Trump and how it's a continuation of trends started under Obama. It mentions that Trump has been more active in changing policies, but some of the foundations were laid by previous administrations. It also discusses how the courts, states, and Congress have sometimes resisted or slowed down Trump's immigration agenda.

Lastly, Doc 6 is from Brookings, discussing the state of US immigration policy and suggestions for improvement. It touches on the family
