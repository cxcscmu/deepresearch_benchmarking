Alright, so I need to think about what happens if inflation rises. Inflation is something I've heard about in the news and in economics class, but I'm not entirely sure what it means or how it affects people. Let me start by trying to understand what inflation is.

I think inflation has to do with prices going up over time. So, if inflation is rising, that means things are getting more expensive. But why does that happen? Is it because there's more money printed, or what causes inflation to rise?

Maybe I should look up what inflation is exactly. Let me try to search for it.

Alright, so I've got this question: "What happens if inflation rises?" Okay, first things first, I need to make sure I understand what inflation is. From what I remember, inflation is when the general prices of goods and services go up over time. So, if inflation rises, that means things are getting more expensive. But why does that happen? Is it because there's more money printed, or what causes inflation to rise?

Maybe I should look up what inflation is exactly. Let me try to search for it.
