Alright, so I need to figure out how global warming affects humans. I know that global warming is about the Earth getting warmer, but I'm not exactly sure how that impacts us directly. I think I should start by understanding what global warming is and then see how it connects to human lives.

First things first, global warming is the long-term warming of the planet's climate system due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases trap heat from the sun in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in average global temperatures. I remember that from science class.

Now, how does this affect humans? I think one of the most direct ways is through extreme weather events. I've heard that global warming can lead to more frequent and severe storms, droughts, and heatwaves. For example, hotter temperatures can cause droughts in some areas, which affects agriculture and water supplies. That would definitely impact people's lives, especially farmers and those relying on regular water sources.

Also, rising sea levels are a big concern. As the planet warms, glaciers and ice sheetsets melt, causing sea levels to rise. This can lead to coastal flooding and the displacement of people living in low-lying areas. I think places like Bangladesh or island nations like the Maldives are particularly vulnerable to this.

Another aspect is the impact on biodiversity. Global warming can disrupt ecosystems, leading to the extinction of species and loss of biodiversity. This matters because many ecosystems provide essential services to humans, like pollination, clean air, and water purification. If these systems are disrupted, it could have cascading effects on human well-being.

Health is another area affected by global warming. Warmer temperatures can lead to the spread of diseases carried by insects, like malaria and dengue fever, into new areas. Heatwaves can also be directly harmful to human health, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.

Economically, global warming can have significant impacts. Extreme weather events can damage infrastructure and disrupt economic activities. For example, a powerful hurricane can destroy homes and businesses, leading to costly repairs and lost productivity. Additionally, the costs of adapting to climate change, like building seawalls or developing drought-resistant crops, can be substantial.

I also think about the social and political implicationsets. Climate change can lead to resource scarcity, which may exacerbate conflicts and migrations. For instance, if a region experiences prolonged drought, it could lead to food and water shortages, potentially causing social unrest or even warfare over resources.

It seems like global warming has far-reaching consequences that affect various aspects of human life, from direct health impacts to broader economic and social issues. To get a more comprehensive understanding, maybe I should look up some specific examples or studies that illustrate these effects.

Let me consider conducting a search to find more detailed information. Maybe I can look for reports or articles that summarize the impacts of global warming on humans.

So, from these search results, I can see that global warming affects humans in numerous ways. Health impacts seem to be a major concern, with increases in heat-related illnesses, the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever, and worsening air quality leading to respiratory problems. There are also significant effects on human settlements, particularly coastal areas that are at risk from rising sea levels and more frequent and severe storms. Additionally, global warming can lead to food and water shortages, which can have profound impacts on livelihoods and can even contribute to conflict and migration.

One thing that stands out is the disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, such as the poor, elderly, and those in developing countries. These groups often have fewer resources to adapt to changing conditions and are more directly dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods.

I also noticed that while some argue that milder winters could reduce winter deaths, the Harvard study shows that the increase in summer deaths due to higher temperatures outweighs any potential reduction in winter deaths. This suggests that overall, global warming is likely to increase mortality rates.

Furthermore, there are broader implications and security implicationss at play. The increased frequency of extreme weather events can lead to displacement and migration, which in turn can strain resources and potentially lead to conflict. This was mentioned in the WorldAtlas article with examples from Syria, Somalia, and other regions.

Economically, the costs are substantial. The WHO estimates that at least 160,000 lives have been lost since 1950 due to global warming, and the Global Humanitarian Forum suggests that over 300,000 deaths occur annually, with the global economy losing around $125 billion. These figures are quite staggering and highlight the urgent need for action.

Looking at the IPCC AR5 report, it's clear that the effects of global warming on humans are being taken very seriously by the scientific community. The identification of "Key Risks" across different sectors and regions provides a comprehensive view of the potential impacts. It's also encouraging to see that adaptation strategies are being developed and implemented, although there's a recognition that much more needs to be done.

In terms of solutions, it seems that both mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (adjusting to the inevitable impacts of global warming) are necessary. The IPCC report mentions the importance of integrating climate adaptation actions into existing plans and programs, which makes sense.

I think it's also important to consider individual actions. While large-scale policy changes are crucial, personal choices can collectively make a difference. Things like reducing energy consumption, using public transportation, eating a plant-based diet, and supporting businesses that prioritize sustainability can all help lessen our impact on the environment.

Moreover, raising awareness and educating others about the realities of global warming and its impacts is essential. Misinformation and skepticism still exist, as evidenced by Fred Singer's perspective, but the weight of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that global warming is real, caused by human activities, and having significant negative impacts on human health and well-being.

In summary, global warming affects humans through various channels, including health, settlements, food and water security, economics, and global stability. The effects are already being felt and are projected to worsen if significant action isn't taken to mitigate and adapt to these changes. It's a complex issue that requires concerted effort at all levels of society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Global warming affects humans through increased health risks, such as heat-related illnesses and the spread of diseases; threats to settlements from rising sea levels and extreme weather events; impacts on food and water security; economic losses; and potential increases in conflict and migration.}} \]
