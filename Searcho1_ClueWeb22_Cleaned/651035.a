So I'm trying to figure out why the TV show "Criminal Minds" ended. I was really into it for a while, but I missed the finale or something because I don't remember it ending. So, I need to find out what happened.

First, I should probably check when the show ended and how many seasons there were. I think it ran for a long time, like more than 10 seasons. Maybe around 15? I'm not sure. So, I need to look that up.

Also, I should see if the main cast members left or something. Maybe they decided to move on to other projects. Or perhaps the ratings dropped, and the network decided to cancel it.

Another thing to consider is if there were any controversies or issues behind the scenes that led to the show's end. Sometimes that happens, and it affects the show's continuation.

I should also check if the creators or producers said anything about why they decided to end the series. Maybe there was a specific plan for the storyline to conclude at a certain point.

Additionally, I can look into whether there have been any attempts to revive the show or if there are plans for a movie or something like that.

I think starting with basic facts would be good. So, let's see: what network aired "Criminal Minds"? Was it CBS
