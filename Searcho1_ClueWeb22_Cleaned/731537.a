Alright, I need to figure out how Louis Pasteur changed the world. I don't remember much about him, except that he was a scientist or something. Maybe he invented pasteurization? But I need to know how that impacted the world. Probably in terms of health and medicine. Let me think step by step.

First, I should probably start by understanding who Louis Pasteur was. He was a French biologist, microbiologist, and chemist who lived in the 19th century. I think he made some really important contributions to medicine and science during that time.

One of the things he's famous for is pasteurization, which is a process of heating liquids like milk and wine to kill bacteria and prevent them from spoiling. This must have been a big deal back in the day when people didn't understand germs and diseases as well as we do now. So, by pasteurizing milk and other products, he probably helped reduce sickness from contaminated foods and drinks.

But I feel like there's more to his contributions than just pasteurization. I think he also did work on vaccinations. Yeah, I recall something about him developing vaccines for various diseases. Maybe rabies was one of them. If I remember right, he created a vaccine
