So I've got this question: "Should motorcycles be outlawed on public streets?" Hmm, that's an interesting one. I don't know much about motorcycles, to be honest. I mean, I've seen them on the road, but I haven't really thought much about the pros and cons of them being allowed on public streets. I guess I need to look into this.

First off, I should probably understand what motorcycles are and how they're used. Motorcycles are two-wheeled vehicles powered by engines, right? They're smaller and lighter than cars, which might make them more maneuverable in traffic, but also maybe less stable or safer. I'm not sure about that.

I think I should look up some statistics on motorcycle accidents and compare them to car accidents. Maybe see if riding a motorcycle is more dangerous than driving a car. That could be a factor in whether they should be allowed on public streets.

Let me try to search for some information on motorcycle safety.

Alright, so I've got these search results about motorcycle accidents and their comparison to car accidents. Let me try to make sense of this.

First, it seems like motorcycles are way more dangerous than cars. Like, way more likely to result in death or serious injury. One of the documents says that motorcyclists are 27 times more likely to die in accidents compared to car drivers. That's a huge difference.

I think the main reasons are:

1. Lack of protection: Motorcycles don't have cages, airbags, or seatbelts. So, in an accident, the rider is directly exposed to the impact.

2. Visibility: Motorcycles are smaller and harder for other drivers to see, which can lead to accidents.

3. Stability: With only two wheels, motorcycles are less stable than four-wheeled vehicles.

4. Road hazards: Things like potholes, gravel, or wet roads can be much more dangerous for motorcycles.

Looking at the statistics, in 2019, around 5,000 motorcyclists died in accidents in the US, which is a significant number considering the fewer number of motorcycles on the road compared to cars.

Now, regarding the question of whether motorcycles should be outlawed on public streets, I need to think about this carefully. Banning motorcycles altogether would probably reduce the number of accidents and deaths, but it's not that simple.

First, motorcycles serve important purposes. They're more fuel-efficient, which is good for the environment. They can navigate through traffic more easily, which can be beneficial in congested cities. Also, for some people, motorcycles are a mode of transportation they prefer, and for others, it's a hobby or a way of life.

Moreover, completely banning motorcycles might not be practical or acceptable to many people. It's like banning cars because they cause accidentsâ€”which isn't going to happen.

Instead, perhaps there are better ways to make motorcycle riding safer without banning them altogether. For example:

1. Mandatory helmet laws: Helmets significantly reduce the risk of head injuries and deaths. More states could enforce universal helmet laws.

2. Rider education and training: Requiring riders to complete safety courses before getting a license could reduce accidents caused by inexperienced riders.

3. Improving driver awareness: Educating car drivers about being more cautious around motorcycles could help prevent accidents where drivers fail to see motorcycles.

4. Infrastructure improvements: Designing roads with motorcycle safety in mind, such as better lane marking and reducing common hazard spots.

5. Encouraging safer riding behaviors: Campaigns to discourage drunk riding, speeding, and other risky behaviors.

I think taking these approaches could make a big difference without resorting to banning motorcycles entirely.

Also, looking at the statistics, a significant number of motorcycle accidents involve alcohol. So, cracking down on drunk riding could potentially reduce accidents.

Another point is that older riders seem to be more at risk, possibly due to decreased reflexes or vision. Maybe there should be more stringent requirements for older riders to ensure they're still fit to ride.

But overall, I don't think banning motorcycles is the answer. Instead, focusing on safety measures and education seems more pragmatic and respectful of people's choices to ride motorcycles.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, motorcycles should not be outlawed on public streets. Instead, implementing stricter safety regulations, education, and infrastructure improvements can make motorcycle riding safer.}} \]
