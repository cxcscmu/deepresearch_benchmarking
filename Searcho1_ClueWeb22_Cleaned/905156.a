Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects people. This seems pretty broad, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I should probably understand what climate change is. I know that climate change refers to long-term alterations in statistical distribution of weather patterns over multiple decades or longer. It's mainly caused by human activities, like burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming.

Okay, so climate change leads to global warming, but how does that affect people directly? I think one of the most direct impacts is through extreme weather events. I've heard that climate change can make hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves more frequent and severe. These events can damage homes, disrupt communities, and even cause loss of life. For example, stronger hurricanes can lead to more powerful storms that devastate coastal areas, displacing thousands of people.

Moreover, rising temperatures can have serious health implications
