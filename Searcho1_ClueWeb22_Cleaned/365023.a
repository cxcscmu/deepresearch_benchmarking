Alright, so I need to figure out how World War I changed the political and geographical landscape of Europe. That's a pretty big topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should probably remember when World War I took place. I think it was from 1914 to 1918. So, it was a while back, but its effects were profound.

Now, before WWI, Europe was made up of a bunch of different countries, some of which were empires, like the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. These empires were vast and controlled many territories beyond Europe as well.

After WWI, a lot of these empires fell apart. For instance, the Ottoman Empire basically collapsed, leading to the modern-day Middle East as we know it, with countries like Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and others being carved out of its remains. But since the question is about Europe, I should focus on changes within European borders.

One major change was the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This empire was huge, covering much of Central and Eastern Europe. After the war, it was divided into several independent nations, such as Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and parts went to Italy and Romania. So, that created a whole bunch of new countries where there was once one large empire.

Similarly, the German Empire lost some of its territories. Germany had to give up Alsace-Lorraine to France, and it also lost some of its territories in the east to Poland. So, Germany's borders shrank significantly.

The Russian Empire also saw changes, although Russia's involvement in the war led to the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, which is a bit of a separate story. But as a result of the revolution and the subsequent civil war, the Russian Empire transformed into the Soviet Union, which was a entirely new kind of state with a communist government.

In the Balkans, which were a powder keg that helped ignite WWI, there were significant changes too. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed, which later became Yugoslavia. Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece

Well, maybe I should look up exactly how the borders changed after WWI to get a clearer picture. Maybe doing a search would help.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that the Treaty ofailles was a key document that redrew the map of Europe after World War I. It primarily affected Germany, but also had implications on other Central Powers like Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.

Let me start by focusing on Germany. According to Doc 1, the Treaty of
