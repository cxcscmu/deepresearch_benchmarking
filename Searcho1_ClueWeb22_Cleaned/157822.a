So I need to figure out how Canada got involved in World War II. I know that Canada is a country in North America, and World War II was a global war that started in 1939. I think Canada must have been pulled into the war because of its relationship with Great Britain, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look up some information to confirm my thoughts.

First, I recall that Canada was a member of the British Commonwealth, which means it had a close political and cultural connection to Great Britain. So, when Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Canada probably followed suit. But I need to verify this.

Let me consider the timeline. World War II began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Then, on September 3, 1939, both Britain and France declared war on Germany. I think Canada waited a few days after that to declare war. Maybe they needed time to consider their position or to get parliamentary approval.

I also remember that in World War I, Canada was automatically at war when Britain was at war, due to the British Empire's structure. However, by World War II, Canada had more autonomy in its foreign policy, so perhaps they made a deliberate decision to enter the war.

Maybe I should look into what public opinion was like in Canada at the time. Did Canadians support entering the war, or was there opposition? I suspect that since Canada had fought alongside Britain in World War I, there might have been a sense of obligation or alliance to support Britain again.

Additionally, I should consider the military contributions Canada made during WWII. I know that Canadian forces played significant roles in battles
