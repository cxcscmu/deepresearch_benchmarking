Alright, so I need to figure out how global warming happens. I've heard about it a lot in the news and from teachers, but I'm not exactly sure what causes it. I think it has something to do with the Earth getting warmer, but there must be more to it than that. Maybe I should start by understanding what global warming actually is.

I know that the Earth has a natural greenhouse effect, which is important for life because it keeps the planet warm enough for us to survive. Gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun and keep the Earth's temperature balanced. Without these gases, the Earth would be much colder and less hospitable.

But global warming seems to be about this natural process getting amplified or somehow disrupted. I think it's because there's an increase in these greenhouse gases, which leads to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere than usual. This excess trapped heat causes the overall temperature of the Earth to rise, leading to what we call global warming.

Now, where is this increase in greenhouse gases coming from? I believe a major contributor is human activity. Things like burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. So, as populations have grown and industrialization has spread, the amount of these gases has increased significantly.

Let me see if I can find some specific examples. Burning coal and oil for electricity and transportation releases CO2. Cutting down forests not only reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 but also releases carbon stored in the trees when they are burned or left to decompose. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, produces methane, which is another potent greenhouse gas.

I also remember hearing about feedback loops in relation to global warming. For example, as temperatures rise, permafrost in Arctic regions thaws, releasing even more methane and CO2, which further accelerates warming. It's like a vicious cycle.

Moreover, the oceans absorb a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere, which helps mitigate some of the warming. But this also leads to ocean acidification, which can have harmful effects on marine life. So, there are multiple interconnected issues here.

I should probably look up some data or sources to confirm what I'm thinking. Maybe check when global warming started becoming a significant issue and what the trends in temperature and greenhouse gas levels have been over time.

Let me try to search for some information on this.

Alright, so I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they say about how global warming happens.

From Doc 1, it seems like global warming has been a topic of discussion for a while, with key figures like Svante Arrhenius proposing the idea back in 1896 that burning fossil fuels could lead to global warming due to increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Then, in the mid-20th century, scientists started measuring CO2 levels and observing a rise, which correlated with a warming trend.

Doc 2 provides a more detailed timeline, starting from the early 19th century up to 2017. It shows how our understanding of global warming has evolved over time, with key discoveries about the greenhouse effect, ice ages, and the role of greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane.

Doc 3 and Doc 4 seem to be similar, both offering timelines of significant events and discoveries related to global warming and climate change. They highlight how scientific understanding has progressed, influenced by technological advancements, political events, and environmental observations.

From Doc 5, which is another timeline, I can see overlapping information with the previous docs, but it also includes more recent events up to 2021, such as the Paris Agreement and the increasing awareness of the urgency to act on climate change.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that global warming is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, especially CO2, in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in the planet's average temperature. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the levels of these gases.

Moreover, there are feedback loops that can amplify this effect. For example, as temperatures rise, permafrost thaws, releasing more methane and CO2, which further accelerates warming. Also, the loss of ice in certain regions reduces the Earth's albedo, meaning less sunlight is reflected back into space, leading to more absorption of heat and further warming.

It's interesting to note that there have been periods of skepticism and debate within the scientific community and among the public, but over time, the consensus has solidified around the idea that human-induced global warming is real and poses significant risks.

I should also consider that natural factors can influence the climate, such as solar activity and volcanic eruptions, but according to the overwhelming scientific evidence, the current warming trend is predominantly human-caused.

Given all this, I can confidently say that global warming occurs due to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect by human activities, leading to a sustained rise in global temperatures.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Global warming occurs due to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect by human activities, leading to a sustained rise in global temperatures.}} \]
