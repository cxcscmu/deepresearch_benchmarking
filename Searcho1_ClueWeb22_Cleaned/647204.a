Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects sea levels. I know that climate change is a big topic, and sea levels are rising, but I'm not exactly sure how one causes the other. Maybe I should start by understanding what climate change is and then see how it relates to sea levels.

First off, climate change refers to long-term alterations in statistical distributions of weather patterns over multiple decades or longer. It's primarily driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures, a phenomenon

That's a good start. So, climate change is mainly caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, which in turn trap heat and cause global temperatures to rise. Now, how does this connect to sea levels?

Well, I've heard that as the planet warms, glaciers and ice sheets
