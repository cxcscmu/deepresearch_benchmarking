The leader at that time was Mikhail Gorbachev, who introduced policies like perestroika and glasnost, which were meant to reform the Soviet system but ultimately contributed to its collapse.

So, to start, I should look into the immediate effects on the region, meaning the former Soviet republics, and then look at how it impacted the rest of the world, particularly in terms of politics, economy, and security.
