I'm trying to understand why there are so few women in Congress. This is a complex issue, and I know that there are many factors at play. I need to approach this carefully and consider various perspectives.

First, I should probably look into the current statistics to get a sense of the representation of women in Congress. I think women make up around 25% of the House of Representatives and about 26% of the Senate. While this is an improvement from previous years, it's still far from parity considering that women make up about 51% of the U.S. population.

So, why is this the case? One possible reason is historical discrimination and bias against women in politics. For a long time, women were excluded from political offices, and even after gaining the right to vote and run for office, they faced significant barriers. Societal norms and stereotypes about women's roles may still persist, making it harder for women to enter and succeed in politics.

Another factor could be the lack of encouragement and support for women to run for office. There might be fewer recruitment efforts targeted at women, and they may face more obstacles in fundraising and gaining endorsements compared to their male counterparts.

Additionally, the political system itself may be structured in ways that disadvantage women. For example, the reliance on large campaign donations
