I'm trying to understand why Reaganomics failed. First off, I need to know what Reaganomics is. I think it was the economic policy followed by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look that up.

Alright, so I've read up on Reaganomics and I have a better understanding of what it was. It was essentially a set of economic policies implemented by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, aimed at addressing the economic issues of the time, which included stagflationâ€”a combination of stagnant economic growth and high inflation.

From what I gathered, Reaganomics had four main components:

1. **Reduced government spending on domestic programs:** Reagan sought to cut back on government expenditures in areas like social welfare, education, and job training programs.

2. **Tax cuts for individuals, businesses, and investments:** One of the hallmark features was significant tax reductions, particularly for high-income earners and businesses, with the idea that this would stimulate investment and economic growth.

3. **Increased military spending:** There was a substantial boost in defense spending, partly in response to perceived threats from the Soviet Union.

4. **Deregulation of domestic markets:** Reagan's administration worked to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses, arguing that this would foster innovation and efficiency.

The theoretical underpinning of these policies was supply-side economics, which posits that by reducing taxes and regulations, you can encourage production and supply, which in turn drives economic growth and benefits trickle down to the rest of the population.

Now, the question is whether Reaganomics failed. To answer this, I need to look at the outcomes and assess them against the stated goals.

First, let's consider the economic performance during Reagan's presidency. According to some sources, there was a period of strong economic growth, with the Dow Jones Index increasing significantly and a large number of new jobs being created. Inflation was brought under control, dropping to around 4%, and unemployment fell below 6%.

However, there are also criticisms. Some economists argue that while there was economic growth, it didn't benefit all segments of society equally. There was an increase in income inequality, with the wealthy seeing disproportionate gains. Additionally, the federal deficit and national debt increased substantially during Reagan's terms, which contradicts the goal of reducing the size of government and controlling spending.

Moreover, some of the deregulatory actions are thought to have contributed to financial crises later on, such as the Savings and Loan crisis in the late 1980s and possibly even the 2008 financial crisis.

So, did Reaganomics fail? It depends on how you measure success. If the primary goals were to stimulate economic growth, reduce inflation, and create jobs, then it's hard to argue that it completely failed, as those objectives were largely achieved. However, if you consider the broader impacts, such as increasing inequality and the expansion of the national debt, one might conclude that it had significant drawbacks.

Furthermore, the sustainability of these policies is questioned. The idea that tax cuts for the wealthy would lead to economic benefits trickling down to the rest of the population hasn't been universally supported by subsequent economic data. In fact, some studies suggest that such tax cuts can lead to greater income inequality without necessarily boosting overall economic growth in the long run.

In conclusion, Reaganomics had mixed results. It succeeded in stimulating economic growth and reducing inflation in the short term but faced criticism for increasing inequality and contributing to larger fiscal deficits. Whether it "failed" or not likely depends on one's perspective and priorities in economic policy.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Reaganomics had mixed results, achieving short-term economic growth and reduced inflation but also leading to increased inequality and larger fiscal deficits.}} \]
