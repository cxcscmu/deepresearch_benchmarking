I need to understand why some people oppose abortion. This is a sensitive topic, and it's important to approach it with respect and openness. I should consider various perspectives, including moral, ethical, religious, and personal beliefs.

First, I should define what abortion is. Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy before it can result in a viable infant. It can be induced either electively or medically when continuation of the pregnancy poses risks to the mother's life or health.

Now, to understand opposition to abortion, I need to look into the reasons people might have for being against it. I think one of the main reasons is related to the belief in the sanctity of life. Many people believe that life begins at conception and that aborting a fetus is equivalent to taking a human life, which they consider morally wrong.

Religious beliefs also play a significant role in shaping opinions on abortion. For instance, many Christian denominations, such as Catholics and Evangelicals, oppose abortion based on their interpretation of religious texts
