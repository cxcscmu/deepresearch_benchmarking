Alright, so from this search result, it seems that Jews were systematically persecuted and murdered by the Nazi regime during World War II. This period is known as the Holocaust. The Nazis, under Adolf Hitler, had beliefs in Aryan supremacy and saw Jews as racially inferior and a threat to their vision for Germany.

**Search Result:**

The Holocaust was a genocide in which Nazi Germany, aided by local collaborators, systematically murdered some six million European Jews during World War II (1939â€“1945). Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger policy of oppression and annihilation of various groups deemed inferior by the Nazi regime, including Romani people, Slavs, disabled individuals, homosexuals, political dissidents, and others.

The persecution of Jews began in Germany when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and evolved into state-sponsored genocide in 1941, resulting in the deaths of approximately two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe. The murders were carried out in mass shootings and in gas chambers or crematoria in concentration camps, particularly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, and Sobibor.

In addition to mass killings, Jews were subjected to forced labor, internment in ghettos, and systematic dehumanization through laws and propaganda that stripped them of their rights and dignity.

Before World War II, the Nazis implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies in Germany. After Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, the Nazi government enacted the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which stripped Jews of their German citizenship and prohibited marriage between Jews and Germans. Jews faced widespread discrimination in employment, education, and public life. Many Jews fled Germany as a result of these policies, but those who remained faced increasing persecution.
