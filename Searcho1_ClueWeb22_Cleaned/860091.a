Alright, so I've got this question about whether Trump's tax cuts helped the middle class. Now, I need to think carefully about this because it's a pretty sensitive and political topic. First off, I should probably understand what exactly the Trump tax cuts were. I know that during his presidency, there was a significant tax reform passed in 2017 called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So, maybe I should look into that.

Let me start by trying to understand what changes the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought about. I think it involved lowering corporate tax rates, changing individual income tax rates, and possibly making adjustments to deductions and credits. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, so I should probably look that up.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made a bunch of changes to both individual and corporate taxes. It looks like for individuals, there were changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, and things like that. Also, a lot of these changes are set to expire after 2025, which seems important.

First, I need to understand what the act did specifically for the middle class. Who qualifies as middle class? I think it varies, but generally, it's people who aren't low-income and aren't high-income. Maybe households earning between $40,000 and $100,000 a year or something like that. But I should confirm that.
