I've been asked to look into why adult children become estranged from their parents. This is a sensitive and complex topic, so I need to approach it carefully and ensure that I'm getting accurate and empathetic information.

First, I should understand what estrangement means in this context. Estrangement typically refers to a situation where family members have become emotionally distant or have cut off contact completely. It's not just a temporary falling out; it's often a long-term separationuation.

I think there are probably many reasons why adult children might become estranged from their parents. Maybe there's abuse involved, or perhaps there are unresolved conflicts from the past. It could also be due to differences in values or lifestyle choices. I need to consider a range of possibilities.

Let me start by doing some research to get a better understanding. I'll look for studies or articles that explore the causes of parental estrangement in adulthood.
