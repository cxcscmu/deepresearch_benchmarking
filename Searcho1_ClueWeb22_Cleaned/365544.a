I'm trying to figure out how Simone Biles has handled the pressure that comes with being famous. I know she's an incredible gymnast and has achieved so much in her career, but fame can be really tough, especially for someone in the public eye like her. I need to find some reliable sources to understand how she manages all that attention and pressure.

First, I should probably look into some articles or interviews where she talks about her experiences with fame. Maybe there are documentaries or books that discuss her journey and how she deals with the pressures.

Let me start by searching for something like "Simone Biles coping with fame" or "how Simone Biles handles pressure." I think seeing what experts or people who have worked with her say would be helpful.

Also, it might be interesting to look at her social media presence and see if she shares any insights there about coping mechanisms or her thoughts on fame.

I should be careful to make sure that the sources I'm using are credible and not just tabloids or unreliable websites. I don't want to spread misinformation.

Maybe I can also look into mental health resources or techniques that athletes use to manage pressure and see if Simone has mentioned using any of those methods.

Another angle could be looking at her retirement announcement and the reasons behind it. She's spoken openly about her mental health, so perhaps there's more information there about how she's coping with the pressures of her career.

I should also consider that fame affects different people in different ways, and what works for one person might not work for another. So, it's important to focus on what Simone herself has said about her experiences.

Let me make a plan:

1. Search for articles and interviews where Simone Biles discusses coping with fame.

2. Look for credible sources that provide insights into her mental health and how she manages pressure.

3. Check her social media platforms for any personal reflections or updates on her well-being.

4. Research general strategies athletes use to handle pressure and see if Simone has mentioned using any of them.

5. Consider the impact of her retirement announcement and any statements she's made about her mental health in that context.

Alright, let's begin with the first step.

**Step 1: Search for articles and interviews where Simone Biles discusses coping with fame.**

I'll need to do a search to find relevant articles. Maybe something like "Simone Biles interviews about fame" or "how Simone Biles handles pressure."

I need to avoid sources that seem sensationalist or that don't cite their information properly.

**Step 3: Check her social media platforms for any personal reflections or updates on her well-being.**

Simone Biles is active on social media, so she might share personal thoughts or updates there.

However, I need to be cautious about relying too heavily on social media posts, as they might not provide a complete picture and could be misinterpreted.

Understanding common techniques for managing performance anxiety and public pressure might help me grasp what Simone might be doing to cope.

Perhaps she has talked about using therapy, meditation, or other mindfulness practices.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can find about how Simone Biles copes with the pressures of fame.

First, there's an article from Time Magazine where Serena Williams writes about Simone Biles. It seems like it's part of a list of influential people. Serena mentions that Simone is using her platform to share her personal journey of self-love, respect, and acceptance, and that she's championing mental health. That sounds really relevant to what I'm looking for.

Then, there's a collection of quotes from Simone Biles on BrainyQuote. Some of them might give insights into her mindset and how she handles pressure. For example, she says, "At the end of the day, if I can say I had fun, it was a good day." And another one: "You don't have to be serious all the time to do a good job." These suggest that she tries to maintain a positive attitude and enjoys what she does, which probably helps her cope with pressure.

There's also an article from US Magazine where Simone shares 25 things about herself. It's more personal and might give some clues about her personality and how she deals with fame. For instance, she mentions that she collects turtles as lucky charms, which could indicate that she has little rituals or superstitions that bring her comfort. Also, she likes to watch certain TV shows in her downtime, which might be her way of relaxing and escaping from the pressures of fame.

Another source is from All-American Speakers, which is more of a biography and doesn't provide much detail on how she copes with pressure, but it does mention that she utilizes her platform to advocate for mental health and support initiatives for children and young adults in adoption and foster care. This suggests that she's open about mental health issues and perhaps shares her own experiences in dealing with pressure.

Lastly, there's a page from Famous Birthdays that provides basic information about Simone Biles, including her birthdate, birthplace, and family background. While this doesn't directly address how she copes with fame, understanding her upbringing might provide some context.

Okay, so from these sources, it seems like Simone Biles copes with pressure by maintaining a positive attitude, enjoying her craft, and finding ways to relax and have fun. She also champions mental health, which suggests that she takes care of her wellbeing and likely has strategies in place to manage stress.

But I need more specific information. Maybe I should look for interviews where she discusses her mental health and how she handles the pressures of fame.

Let me try another search.

Okay, so from these search results, I can see that Simone Biles has been very open about her mental health struggles and how she copes with the pressures of fame and her sport.

In the first article from NBC News, she talks about being a voice for the voiceless in championing mental health. This suggests that she's using her platform to raise awareness and reduce stigma around mental health issues, which is a way for her to cope and also help others who may be going through similar struggles.

In the US Magazine article, she shares some honest quotes about her mental health journey. She mentions feeling depressed and struggling to cope after being sexually abused by Larry Nassar. She talks about how she would sleep a lot as a way to escape reality, which indicates that she was using avoidance as a coping mechanism at that time.

However, she also mentions that she eventually started going to therapy and taking medication for her anxiety. She credits therapy for helping her process her emotions and find herself. This shows that seeking professional help is a key part of how she manages her mental health.

In another article from Prevention, she discusses how she initially resisted therapy but eventually came to appreciate it as a safe space to process her emotions. She emphasizes that it's okay to ask for help and that therapy isn't just for people who are "crazy." This normalization of therapy is another way she's coping with the pressures she faces.

Additionally, in the Facebook Watch docuseries "Simone vs Herself," she delves deeper into her experiences with sexual abuse and how it affected her mentally. By sharing her story publicly, she's not only seeking healing but also connecting with others who may have gone through similar traumas.

It's also worth noting that she's involved with online mental health platforms like Cerebral, where she's the Chief Impact Officer. This partnership allows her to continue advocating for mental health and providing resources to those who need them.

Furthermore, in her interactions with the media and in her social media presence, she often shares messages of positivity, self-care, and resilience. For example, she frequently posts about her workouts, her hobbies, and her time with family and friends, which suggests that she finds joy and relaxation in these activities.

Overall, it seems that Simone Biles copes with the pressures of fame and her demanding sport through a combination of professional help, open dialogue about mental health, and engaging in activities that bring her happiness and a sense of control.

She's also using her influence to create positive change and support systems for others, which can be therapeutic for her as well.

I think this is a really admirable approach, and it's important for public figures to share their struggles and coping mechanisms to encourage others to prioritize their mental health.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Simone Biles copes with the pressures of fame through a combination of professional help, open dialogue about mental health, and engaging in activities that bring her happiness and a sense of control.}} \]
