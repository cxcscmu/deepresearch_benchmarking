Alright, so I need to figure out how the Reggio Emilia approach has evolved since it first started. I'm not super familiar with it, but I know it's an educational philosophy, probably for young children. I think it originated in Italy, specifically in the town of Reggio Emilia, after World War II. I should probably start by understanding what the original approach was and then see how it has changed or developed over time.

First things first, I need to do some research on the Reggio Emilia approach. I'll start by searching for key terms like "Reggio Emilia approach origin" or "history of Reggio Emilia education." Maybe I can find some foundational texts
