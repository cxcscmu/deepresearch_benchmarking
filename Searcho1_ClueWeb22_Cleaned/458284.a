Alright, so I need to figure out how clutter affects health. Hmm, I've heard that messiness can be stressful, but I'm not really sure about the具体 ways it impacts health. Maybe I should look up some studies or articles on this topic.

First, I should probably define what clutter is. Clutter seems like an accumulation of stuff, things that are unnecessary or disorganized. So, a cluttered space is one that's messy, with things everywhere, hard to find what you need, that sort of thing.

Now, how does that affect health? I can think of a few ways off the top of my head. First, stress. Living in a messy environment can probably increase stress levels. There's a psychological term for that, maybe "environmental stress" or something like that. I should look into that.

Also, cleanliness—clutter can make it harder to keep things clean, which could lead to more dust, allergens, and possibly even pests. That could affect respiratory health, cause allergies or asthma flare-ups. Yeah, that makes sense.

Moreover, safety might be an issue. Tripping hazards, for example, if there are things lying around on the floor. That could lead to injuries.

And maybe mental health too. Some people might feel embarrassed or ashamed of their living conditions, which could lead to social isolation or depression.

Oh, and productivity. A cluttered workspace can distract you and make it harder to focus on tasks, which could lead to job stress or burnout.

I should probably see what experts say about this. Maybe look for articles from reputable sources like health organizations or psychology journals.

Let me try searching for "how clutter affects health" and see what comes up.

2. **Mental Health:**

   - Increases stress and cortisol levels.
