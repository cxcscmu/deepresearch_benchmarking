Alright, so I need to describe the roles of government bodies that determine fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is basically how a government decides to spend its money, collect taxes, and manage public debt to influence a country's economy. It's different from monetary policy, which is handled by the central bank and involves things like interest rates and money supply.

First off, I need to understand which government bodies are involved in fiscal policy. In most countries, this is typically handled by the executive branch and the legislative branch of the government. Let me think about the United States, since that's the government structure I'm most familiar with.

In the U.S., the executive branch, led by the President, plays a big role in fiscal policy. The President puts forward a budget proposal each year, which outlines how much money should be spent on various government programs and how much in taxes should be collected. This budget proposal is created with the help of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is part of the Executive Office of the President.

But the President doesn't have the final say. The legislative branch, specifically Congress, has to approve the budget. Congress is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. They review the President's budget proposal and make their own decisions about spending and taxation. They do this through a series of appropriations bills that fund different parts of the government.

So, in essence, both the executive and legislative branches have roles in determining fiscal policy. The executive proposes a budget, and the legislature approves it, amends it, or rejects it.

I should also consider other government bodies that might influence fiscal policy. For example, government agencies and departments have experts who provide data and analysis that can inform budget decisions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is an independent agency that audits how the federal government spends money and provides insights into ways to make the budget more efficient.

Moreover, in some countries, there might be treasury departments or finance ministries that play key roles in formulating fiscal policy. For instance, in the UK, the Treasury is responsible for advising the government on economic and financial matters, including fiscal policy.

It's also important to note that during economic downturns or crises, special committees or task forces might be formed to address immediate fiscal needs. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, there were emergency sessions and legislation passed to stabilize the economy through fiscal measures.

Additionally, there are often constraints and guidelines that govern fiscal policy. For example, balanced budget requirements, debt limits, and fiscal responsibility laws can influence how governments make spending and taxation decisions.

I should also consider the role of the Government Accounting Office or similar bodies that ensure transparency and accountability in how public funds are used. These institutions provide oversight to make sure that fiscal policies are implemented as intended and that public money is spent efficiently and effectively.

Furthermore, in federal systems like the U.S., where power is divided between the national government and state or provincial governments, fiscal policy can be influenced at multiple levels. State and local governments have their own budgets and tax policies, which can interact with national fiscal policies.

International factors can also play a role in determining fiscal policy, especially for countries that are members of international organizations or have integrated economies. For example, European Union member states have to comply with EU fiscal rules and guidelines.

Lastly, public opinion and political pressures can significantly influence fiscal policy decisions. Elected officials often have to balance what's economically prudent with what's politically popular, which can lead to compromises in budgetary decisions.

In summary, determining fiscal policy is a complex process involving multiple government bodies, including the executive and legislative branches, various agencies, and sometimes special committees. These bodies work together, often under constraints and influences from both internal and external factors, to decide how to best manage public finances for the health and stability of the economy.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The roles of government bodies in determining fiscal policy include proposing budgets (executive branch), approving and amending budgets (legislative branch), providing data and analysis (government agencies), ensuring transparency and accountability (accounting offices), and complying with legal and international constraints.}}
