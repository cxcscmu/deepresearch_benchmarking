Alright, so I need to figure out how the Civil War began. Now, I know there was a lot going on in the United States before the Civil War, especially regarding slavery and states' rights. But I'm not exactly sure what the immediate trigger was for the war to start. Maybe I should look into some key events leading up to the war.

First off, I remember that slavery was a major issue dividing the North and the South. The Northern states had abolished slavery, while the Southern states depended heavily on it for their economy, especially in agriculture. There were ongoing debates about whether new states should be admitted as free or slave states, and this led to compromises like the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850.

Then there was the Dred Scott decision in 1857, where the Supreme Court ruled that slaves were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts. This decision also invalidated the Missouri Compromise, saying that Congress didn't have the authority to ban slavery in territories. That must have escalated tensions even more.

After that, there was John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859. John Brown was an abolitionist who tried to start a slave uprising by seizing an arsenal, but it didn't go as planned, and he was captured and executed. That event shocked both the North and the South and further divided opinions on slavery.

Now, I think the actual start of the Civil War is marked by the attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. I recall that Fort Sumter was a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston, which was controlled by Confederate forces after South Carolina seceded from the Union. So, perhaps the conflict began when the Confederacy attacked the fort.

But I need to make sure about the sequence of events. Let me see: South Carolina seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860, followed by several other Southern states. On February 4, 1861, delegates from these seceded states met in Montgomery, Alabama, to form the Confederate States of America. Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as President of the United States on March 4, 1861.

Then, on April 12, 1861, Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter, forcing the Union garrison to surrender. This attack is widely recognized as the beginning of the Civil War.

Wait a minute, was there anything else that happened before that? Did any earlier skirmishes or battles
