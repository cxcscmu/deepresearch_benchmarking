I'm trying to understand why it's considered cruel to keep animals in cages. I think it has something to do with their natural behavior and well-being, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some information on this topic.

First, I need to understand what it means for an animal to be kept in a cage. I imagine it's being confined to a small space, unable to move around freely. This seems restrictive compared to how they live in the wild. But I need to consider different types of cages and the reasons animals might be kept in them.

Perhaps I should start by considering the purposes for which animals are caged. For example, zoos keep animals in enclosures for public viewing, research facilities might use cages for experiments, and pets are often kept in cages, like birds or rabbits. Each of these scenarios might have different implications
