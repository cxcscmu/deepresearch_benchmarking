So I have this question: "How did the transatlantic slave trade start?" I need to figure this out, and I can use the search function to help me find information. I should think step by step and make sure I understand what I'm reading.

First, I need to understand what the transatlantic slave trade is. I know it involved the forced migration of Africans to the Americas to work, mostly on plantations. But I don't know exactly how it began. Maybe I should start by searching for the origins of the transatlantic slave trade.
