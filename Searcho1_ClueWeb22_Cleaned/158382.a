I'm trying to understand how the Balfour Declaration contributed to tension between Jews and Arabs. I don't remember much about this topic, so I need to look it up and think through it step by step.

First, I need to recall what the Balfour Declaration is. I think it's a statement from the British government during World War I that supported the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. But I'm not sure about the exact details, so I should look that up.
