So I'm trying to figure out how traveling the world affects life and personality. It seems like a pretty broad topic, but I think it's interesting. I've heard that traveling can be life-changing, but I'm not exactly sure how. Maybe it has something to do with experiencing different cultures, meeting new people, or just getting out of your comfort zone. I need to think this through step by step.

First off, what does it mean to travel the world? Does it mean going to every continent, or just visiting a bunch of different countries? I think for the purpose of this question, it probably just means traveling to various parts of the world, maybe even living abroad for a while. It's not necessarily about covering every corner of the globe
