Alright, so I need to figure out what the importance and significance of art were during the prehistoric period. Okay, first things first, I should probably understand what is meant by "prehistoric period." I know that prehistory refers to the time before written records, so that would be before people started writing things down. That must be a really long time ago, right? Like, starting from when humans first appeared up until the development of writing.

Now, art from that timeâ€”what kind of art are we talking about? I think of cave paintings, like those in Lascaux or Altamira, with images of animals and handprints. There are also sculptures, like the Venus figurines. And maybe some abstract markings or patterns. So, it's not like the art we have today; it's more primitive, but still incredibly fascinating.

But why was art important back then? What did it mean to those early humans? I guess I need to think about the context in which this art was created. Back in prehistoric times, people lived in small communities, often hunter-gatherers. They didn't have the same kind of society we have now, with complex governments and economies. So, the role of art might have been different from what it is today.

Maybe art served a spiritual purpose. A lot of the cave paintings seem to depict animals, and since hunting was crucial for survival, perhaps these paintings were part of rituals to ensure a successful hunt. Like, maybe they believed that by painting the animals, they could capture their spirits or invoke favor from some higher power. That sounds plausible.

Also, art could have been used for storytelling. Before writing, people had to pass on their history and traditions through oral stories and possibly through visual art. So, maybe these paintings told stories about significant events, like migrations or battles
