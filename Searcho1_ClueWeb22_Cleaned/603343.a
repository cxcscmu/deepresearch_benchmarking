Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects hurricanes. I know that climate change is related to global warming and it's caused by increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities like burning fossil fuels. Hurricanes are these big storms that form over warm ocean waters, so maybe there's a connection there.

First, I should probably understand what causes hurricanes to form. I remember that hurricanes need warm ocean water to build up strength. The warmer the water, the more energy there is for the hurricane to feed on. So, if the oceans are getting warmer because of climate change, that might mean hurricanes can become stronger or more frequent.

But I need to be careful here. Correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation. Just because oceans are warmer doesn't automatically mean hurricanes will be worse. I need to look into scientific studies and see what they say about this relationship.

Maybe I should search for something like "climate change and hurricane intensity" or "effect of global warming on hurricanes." Let me try that.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what they say.

First document is from Treehugger.com. It talks about how hurricanes are intensifying and getting stronger because of climate change. It mentions that Category 3, 4, and 5 hurricanes have increased by 8% per decade globally, and in the Atlantic, it's even higher at 49% per decade. That sounds pretty significant. It also says that hurricanes are getting bigger and wetter, which could lead to more flooding.

Next, there's an article from The New York Times. It confirms that there's a consensus among scientists that hurricanes are becoming more powerful due to warmer ocean temperatures. Warmer water provides more energy for storms to feed on, which can lead to higher wind speeds and more rainfall. The article also mentions that slower-moving storms are causing more flooding because they linger over areas for longer periods, dropping more rain.

Then, there's a page from C2ES.org, which is the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. It provides a good overview of how climate change affects hurricanes. It talks about how warmer seas can make hurricanes stronger and how sea-level rise exacerbates coastal flooding during storms. It also mentions that the areas affected by hurricanes might be shifting towards higher latitudes, putting more coastal areas at risk.

Another document is from ScienceBrief.org. It's a detailed review on hurricanes and climate change. It discusses both observed changes and future projections. It confirms that there's evidence of hurricanes becoming more intense and that this is likely due to human-induced climate change. It also mentions that there's uncertainty about whether the total number of hurricanes will increase or decrease, but there's more confidence that the strongest storms will become stronger.

Lastly, there's a page from ClimateSignals.org that specifically discusses the increase in intense cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons due to climate change. It provides real-time data and links to various events and headlines that illustrate these trends.

So, summarizing all this information, it seems clear that climate change is making hurricanes stronger and potentially more destructive. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for hurricanes to feed on, leading to higher wind speeds and more rainfall. Additionally, sea-level rise is making coastal flooding worse during storms. There's also some suggestion that hurricanes might be moving towards higher latitudes, affecting areas that may not be as prepared for them.

However, there's still some uncertainty about whether the total number of hurricanes will increase or decrease. Some models suggest that while there might be fewer overall hurricanes, the ones that do form could be more intense. This is an important point because even if there are fewer storms, the ones that do occur could cause significantly more damage.

It's also interesting to note that there's evidence of hurricanes forming more rapidly and moving more slowly, which can lead to more flooding. These are aspects that could have significant impacts on affected areas.

In conclusion, climate change is likely to continue to make hurricanes more intense and potentially more damaging, and it's crucial for communities to prepare for these changes to minimize the risks to lives and property.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change is making hurricanes stronger and potentially more destructive due to warmer ocean temperatures and sea-level rise, although there is uncertainty about the total number of hurricanes.}} \]
