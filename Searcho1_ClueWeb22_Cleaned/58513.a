As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and analysis on the topic of former lawmakers serving as lobbyists and potential long-term dangers associated with this practice.

First, I need to understand what lobbying is and why former lawmakers might become lobbyists. Lobbying involves advocating for specific interests or causes to influence political decisions, often by communicating with legislators or government officials. Former lawmakers may have valuable insights into the legislative process and relationships with current officials, making them potentially effective lobbyists.

One possible long-term danger is the erosion of public trust in government. If the public perceives that former lawmakers are using their past positions to influence legislation for personal gain or the benefit of special interests, it could lead to decreased confidence in the integrity of the political system.

Another concern is the potential for a revolving door between government service and lobbying, where lawmakers leave office to become lobbyists and may later return to government positions. This cycle could create conflicts of interest and undermine the impartiality of decision-making processes.

Additionally, the influence of lobbyists might skew policy decisions in favor of wealthy individuals or corporations
