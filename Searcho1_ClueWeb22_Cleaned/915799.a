As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide you with information based on scientific consensus and research regarding whether humans cause climate change.

First, I need to understand what climate change is. Climate change refers to long-term alterations in statistical distribution of weather patterns over multiple decades or longer. It can involve changes in average weather conditions, as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events.

Now, the key question is whether human activities are contributing to this climate change. To answer this, I should look into the scientific evidence and reports on the matter.

I recall that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a权威机构 that assesses the science related to climate change. Their reports are comprehensive and represent the consensus of many scientists worldwide. I should check their latest report to see what they say about human influence on climate change.

Let me see... the IPCC released its Sixth Assessment Report in 2021. In their Summary for Policymakers, they state that "It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land." They also mention that "Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe
