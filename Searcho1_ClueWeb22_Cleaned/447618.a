So I've got this question: "Why is it argued that ethical transgression is pervasive in social research?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure where to start with this. I know that social research involves studying human behavior and societies, but I don't recall much about ethics in this context. Maybe I should look into some examples of ethical issues in social research to get a better understanding.

Let me think about this step by step. First, what does "ethical transgression" mean? It probably refers to actions or practices in research that go against established ethical principles. These principles typically include things like informed consent, confidentiality, avoidance of harm to participants, and so on. So, if ethical transgression is pervasive in social research, that would mean that these ethical standards are frequently being violated in studies involving human subjects.

But why would that be the case? Is it because researchers are deliberately ignoring ethics, or is there something about social research that makes ethical issues more common? Maybe it's a bit of both. On one hand, there might be pressure to produce certain results or advance particular agendas, which could lead researchers to cut corners when it comes to ethics. On the other hand, social research often deals with sensitive topics and complex human interactions, which can make it challenging to navigate ethical considerations.

Let me try to find some specific examples to illustrate this point. One famous example that comes to mind is the Stanford prison experiment, where researchers simulated a prison environment and observed the behavior of participants acting as prisoners and guards. That study had severe ethical issues, including psychological distress for the participants, and it was argued that informed consent was not properly obtained. However, that was a long time ago. Are there more recent examples?

Another example is the Facebook emotional contagion study, where researchers manipulated users' news feeds to study emotional responses. This raised concerns about manipulation and lack of informed consent, as users were not explicitly told about the experiment. This seems more contemporary and shows that ethical issues persist in social research.

But why is this pervasive? Is it just a few bad apples, or is there a systemic problem? Maybe it's due to the way research is structured and incentivized. For instance, there's often pressure to publish significant findings to advance one's career, which could lead to cutting ethical corners to get desired results. Additionally, funding bodies might have their own agendas, influencing the types of research that get conducted, potentially at the expense of ethical standards.

Also, perhaps the nature of social research makes ethical transgressions more likely. Since it involves studying people in their natural settings or through sensitive surveys, there might be more opportunities for ethical missteps. For example, issues around privacy, confidentiality, and the potential for causing harm through the research process could be more pronounced in social research compared to other fields.

Moreover, the line between what is ethical and what isn't can be blurry in social research. What one person considers acceptable might be seen as unethical by another. This subjectivity could lead to differing opinions on whether a particular study crosses ethical boundaries.

I should also consider the regulatory aspects. Most institutions have review boards, like IRBs (Institutional Review Boards), that oversee research involving human subjects and ensure that ethical standards are met. But perhaps these boards are not always effective, or researchers find ways to circumvent their oversight.

Maybe there are cultural or institutional factors at play as well. In some research cultures, ethics might not be given as much importance as they should be, or there might be a tolerance for certain ethical transgressions in the name of scientific advancement.

Furthermore, with the rise of big data and digital research methods, new ethical challenges have emerged
