Alright, I need to figure out what the major forms of resistance to slavery were. I don't know a lot about this topic off the top of my head, so I think I should start by doing some research. I'll use the search tool to look up information on resistance to slavery.

First, I need to think about what kinds of resistance there might have been. I know that slaves were often treated very poorly, so I imagine that they would have found ways to resist their enslavement. Maybe they would try to run away, or rebel, or find other ways to assert their humanity despite being enslaved.

I should probably look into different time periods and places where slavery existed, because resistance might have taken different forms depending on the context. For example, slavery in the American South was different from slavery in ancient Rome or in the Caribbean.

Let me start by searching for "major forms of resistance to slavery." That should give me a general overview.

Alright, I've got some information from the search results. Let's see what I can gather about the major forms of resistance to slavery.

From Doc 1, it mentions three types of resistance: slave rebellions, escape, and everyday resistance like working slowly or breaking tools. It seems like slave rebellions were the most drastic but less common, while escape was more common but still had low chances of success, especially in the Deep South. The most common form was everyday resistance, which was subtle and often not perceived as resistance by slave owners.

Doc 2 talks about slaves showing resistance in a few ways, mentioning sabotaging equipment as the most popular form. So, maybe damaging tools or equipment was a common way slaves resisted.

Doc 3 provides a similar view, stating that "day-to-day resistance" was the most common form, including breaking tools, feigning illness, and sabotage. It also mentions running away as another form of resistance.

Doc 4 delves deeper into slave resistance and revolts, discussing various forms of resistance and historical instances of slave revolts. It seems to confirm that while violent rebellions occurred, they were less common due to the risks involved.

Doc 5 mentions that slaves used both covert and overt forms of resistance. Covert resistance includes things like working slowly or breaking tools, while overt resistance includes running away or organizing rebellions.

So, synthesizing this information, it seems like there were several major forms of resistance to slavery:

1. **Everyday or Covert Resistance:** This included subtle actions like working slowly, breaking tools, feigning illness, and other forms of sabotage. These acts were common and allowed slaves to resist without drawing immediate punishment.

2. **Escape:** Running away was another form of resistance, though it was risky. Slaves might attempt to escape to freedom in the North or to other countries where slavery was not practiced.

3. **Rebellions:** More drastic and dangerous, slave rebellions involved organized violence against slave owners and authorities. These were less common due to the high risks involved but had a significant impact when they occurred.

4. **Cultural Resistance:** Maintaining cultural practices, languages, and religions from Africa was another form of resistance, as it helped preserve their identity and heritage despite being enslaved.

5. **Sabotage:** Deliberately damaging property or equipment to disrupt the functioning of the plantation.

Given this, I can conclude that the major forms of resistance to slavery included everyday covert resistance, escape, organized rebellions, cultural preservation, and acts of sabotage.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Everyday resistance, escape, rebellions, cultural preservation, sabotage}} \]
