Alright, I have the search results here. Let me see what I can work with. So, the question is about how "The Charterhouse of Parma" portrays women's roles in society during the 1800s. First things first, I need to understand what the book is about and identify the key female characters.

Looking at Doc 1 from Wikipedia, it gives a brief overview of the book. It's a novel by Stendhal published in 1839, set in the Napoleonic era and later, focusing on the life of Fabrice del Dongo. It seems to be a mix of adventure, politics, and romance. The title refers to a Carthusian monastery, which is only mentioned towards the end.

From the plot summary, there are several women mentioned: Gina Pietranera, the aunt of Fabrice, who is a central figure; Clelia Conti, whom Fabrice loves; Fausta, an opera singer; Marietta, a comic actress; and others. It seems like women play significant roles in the novel, influencing the protagonist's life and the political landscape.

Doc 2 is a summary from SuperSummary. It provides a more detailed overview of the plot and mentions that Gina del Dongo is a political mastermind and the jewel of the Parmesan court. She harbors affection for her nephew, Fabrice, bordering on romantic love, but Fabrice does not reciprocate those feelings. This suggests that Gina is a powerful and independent woman in the court, using her intelligence and relationships to protect her nephew's future.

Doc 3 is from Goodreads, providing reviews and ratings from readers. One review mentions that the novel depicts both the amorous passion and the predilection for court intrigue present in the Italian character, with an ironic and political analysis that is French. This duality might be reflected in the portrayal of women characters, who could be caught between traditional Italian roles and more progressive French influences.

Another review describes the book as a "sprawling, sloppy, often-exhilarating read" with elements of Tom Jones and War and Peace. It suggests that the novel has messy threads that don't resolve neatly, which might indicate that the portrayal of women's roles is complex and not straightforward.

Doc 4 is from Amazon, providing a description of the book and its translations. It mentions that the novel is considered a classic romantic thriller and that it features a blend of intrigue, military episodes, and psychological insights. The description highlights Gina, the Duchess of Sanseverina, and Count Mosca as the true heroes of the novel, suggesting that their characters are central to understanding the political and social dynamics of the time.

Doc 5 is another Amazon listing for a different translation of the book, edited and translated by John Sturrock. The back cover blurb describes the novel as a compelling story of passion and daring, involving political chicanery and personal爱情的追求。它设定在19世纪初的意大利北部，讲述了英俊年轻的贵族法rice del Dongo和他的非凡姑妈Gina的激情冒险经历。这个介绍强调了女性角色在小说中的重要性，特别是Gina，她的魅力和影响力被描述为“无可比拟”。

从这些资料来看，似乎《帕尔马修道院》中对女性角色的刻画是多维度的，她们不仅在个人生活中扮演重要角色，还在政治和社会层面具有影响力。Gina作为一个聪明、有权力的女性，她在宫廷中的地位和她与Mosca的关系表明了女性在当时社会中可能具有的权力和影响力。同时，Clelia Conti作为 Fabrice 的爱人，她的形象可能代表了传统意义上的女性角色，美丽而充满激情，但同时也受到社会规范的约束。

为了更深入地理解女性在19世纪社会中的角色，我需要进一步分析这些女性人物的行为、动机以及她们在小说中的地位。此外，考虑到小说的背景设置在拿破仑时代及其后的意大利，这可能是一个社会变革的时期，女性的角色也可能反映了当时社会的变化和矛盾。

首先，Gina del Dongo，Fabrice的姑妈，是小说中一个非常重要的女性角色。根据SuperSummary的总结，她是Parmesan宫廷的瑰宝，是一个政治阴谋家，与Mosca伯爵有着复杂的关系。她利用自己的智慧和关系来保护侄子的未来，并且对她侄子有着近乎浪漫的感情。这表明，在某种程度上，她是一个超越传统女性角色的人物，她在男性主导的政治世界中发挥着重要作用。

然而，她的行为也受到传统社会规范的限制。例如，她与Mosca的关系是不道德的，但她还是选择了接受他的提议，嫁给一个长期不在家的公爵，以便与Mosca保持关系。这显示了女性在婚姻和爱情方面的有限选择，以及她们如何在社会期望和个人欲望之间做出妥协。

另一方面，Clelia Conti是Fabrice真正的爱人，是一个纯洁而美丽的年轻女子。她与Fabrice的爱情故事充满了悲剧色彩，因为他们的关系是秘密的，而且由于社会地位和道德观念的限制，他们不能公开在一起。Clelia的形象可能代表了传统意义上的理想女性，温柔、忠诚，但同时也承受着巨大的内心痛苦。

此外，还有其他女性角色，如Marietta，一个喜剧演员，是Fabrice的第一个爱人；Fausta，一个易怒的歌剧女歌手，也是Fabrice的情人。这些角色可能代表了不同类型的女性，以及男性主人公与她们的关系，从而反映出当时社会对女性的不同看法和期待。

总的来说，《帕尔马修道院》通过其丰富的女性角色，展现了19世纪女性在家庭、社会和政治领域中的多重角色和复杂处境。Gina作为一个有权力和影响力的女性，挑战了传统的性别角色，而Clelia则代表了更传统的女性形象，受到社会规范的严格限制。通过对这些角色的描绘，小说可能反映了当时社会中关于女性地位的矛盾和变化。
