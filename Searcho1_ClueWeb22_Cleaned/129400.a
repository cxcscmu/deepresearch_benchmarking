So I'm trying to understand why chemical weapons are banned. I mean, there are plenty of other weapons out there that cause a lot of harm, so what makes chemical weapons so different? I guess it has something to do with how they work or maybe how devastating their effects can be. But I'm not really sure. Maybe I should look into some history behind the ban to get a better grasp of this.

First off, what exactly are chemical weapons? From what I recall, they're weapons that use chemicals to cause harm, usually through poisoning or suffocation. Things like mustard gas, nerve agentsâ€”stuff like that. They've been used in wars in the past, and apparently, the international community has decided to prohibit their use. But why? Is it because they're considered inhumane, or is there more to it?

I think it would be helpful to look into the history of chemical weapons and see when and why they were banned. Maybe there was a particular incident or event that led to their prohibition. I remember something about World War I; wasn't that when chemical weapons were first widely used? If I can find out more about that period, maybe I can understand the reasons behind the ban.

Let me try to search for some information on this. Maybe I can find some articles or resources that explain the history and the ethical considerations surrounding chemical weapons.

Alright, so I've got some information here about why chemical weapons are banned. It seems like the history goes way back, even to ancient times. People have been trying to use chemicals to gain an advantage in warfare for a long time, but it really escalated during World War I. That's when chemical weapons were used on a large scale, and it had devastating effects.

From what I'm reading, the first real attempt to ban chemical weapons was back in 1675 with the Strasbourg Agreement between France and the Holy Roman Empire. They agreed not to use poisoned bullets in wars between them. Then, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were more formal international agreements, like the Hague Conventions in 1899 and 1907, which prohibited the use of certain types of chemical weapons.

But despite these agreements, chemical weapons were still used extensively in World War I. It was a big shock to everyone, and after the war, there was a strong push to prevent their use in the future. That led to the Geneva
