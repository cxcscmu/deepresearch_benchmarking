I'm trying to understand why communism is often considered a bad form of government. I need to approach this carefully because it's a complex topic with different perspectives. First, I should probably define what communism is to make sure I understand the basics.

Alright, I've got the definitions of communism from various sources. Let's see what they say.

First, from Oxford Learner's Dictionary: "a theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs. In theory, a communist society has no government and the means of production are owned by the people. In practice, countries that are referred to as ‘communist’, such as the former USSR, usually have a powerful state that controls all aspects of society."

So, in theory, communism sounds pretty ideal—everyone shares, no one owns, equality for all. But in practice, it seems like it leads to a powerful state controlling everything. Hmm, that doesn't sound so great.

Next, from The Free Dictionary: "a theoretical economic system characterized by the collective ownership of property and by the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members." It also mentions "a system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people."

Again, the theory sounds nice, but the practice seems to involve a lot of control by the state and often an authoritarian government. That doesn't align with the idea of equality and freedom.

Then, from Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary: "a theory or system of social organization based on holding all property in common, actual ownership being ascribed to the community or to the state." It also defines it as "a political doctrine or movement based on Marxism and developed by Lenin and others, seeking a violent overthrow of capitalism and the creation of a classless society."

So, communism is not just about economics; it's also a political movement aiming to overthrow capitalism through violence, according to this source.

Collins English Dictionary adds that communism is "the principles and practices of a Communist Party" and "communal living; communalism."

Looking at these definitions, it seems like communism has both an idealistic theoretical side and a practical side that often involves authoritarian control.

Now, to answer why communism is considered a bad form of government, I need to look beyond the definitions and see what problems have arisen in communist states.

I recall that in countries like the USSR, China under Mao, North Korea, and others that claimed to be communist, there were issues with human rights abuses, lack of personal freedoms, economic inefficiencies, and widespread poverty despite the ideals of equality.

Maybe I should look for specific examples or historical contexts to understand this better.
