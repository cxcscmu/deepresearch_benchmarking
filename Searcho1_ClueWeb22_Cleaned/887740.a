Alright, so I need to figure out how the colonists reacted to the Stamp Act. I don't remember a lot about this from history class, so I think I should look it up to get accurate information.

First, I need to understand what the Stamp Act was. I think it was a tax imposed by the British government on the American colonies. Maybe it had something to do with putting a stamp on certain documents or products to show that the tax had been paid. But I'm not sure about the details, so I should probably look that up too.

I think the Stamp Act was passed in 1765, but I'm not entirely sure. If I can confirm the date, that might help me find more information about the reaction of the colonists.

Okay, so let me try to search for "Stamp Act colonial reaction." Maybe that will give me some direct information.

Alright, so I've got some information here about how the colonists reacted to the Stamp Act. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, from Doc 1, it says that the Stamp Act was a tax imposed by the British government on the American colonies, and it required stamps to be placed on certain documents to show that the tax had been paid. It was passed in 1765, and the colonies didn't like it at all.

The colonists were upset because they felt that the British Parliament was taxing them without their consent. They believed that only their own colonial assemblies had the right to impose taxes on them, not a distant Parliament in which they had no representation. That's where the slogan "No taxation without representation" came from.

There were different reactions to the Stamp Act. Some colonists organized protests and boycotts of British goods. There were also instances of violence and intimidation against those who were assigned to enforce the act, like the story about Andrew Oliver and Thomas Hutchinson having their homes attacked.

The Stamp Act Congress was formed, where delegates from nine colonies met to discuss their grievances and assert their rights as British subjects. They produced a document called The Declaration of Rights, which outlined their objections to the Stamp Act and affirmed their belief in certain fundamental rights.

Doc 2 reinforces the idea that the colonists were angry and protested against the Stamp Act. They boycotted British goods, held protests, and even threatened violence against those trying to enforce the act. It was a widespread reaction, with all 13 colonies participating in some form of protest.

Doc 3 is a Quora answer discussing why the colonists reacted so strongly to the Stamp Act. The answer explains that it was because the Stamp Act was a direct tax on the colonists, whereas previous taxes had been indirect, like import duties. The colonists saw this as a violation of their rights as British subjects, who were entitled to be taxed only by their own elected representatives.

Doc 4 provides more detail on the Stamp Act and the colonists' reaction. It mentions Patrick Henry's resolves in the Virginia House of Burgesses, which were similar to the Declaration of Rights later adopted by the Stamp Act Congress. It emphasizes that the colonists were defending what they saw as their traditional rights as Englishmen and that the Stamp Act was seen as a threat to those rights.

Finally 5 is a primary source, a letter from Archibald Hinshelwood to Joshua Mauger in 1765, discussing the reaction to the Stamp Act. Hinshelwood notes that there is a "violent spirit of opposition" to the Stamp Act on the continent, specifically mentioning the mob violence in Boston against Mr. Oliver, who had accepted an office related to the Stamp Act. The letter suggests that the situation in Nova Scotia was different, with less turbulent reactions, but Hinshelwood acknowledges the potential for unrest.

So, overall, the colonists reacted strongly against the Stamp Act because they saw it as an infringement on their rights. They believed that only their own colonial assemblies had the authority to tax them, and they resented being taxed by a British Parliament in which they had no representation. Their reactions ranged from peaceful protests and boycotts to violent acts against those enforcing the act. This resistance ultimately led to the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766, but it also set a precedent for future conflicts between the colonies and Britain leading up to the American Revolution.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The colonists reacted strongly to the Stamp Act because they saw it as a violation of their rights as British subjects, leading to widespread protests, boycotts, and even violence, ultimately forcing the British Parliament to repeal the act.}} \]
