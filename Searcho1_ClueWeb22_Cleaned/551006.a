Alright, so I've been asked to think about how racism has changed over time. This is a really big and complex topic, so I need to approach it carefully. First off, I should probably define what racism is, at least for the purposes of this discussion. Racism, as I understand it, is the belief that inherent differences among racial groups determine individual abilities and merits, often leading to the favoring of one race over others. It's important to note that racism can manifest in various ways, not just through individual beliefs and actions, but also through institutional policies and practices that advantage some races over others.

Now, considering that, I need to think about how racism has evolved over time. I know that racism has been around for a very long time, dating back to ancient civilizations where different groups were treated differently based on their ethnic or racial backgrounds. But in more recent history, especially in the context of Western societies, racism has taken various forms.

Let me start by considering the historical periods. In the past, racism was often overt and legally sanctioned. For example, during the era of slavery in the United States, racial discrimination was embedded in laws that treated African Americans as property, not as human beings with rights. Similarly, in South Africa, apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that lasted until the early 1990s.

So, in these cases, racism was explicit and openly accepted by society. People didn't necessarily see anything wrong with treating certain races differently under the law. But things have changed since then, right? In most countries today, such overt forms of racism are illegal, and there's a general consensus that racial discrimination is wrong.

But does that mean racism has disappeared? Clearly not. It seems to have transformed into different forms. One way to look at it is that racism has become more subtle and less visible. It's now more about implicit biases and systemic inequalities that aren't always obvious at first glance.

For instance, in employment, housing, education, and the criminal justice system, there are often disparities that affect minority groups disproportionately, even if there aren't explicit laws mandating discrimination. These are examples of structural or institutional racism, where systems and institutions perpetuate inequality, often without malicious intent but due to biased policies or practices.

Another way racism has changed is through the way it's expressed in society. While overtly racist
