Alright, I need to figure out how East Francia and England responded to Viking attacks. I don't remember much about this period, so I'll need to do some research. Let me start by understanding who these players are.

First, East Francia. I think Francia was an early medieval kingdom that included parts of modern France, Germany, and Italy. After the division of the Carolingian Empire, it split into West Francia and East Francia. West Francia became the kernel of what would be France, and East Francia was the precursor to Germany. So, East Francia is basically early medieval Germany.

England, at that time, was not unified as it is today. It was divided into several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms like Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, and others. So, I need to consider how these individual kingdoms, as well as later unified England, responded to Viking attacks.

Now, the Vikings were Norse seafarers who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of Europe during the late 8th to early 11th centuries. Their activities included piracy, trade, exploration, settlement, and warfare.

I need to look into how East Francia and England defended against these Viking incursions. Maybe they had similar strategies or perhaps they differed significantly.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered some information about how East Francia and England responded to Viking attacks. It seems like both regions had their ways of dealing with the Viking incursions, but their approaches differed based on their political structures and military capabilities.

First, let's tackle East Francia. From Doc 1, it mentions that East Francia was the precursor to Germany, and it was part of the Carolingian Empire. The Franks, especially under Louis the German, were pretty effective in repelling Viking raids. For instance, in 845, there was a raid on Hamburg, but Louis managed to contain it, and it was the last major Viking raid in the east for about 30 years. So, it seems like East Francia had a relatively successful defense strategy against the Vikings.

Looking at Doc 3, there's more detail about the Carolingian army and how it adapted to fight the Vikings. It talks about different types of defensive forces, like the host, the coast guard, and the lantweri. The coast guard seems particularly important, as they were the first line of defense against Viking incursions by sea. The article also mentions that the Franks tried various strategies, including containment to restrict Viking fleets to rivers and siege warfare.

In contrast, England, especially under King Alfred the Great, had a different approach. Doc 1 mentions that Alfred spent years combating Viking assaults and eventually reached a treaty with them, establishing the Danelaw in northern England. This seems like a significant response, essentially conceding territory to the Vikings in exchange for peace.

Doc 2 is a bit brief, but it confirms that East Francia and England had different responses to Viking attacks. It seems like East Francia was more successful in repelling Viking raids, at least initially, while England had to make concessions like creating the Danelaw.

Moving on to Doc 4, it provides specific examples of Viking raids in England, such as the sack of Bordeaux and the Seine raids. It shows how the Vikings were able to penetrate deep into Frankish territory and how Charles the Bald, the king of West Francia, struggled to defend his realms against these incursions.

Doc 5 focuses on Viking Age Northumbria, which is a part of England. It details the Viking invasion of Northumbria in 866, leading to the capture of York and the establishment of the Kingdom of York, also known as Jorvik. It's interesting to see how the Vikings not only raided but also settled and integrated into the local society, as evidenced by the Danish place names in Yorkshire.

Comparing East Francia and England, it appears that East Francia had more success in defending against Viking attacks, possibly due to stronger centralized leadership and military organization. England, particularly under Alfred the Great, showed resilience and adaptability by negotiating treaties and establishing buffer zones like the Danelaw.

I should also consider the long-term impacts of these responses. East Francia's seemingly more effective defense might have prevented extensive Viking settlement, whereas in England, the Vikings not only raided but also settled, leading to lasting cultural and linguistic influences.

In conclusion, East Francia and England responded differently to Viking attacks, with East Francia focusing on military defense and containment, while England engaged in a mix of military resistance and political accommodation, such as the establishment of the Danelaw.
