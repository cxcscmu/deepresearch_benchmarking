As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or experiences, but I can help you understand the different impacts of verbal and physical abuse. Both types of abuse are serious and can have lasting effects on a person's well-being. Verbal abuse involves using words to harm, control, or manipulate someone, while physical abuse involves harmful physical actions.

To address whether one is worse than the other, it's important to consider the context and the individual's experience. Some people may feel that physical abuse is more severe because it causes visible injuries and tangible harm to the body. However, verbal abuse can be equally damaging, affecting a person's mental health, self-esteem, and emotional well-being. In some cases, the effects of verbal abuse can be more long-lasting and difficult to heal.

It's also worth noting that both forms of abuse can co-occur, and their combined impact can be even more detrimental. It's essential to recognize and address any form of abuse, seeking support and help when needed.

In conclusion, neither form of abuse is worse; they are just different in how they manifest and affect the victim. Both require attention and intervention to prevent further harm.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Neither is worse; both are serious and require attention.}} \]
