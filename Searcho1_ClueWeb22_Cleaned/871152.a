Alright, so I need to figure out how apartheid affected people's lives. I don't know much about apartheid, to be honest, so I'll have to start from the beginning. First things first, I should probably understand what apartheid is.

I think apartheid was a system in South Africa, right? I've heard the term before, but I'm not sure about the details. Maybe I should look it up to get a basic understanding.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the white minority government in South Africa. It seems like it was in place from around 1948 until the early 1990s. The word itself comes from Afrikaans, which is a language spoken in South Africa, and it means "separateness" or "apartness." So, it's basically a policy that separated people based on their race.

Now, I need to think about how this affected people's lives. Since it was a system of racial segregation, I imagine that it had profound impacts on the daily lives of non-white South Africans. Let me try to break this down.

First, racial segregation probably meant that different racial groups lived in separate areas. So, there must have been designated neighborhoods or even entire regions for whites, blacks, Indians, and other racial groups. This would mean that people were forced to live apart from others based on their race, which must have created a lot of social division and tension.

Second, apartheid likely affected access to education. Different schools were probably set up for different racial groups, with whites having better-resourced schools and non-whites getting lower-quality education. This would limit opportunities for non-white people to get good jobs and improve their socioeconomic status.

Third, in terms of employment, there might have been job reservations where certain jobs were reserved for whites only. Non-whites could be barred from pursuing certain careers or getting promotions. Wages and working conditions for non-whites could also be inferior compared to those for whites.

Fourth, political participation would probably be restricted. Non-white people might not have had the right to vote or hold public office. This would mean that they had no say in how the country was governed, even though they made up the majority of the population.

Fifth, public services and facilities could have been segregated. For example, beaches, parks, hospitals, and transportation might have had separate areas for different racial groups. This would reinforce the idea of racial superiority and inferiority and create a sense of inequality.

Moreover, there were probably pass laws and other restrictive measures that controlled the movement of non-white people. They might have needed permits to live in certain areas or to travel between towns. This would severely limit their freedom and make their lives more difficult.

It's also important to consider the psychological impact of living under apartheid. Being constantly told that you are inferior because of your race must have taken a toll on people's self-esteem and mental health. There could have been a lot of resentment, anger, and frustration among non-white communities.

On the other hand, white people who benefited from apartheid might have felt entitled and superior, which could have led to a lack of empathy and understanding towards the struggles of non-white people.

Furthermore, the international community likely imposed sanctions and sanctions on South Africa because of apartheid, which could have had economic consequences for the country as a whole.

In summary, apartheid had far-reaching effects on people's lives in South Africa, impacting where they lived, how they were educated, their job opportunities, their political rights, and their overall quality of life. It was a system designed to maintain white supremacy and control over the non-white majority.

But I should probably look for more specific information to support these points. Maybe I can find some statistics or personal accounts that illustrate the impact of apartheid.

Let me try another search.

So, from these search results, I can see that apartheid had a profound and lasting impact on South Africa, particularly on the lives of black South Africans. Even though apartheid officially ended in 1994, its effects are still felt today.

Firstly, apartheid created a system of racial segregation that was enshrined in law. The Population Registration Act of 1950 classified people into different racial groups, which determined where they could live, work, and access services. This led to the creation of homelands or bantustans, where black people were forced to live, often in poor conditions with limited resources.

This forced removal and separation of people based on race had a devastating effect on families and communities. People were uprooted from their homes and lands, which often had deep cultural and historical significance. This not only disrupted their lives but also eroded their sense of identity and belonging.

In terms of education, apartheid policies ensured that white children received a higher quality of education compared to black children. Schools for black students were underfunded and provided substandard education, which limited their future opportunities. This educational inequality has persisted even after apartheid, as many formerly black schools still lack resources and struggle to provide quality education.

Economically, apartheid entrenched racial disparities. The Job Reservation Act, for example, reserved certain jobs for white people only, denying black people access to skilled employment and better-paying jobs. This perpetuated poverty and limited economic mobility for black South Africans.

Moreover, the pass laws required black people to carry identity documents at all times and restricted their movement within the country. Failure to produce these documents on demand could lead to arrest and imprisonment. This not only infringed on their personal freedoms but also made it difficult for them to find work or access services in urban areas.

Apartheid also had psychological effects on both the oppressed and the oppressors. For black South Africans, living under a system that deemed them inferior took a toll on their self-esteem and mental health. On the other hand, white South Africans who benefited from apartheid may have developed a sense of entitlement and superiority, which could hinder efforts towards reconciliation and equality.

Even after the end of apartheid, the legacy of racial discrimination continues to shape South African society. Income inequality remains stark, with black South Africans disproportionately represented among the poor. Access to healthcare, housing, and other social services is still unequal, reflecting the imbalances created by apartheid.

Efforts have been made to address these issues, such as land reform and affirmative action programs, but progress has been slow, and there is still much work to be done. The ongoing protests and social unrest in South Africa highlight the persistent discontent among those who feel left behind by the country's transition to democracy.

In conclusion, apartheid had a multifaceted and enduring impact on the lives of South Africans, affecting their personal lives, movements, rights, education, and economic opportunities. While significant strides have been made towards building a more equitable society, the legacy of apartheid continues to pose challenges that require持续的 attention and action.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Apartheid had a profound and lasting impact on South Africa, affecting the lives of its citizens in numerous ways, including racial segregation, restricted movement, unequal access to education and economic opportunities, and enduring social and economic disparities.}} \]
