I need to figure out why the Radical Republicans disapproved of Presidential Reconstruction after the Civil War. I remember that there was a lot of tension between President Andrew Johnson and the Radical Republicans in Congress, but I need to recall the specific reasons for their disagreement.

First, I should remind myself what Presidential Reconstruction was. It was the plan implemented by President Andrew Johnson after the Civil War to readmit the Southern states back into the Union. Johnson's approach was quite lenient towards the former Confederate states. He pardoned many former Confederates and allowed them to retain some of their rights and properties. He also required only minimal changes to the Southern state constitutions, such as abolishing slavery and repudiating secession.

Now, the Radical Republicans were a faction within the Republican Party who wanted more drastic changes in the South. They were concerned about ensuring that the newly freed slaves had real protection and rights, and they didn't think Johnson's plan went far enough. I think one of their main issues was that Johnson's reconstruction didn't guarantee civil rights for African Americans.

Let me think about this step by step. First, the Radical Republicans wanted stricter conditions for readmitting the Southern states. They believed that the Southern states had committed acts of treason by seceding, and therefore, the Union should treat them as conquered territories rather than simply allowing them back with minimal changes.

Another key point is that the Radical Republicans were pushing for significant reforms in the South, including land redistribution to benefit the freed slaves, and they wanted to ensure that these reforms were enforced. They were worried that without these measures, the freedmen would remain economically dependent on their former owners and effectively without real freedom.

Moreover, the Radical Republicans were concerned about the power of the ex-Confederate leaders. They didn't trust these leaders and thought that allowing them to regain power in the Southern states would undermine the goals of the war, which included ending slavery and ensuring loyalty to the Union.

I also recall that there was a conflict over the interpretation of the Constitution regarding the rights of the states versus the rights of the federal government. The Radical Republicans favored a stronger federal role in enforcing civil rights, while Johnson and the moderate Republicans were more inclined to respect state sovereignty.

Let me see if I can find more specific points. Maybe I should consider the differences in their approaches to reconstructing the South. Johnson's plan was seen as too lenient because it didn't require Southern states to grant voting rights to African Americans. In fact, some states were passing Black Codes that restricted the freedoms of the newly freed slaves.

The Radical Republicans saw these Black Codes as a way for the South to maintain a system similar to slavery, and they wanted to prevent that. They believed that true equality and freedom for African Americans could only be achieved through federal intervention and the establishment of protections at the national level.

Additionally, the Radical Republicans were pushing for the expansion of federal power to protect citizens' rights, which aligned with their overall political philosophy. They saw the reconstruction period as an opportunity to reshape the South in a way that would be more in line with Northern values and economic systems.

I also think that there was a moral dimension to their opposition. Many Radical Republicans were abolitionists before the war and felt strongly about the need to secure justice and equality for African Americans. They were appalled by the idea that former slaveholders could regain power without any real accountability for their actions during the war.

Furthermore, there were political calculations involved. The Radical Republicans wanted to build a strong Republican presence in the South, which would be threatened if the ex-Confederate leaders were quickly readmitted to power. By imposing stricter conditions, they could ensure that the South would be more politically aligned with the North.

I should also consider the timing of these events. Presidential Reconstruction began in 1865, immediately after the war ended, while the Radical Republicans in Congress had their own plans, which led to the enactment of the Reconstruction Acts in 1867, overriding Johnson's vetoes.

This suggests that there was a fundamental disagreement between Johnson and the Radical Republicans about the pace and nature of reconstruction. Johnson wanted a quick return to normalcy, while the Radicals sought a more thorough transformation of Southern society.

Let me try to summarize the key reasons why the Radical Republicans disapproved of Presidential Reconstruction:

1. **Leniency towards former Confederates:** Johnson's plan was seen as too forgiving, allowing many ex-Confederate leaders to regain power without sufficient punishment or restrictions.

2. **Insufficient protection for freed slaves:** The plan didn't guarantee civil rights or voting rights for African Americans, and it allowed Southern states to pass Black Codes that restricted their freedoms.

3. **Minimal changes to Southern state constitutions:** Johnson required only nominal changes, such as abolishing slavery and repudiating secession, without ensuring substantive reforms.

4. **Respect for state sovereignty:** Johnson's approach respected the autonomy of Southern states, whereas the Radical Republicans favored greater federal intervention to enforce civil rights.

5. **Economic and social transformation:** The Radicals wanted to reshape the Southern economy and society, moving away from plantation slavery to a system where freedmen could own land and have economic independence.

6. **Political considerations:** The Radicals aimed to establish a strong Republican presence in the South, which would be jeopardized if ex-Confederates were quickly readmitted to power.

I think these are the main reasons why the Radical Republicans opposed Presidential Reconstruction. Their vision for reconstruction was much more ambitious and radical than Johnson's, and they were willing to fight for their ideas, leading to significant political battles
