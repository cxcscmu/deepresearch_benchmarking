Alright, I need to figure out what caused the Vietnam War to start. I don't remember a lot about this, so I should probably do some research to get accurate information. I know that the Vietnam War was a long time ago, in the 1960s and 70s, but I'm not sure about the exact causes.

First, I should probably understand what the Vietnam War was. It was a conflict in Vietnam, which is a country in Southeast Asia. From what I recall, it was part of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. So, maybe the war was related to the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism.

Let me think about the key players involved. There was North Vietnam, which was communist and supported by the Soviet Union and China, and South Vietnam, which was anti-communist and supported by the United States. So, it seems like it was a proxy war between the US and the USSR.

But why did it start? I think there were several factors that led to the war. Maybe I should look into the history of Vietnam before the war. I know that Vietnam was a French colony, and there was a war between France and Vietnam called the First Indochina War, which ended in 1954 with the Geneva Accords.

The Geneva Accords divided Vietnam into North and South at the 17th parallel, and there was supposed to be an election in 1956 to reunify the country. But that election never happened, and the US started supporting South Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism in the region.

So, one cause might be the Domino Theory, which was the belief that if one country in Southeast Asia fell to communism, others would follow. That might have pushed the US to intervene.

Also, there was the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964, where US ships were allegedly attacked by North Vietnamese forces, leading to Congress passing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave the president broad powers to escalate the war.

But I need to verify all these points. Maybe I should look up some reliable sources to get a clearer picture.

Let me try searching for "causes of the Vietnam War." Hopefully, I can find some good information.

Alright, I've got some information from these documents. Let me try to organize my thoughts.

First, the Vietnam War was a conflict in Vietnam that lasted from 1955 to 1975. It was between North Vietnam, which was communist and supported by the Soviet Union and China, and South Vietnam, which was anti-communist and supported by the United States. The war is considered a proxy war of the Cold War between the US and the USSR.

Looking at the causes, it seems there are a few key factors:

1. Spread of communism: The US was trying to contain the spread of communism, as per the Truman Doctrine and the Domino Theory, which feared that if one country fell to communism, others would follow.

2. French colonial legacy: Vietnam was a former French colony, and the First Indochina War between France and Vietnam had ended with the Geneva Accords in 1954, dividing the country at the 17th parallel.

3. Desire for national independence: Vietnamese nationalists, led by Ho Chi Minh, wanted to unify the country and gain independence from foreign influence.

4. Cold War tensions: The global power struggle between the US and the USSR played a significant role in escalating the conflict.

Let me look at each of these in more detail.

First, the spread of communism. The US was deeply committed to containing communism globally, especially after the Chinese Revolution in 1949 brought Mao Zedong and his communist party to power. The Domino Theory suggested that if Vietnam fell to communism, other Southeast Asian countries would follow suit. So, preventing that was a primary motivation for US involvement.

Second, the French colonial legacy. Vietnam had been a French colony, and the First Indochina War was fought between France and the Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh. When France was defeated at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, the Geneva Accords divided Vietnam into North and South, with the intention of holding elections to reunify the country. However, these elections never took place, and the US began supporting South Vietnam to prevent communist takeover.

Third, the desire for national independence. Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh were fighting for Vietnam's independence from foreign rule, first from Japan during World War II and then from France. Their goal was to establish a unified, independent Vietnam, which aligned with communist ideology.

Fourth, Cold War tensions. The US saw supporting South Vietnam as a way to counter Soviet and Chinese influence in the region. The war became a battleground for the ideological conflict between capitalism and communism.

Additionally, there were specific events that escalated the conflict, such as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964, which led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and a significant increase in US military involvement.

I should also consider the perspective of the Vietnamese. For them, the war was about national unity and independence from foreign interference, starting with the French and later the Americans.

In summary, the Vietnam War was caused by a complex interplay of factors, including the spread of communism, the legacy of French colonialism, the desire for Vietnamese national independence, and the broader context of the Cold War.

So, to answer the question "What caused the Vietnam War to start?", I would say it was a combination of the US's commitment to containing communism, the historical context of French colonial rule and the First Indochina War, the Vietnamese struggle for independence and unification, and the global power dynamics of the Cold War.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Vietnam War was caused by a combination of factors including the US's commitment to containing communism, the legacy of French colonial rule, the Vietnamese struggle for independence and unification, and the global power dynamics of the Cold War.}} \]
