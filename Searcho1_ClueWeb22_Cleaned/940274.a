As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and perspectives on whether internet access is considered a human right.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a human right. Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being.

So, is internet access a fundamental right? Some argue that in today's digital age, access to the internet is essential for participating in society, accessing information, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Others contend that while it's important, it shouldn't be considered a fundamental human right.

I should look into what international bodies have said about this. Maybe the United Nations has addressed this issue.

Let me consider performing a search to find out if the UN or any other global organization has declared internet access as a human right.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Is internet access a human right?" I need to figure this out, so I thought maybe looking into what international bodies have said about it would be a good start. So, I did a search on whether the United Nations considers internet access a human right.

From the search results, it seems like there's a bit of confusion about this. Some articles say that the UN has declared internet access a human right, while others suggest that it's not that straightforward. Let's look at each document to get a clearer picture.

The first document is from Business Insider, dated July 2016. It says that the UN thinks internet access is a human right, based on a resolution called A/HRC/32/L.20. It mentions that the UN has declared "online freedom" as a human right that must be protected. However, it also notes that some countries, like Russia, China, and South Africa, didn't fully agree with this resolution.

The second document is from Lifewire, dated March 2020. It talks about a report from the Human Rights Council that declares access to the Internet a basic human right, which enables individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression. The report emphasizes that disconnecting individuals from the Internet is a violation of human rights and against international law. This seems pretty definitive, but I should check other sources to confirm.

The third document is from Amnesty USA, dated January 2012. It discusses an op-ed in the New York Times where Vinton Cerf, a "father" of the Internet, argues that internet access is not a human right. The author of the Amnesty USA article disagrees and argues that internet access is crucial for enjoying other human rights, such as the right to education, health, and employment. The author also mentions that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes the right to participate in cultural life and enjoy scientific advancements, which could encompass internet access.

The fourth document is from Diplo, dated June 2011. It questions whether the UN has really declared internet access a human right, given that a recent report by the Human Rights Council doesn't explicitly state this. The report does say that the Internet is a catalyst for enjoying human rights and that states have a positive obligation to promote or facilitate Internet access. However, the author cautions against assuming that internet access is a human right based on this report alone.

The fifth document is from The Atlantic, dated June 2011. It reports on a UN Human Rights Council session where a report was released emphasizing the importance of the Internet in enabling human rights. The report calls for facilitating access to the Internet for all individuals with as little restriction as possible. The article also mentions that a BBC survey found that 79% of people believe internet access is a fundamental right.

Okay, so from these documents, it seems there's a mix of opinions. Some sources suggest that the UN has declared internet access a human right, while others indicate that it's more about recognizing the Internet as a tool for exercising existing human rights.

Let me try to make sense of this. First, what is a human right? Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior, and they are often protected by law. They are inherent to all humans, regardless of nationality, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status.

Now, is internet access one of these inherent rights? Or is it more of a means to exercise other rights?

Looking at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."

This seems relevant because it mentions "any media," which could include the Internet. So, in that sense, access to the Internet could be seen as necessary for exercising the right to freedom of expression and access to information.

Moreover, other articles in the UDHR mention rights like education, participation in cultural life, and sharing in scientific advancements (Article 27). Given that the Internet is a key platform for these activities in the modern world, one could argue that access to the Internet is integral to realizing these rights.

The report from the Human Rights Council, as mentioned in the Lifewire and The Atlantic articles, seems to support this view. It states that the Internet is a catalyst for enjoying human rights and that states have a responsibility to promote or facilitate Internet access.

However, as the Diplo article points out, the report doesn't explicitly declare internet access a human right. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of the Internet in enabling the exercise of existing human rights.

So, perhaps it's more accurate to say that internet access is a prerequisite or a means to exercise certain human rights, rather than a human right in itself.

But, if that's the case, does that make it a human right? Some might argue that if something is essential for exercising human rights, it should be considered a human right itself.

On the other hand, there are those, like Vinton Cerf, who argue that internet access is not a human right. Cerf might be coming from a perspective that human rights are inherent and universal, whereas internet access is a relatively recent development and may not fit neatly into traditional categories of human rights.

Additionally, there are practical considerations. Not all countries have the infrastructure or resources to provide universal internet access. Declaring it a human right could put pressure on governments to ensure this access, which might be challenging for some.

Nevertheless, the trend seems to be towards recognizing the importance of internet access for human dignity and development. As the Lifewire article notes, 119 governments have adopted broadband plans to guide their journey into the digital era.

Moreover, some countries have taken steps to enshrine internet access as a legal right. Estonia, France, and Costa Rica have recognized it as a fundamental right, and Finland has mandated a minimum broadband speed.

Public opinion also seems to support this notion. The BBC survey mentioned in the Amnesty USA and The Atlantic articles shows that 79% of people believe internet access is a fundamental right.

In conclusion, while the UN hasn't explicitly declared internet access a human right, it has recognized the Internet's crucial role in enabling the exercise of existing human rights, particularly freedom of expression and access to information. Many experts and a significant portion of the global population believe that internet access should be considered a human right due to its importance in participating in modern society.

Given this information, I would say that internet access is increasingly being viewed as a necessary component for the realization of human rights, even if it isn't yet universally recognized as a human right in itself.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Internet access is increasingly being viewed as a necessary component for the realization of human rights, even if it isn't yet universally recognized as a human right in itself.}} \]
