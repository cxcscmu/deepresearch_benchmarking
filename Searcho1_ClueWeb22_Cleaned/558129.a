I need to figure out what happened to the Nazis after the Holocaust. This is a serious and important topic, so I want to make sure I approach it carefully and accurately.

First, I should understand what the Holocaust was. I know that it was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. It took place during World War II, so after the war ended in 1945, there were consequences for the Nazis involved.

I think the Nuremberg Trials come to mind. After World War II, the Allied forces held trials for the top Nazi leaders to prosecute them for war crimes and crimes against humanity. So, many high-ranking Nazis were put on trial and faced justice there.

But what about other Nazis who weren't part of the top leadership? Were they also held accountable? I'm not sure about that. Maybe some were, and some weren't.

Also, I've heard stories about Nazis fleeing to other countries after the war, like South America or even the United States. Was that common? How many actually did that?

I need to get more information to answer this question properly. I should look up details about the Nuremberg Trials and see what happened to Nazis after the war.
