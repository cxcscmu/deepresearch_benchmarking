So I have this question: "Do the American population wish for more autonomy in their work?" Now, I'm not an expert in psychology or sociology, but I do know that autonomy in the workplace is a topic that comes up a lot in discussions about job satisfaction and employee well-being. I think to answer this question properly, I need to look into some research or studies that have been conducted on this subject, specifically focusing on the American population.

First, I should define what autonomy means in the workplace. Autonomy generally refers to the degree to which employees have control over their work, such as deciding how to perform their tasks, setting their own goals, and having flexibility in their schedules. It's often associated with higher job satisfaction and better mental health.

I recall that there are several models in organizational psychology that emphasize the importance of autonomy, like Self-Determination Theory, which suggests that autonomy is a basic psychological need. So,理论上来说，人们应该倾向于在工作中拥有更多的自主权。

但是，这是否意味着美国人口普遍希望在工作中有更多自主权呢？也许不同的人有不同的偏好。有些人可能更喜欢结构化的工作环境，有明确的指导和规则，而其他人则可能更喜欢自由度高的工作环境，可以自己做决定。

为了得到一个准确的答案，我需要查找一些调查数据或者研究报告，看看有多少美国人表示他们希望在工作中拥有更多的自主权。

让我想想，哪里可以找到这样的信息。也许盖洛普（Gallup）或其他市场研究公司进行过相关的调查。或者，可能是学术研究中有这方面的数据。

也许我可以先搜索一下关于工作自主权和美国员工满意度的研究。

Alright, so I've got this question: "Do the American population wish for more autonomy in their work?" I need to figure this out based on the search results I've got. Let's see what these documents are telling me.

First up, Doc 1 is from a website called Work.Chron.com, and it's about the effects of autonomy on job satisfaction. It seems like it's providing some general information on workplace autonomy. It mentions that autonomy can lead to higher job satisfaction and better productivity, but also notes that too much autonomy can backfire if the organizational culture isn't supportive. So, it's saying that autonomy is generally good, but needs to be balanced.

Next, Doc 2 is a scholarly article from Semantic Scholar. It's titled about job autonomy and job satisfaction, using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study. It says that perceived job autonomy is a highly significant determinant of job satisfaction across five different domains: pay, co-workers, supervisor, promotion opportunities, and overall job satisfaction. This sounds pretty relevant to the question. It suggests that Americans do value autonomy in their work because it's linked to higher job satisfaction.

Doc 3 is from ScienceDaily, reporting on a study from the University of Birmingham that found employees with higher levels of autonomy report better well-being and job satisfaction. It also notes that there are differences in how autonomy affects men and women, with women benefiting more from flexibility in work schedules and locations, possibly to balance work and family responsibilities. This adds another dimension to the topic, showing that autonomy can have different impacts based on gender.

Doc 4 is from HRZone.com, discussing how autonomy in the workplace positively affects well-being and job satisfaction. It summarizes research that found higher levels of autonomy lead to better wellbeing and job satisfaction, and also highlights that men and women benefit differently from various types of autonomy. For women, flexibility in work location and schedule seems particularly beneficial, while men are more impacted by job tasks, pace of work, and task order.

Lastly, Doc 5 is from The Conversation, discussing the Great Resignation and whether American workers are unhappy with their jobs. It presents data from the General Social Survey showing that job satisfaction has remained relatively stable over the years, with the vast majority of workers reporting moderate to high satisfaction. However, there's an increase in turnover intentions, meaning more people are considering quitting their jobs, but not necessarily because they're dissatisfied. The author suggests that the strong economy is encouraging people to look for better opportunities rather than being driven by dissatisfaction.

So, synthesizing these sources:

- Autonomy is positively correlated with job satisfaction and well-being.

- Both men and women benefit from autonomy, but in different ways.

- Despite a record number of quits, overall job satisfaction remains high, suggesting that people aren't necessarily leaving because they hate their jobs, but perhaps seeking better opportunities.

- The economy plays a role in people's decisions to quit and look for new jobs.

Given this information, it seems that the American population does value autonomy in their work, as it leads to higher job satisfaction and well-being. However, the recent surge in resignations might not solely be due to a desire for more autonomy or dissatisfaction with current jobs, but also due to economic conditions and people taking advantage of a buyer's market for talent.

Therefore, my answer would be that yes, the American population generally wishes for more autonomy in their work, as it is associated with greater job satisfaction and well-being. However, the current trend of resignations is multifaceted and not solely driven by a lack of autonomy or job dissatisfaction.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, the American population generally prefers more autonomy in their work, as it is linked to higher job satisfaction and well-being.}} \]
