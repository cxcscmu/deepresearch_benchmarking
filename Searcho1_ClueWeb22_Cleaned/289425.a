Alright, so I need to figure out why Reconstruction failed after the Civil War. I don't remember a lot about this period, so I'll need to do some research to get a good understanding. Let me start by recalling what I know about Reconstruction.

Reconstruction was the period after the Civil War when the nation tried to rebuild and integrate the Southern states back into the Union, especially focusing on freeing the slaves and giving them rights. I think it lasted from 1865 to 1877. But I'm not entirely sure about the dates. Maybe I should look that up first.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered that Reconstruction was the period after the Civil War, roughly from 1865 to 1877, when the nation tried to rebuild and address the issues arising from the war, particularly regarding the status of freed slaves. There were different approaches to Reconstruction, with President Andrew Johnson advocating for a more lenient approach and the Radical Republicans in Congress pushing for stricter measures to ensure the rights of African Americans.

One key point is that there were conflicting goals among different groups. The Radical Republicans wanted to punish the South and protect the rights of freed slaves, while President Johnson wanted a quicker reconciliation without severe penalties. Southern Democrats, meanwhile, were resistant to changes that would grant equal rights to African Americans.

Several important pieces of legislation were passed during this time, including the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to former slaves, and ensured their right to vote, respectively. However, enforcing these rights was challenging, especially in the South where there was widespread resistance.

The period also saw the rise of groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which used violence and intimidation to suppress African American political participation and rights. This resistance made it difficult for the federal government to maintain the gains made during Reconstruction.

Reconstruction officially ended with the Compromise of 1877, which resolved the disputed 1876 presidential election in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. This effectively marked the end of federal enforcement of Reconstruction policies in the South.

After Reconstruction, many of the gains made by African Americans were rolled back, and the South implemented Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation and discrimination. It wasn't until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s that significant strides were made to address these injustices.

So, to answer the question "Why did Reconstruction fail?" I think there are several reasons:

1. **Political Divisions:** The differing goals and approaches between President Johnson and the Radical Republicans led to gridlock and ineffective policies.

2. **Resistance in the South:** Southern whites were deeply opposed to the changes brought by Reconstruction and used various means, including violence and legal maneuvers, to resist and undermine Reconstruction efforts.

3. **Lack of Enforcement:** While laws were passed to protect the rights of African Americans, there was often insufficient federal enforcement, especially after the end of Reconstruction.

4. **Northern Fatigue:** Over time, Northerners lost interest in the Reconstruction project, preferring to focus on other issues, which led to a withdrawal of support.

5. **Compromise of 1877:** The end of federal military presence in the South allowed Southern states to implement discriminatory practices without interference.

These factors collectively contributed to the failure of Reconstruction to fully achieve its goals of ensuring equality and justice for African Americans.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Reconstruction failed due to political divisions, Southern resistance, lack of enforcement, Northern fatigue, and the Compromise of 1877.}} \]
