I'm trying to understand why gas cars are bad for the environment. I know that they're pretty common, but I've heard that they contribute to pollution环境污染. I need to figure out exactly how they do that.

First off, what are gas cars? They're vehicles that run on gasoline, which is a fossil fuel. Fossil fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals, buried deep underground for millions of years. So, when we burn gasoline in our cars, we're essentially burning these ancient organisms.

But why is that bad for the environment? Well, burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2). Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. So, the more CO2 we release, the worse the problem becomes.

Let me think about this. How much CO2 does a typical car emit? I should look that up.

Okay, so from the search results, I can see that gas cars emit a significant amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. For example, in the UK, the average car emits about 138.4 grams of CO2 per kilometer, which translates to around 221.4 grams per mile. Over a year, with an average mileage of 7,600 miles, that's about 1,682,383 grams or roughly 1.68 metric tons of CO2 per car per year.

Comparatively, new cars are improving, with newer models emitting less CO2. In the third quarter of 2021, the average CO2 emissions for new cars in the UK were 116.2 grams per kilometer, which is around 185 grams per mile. That's still a substantial amount.

But CO2 isn't the only pollutant from gas cars. There are other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide, and also air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter, which can have harmful effects on human health and the environment.

I should probably look into what these other pollutants are and how they affect the environment.

So, from these search results, it's clear that gas cars are bad for the environment in several ways. First, they emit a lot of CO2, which contributes to global warming and climate change. Even though new cars are becoming more efficient and emitting less CO2, there are still millions of older, less efficient cars on the road that emit a lot more.

But it's not just CO2. Gas cars also emit other pollutants like nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds. These can lead to smog, acid rain, and respiratory problems for people. Plus, there's the issue of oil spills and leaks, which can contaminate soil and water.

Also, the production and disposal of cars have environmental impacts. Making cars requires a lot of resources and energy, and disposing of them can lead to waste and pollution in landfills.

Moreover, cars contribute to noise pollution, which can have adverse effects on both wildlife and human health.

Looking back at the first search result, it mentioned that transportation is the largest source of CO2 emissions after electric power generation. That's pretty alarming. And in the US, cars and trucks are the single largest contributor to air
