As an AI assistant, I'm here to help you understand when a task (referred to as "a") should be raised as a program risk. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a "program risk" is. In project management and software development, a risk is any uncertain event or condition that has the potential to affect the achievement of project objectives. A program risk, specifically, refers to risks associated with a program, which could be a collection of related projects or a larger initiative.

So, raising a task as a program risk means identifying that this task poses a significant threat or uncertainty to the success of the program. But how do we determine when a task should be flagged in this way?

I think there are several factors to consider:

1. **Impact on Program Objectives:** If the task, if not completed successfully, could prevent the program from achieving its goals, it should be considered a risk.

2. **Dependency on Other Tasks:** If many other tasks or parts of the program depend on this task being completed on time and to specification, then it's a critical path task and should be monitored closely for risks.

3. **Uncertainty or Complexity:** Tasks that are particularly complex or involve uncertain elements, such as new technologies or unproven methods, carry higher risk.

4. **Resource Constraints:** If the task requires resources that are limited or difficult to obtain, this could pose a risk.

5. **Time Constraints:** Tasks with tight deadlines or those that are behind schedule can be risky because delays can cascade through the program.

6. **Stakeholder Concerns:** If stakeholders have expressed particular concern about the successful completion of a task, it may indicate underlying risks.

7. **Historical Data:** If similar tasks in the past have frequently caused problems, this task should be watched carefully for potential risks.

Given these considerations, I would say that a task should be raised as a program risk when it meets one or more of the following criteria:

- It has a high potential impact on the program's objectives.

- It is a critical dependency in the program's schedule, with many dependencies.

- It involves significant uncertainty or complexity.

- It is resource-intensive or faces resource constraints.

- It is behind schedule or has tight time constraints.

- Stakeholders have expressed concerns about its completion.

- Similar tasks have caused issues in the past.

By monitoring and managing these high-risk tasks, program managers can proactively address potential problems and increase the likelihood of program success.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{A task should be raised as a program risk when it has a high potential impact on the program's objectives, is a critical task with many dependencies, involves significant uncertainty or complexity, faces resource constraints, is behind schedule or has tight time constraints, is of concern to stakeholders, or has a history of causing problems in similar programs.}}
