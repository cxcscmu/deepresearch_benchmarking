Alright, I need to figure out how Herbert Hoover responded to the demands of the Bonus Army. I don't remember much about this, so I'll need to do some research. First, I should understand who Herbert Hoover is and what the Bonus Army was demanding.

Herbert Hoover was the 31st President of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. He took office just before the stock market crash of 1929, which led to the Great Depression. So, during his presidency, there were a lot of economic hardships and public dissatisfaction.

The Bonus Army refers to a group of World War I veterans who gathered in Washington, D.C., in 1932 to demand early payment of a promised bonus for their military service. The bonus was originally scheduled to be paid in 1945, but with the onset of the Great Depression, many veterans were facing financial difficulties and sought immediate payment.

So, the Bonus Army was essentially protesting for financial relief. Now, I need to find out how President Hoover reacted to their demands.

I think I should look up some information about the Bonus Army and Hoover's response. Maybe start with a general search.

Let me try searching for "Herbert Hoover and the Bonus Army."

Alright, I've got some information from these documents. Let me try to piece it together.

So, the Bonus Army was a group of World War I veterans who went to Washington, D.C., in 1932 to demand early payment of a bonus that was supposed to be given to them in 1945. They were facing hardship due to the Great Depression, and they thought getting this bonus early would help them out.

Herbert Hoover was the president at that time, and from what I'm reading, his response wasn't very favorable to the veterans. In one of the documents, it says that Hoover ordered the army to disperse the Bonus Army, and that led to some violence. Two veterans were killed, and many others were injured.

It seems like Hoover's handling of the situation was pretty controversial. A lot of people were upset with him for using military force against these veterans who were, you know, basically asking for help during tough times.

One document mentions that this event really damaged Hoover's reputation and contributed to his loss in the 1932 election to Franklin D. Roosevelt.

So, to sum it up, Hoover responded to the Bonus Army's demands by ordering the military to remove them from Washington, D.C., which resulted in violence and deaths, and this action was widely criticized and hurt his public image.

I think that's the main point, but maybe I should look a bit deeper. Let me see what else these documents say.

In one of the documents, it talks about how Hoover didn't want to pay the bonus early because he thought it would require raising taxes, which he didn't want to do. So, he was against the idea of paying the bonus提前.

When the Senate rejected a bill to pay the bonus early, Hoover then ordered the army to remove the veterans from their camps. It seems like he was trying to maintain law and order, but his methods were seen as heavy-handed and insensitive.

Another point is that some people at the time thought the Bonus Army was influenced by communist ideas, which might have heightened Hoover's response. But regardless, the way it played out was not good for Hoover.

So, in answering the question of how Hoover responded to the demands of the Bonus Army, I would say he rejected their demands and used military force to disperse them, which led to violence and damage to his reputation.

I think that captures the essence of what happened. If I need to be more specific, I could mention the names of the generals involved, like Douglas MacArthur, but I think for the basic question, this suffices.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{He rejected their demands and used military force to disperse them, leading to violence and damage to his reputation.}} \]
