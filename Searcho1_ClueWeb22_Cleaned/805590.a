Alright, I need to figure out how Algeria gained its independence. I know that Algeria was a French colony for a long time, but I'm not sure about the specifics of how they achieved independence. I think I should start by understanding the timeline of events leading up to independence.

First, I should probably look up when Algeria actually gained independence. I have a vague memory that it was in the 20th century, maybe around the mid-1900s. Let me see... I think it was in 1962, but I'm not entirely sure. It would be good to confirm that date.

Next, I need to understand what led to Algeria's struggle for independence. Was there a particular event or a series of events that triggered the movement? I recall that there were fights between Algeria and France, but I don't know the details.

Maybe I should look into the Algerian War. I think that was the conflict between Algeria and France that eventually led to Algeria's independence. I should find out when the war started and ended, and what were the key events during that period.

Also, I should find out about the main leaders of the Algerian independence movement. Were there prominent figures who played crucial roles in achieving independence? Knowing about them might help me understand the strategies they used.

Moreover, it would be interesting to know how the international community reacted to Algeria's fight for independence. Did other countries support Algeria, and if so, how? Or did they support France? Understanding the global political climate at that time could provide more context.

I should also consider the role of the United Nations. I think the UN played a part in mediating between Algeria and France, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe checking if there were any resolutions passed regarding Algeria's independence would be helpful.

Additionally, I ought to look into the impact of independence on Algeria itself. What changes occurred after gaining independence? Were there any challenges that the newly independent nation faced?

I feel like there's a lot to cover here, so I'd better organize my thoughts properly. Perhaps making an outline would help me structure the information better.

Let me try to outline the key points I need to cover:

I. Introduction

A. Brief history of Algeria as a French colony

B. Date of independence

II. Lead-up to the Algerian War

A. Key events and tensions

B. Formation of the National Liberation Front (FLN)
