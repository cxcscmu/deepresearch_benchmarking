Okay, so from these search results, it seems like ableism is discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. It can manifest in various ways, such as unfair treatment or negative attitudes towards disabled individuals. The term seems to have originated in the 1980s and is recognized in multiple dictionaries.

Now, the question is about how ableism affects men in dating. So, I need to think about how this form of discrimination might play out in the context of romantic relationships and specifically how it impacts men.

First, I should consider what kinds of disabilities might be relevant here. Disabilities can be physical, mental, intellectual, sensory, or a combination of these. In the context of dating, visible disabilities like using a wheelchair or having a prosthetic limb might be more immediately apparent, but there are also invisible disabilities like chronic pain, mental health issues, or learning disabilities that might not be obvious to others.

Perhaps I should look into studies or articles that discuss ableism in dating or relationships.

So, from these search results, it seems like ableism can affect men in dating in several ways. First, there's the issue of societal attitudes towards disability, which can lead to discrimination or prejudice. For example, some people might assume that a man with a disability is less desirable or capable in a relationship, which can make it harder for him to find a partner.

One article mentioned that disabled men often face higher unemployment rates and lower-paying jobs, which can affect their desirability in the dating market. Financial stability is often a factor in dating, and if a man with a disability is perceived as having less financial security, that could be a barrier.

There's also the physical aspect. Some disabilities might require accommodations or adjustments in physical interactions, which could be unfamiliar or uncomfortable for some potential partners. For example, dating someone in a wheelchair might require planning dates in accessible locations and being mindful of physical assistance.

Moreover, there's the issue of sexuality and societal expectations. There's a stereotype that people with disabilities are asexual or not sexually desirable, which isn't true. Overcoming these misconceptions can be challenging in dating.

On the positive side, there are dating apps and websites specifically designed for people with disabilities, which can make it easier to connect with others who understand and accept their experiences.

Overall, ableism in dating can create additional challenges for men with disabilities, but it's important to remember that these challenges can be overcome with understanding, acceptance, and a willingness to educate oneself about disability issues.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Ableism in dating affects men with disabilities through societal prejudices, financial barriers, physical accommodations, and misconceptions about sexuality.}} \]
