As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and analysis on the topic of whether the cost of college is too high.

To approach this question, I need to consider several factors, such as the trends in college tuition fees, the value of a college education, student debt, and alternative options to traditional higher education.

First, I should look into how college tuition fees have been changing over time. Have they been increasing at a rate higher than inflation? Are there any differences between public and private institutions?

Second, I need to assess the benefits of a college education. Does a college degree lead to higher earning potential? Are there other intangible benefits, such as networking opportunities and personal growth?

Third, I should examine the issue of student debt. How common is it for students to take on loans to pay for college? What is the average amount of debt, and how does it affect graduates' financial well-being?

Lastly, I should consider alternative paths to traditional college education. Are there vocational schools, online courses, or apprenticeships that can provide similar career prospects at a lower cost?

By analyzing these aspects, I can form a comprehensive understanding of whether the cost of college is indeed too high.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{The cost of college is considered too high due to rising tuition fees, significant student debt, and questions about the return on investment, although a college degree still generally leads to higher earnings and other benefits.}} \]
