Alright, so I've got this question: "Why are Cubans protesting?" Now, I don't know much about current events, especially regarding Cuba, so I need to figure this out. Maybe start by understanding what's been happening in Cuba recently that might have led to protests.

First, I should probably look up some recent news about Cuba to see what's been going on. Maybe there have been some political changes or economic issues that have triggered these protests. I think searching for "recent Cuban protests" would be a good starting point.

Alright, so I've got these search results about recent Cuban protests. Let's see what they say.

First, there's an article from The Nation titled about the latest round of protests in Cuba. It seems like these protests are connected to economic issues and US foreign policy. The article mentions that the Cuban economy has been hit hard by the end of cheap Venezuelan oil, the dysfunction of the island's economy, and the implementation of a monetary reform program. Plus, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation by wiping out tourism, which is a big part of Cuba's economy.

The article also talks about US embargo and sanctions against Cuba, which have restricted the flow of money and resources to the island. It seems like these external factors have contributed to the protests. The author also mentions that the protesters are mostly middle-class artists and intellectuals who are calling for more freedom of expression and democracy, but they haven't connected well with the working-class sectors that are also suffering from the economic crisis.

There's also a mention of a specific protest that was planned but didn't turn out as expected, with only a few people showing up and some arrests. The author suggests that fear of the government played a role in suppressing turnout, but also that the organizers failed to connect with broader segments of society.

Next, there's a piece from Fox News about ongoing protests in the US in support of the Cuban protesters, as well as the Cuban government rallying its supporters in Havana. It seems like the situation is polar in both Cuba and the US, with different groups expressing their views and opinions.

Then, there's an article from CBS News about the protests that happened on July 11, 2021, where thousands of Cubans took to the streets in Havana and other parts of the country to protest food shortages, high prices, and the economic crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The protesters were chanting things like "Freedom" and "Enough," and there were some clashes with police, who used tear gas and made arrests.

The Cuban president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, appeared on TV to condemn the protests and called on government supporters to take to the streets in response. There was also a tweet from a US State Department official expressing support for the protesters' right to peaceful assembly.

It's interesting to see the US government's reaction to these protests. The article mentions that the Biden administration has not lifted the Trump-era embargo and保持着对古巴的强硬立场，尽管一些古巴裔美国人和政界人士呼吁采取更积极的措施支持古巴人民。

还有来自The Conversation的一篇文章，它提供了关于古巴抗议的一些背景信息，包括古巴的新宪法、艺术家的反抗以及劳尔·卡斯特罗退出领导层后的情况。这篇文章指出，尽管古巴在2019年通过了一部新宪法，扩大了一些社会和政治权利，但政府仍然严格控制着政治领域，对独立组织持警惕态度，尤其是那些具有政治性质的组织。

此外，文章还提到了艺术家们在2020年的抗议活动，他们要求更多的创作自由，并与政府进行了谈判，但最终谈判未能取得实质性的成果，政府反而加强了对异议声音的打压。

最后，NBC News的一篇文章详细描述了2021年7月11日的抗议情况，包括成千上万的古巴人在全国各地抗议政府的管理不善、经济困境和对COVID-19疫情的处理不当。抗议者高呼“我们要自由”和“我们不再害怕”等口号，这在古巴是相当罕见的公开反对声音。

文章还提到，古巴政府切断了互联网服务，以防止抗议活动的实时传播，并且派出了特种警察部队来镇压示威者。总统Díaz-Canel在国家电视台上呼吁军队对抗抗议者，并动员政府支持者到街头去。

在美国迈阿密的古巴裔社区，也举行了声援古巴抗议者的集会，表达了对古巴亲属的担忧和对政府现状的不满。

综合这些信息，看来古巴近期的抗议活动主要是由经济困难、生活物资短缺、电力中断以及政府应对COVID-19疫情不力等因素引发的。同时，美国的经济制裁和外交压力也被认为是加剧古巴经济危机的因素之一。

抗议者主要是中产阶级的艺术家和知识分子，他们呼吁更多的言论自由和民主改革，但似乎没有很好地与受经济危机影响更大的工人阶级建立联系。政府对此反应强烈，动员支持者并动用警方力量来压制抗议活动。

此外，美国政府的态度也是影响局势的一个因素。拜登政府虽然表示支持古巴人民的和平抗议权利，但并未放松对古巴的制裁政策，这可能会影响古巴国内的局势发展。

总的来说，古巴的抗议活动反映了该国当前面临的严重经济和社会问题，以及民众对政府管理方式的不满。这些问题的根源复杂，涉及内部经济政策、外部制裁多重因素。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Cubans are protesting due to a combination of economic hardships, including food and medicine shortages, power outages, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as dissatisfaction with the political system and restrictions on freedom of expression. External factors, such as the U.S. embargo and recent tightening of sanctions by the Trump administration, have also contributed to the crisis.}} \]
