So I have this question: "How atypical development may impact on areas of development." Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to understand what "atypical development" means. I think "atypical" means not typical or unusual, so atypical development would be development that doesn't follow the usual pattern or expected milestones. Maybe it's when a child develops skills earlier or later than most other children, or maybe they develop certain skills differently.

I need to clarify this term because it's key to answering the question. Let me see if I can find a definition. Maybe I should look up "atypical development" to get a better understanding.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How atypical development may impact on areas of development." Okay, first things first, I need to make sure I understand what "atypical development" means. From what I gathered from the search results, atypical development refers to development that doesn't follow the usual pattern or expected milestones. It could be that a child develops skills earlier or later than most other children, or perhaps they develop certain skills differently. It's essentially when development falls outside of what's considered normal or typical for their age.

So, to answer this question, I need to explore how this kind of development affects different areas of a person's growth and development. Probably, this includes physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development. Maybe even cognitive development, like language and communication skills.

Let me see what the search results say about this. In Doc 1, it mentions that atypical development can impact social and emotional development. It also talks about atypical physical development affecting a child's social and emotional growth. So, it seems like there's a interplay between different areas of development.

Another point from Doc 1 is that atypical development can be a symptom of other underlying medical conditions, such as autism spectrum
