So I have this question: "Is perceptual development an innate or socially acquired process?" Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. First off, I need to understand what perceptual development is. I think it has something to do with how we perceive things around us, like seeing, hearing, touching, and so on. So, perceptual development must be about how these abilities grow and develop over time.

Now, the question is asking whether this development is innate or socially acquired. Innate means something we're born with, like our eye color or the ability to breathe. Socially acquired means we learn it through experience and interaction with others and our environment.

So, is our ability to perceive the world something we're born with, or do we learn it as we grow up? I guess it's a combination of both, but the question seems to want a more definitive answer. Maybe I should look into some theories or research on this topic.
