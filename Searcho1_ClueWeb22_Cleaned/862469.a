I'm trying to figure out how common late-term abortions are in the United States. First, I need to understand what is considered a "late-term" abortion. I think it generally refers to abortions performed in the later stages of pregnancy, but I'm not sure exactly when that starts. Maybe after the first trimester or around 20 weeks? I should look that up.

Also, I need to make sure I'm using accurate and recent data because statistics can change over time. Abortion is a sensitive topic, so I have to be careful to get information from reliable sources. Probably government health agencies or reputable research organizations would have the most accurate data.

Let me start by defining what late-term abortion means. I'll do a quick search to see if there's a standard definition.

Alright, I've got some information now. So, first things first, I need to understand what "late-term abortion" really means because it seems like there's some confusion around the term. From what I've read, "late-term abortion" isn't a medically recognized term. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says that it has no medical definition and isn't used in clinical settings. So, it seems like this is a term that's been created more for political or ideological reasons rather than medical ones.

Instead, abortions are typically categorized by the trimester of pregnancy they occur in. Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters:

- First trimester: up to 12 weeks

- Second trimester: 13 to 26 weeks

- Third trimester: 27 weeks until delivery

So, when people talk about "late-term abortions," they might be referring to abortions in the second or third trimester. But as I've learned, it's not a precise term, and its usage can be misleading.

Now, I need to find out how common these abortions are in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the vast majority of abortions—around 91%—occur in the first trimester. Only about 9% happen in the second trimester, and less than 1% occur in the third trimester.

Wait, but I need to verify this because different sources might have slightly different statistics. Let me check another reliable source, like the Guttmacher Institute, which is a research organization focused on reproductive health.
