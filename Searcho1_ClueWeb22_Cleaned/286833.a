So I have this question: "How can wealthy countries aid other countries?" It seems pretty broad, but I think it's an important topic. I need to think about the different ways that richer nations can help those that are less economically developed. Maybe I should start by understanding what makes a country wealthy and how that wealth can be used to support others.

First off, wealthy countries usually have stronger economies, better infrastructure, and more resources available to them. So, they might be in a position to provide financial assistance, share technology, or offer educational opportunities to less developed countries. But I need to dig deeper than that.

Let me consider some specific examples. For instance, the United States has a lot of economic power. What does it do to help other countries? I know there's something called foreign aid, where rich countries give money or resources to poorer ones. Maybe I should look into how that works.

Wait, maybe I should do a search to get more concrete information on this. Like, what are the main ways that wealthy countries assist others, and are there any statistics on how effective these methods are.
