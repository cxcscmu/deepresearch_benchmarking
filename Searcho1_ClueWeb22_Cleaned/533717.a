Alright, so I need to figure out how the Spanish Flu changed society. I don't remember much about it off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research. First things first, I should probably understand what the Spanish Flu was and when it happened.

I think it was a really bad flu pandemic that happened a while back, maybe in the early 1900s. But I'm not sure about the dates or the details. So, I need to look that up.
