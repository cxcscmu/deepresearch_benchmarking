Alright, so I need to figure out what the resistances to imperialism in Africa and India had in common. Okay, first things first, I should probably understand what imperialism is. Imperialism, as I recall, is when a country extends its influence over other countries, usually through colonization, economic dominance, or both. So, in the context of Africa and India, we're talking about European powers, particularly Britain and France, taking control of these regions.

Now, resistance to imperialism would mean efforts by the people of these regions to oppose or fight back against this foreign control. So, I need to look at the resistance movements in Africa and India and see what similarities there are between them.

Let me start by thinking about the Indian resistance. I know that India was under British rule for a long time, and there were several movements aimed at gaining independence. The Indian National Congress was one such organization that played a key role in the freedom struggle. There were non-violent movements led by Gandhi, like the Salt March, which was a protest against the British salt tax. So, non-violent civil disobedience was a significant aspect of Indian resistance.

There were resistance movements there, like the African National Congress (ANC), which fought against apartheid. In other parts of Africa, there were nationalist movements seeking independence from colonial powers. For example, in Algeria, there was a war of independence against French rule.

So, one commonality might be the use of both violent and non-violent methods in resistance. In India, there was a strong emphasis
