Alright, so I need to figure out how global warming affects the environment. I know that global warming is kind of like the Earth getting warmer over time, but I'm not exactly sure what causes it or how it impacts the planet. I think it has something to do with greenhouse gases, but beyond that, I'm a bit fuzzy. So, I should probably start by understanding what global warming is and then look into its effects on the environment.

First things first, I need to define global warming. From what I recall, it's the long-term warming of the planet due to human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. These gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, build up and act like a blanket, trapping heat from the sun and causing the Earth's average temperature to rise. This is different from regular weather fluctuations, which can be cold or hot in the short term.

Now, I need to think about how this warming affects the environment. I've heard about things like melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and changes in ecosystems. But I need to understand these in more detail and see if there are other impacts as well.

Let me start with melting ice caps and rising sea levels. I know that as the Earth warms, polar
