Alright, so I've got this question: "How does global stratification impact local culture?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what global stratification means in this context, but I think it has something to do with inequalities around the world. Local culture refers to the customs, beliefs, and practices of a specific place, right? So, I need to figure out how these global inequalities affect those local practices.

First, maybe I should define global stratification more clearly. I recall that stratification generally means layering or ranking, so global stratification probably refers to the ranking of countries or societies on a global scale, often based on economic factors like GDP or development indices. So, it's about the hierarchical arrangement of nations or regions in the world based on their socioeconomic status.

Now, how does this hierarchy impact local cultures? I think there are a few ways this could happen. One is through economic pressures. For example, poorer countries might feel pressure to adopt practices from richer countries in order to attract investment or improve their economy. This could lead to a dilution or transformation of their local culture as they adopt foreign practices.

Another aspect is cultural diffusion. With globalization, cultures spread across borders more easily. So, the culture of more powerful or higher-stratified countries might spread and influence local cultures in less stratified regions. This could lead to cultural homogenization, where local cultures become more similar to global trends, perhaps losing some of their unique characteristics.

Moreover, there's the issue of cultural appreciation versus cultural appropriation. In stratified systems, dominant
