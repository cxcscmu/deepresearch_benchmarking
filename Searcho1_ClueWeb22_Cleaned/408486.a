So I've got this question: "Why does the Protestant Bible have fewer books than other versions?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has something to do with different Christian denominations accepting
having different canonical standards. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First off, I know that the Bible is divided into two main parts: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The New Testament is consistent across most Christian traditions, but I believe there are differences in the Old Testament books included. So, perhaps the variation in the number of books is mainly in the Old Testament.

I recall that some churches include certain books that others don't. For example, I think there are some books like Judith or Maccabees that are in some Bibles but not others. Maybe Protestant Bibles exclude these books. But why is that?

I think this has to do with the history of the Bible and how different branches of Christianity decided which books to include as canonical. Canonical means that the books are considered authoritative and inspired by God.

Let me see if I can remember any specific events or decisions that led to these differences. I believe that around the time of the Reformation, Protestant leaders revisited the canon of Scripture and made decisions based on certain criteria.

Perhaps they decided to go back to the Hebrew Bible for the Old Testament, rather than the Greek version known as the Septuagint, which includes additional books. If that's the case, then the difference might stem from whether these extra books were originally part of the Hebrew Scriptures.

Wait a minute, I need to verify that. Maybe I should look up the difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint. Maybe that will clarify things.
