I've been asked to look into why women often earn less than men. This is a complex issue, and I know there are many factors involved. I need to approach this carefully and make sure I get accurate information. Maybe starting with some basic statistics would be a good idea.

First, I should check what the current gender pay gap is. I think it varies by country and industry, so perhaps I should focus on a specific region, like the United States, for the sake of this discussion.

Let me try to find some recent data on the gender pay gap in the US. I recall that women earn about 80% of what men earn, but I'm not sure if that's still accurate.
