Alright, so I've got this question: "What future problems would result from scarce resources?" Hmm, scarce resourcesâ€” that sounds like it's related to stuff like water, food, minerals, maybe even things like energy sources. I guess the idea is that if these resources become scarce, there will be various problems in the future. But what exactly? I need to think this through step by step.

First off, I should probably define what scarce resources are. Scarce resources are those that are not available in sufficient quantities to meet demand. So, if something is scarce, it means there's not enough of it to go around for everyone who wants or needs it. That could be due to depletion, poor management, or just natural limitations.

Now, considering the future, there are a few trends that might exacerbate resource scarcity. For one, the world population is growing. More people mean higher demand for resources. According to the United Nations, the global population is expected to reach around 9.7 billion by 2050. That's a significant increase from where we are now, which is over 7.9 billion.

Secondly, economic development in many countries is leading to increased consumption. As people get richer, they tend to consume
