Alright, so I have this question about redlining and how it affects people today. I'm not super familiar with the term, but I know it has something to do with housing and discrimination. Maybe I should start by understanding what redlining actually is.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How does redlining affect people today?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what redlining is. From what I recall, redlining is a practice where financial institutions deny services to certain neighborhoods based on the race or ethnicity of the people living there. It's a form of discrimination that has had lasting effects on communities, particularly African American communities in the United States.

I think it's important to get a solid definition and some historical context before diving into its current impacts. Maybe I should look up some reliable sources to refresh my memory.

So, I'll start by searching for "what is redlining" to get a clear understanding.
