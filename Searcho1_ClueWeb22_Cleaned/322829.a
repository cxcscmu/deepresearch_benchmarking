So I'm trying to figure out why car hire is so expensive. I've noticed that when I book a rental car, especially during peak seasons or in popular tourist areas, the prices can be really high. I want to understand what drives up the cost of car rentals. Maybe it's the demand, or perhaps there are hidden fees I don't know about. I should probably look into this step by step.

First, I think about supply and demand. If there are lots of people wanting to rent cars in a certain area or time, like during holidays, the prices might go up because of high demand and limited supply. It's similar to how airline tickets get more expensive during vacation times.

Let me consider that. So, if a lot of people want to rent cars, say, during summer vacations or major events, the rental companies can charge more. But even outside of those times, I've noticed that car rentals aren't exactly cheap. So maybe there's more to it than just supply and demand.

Maybe the cost of maintaining the cars plays a big role. Rental cars have to be serviced regularly, insured, and kept in good condition to attract customers. All those maintenance costs probably add up and are passed on to the renters.

Also, rental companies have overhead costs like staff salaries, rental space for their offices and parking areas, marketing, and so on. These expenses must be covered somehow, and likely they incorporate them into the rental rates.

Another thing I've observed is that sometimes rental companies charge extra for things like GPS devices, extra drivers, or additional insurance coverage. These optional add-ons can inflate the total cost significantly.

Wait, and there are often taxes and fees that are added to the base rental price. Sometimes these can be as much as 20-30% of the rental cost. So that's another factor contributing to the overall expense.

Perhaps location also plays a part. Renting a car in a big city like New York or London is more expensive than in a smaller town. Maybe because of higher operating costs in urban areas, or greater competition among rental agencies driving up prices.

I should also think about the type of vehicle being rented. Luxury cars or SUVs are going to cost more than economy cars. But even the cheapest options seem pricey to me.

Let me see if I can find some specific reasons online. Maybe there's some industry insight that can explain this.

Alright, so I've got some information from these articles. It seems like the main reason car hire is expensive right now is due to a combination of high demand and low supply. Let me try to break this down.

First, during the pandemic, many people weren't traveling, so rental car companies had a lot of cars that weren't being used. To cut costs, they sold off a bunch of their fleet. According to one source, they got rid of over 770,000 vehicles. That makes sense because if no one's renting, you don't need that many cars sitting around costing you money.

Then, as vaccines became available and people started traveling again, the demand for rental cars surged. But the companies didn't have enough cars to meet this sudden increase in demand because they'd just sold off a lot of their fleet. So, now there are fewer cars available, but more people wanting to rent them. Basic economics tells me that when demand goes up and supply stays the same or decreases, prices go up. That seems to be what's happening here.

Additionally, there's a global semiconductor chip shortage affecting the auto industry. These chips are essential for manufacturing new cars, including rental cars. So, even if rental companies wanted to restock their fleets, they're facing delays because car manufacturers can't produce vehicles fast enough due to the chip shortage. This is compounding the problem, keeping the supply of rental cars low.

One article mentioned that rental car prices in June were 88% higher than the same time last year and 76% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic. That's a significant increase!

Some people are turning to alternatives like renting U-Haul trucks or using car-sharing services like Turo. It seems like these options might be more affordable, although they might not be ideal for everyone, especially if you're traveling with a larger group or need a more comfortable vehicle.

Another point is that booking rental cars well in advance can help secure better rates, but even that might not be enough given the current shortages. Some travelers are finding that prices have increased dramatically even for bookings made months in advance.

I also noticed that some rental companies are charging higher daily rates, but others might have weekly or longer-term rates that could be more economical. So, it might be worth checking if renting for a longer period could save money.

Overall, it seems like the high cost of car hire is primarily due to the imbalance between supply and demand, exacerbated by the semiconductor chip shortage. Until rental companies can replenish their fleets and meet the increased demand, prices are likely to remain high.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{High demand and low supply due to pandemic-related fleet reductions and semiconductor chip shortages are causing car hire prices to be expensive.}} \]
