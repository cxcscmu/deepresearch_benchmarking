I'm trying to figure out how the Ottoman genocide ended. First off, I need to make sure I understand what the Ottoman genocide refers to. I think it's related to the mass killings and deportations carried out by the Ottoman Empire, particularly against the Armenian population, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.
