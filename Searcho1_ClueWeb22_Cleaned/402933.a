Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects developed countries. I know that climate change is a big deal worldwide, but I'm specifically supposed to think about its impacts on developed nations. I'm not entirely sure where to start, so maybe I should begin by understanding what constitutes a developed country and then see how climate change might affect them differently compared to developing countries.

First off, what defines a developed country? Typically, these are countries with higher levels of economic development, technological advancement, and a better standard of living. They usually have more robust infrastructure, stronger economies, and better social services. Examples include the United States, countries in Western Europe, Japan, and Australia.

Now, climate change impacts are broad and varied, affecting various aspects like agriculture, health, infrastructure, and economy. I need to consider how these areas are affected in developed countries.

Let me start with agriculture. I think that even in developed countries, agriculture can be vulnerable to climate change. For instance, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect crop yields. Developed countries might have more advanced agricultural technologies, but extreme weather events like droughts or floods can still cause significant damage. Maybe I should look up some specific examples to see how this plays out.
