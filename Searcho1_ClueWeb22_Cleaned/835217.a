As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information based on scientific consensus and research findings. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global climate change is already affecting various aspects of human life, including agriculture, water resources, human health, and ecosystems. These impacts can lead to changes in lifestyle, migration patterns, and economic activities for many people around the world.

To provide a more detailed answer, I would need to consider specific examples and data related to how climate change affects different populations. For instance, rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, extreme weather events become more frequent, and shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns affect crop yields. These changes can force people to adapt their ways of living or even relocate, thereby significantly altering their lives.

In conclusion, yes, global climate change can indeed change people's lives in numerous ways, often requiring significant adjustments and adaptations.
