So I have this question: "How has mental health changed over the years?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I guess it's about how our understanding and approach to mental health have evolved over time. I don't know much about the history of mental health, so I'll need to do some research to answer this properly.

First, I should probably look into how mental health was perceived in the past compared to now. I remember hearing about asylum treatments in the 1800s, which sound really barbaric by today's standards. So, there must have been significant changes since then.

Maybe I should start by finding out when the concept of mental health began to take shape. I think psychology as a science started around the late 19th century with people like SigmFreud and Ivan Pavlov. Before that, mental illnesses were often attributed to supernatural causes or moral weakness.

Let me consider doing a search to get a clearer timeline of important events and shifts in perspective regarding mental health.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How has mental health changed over the years?" I need to figure out how to approach this. It seems pretty broad, so I should probably break it down into smaller parts. Maybe look at how society's perception of mental health has changed, how treatments have evolved, and any significant milestones or shifts in understanding over time.

First off, I remember that in the past, mental illnesses were often misunderstood and treated poorly. Things like exorcisms, chaining people up, and other inhumane practices were common. It would be interesting to see how we've progressed from there.

I think starting with a brief overview of historical perspectives on mental health would be a good idea. Like, in ancient times, how did different cultures view mental health? Did they see it as a spiritual issue, a medical condition, or something else entirely?

Let me consider doing a search to get some background information.
