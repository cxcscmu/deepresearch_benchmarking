Alright, so I need to figure out what constitutes a hostile work environment. This seems important because it affects people's jobs and well-being. I've heard the term before, but I'm not exactly sure what it means legally or practically. Maybe I should start by understanding what a hostile work environment is and what causes it.

First, I think a hostile work environment is when someone feels unsafe or uncomfortable at their workplace due to certain behaviors or actions by their colleagues, supervisors, or even clients. It could involve harassment, discrimination, or just overall negative behavior that makes it hard for someone to do their job.

But, I need to be more specific. Maybe I should look into legal definitions to understand what qualifies as a hostile work environment in the eyes of the law. I recall that there are laws protecting employees from such environments, but I don't know the details.

Perhaps I should do some research to get a clearer picture. Let me try searching for "what is a hostile work environment" to see what comes up.
