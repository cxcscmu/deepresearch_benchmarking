So I have this question: "How did the Mexican Cession impact slavery?" Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I know that the Mexican Cession has something to do with the expansion of the United States in the 19th century. I think it had to do with the Mexican-American War, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, I need to figure out how this event affected slavery in the United States.

First things first, I should probably understand what the Mexican Cession is. I think it refers to the territory that Mexico ceded to the United States after the Mexican-American War in 1848. So, maybe I need to look into that war and the treaty that ended it, which I believe is called the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

I should probably do some research to get the facts straight. Maybe start by searching for "Mexican Cession" to get a better understanding of what it was and when it happened.
