Alright, I need to understand the causes and consequences of World War I. I don't remember a lot about this from history class, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information. Let's start by figuring out what caused WWI.

I think it had something to do with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but I know that wasn't the only reason. There must have been underlying tensions and alliances that led to the war. Maybe I should look into the system of alliances before WWI.

Also, I've heard about militarism, imperialism, and nationalism being factors. Perhaps those played a role in igniting the conflict. I should probably read up on each of these and see how they contributed to the start of the war.

Once I have a grasp on the causes, I can move on to the consequences. I know that WWI was a major turning point in history, leading to significant changes in the political landscape. The war resulted in the collapse of empires and the redrawing of borders. It also set the stage for WWII, so there must be some long-term consequences that are important to understand.

Maybe I should make an outline to organize my thoughts. First, list the main causes, then discuss the immediate and long-term consequences. That might help me present the information clearly.

Let me start by searching for the causes of WWI.
