I'm trying to understand why Armenia and Azerbaijan are at war. I know a little bit about it, but I want to get a clearer picture. So, I think I need to look into their history and see what's been going on between them.

First off, both Armenia and Azerbaijan are countries in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Armenia is bordered by Turkey to the west, Azerbaijan to the east, and Georgia to the north, while Azerbaijan shares borders with Russia and Iran as well. So, it's a pretty strategic location.

I recall that there's a disputed region between them called Nagorno-Karabakh. I think that's at the heart of their conflict. Maybe I should start by understanding what Nagorno-Karabakh is.
