Alright, so I've got this question about how smart, connected products are transforming competition. I'm not entirely sure what "smart, connected products" are, but I think they're like devices that can connect to the internet and have some intelligence built-in. Maybe like smartphones or smart home devices. But I need to be sure about that.

First, I should probably define what smart, connected products are. Maybe I can look that up. I think understanding the basics is important before I can see how they're changing competition.

Alright, so I've got this question about how smart, connected products are transforming competition. I've done some searching and found a few articles that seem relevant. Let me try to make sense of this.

First, I looked up what smart, connected products are. From what I've read, they are basically devices that can connect to the internet and have some sort of intelligence built-in. Like smartphones, smart home devices, or even industrial machines that can send and receive data. So, these products aren't just standalone items; they're part of a larger system that can collect and use data.

One article I found was from HBR, titled How Smart, Connected Products Are Transforming Companies. It seems pretty comprehensive. It talks about how these products are changing not just how companies compete externally, but also how they operate internally. So, it's affecting both the external and internal aspects of businesses.

Externally, I guess it's changing competition because companies that can make better use of data from their products can innovate faster, offer better services, and maybe even create new business models. For example, instead of just selling a product, they can offer it as a service, like Tesla's autopilot feature that can be updated over time.

Internally, it's reshaping how companies are organized and operate. Functions like product development, IT, manufacturing, logistics, marketing, sales, and after-sale service are all being transformed because of these smart, connected products.

Let me think about this. So, if a company makes smart, connected products, they can collect a lot of data from those products. That data can tell them how the product is being used, where it's being used, how it's performing, and maybe even predict when it might need maintenance.

This is different from traditional products, where once you sell the product, that's it. You don't really have any more interaction with it unless there's a problem. But with smart, connected products, the relationship with the product and the customer is continuous. The company can keep updating the product, improving it, and offering new features over time.

This must be really transformative for companies because it changes their whole business model. They're not just selling a product; they're selling a ongoing service or experience.

Also, from a competitive standpoint, companies that can harness the data from their products can gain a lot of insights into customer behavior, product performance, and market trends. This can give them a competitive edge over rivals that are still stuck in the traditional way of doing things.

Moreover, these smart, connected products can be part of larger ecosystems. For example, a smart thermostat can be connected to other smart home devices, creating a whole smart home system. So, companies that can integrate their products into these ecosystems can attract more customers and create more value.

On the internal side, companies need to reorganize themselves to handle all this new data and the continuous interaction with products and customers. They need to have strong IT infrastructure, data analytics capabilities, and maybe even new departments focused solely on managing product data and customer relationships.

It's interesting how this shift to smart, connected products is forcing companies to become more data-driven and tech-savvy. Even traditional manufacturing companies have to start thinking like software companies, because a lot of the value in these products comes from the software and the data they generate.

I can see how this is leading to a blurring of lines between different industries. For example, a car manufacturer might now be competing with tech companies that are developing autonomous driving software. So, it's not just about making a reliable car; it's about providing a seamless, high-tech driving experience.

Furthermore, the article mentions that companies need to make decisions about where to play in this new landscape. Do they focus on individual products, families of products, or entire platforms? This must be a tough strategic question for many companies.

Also, there's the issue of security. With all these connected products, there's a risk of hacking and data breaches. So, companies need to invest heavily in cybersecurity to protect their products and their customers' data.

Overall, it seems like smart, connected products are driving a fundamental shift in how companies operate and compete. It's not just about making better products; it's about creating a whole ecosystem around those products that provides ongoing value to customers.

I think to answer the question about how smart, connected products are transforming competition, I need to highlight both the external and internal changes they're bringing about.

Externally, they're changing how companies compete by:

1. Allowing for continuous innovation and improvement of products post-sale.

2. Enabling new business models, like product-as-a-service.

3. Providing valuable data insights that can inform product development and marketing strategies.

4. Facilitating the creation of ecosystems and platforms that integrate multiple products and services.

5. Increasing the importance of cybersecurity and data protection.

Internally, they're transforming companies by:

1. Redefining core functions like product development, IT, manufacturing, and after-sale service.

2. Requiring new skills and expertise, such as data analytics and software engineering.

3. Demanding greater coordination and integration across different functions.

4. Leading to the creation of new departments focused on data management and customer success.

5. Necessitating investments in new technologies and infrastructure to handle data and connectivity.

So, in summary, smart, connected products are revolutionizing competition by creating new avenues for value creation, requiring companies to become more data-driven and agile, and forcing them to rethink their entire business models and organizational structures.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Smart, connected products are transforming competition by enabling continuous innovation, new business models, data-driven insights, ecosystem integrations, and requiring significant internal restructuring and investment in data and cybersecurity.}} \]
