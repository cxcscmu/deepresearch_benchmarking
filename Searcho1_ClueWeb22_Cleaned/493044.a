I'm trying to understand why some people want to overturn Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade is a Supreme Court case from 1973 that legalized abortion nationwide in the United States. Overturning it would likely lead to more restrictions on abortion access. But I need to look into the reasons behind this movement.

First, I should probably understand what Roe v. Wade actually did. From what I recall, it established a woman's right to choose to have an abortion, based on the privacy rights afforded by the Constitution. It set a framework for when abortions could be regulated by the states, based on the trimesters of pregnancy.

But why do some people want to overturn this decision? I think it's mostly related to moral and religious beliefs about when life begins and the sanctity of human life. Many opponents believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is equivalent to murder. Therefore, they argue that it should be illegal.

I should look up some statistics on public opinion about Roe v. Wade to see how opinions have changed over time. Maybe there are political factors at play as well.

Let me consider doing a search to get more accurate information.

Alright, so I've got some search results here about public opinion on Roe v. Wade and abortion in general. Let's see what I can make of this.

First, there's a Pew Research Center article from 2013 that talks about public opinion on abortion and Roe v. Wade. It says that around 25% of the public sees abortion as morally wrong and wants Roe v. Wade overturned, while 18% see it as wrong but don't want the decision overturned. About 42% don't see it as morally wrong and don't want the decision overturned. So, it seems like a significant portion wants to keep Roe v. Wade as is, but there's a notable group that wants it overturned.

Another Pew Research Center article from 2019 indicates that 61% of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 38% think it should be illegal in all or most cases. Only 28% want Roe v. Wade completely overturned, while 70% don't want to see it overturned. This suggests that the majority supports legal abortion and wants to maintain the status quo set by Roe v. Wade.

Looking at the demographic breakdown, it's interesting to see that Democrats are more likely to support legal abortion, with 82% saying it should be legal in all or most cases, whereas Republicans are split, with 62% saying it should be illegal in all or most cases, especially among conservative Republicans (77%).

There's also a mention of ideological divisions within parties. For example, liberal Democrats are more likely to support legal abortion in all cases, while conservative and moderate Democrats are more split. Similarly, moderate and liberal Republicans are more likely to support legal abortion than conservative Republicans.

The article also notes that there's a growing partisan gap on this issue, with Democrats becoming more supportive of legal abortion over time, widening the difference with Republicans.

Another source is from Gallup in 2021, which reports that 58% of Americans don't want Roe v. Wade overturned, while 32% do. This aligns with the Pew findings.

Gallup also tested specific restrictions on abortion, like banning abortions after 18 weeks, after detecting a fetal heartbeat, or in cases where the fetus has a genetic disease. Majorities opposed these bans, suggesting that while people support Roe v. Wade, they may also have concerns about late-term abortions or abortions for specific reasons.

There's also a Washington Examiner op-ed that argues most people don't actually support Roe v. Wade because they don't understand what it entails. The author suggests that when people are properly informed about what Roe v. Wade does, support is not as high as polls suggest. The op-ed references a Marist and NPR poll where only 18% support the idea of a constitutional right to abortion up until birth.

This raises an important point about how poll questions are phrased. If people are told that Roe v. Wade allows abortion up until birth, their support might decrease compared to a general statement about supporting Roe v. Wade.

From the Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 54% want abortion to be more restricted than it currently is, which could be seen as a de facto endorsement of overturning or limiting Roe v. Wade.

However, another point is that many people think overturning Roe v. Wade would ban all abortions, which isn't necessarily the case. Overturning Roe would likely return the issue to the states, allowing for a variety of laws, some more restrictive and some less so.

So, to summarize, the majority of Americans support legal abortion and want to maintain Roe v. Wade. However, there's a significant minority that wants to overturn it, largely due to moral and religious beliefs about when life begins and the sanctity of human life.

Moreover, there's a complex landscape of opinions on specific restrictions and circumstances under which abortion should be allowed. It's also clear that how poll questions are phrased can influence responses, and there may be misunderstanding about what exactly Roe v. Wade entails.

Given all this, it seems that the primary reason people want to overturn Roe v. Wade is a moral objection to abortion, coupled with a desire to allow states to pass stricter abortion laws or even ban it entirely.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Moral and religious objections to abortion, coupled with a desire for states to have more control over abortion laws.}} \]
