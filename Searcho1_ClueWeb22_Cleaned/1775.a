So I have this question: "Why did the Soviet Union set up communist governments in Eastern Europe?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has something to do with the Cold War and the spread of communism. Maybe I should look that up to get a better understanding.

During World War II, the Soviet Union fought against Nazi Germany and ended up occupying a large part of Eastern Europe. So, perhaps after the war, they installed communist governments in those countries to expand their influence.

But why exactly? Was it to protect themselves from future attacks from the West? Or was it to spread communism as per Marxist ideology? Maybe both? I need to find out more about this.

World War II ended in 1945, and soon after, the Cold War began between the Soviet Union and the Western capitalist countries, particularly the United States. So, maybe setting up communist governments in Eastern Europe was a strategic move to create a buffer zone against the West.

On the other hand, communism aims for a global revolution, so perhaps the Soviet Union wanted to spread communism beyond its borders. But I'm not sure how much of it was ideological versus pragmatic.
