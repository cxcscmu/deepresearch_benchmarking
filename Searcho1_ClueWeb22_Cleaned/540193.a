One thing that comes to mind is training and education. XR can provide immersive training scenarios that are realistic and safe. For example, employees in dangerous jobs like construction or manufacturing can practice hazardous tasks in a simulated environment without risking actual injury. This could lead to better-trained workers and safer workplaces.

Another area where XR might be useful is in product design and visualization. Architects and engineers
