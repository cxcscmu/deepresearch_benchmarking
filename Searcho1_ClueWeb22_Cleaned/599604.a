I've been hearing a lot about Critical Race Theory (CRT) lately, and it seems like there's a lot of controversy surrounding it. I'm not entirely sure what it is or why people are against it, so I need to educate myself on this topic. Let me start by understanding what CRT actually is.

First, I should probably look up what Critical Race Theory is. It sounds like an academic concept, so maybe it's something studied in universities. I think it has to do with race and law, but I'm not sure. Perhaps I can find some reliable sources to define it.

Alright, so I've got this information about Critical Race Theory. From what I can gather, CRT is an academic concept that examines how race and racism are embedded in laws, policies, and institutions in the United States. It suggests that racism isn't just about individual prejudices but is systemic and has deep roots in history, particularly in practices like slavery and segregation.

Looking at Doc 1, it provides a pretty detailed overview of CRT, including its five core principles:

1. Race is a social construct, not a biological reality.

2. Racism is centrality, meaning it's not just about a few bad apples but is embedded in society and its institutions.

3. There's a commitment to social justice to eradicate racism and oppression.

4. Experiential knowledge, like storytelling and personal narratives, is crucial for understanding racism.

5. It's interdisciplinary, drawing from various fields to address issues of racism.

Doc 2 from The New York Times offers some context on how CRT has become a political issue, especially in education. It mentions that while CRT is not typically taught directly in K-12 schools, some ideas related to it are being incorporated into teacher training and curriculum. This has led to a backlash from some conservatives who argue that teaching about systemic racism divides people into oppressors and oppressed based on race.

Doc 3 from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund provides a perspective on why CRT is under attack. They argue that attempts to ban CRT are part of a larger effort to suppress discussions about racism and to control the narrative of American history. The bans are seen as attacks on free speech and efforts to silence truthful discussions about race and racism.

Doc 4 from Dictionary.com gives a concise definition of CRT and notes that it has become a target of criticism, particularly among conservatives who see it as divisive. The dictionary entry also points out that the term "critical" in CRT often leads to misunderstanding, as it refers to critical analysis rather than being purely negative or critical in the everyday sense.

Finally 5 is an encyclopedia entry that delves into the historical origins of CRT and its key tenets. It emphasizes that CRT views racism as a product of social thought and power relations and that it operates through structures and assumptions that are normalized in society.

So, synthesizing this information, CRT is an academic framework that analyzes how race and racism are institutionalized in society, particularly through laws and policies. It's not about blaming individual whites for being racist, but about understanding how systems and structures perpetuateracial inequalities.

Now, why are people against it? From what I can see, there are a few reasons:

1. Misunderstanding: Some people conflate CRT with ideas like inherent white racism or that all whites are oppressive. But CRT actually argues that racism is systemic, not that all white people are individually racist.

2. Political Agenda: Conservative politicians and groups have politicized CRT, using it as a scapegoat for broader issues around race and education. By painting CRT as divisive, they can mobilize their base and push for legislation that aligns with their agenda.

3. Fear of Change: Discussions about systemic racism challenge the status quo and may require significant changes in policies and practices. This can be threatening to those who benefit from the current system.

4. Control of Narrative: There's a desire to control how history is taught and perceived. By opposing CRT, some aim to maintain a version of history that downplays or ignores the injustices faced by people of color.

It's important to note that the backlash against CRT is not just about academic theory; it's part of a larger cultural and political battle over the narrative of American history and the role of race in society.

In conclusion, Critical Race Theory is a scholarly approach to understanding and addressing systemic racism. The opposition to it stems from misunderstandings, political maneuvering, and a resistance to confronting uncomfortable truths about history and contemporary society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People are against Critical Race Theory due to misunderstandings about its goals, political motivations to control the narrative of history, and resistance to acknowledging systemic racism.}} \]
