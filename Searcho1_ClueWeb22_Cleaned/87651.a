I'm trying to understand why home prices are so high. It seems like everywhere you look, houses are priced really high, and it's hard for people to afford them. I need to figure out what's causing this. Maybe it's supply and demand? Or maybe there are other factors at play. I should probably look into economic principles and see how they apply to the housing market.

First, I know that in economics, prices are often determined by supply and demand. If there's a high demand for something and a low supply, prices tend to go up. So, maybe in the case of homes, there aren't enough houses being built to meet the number of people who want to buy them. That could be one reason why prices are high.

But wait, I've also heard that in some areas, there's a lot of new construction, and prices are still high. So, maybe it's not just about the number of houses available. There must be more to it.

Another thing I've noticed is that in certain cities, like San Francisco or New York, homes are extremely expensive. But even in some smaller towns
