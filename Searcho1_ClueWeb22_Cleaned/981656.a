I've been wondering why some people who are exposed to COVID don't end up getting sick. It seems like not everyone who comes into contact with the virus actually contracts it. There must be some reasons behind this. Let me try to figure this out.

First, I need to understand how COVID spreads. I know that it's primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. So, if someone is near an infected person, they might inhale these droplets containing the virus. That's one way exposure happens.

But not everyone who is exposed gets infected. There must be factors that influence whether the virus takes hold in a person's body or not. Maybe it has something to do with the virus itself, or perhaps it's about the person's immune system, or maybe even the environment they're in.

Let me consider the virus first. Perhaps some exposures involve a low amount of viral particles, which might not be enough to cause infection. I've heard terms like "viral load" â€“ maybe if the exposure leads to a small viral load, the body can fight it off before it takes hold.

Also, the virus has to find its way into the body through certain entry points, like the nose, mouth, or eyes. If someone is exposed but manages to avoid touching their face, maybe that reduces the risk of infection.

Then there's the person's immune system. Some people have stronger immune systems than others. Factors like age, general health, vaccination status, and possibly genetic factors could play a role in determining whether someone gets infected after exposure.

Vaccination is a big factor, I think. People who are vaccinated have antibodies that can recognize and fight the virus more effectively. So, even if they're exposed, their immune system can act quickly to neutralize the virus before it causes illness.

Moreover, some people might have pre-existing immunity from previous infections or vaccinations against other coron
