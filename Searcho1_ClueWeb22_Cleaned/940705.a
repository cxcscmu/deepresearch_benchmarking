Alright, so I need to figure out how internships increase chances of employment. I'm not exactly sure where to start with this, but I think breaking it down into smaller parts might help.

First off, what is an internship? From what I understand, an internship is a period of work experience that students or entry-level candidates undertake to gain practical skills and knowledge in their field of study or interest. It's often unpaid or minimally paid, and it's a way for people to get a foot in the door in their desired industry.

Now, why would having an internship make someone more employable? I can think of a few reasons off the top of my head. Maybe it's because they gain real-world experience that looks good on their resume. Or perhaps it's about making connections in the industry, which could lead to job offers down the line. Also, internships might help candidates develop specific skills that are valued by employers.

Let me try to explore these ideas further. First, real-world experience. I think employers value candidates who have actually worked in their field because they've faced real problems and learned how to solve them. This kind of experience can't be taught in a classroom
