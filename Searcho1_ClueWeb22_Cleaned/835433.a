So I need to figure out what the short-term causes of World War I were. I know that WWI started in 1914 and lasted until 1918, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the immediate reasons that triggered it. I remember something about an assassination, but I need to understand how that led to a full-scale war involving so many countries.

First, I should probably look up the key events that happened right before the war started. Maybe around 1914. I think the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was important, but I need to know more about that and how it connects to the wider conflict.

Let me consider doing a search to get more details. Maybe I can look for "short-term causes of World War I" or "immediate causes of WWI." That should give me some pointers.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me read through them and see what I can gather about the short-term causes of World War I.

First document is from Reference.com. It says that the immediate cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austrian throne, by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo. This led to Austria declaring war on Serbia, and then things kind of snowballed because of all the alliances between the countries. So, the assassination seems like a key short-term cause.

The second document is from StudyMode and talks about long-term and short-term causes. It mentions that long-term causes include things like militarism, nationalism, imperialism, and the alliance system. The short-term cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which triggered Austria to declare war on Serbia. Then, because of alliances, other countries got pulled in.

The third document is also from Cram.com and discusses the same points. It emphasizes the formation of alliances and how they drew countries into the conflict. It also mentions the arms race between Germany and Britain, which added to the tension.

The fourth document is another StudyMode essay that delves into the roles of imperialism, nationalism, militarism, and alliances. It specifically mentions that militarism was a significant long-term cause because of the arms race and the buildup of military forces.

The fifth document is from a Weebly site and seems to focus more on the role of Russia in the lead-up to World War I. It talks about internal issues in Russia, like peasant uprisings and the development of opposition parties, leading up to the 1905 Revolution. It also mentions the Bosnian Crisis and the Balkan Wars, which seem to be important short-term events that contributed to the start of WWI.

So, from these sources, it seems like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is the immediate trigger, but there were other short-term events like the Bosnian Crisis and the Balkan Wars that created a volatile environment. The long-term causes provided the underlying tensions that made the situation explosive.

I think to answer the question about short-term causes, I should focus on the assassination and the series of events that followed, including the declarations of war and how the alliances came into play. Maybe I should also mention the Bosnian Crisis and the Balkan Wars, as they seem to have set the stage for the conflict.

Let me try to organize my thoughts:

1. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo was the immediate trigger.

2. Austria-Hungary, backed by Germany, issued an ultimatum to Serbia.

3. Serbia didn't fully comply, so Austria-declared war on Serbia.

4. Russia, feeling protective of Serbia, began to mobilize its troops.

5. Germany, allied with Austria-Hungary, saw Russia's mobilization as a threat and declared war on Russia.

6. France, allied with Russia, was then drawn into the conflict.

7. Germany invaded neutral Belgium to attack France, which led to Britain entering the war, as Britain had a treaty to protect Belgium.

So, the short-term causes seem to be a chain reaction starting from the assassination, leading to declarations of war, and the activation of military alliances.

Additionally, the Bosnian Crisis and the Balkan Wars were shorter-term events that increased tensions in the region and made the situation more unstable, contributing to the outbreak of a larger war.

I should also note that nationalism played a role in these short-term events, as the desire for independence and self-determination among different ethnic groups in the Balkans was a major factor in the conflicts.

So, in summary, the short-term causes of World War I include:

- The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

- The subsequent declarations of war by Austria-Hungary on Serbia, and by Germany on Russia and France.

- The activation of military alliances, particularly the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance.

- The Bosnian Crisis and the Balkan Wars, which heightened tensions in the region.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I need to make sure that I haven't missed any other short-term causes mentioned in the search results.

Looking back at the documents, the Weebly site talks about Russia's internal issues and its involvement in the Balkan Wars, but I think that fits more under the long-term causes or the context leading up to the war.

I should also consider whether the Anglo-German naval arms race is considered a short-term cause. While it's a long-term cause, perhaps its culmination in the years before WWI could be seen as a short-term factor.

But based on the search results, it seems that the main short-term causes are indeed the assassination and the chain reaction of declarations of war triggered by the alliances.

I think I have a good understanding now. Time to formulate my final answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The short-term causes of World War I included the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the subsequent declarations of war by Austria-Hungary on Serbia and by Germany on Russia and France, and the activation of military alliances such as the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance.
