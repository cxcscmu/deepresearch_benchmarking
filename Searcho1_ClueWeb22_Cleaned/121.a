I'm trying to understand how European "ethnics" became white and what changes made this possible. This seems like a complex topic involving history, sociology, and racial identity. I need to break this down step by step.

First, I should clarify what is meant by "European ethnics." I think this refers to immigrant groups from Europe who came to the United States, particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Groups like Italians, Poles, Jews, Irish, and others who were considered distinct ethnic groups with their own cultures and sometimes faced discrimination upon arrival.

The term "white" in this context likely refers to being accepted into the mainstream white American society, which historically has had its own definitions of who qualifies as white. So, the question is asking how these ethnic groups came to be seen as white and part of the mainstream, and what changes allowed that to happen.

I need to do some research to understand this better. Maybe start by looking into the history of immigration in the US and how different groups were perceived over time.
