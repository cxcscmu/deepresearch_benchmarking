Alright, I need to figure out what some of the legal and political effects of the Dred Scott decision were. I don't remember a lot about this, so I'll need to look it up and understand it step by step.

Alright, so I've read through these articles about the Dred Scott decision. Let me try to make sense of all this information and figure out what the legal and political effects were.

First off, who was Dred Scott? He was a slave owned by an army surgeon named Dr. John Emerson. Scott lived with Emerson in free states and territories, like Illinois and Wisconsin, where slavery was prohibited. Then, they moved back to Missouri, which was a slave state. Scott sued for his freedom, arguing that his time in free territories should make him free.

So, the case went through several trials. Initially, in Missouri state court, he won his freedom, but then the Missouri Supreme Court overturned that decision. Then, Scott sued in federal court against John Sanford, who was his owner's brother-in-law. Eventually, the case made its way to the US Supreme Court.

Now, the Supreme Court's decision in 1857 was really significant. The court, led by Chief Justice Roger Taney, made a few key points:

1. Scott wasn't a citizen, so he couldn't sue in federal court. The court said that people of African descent, whether free or slave, couldn't be citizens of the United States.

2. Even if Scott had been free while living in the free territories, returning to a slave state meant he was still a slave. The court said that the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited slavery in certain territories, was unconstitutional because Congress couldn't ban slavery in the territories.

3. Essentially, the court was saying that slaves were property, and just like any other property, owners had the right to take them anywhere in the country, and that no state or territory could outlaw slavery.

Okay, so what were the legal effects of this decision?

Well, legally, it meant that slaves weren't citizens and had no rights that white people were bound to respect. It also meant that Congress couldn't ban slavery in the territories, which was a big deal because the country was expanding westward, and there was a lot of debate about whether new states should be free or slave.

This decision basically invalidated the Missouri Compromise, which had been a careful balance between free and slave states. By saying that Congress couldn't prohibit slavery in the territories, it opened up all territories to the possibility of slavery.

Moreover, the decision fueled the fire of the abolitionist movement. It made northerners really upset because it seemed like the Supreme Court was siding with the South and protecting slavery. It also raised questions about states' rights versus federal authority.

Politically, the Dred Scott decision had huge implications consequences. It was one of the events that led up to the Civil War.

For one, it affected the presidential election of 1860. The Republican Party was against the expansion of slavery, and the Dred Scott decision made their position even more appealing to northerners who were against slavery.

Abraham Lincoln, who was a Republican candidate, spoke out against the decision, saying that the country couldn't survive half slave and half free. His opposition to the decision helped him gain support in the North.

On the other hand, southern states saw the decision as a victory for slavery. They felt that the Supreme Court was protecting their rights as slaveholders.

But the decision also caused division within the Democratic Party. Some Democrats supported the decision, while others didn't. This split helped the Republicans gain more power.

Furthermore, the decision led to more tension between the North and the South. It was seen as yet another example of the South trying to impose its views on the North.

After the decision, some northern states passed Personal Liberty Laws to counteract the effects of the Fugitive Slave Act, which was part of the Compromise of 1850. These laws were designed to protect free blacks from being kidnapped and sold into slavery.

So, in summary, the legal effects were that slaves weren't citizens, Congress couldn't ban slavery in the territories, and the Missouri Compromise was invalid. Politically, it deepened the divide between North and South, contributed to the rise of the Republican Party, and was a step towards the Civil War.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I need to make sure I present this information clearly in my answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Dred Scott decision had profound legal and political effects. Legally, it ruled that African Americans could not be citizens and that Congress lacked the power to ban slavery in territories, invalidating the Missouri Compromise.
