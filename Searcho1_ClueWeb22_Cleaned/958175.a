As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or biases. However, I can help you understand how to evaluate the bias of a news source like Business Insider.

First, it's important to recognize that all media outlets have some degree of bias, whether it's in their selection of stories, the角度 they approach them from, or the language they use. This is because journalists and editors are human and bring their own perspectives to their work.

To determine if Business Insider is biased, you can consider several factors:

1. **Ownership and Funding:** Look into who ownses Business Insider and where their funding comes from. If they are owned by a larger corporation with its own agenda, this could influence their reporting.

2. **Editorial Policies:** Check their editorial guidelines to see how they claim to approach news and storytelling.

3. **Coverage Range:** Observe the variety of topics they cover. A balanced outlet should cover a wide range of subjects without omitting certain areas.

4. **Perspective Analysis:** Read articles on similar topics from different sources and compare the perspectives presented. See if Business Insider consistently presents a particular viewpoint.

5. **Fact-Checking:** Verify the facts in their articles against other reputable sources to ensure accuracy.

6. **Reader Feedback:** Look at comments and feedback from readers to see if there are common complaints about bias.

7. **Transparency:** See if they are transparent about their sources and methods.

By considering these aspects, you can form a more informed opinion about whether Business Insider exhibits bias in its reporting.
