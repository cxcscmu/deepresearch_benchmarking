Alright, I need to figure out how terrorism has affected global trade. Hmm, this seems like a pretty broad topic, so I should probably break it down into smaller parts to understand it better.

First off, what is terrorism? Terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. So, it's about causing fear and instability to achieve certain goals.

Now, global trade refers to the exchange of goods, services, and resources between countries around the world. It's a system that connects economies and influences the flow of money, products, and sometimes even people.

So, how do these two things interact? I think terrorism can affect global trade in several ways. Let me try to list them out.

1. **Economic Instability:** Terrorism can create uncertainty and fear, which might lead to decreased consumer confidence and spending. If people are afraid for their safety, they might not travel or make big purchases, which can impact businesses that rely on tourism and international sales.

2. **Investment Decline:** Investors might be hesitant to put money into countries or regions that are perceived as unsafe due to terrorist activities. This could lead to a decrease in foreign direct investment, which is crucial for many economies, especially developing ones.

3. **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Acts of terrorism can disrupt supply chains by damaging infrastructure like ports, airports, or transportation routes. This can make it harder for goods to move across borders, increasing costs and delivery times.

4. **Insurance Costs:** The risk associated with terrorism can lead to higher insurance premiums for businesses involved in international trade. This added cost can make trading less profitable or even unfeasible for some companies.

5. **Policy Changes:** In response to terrorism, governments might implement stricter security measures at borders and ports. While these are meant to prevent future attacks, they can also slow down the movement of goods and increase administrative costs.

6. **Geopolitical Tensions:** Terrorism often escalates geopolitical tensions between countries, which can lead to trade restrictions, embargoes, or other forms of economic sanctions
