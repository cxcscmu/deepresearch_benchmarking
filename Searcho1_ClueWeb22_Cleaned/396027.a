I'm trying to figure out if the use of CAFOs compromises Ben & Jerry’s mission. First off, I need to understand what CAFOs are and what Ben & Jerry’s mission is.

So, CAFO stands for Confined Animal Feeding Operation. From what I know, these are large-scale farming operations where animals are kept and raised in confinement, often in very tight spaces. They're designed to maximize production efficiency but have been criticized for their treatment of animals and environmental impact.

Now, Ben & Jerry’s is a ice cream company known for its social and environmental activism. Their mission statement, as far as I remember, is about creating superior quality ice creams and sorbets, and using their business as a vehicle for positive change.

I need to see if their use of CAFOs aligns with this mission. To do that, I should look into whether Ben & Jerry’s actually uses CAFOs, because I'm not entirely sure.

Let me start by confirming if Ben & Jerry’s sources ingredients from CAFOs. Probably the main ingredient

Yes, Ben & Jerry’s uses milk and eggs in their ice cream, which likely come from CAFOs.
