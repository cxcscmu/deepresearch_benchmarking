Alright, so the question is whether humans are responsible for climate change. This is a big topic, and there's a lot of information out there, some of which might be conflicting. I need to approach this carefully and make sure I'm looking at reliable sources.

First off, I know that climate change is happening. Temperatures are rising, ice sheetss are melting, sea levels are increasing, and we're seeing more extreme weather events. But is this all due to human activity, or are there natural factors at play too?

I think it's important to understand what causes climate change. There are natural causes, like volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth's orbit, and variations in solar radiation. But in recent decades, there's been a lot of talk about human-induced climate change, primarily through the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.

So, maybe I should look into how much of the current climate change is attributed to human activities. I've heard terms like "anthropogenic climate change," which specifically refers to climate change caused by human actions.

Perhaps I should start by searching for scientific consensus on this issue. Scientists have been studying climate change for a long time, and I bet there are reports and studies that summarize their findings.

Let me try searching for something like "scientific consensus on human cause of climate change."

Alright, so I've got these search results here. Let's see what they're saying.

First document is from Newsweek, and it's titled in 2021. It talks about a study that looked at almost 90,000 climate research papers published between 2012 and 2020. The study found that only four papers out of 3,000 randomly selected ones were skeptical of human-caused climate change. Then, using an algorithm, they found only 28 skeptical papers out of 88,125 total papers. That's less than 0.0003%. So, according to this, there's overwhelming agreement that humans are causing climate change.

The second document is from Evidence Based Living at Cornell University, and it also mentions the same study. It says that more than 99% of peer-reviewed scientific studies agree that human activities are the主要 driving force behind climate change. It also notes that public opinion in the U.S. has remained around 60% believing in human-caused climate change over the past 20 years, but there's a political divide, with Democrats more likely to believe it's a serious issue and Republicans less likely.

The third document is from USA Today, and it's a fact check responding to someone who called human-caused climate change a "scam." The article asserts that scientific consensus is clear: humans are the主要 cause of climate change. It cites the "hockey stick" graph showing temperatures rising sharply in recent decades, which aligns with increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It also mentions that various scientific organizations and government bodies agree on this point.

The fourth document is another Newsweek article, probably the same as the first one, emphasizing that over 99.9% of scientists agree that humans are causing climate change. It mentions the upcoming COP26 summit and how this consensus should inform policy decisions.

The fifth document is from NASA's climate change page, which has a section on scientific consensus. It states that Earth's climate is warming, and it's "extremely likely" that human activities are the主要 cause. It lists multiple scientific organizations that have issued statements supporting this view, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Meteorological Society, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

So, from these sources, it's clear that there's a strong scientific consensus that humans are responsible for climate change. The percentages vary—97%, 99%, up to 99.9%—but the message is consistent: human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are the主要 drivers of observed climate warming.

But, I should consider if there are any credible sources that disagree with this consensus. Maybe I should look for studies or organizations that question human responsibility for climate change.

Okay, so now I have some sources that list scientists who disagree with the consensus on human-caused climate change. Let's see who's on this list.

Looking at the first document, it's a list from a website called Electroverse, and it has over 85 names of scientists who publicly disagree with the current consensus on climate change. It categorizes them into those who argue that global warming is primarily caused by natural processes, those who question the accuracy of IPCC climate models, those who say the cause is unknown, and those who think global warming will have few negative consequences.

Some of the names I recognize, like Frederick Seitz and Frederick Singer, who have been associated with industry-funded campaigns to cast doubt on climate science in the past.

The second document is from Livescience, and it talks about the debate between human-caused and naturally caused climate change. It mentions that while some scientists attribute climate change to natural causes like solar variations and orbital changes, the consensus is that human activities are the主要 cause.

The third document is from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which is part of the NIH. It's a letter to the editor in the British Medical Journal questioning the consensus on global warming and citing satellite data showing cooling trends.

The fourth document is from MediaMatters, which is a liberal-leaning media watchdog group. It lists various think tanks and individuals who are skeptical of climate change and are often featured in conservative media outlets.

So, from these sources, it seems that there are indeed scientists who disagree with the mainstream consensus on human-caused climate change. However, the number seems to be a minority compared to the overwhelming majority that agrees with human causation.

I should consider the credibility of these sources. Electroverse appears to be a blog or website that focuses on alternative views, possibly with a bias towards skepticism on climate change. MediaMatters is known for criticizing conservative media, so there might be some bias there as well.

I think it's important to look at the qualifications and funding sources of these dissenting scientists. Many of them seem to be associated with think tanks that receive funding from industries that have a stake in denying climate change, like fossil fuel companies.

For example, the Heartland Institute has received funding from Charles Koch and ExxonMobil, and their positions often align with the interests of these funders.

Similarly, the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute have also received funding from industries that oppose climate regulations.

So, while there are scientists who disagree with the consensus, their positions may be influenced by the funding they receive.

Moreover, some of these scientists may not have expertise directly related to climate science. For instance, James Taylor from Heartland is a lawyer, not a climate scientist.

I should also consider the peer-reviewed literature. The initial search results showed that over 99% of peer-reviewed studies support human-caused climate change.

Is there any peer-reviewed research that supports the positions of these dissenting scientists?

Maybe I should look for studies published by these scientists and see if their research stands up to scrutiny.

Let's take one example: Willie Soon, who is listed in the first document. He's an ast
