Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects natural disasters. Hmm, this seems like a pretty big topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, what exactly is climate change? I know that it refers to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns across the Earth. It's mainly caused by human activities, like burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures. That's called the greenhouse effect.

Now, natural disasters are extreme events that can cause damage to the environment and human societies. Examples include hurricanes, droughts, floods, wildfires, and heatwaves. So, the question is, how does climate change influence these types of events?

I think I should start by looking into specific types of natural disasters and see how climate change might affect them individually. Let's begin with hurricanes.

Hurricanes are large storm systems that form over warm ocean waters. They get their energy from the heat in the ocean. So, if ocean temperatures are rising due to climate change, that could potentially make hurricanes more powerful. I've heard that warmer oceans can lead to stronger hurricanes with higher wind speeds
