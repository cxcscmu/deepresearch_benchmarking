As an AI language model, I cannot provide personal opinions, but I can present some common reasons why domestic abuse occurs.

Domestic abuse can happen for a variety of reasons, and it is important to note that there is never an excuse for abuse. However, some common factors that may contribute to domestic abuse include:

1. Power and control: Abusers may use violence and manipulation to maintain power and control over their partner. They may feel entitled to control every aspect of their partner's life, including their finances, social interactions, and even their thoughts and feelings.

2. Learned behavior: Some people may have grown up in households where abuse was normalized, and they may have learned that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts or express anger.

3. Substance abuse: Alcohol and drug abuse can exacerbate existing issues and make it more likely for someone to become abusive.

4. Mental health issues: Some people who struggle with mental health issues may be more prone to violent behavior, especially if they are not receiving proper treatment.

5. Stress and frustration: High levels of stress and frustration can lead some people to lash out at their partners, especially if they lack healthy coping mechanisms.

It's essential to remember that domestic abuse is never the victim's fault, and no one deserves to be abused, regardless of the circumstances.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Domestic abuse happens due to a complex interplay of factors including power dynamics, learned behaviors, substance abuse, mental health issues, and stress.}} \]
