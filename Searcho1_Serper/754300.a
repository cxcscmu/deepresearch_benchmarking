So I have this question: "How did Socrates affect the world?" Hmm, I don't know much about Socrates, to be honest. I know he was an ancient Greek philosopher, but beyond that, I'm a bit fuzzy. I think I need to learn more about who he was and what he did to understand his impact on the world.

First things first, I should probably find out some basic facts about Socrates. Like, when he lived, where he was from, and what he was known for. I think he was from Athens, Greece
