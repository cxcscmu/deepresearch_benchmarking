Alright, so I need to figure out how Hitler's dictatorship ended. I know that Adolf Hitler was the leader of Nazi Germany, and his regime was known for its extreme policies, including genocide and aggressive warfare. But I'm not exactly sure how it all came to an end. I think it has something to do with World War II, but I need to get more specific than that.

First, maybe I should recall when Hitler came to power. I believe he became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933, and then consolidated his power to become the dictator shortly after. So, his rule lasted until the end of World War II, which was in 1945. That gives me a time frame, but I need to understand the events that led to the end of his dictatorship.

I think the key to understanding how his dictatorship ended is to look at the outcome of World War II. Germany was defeated by the Allied forces, which included the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and others. So, the military defeat of Nazi Germany led to the end of Hitler's rule.

But I should dig deeper. What were the major events towards the end of the war that directly contributed to the collapse of Hitler's regime? I recall that as the Allies advanced into German territory, Hitler's control began to falter. Maybe I should look into the final battles
