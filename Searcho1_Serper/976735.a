Illegal immigration is a controversial issue due to various reasons. Let me try to understand this step by step.

First, I need to define what illegal immigration is. Illegal immigration refers to the movement of people across national borders in a way that violates immigration laws. These individuals enter a country without proper documentation or stay beyond the expiration of their visas.

Now, why is this a controversial issue? I think there are several reasons for that.

1. **Economic Impact:** One of the main争议 points is the economic impact of illegal immigrants. Some argue that they take jobs away from native citizens, especially in low-skilled sectors. Others argue that they fill jobs that citizens are unwilling to do and contribute to the economy by paying taxes and starting businesses.

2. **Public Services:** Illegal immigrants may use public services like healthcare and education without paying the required taxes. This can strain public resources and lead to higher taxes for citizens.

3. **Cultural Integration:** There can be cultural clashes when immigrants don't assimilate into the host country's culture. This can lead to social tensions and conflicts.

4. **National Security:** There are concerns that illegal immigration can be a pathway for criminals and terrorists to enter the country. Strengthening border security is often a priority to prevent this.

5. **Human Rights:** On the other hand, there are arguments about the humane treatment of immigrants. Many advocate for pathways to citizenship and protection for those fleeing persecution or seeking a better life.

6. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** There are debates about the morality of deporting individuals who have built lives in the country, including those who were brought here as children (often referred to as Dreamers).

7. **Political Polarization:** Immigration is a highly politicized issue, with different political parties often taking opposing stances. This polarization can make it difficult to find common ground and pass comprehensive immigration reform.

8. **Border Control:** The effectiveness of border control measures is also a point of contention. Some argue for stricter enforcement and physical barriers, while others believe in more compassionate and open policies.

9. **Economic Disparities:** Economic disparities between countries often drive immigration. Addressing the root causes, such as poverty and lack of opportunities, is seen by some as a longer-term solution.

10. **Globalization and Mobility:** In an increasingly globalized world, there are differing opinions on how open borders should be. Some advocate for freer movement of people, while others prefer stricter controls.

Given these points, it's clear why illegal immigration is a complex and controversial issue. It touches on economics, sociology, politics, ethics, and law, and affects many aspects of society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Illegal immigration is a controversial issue due to its economic impact, strain on public services, cultural integration challenges, national security concerns, human rights considerations, legal and ethical debates, political polarization, border control effectiveness, economic disparities between countries, and the broader context of globalization and mobility.}} \]
