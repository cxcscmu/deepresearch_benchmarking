As an AI language model, I don't have personal expectations or opinions. However, I can provide you with some insights on how international business might change in the post-COVID-19 landscape based on current trends and analyses.

Firstly, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies across various sectors. Businesses that were slow to embrace e-commerce, remote work, and digital communication tools have had to rapidly adapt. This shift is likely to persist, with more companies investing in digital infrastructure to ensure resilience against future disruptions.

Secondly, supply chain management is expected to undergo significant changes. The reliance on single-source suppliers and long supply chains has been highlighted as a vulnerability during the pandemic. Companies may seek to diversify their supplier bases and shorten their supply chains to mitigate risks.

Thirdly, there could be a resurgence in protectionist policies as countries prioritize domestic industries and jobs. This might lead to increased trade barriers and slower growth in global trade.

Lastly, the pandemic has emphasized the importance of health and safety protocols in business operations. International businesses may need to implement stricter hygiene standards and contingency plans to protect employees and customers.

In summary, international business is likely to see increased digitization, changes in supply chain strategies, potential shifts towards protectionism, and heightened focus on health and safety measures in the post-COVID-19 era.
