I need to figure out why the gold standard collapsed. I know that the gold standard is a monetary system where a country's currency is linked to gold. So, its value is determined by the amount of gold it can be exchanged for. But at some point, this system stopped being used. I need to understand what led to its collapse.

First, I should probably look into when the gold standard was abandoned. I think it was in the 20th century, maybe around the time of World War II or a bit later. But I'm not sure about the exact timeline. Maybe I should start by finding out when and how countries moved away from the gold standard.

Also, I should consider the reasons behind abandoning it. Was it due to economic crises, wars, or changes in global trade? Perhaps there were limitations to the gold standard that became apparent over time.

Let me try to recall some history. I know that before World War I, many countries were on some form of gold standard. But during the war, countries had to print more money to finance the war efforts, which might have caused inflation and undermined the gold standard.

After World War I, some countries tried to return to the gold standard, but I think there were problems with that. The Great Depression in the 1930s might have also played a role in its collapse.

I should probably look up some key events related to the gold standard. For example, the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944 established a new international monetary system where currencies were pegged to the US dollar, which in turn was backed by gold. But later, in 1971, US President Nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar to gold, which effectively marked the end of the gold standard.

So, it seems like the gold standard gradually eroded over time, with key moments leading to its final collapse. I need to understand the reasons behind each of these events and how they contributed to the overall collapse of the system.

Maybe I should start by understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the gold standard. That might help me see why it was eventually abandoned.

Benefits of the gold standard:

1. Stability: The gold standard provided a fixed value for currencies, which could help control inflation and provide stability for international trade.

2. Discipline: It forced governments to be fiscally responsible because they couldn't print money beyond their gold reserves.

Drawbacks of the gold standard:

1. Lack of flexibility: The gold standard limited a government's ability to respond to economic shocks, such as recessions or financial crises, because they couldn't expand the money supply easily.

2. Imbalance in trade: Countries with gold reserves could accumulate more wealth, while those without sufficient gold might face economic disadvantages.

3. Deflationary pressures: If the supply of gold didn't keep up with the growth of the economy, it could lead to deflation, which can be harmful to economic growth.

Given these drawbacks, it's possible that the gold standard became unsustainable over time, especially with the increasing complexity of global economies and the need for more flexible monetary policies.

Now, let's look at some specific events that led to its collapse.

First, World War I disrupted the gold standard because countries needed to print more money to finance the war, which led to inflation and a departure from the fixed exchange rates.

After the war, many countries tried to return to the gold standard, but at unrealistic pre-war parity rates, which led to deflation and economic hardship. For example, Britain returned to the gold standard in 1925 at the pre-war rate, which made its exports less competitive and contributed to unemployment.

The Great Depression in the 1930s put further strain on the gold standard. As countries tried to protect their gold reserves, they raised interest rates, which deepened the depression. Some countries abandoned the gold standard and devalued their currencies, which helped them recover faster.

The Bretton Woods system, established after World War II, was a modified gold standard where currencies were pegged to the US dollar, which was convertible to gold at a fixed rate. This system provided some stability but also had its issues.

In the 1960s, there was a growing imbalance as the US dollar was overvalued relative to gold, leading to a run on US gold reserves. Other countries started demanding gold in exchange for their dollars, which wasn't sustainable.

Finallyally, in 1971, US President Nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar to gold, which marked the end of the Bretton Woods system and effectively the end of the gold standard.

So, the gold standard collapsed due to a combination of factors, including the demands of wartime financing, the rigidity of the system in the face of economic crises, and the impracticality of maintaining fixed exchange rates tied to gold in an increasingly interconnected global economy.

In summary, the gold standard collapsed because it could not accommodate the economic needs and shocks of the 20th century, leading countries to seek more flexible monetary systems.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The gold standard collapsed due to its inflexibility in应对经济冲击,特别是战争和大萧条，以及维持与黄金固定汇率的不切实际性，在日益互联的全球经济中。}} \]
