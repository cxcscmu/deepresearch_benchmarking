I need to understand how poverty affects healthcare. This seems like an important issue, but I'm not entirely sure about all the connections between being poor and access to healthcare. I think there are probably multiple ways that poverty can impact health and the ability to get proper medical care. Maybe I should start by thinking about what poverty means and then see how that relates to healthcare.

So, poverty generally refers to lacking sufficient resources to meet basic needs, like food, shelter, and clothing. In many places, it's defined based on income levels compared to the cost of living. Now, how does this connect to healthcare? Well, if someone doesn't have enough money to afford healthcare services, they might not get the medical attention they need. That seems straightforward. But there might be more to it than just not being able to pay for doctor visits.

Let me consider some possible ways poverty could affect healthcare:

1. **Access to healthcare services:** Poor people might not be able to afford health insurance or the costs associated with medical treatments, which could prevent them from seeing doctors or getting necessary medications.

2. **Living conditions:** People living in poverty often reside in areas with poorer living conditions, such as overcrowded housing, lack of clean water, or exposure to environmental hazards. These factors can lead to higher rates of illness.

3. **Nutrition:** Poverty often limits access to nutritious food, which is crucial for maintaining good health and recovering from illnesses.

4. **Stress:** Living in poverty can be extremely stressful due to financial insecurity and other related issues. Chronic stress is known to have negative impacts on health.

5. **Education:** Lower socioeconomic status may also mean less education about health and hygiene, leading to poorer health choices and practices.

6. **Mental health:** The strain of poverty can affect mental health, leading to higher rates of depression and anxiety.

7. **Preventive care:** Those in poverty might not have the means to seek preventive care, leading to worse health outcomes when diseases aren't caught early.

These are just some initial thoughts. I need to verify these points and see if there's more to add. Maybe I should look up some statistics or studies on this topic to get a better understanding.

I think starting with some online research would be helpful. I can search for information on how poverty affects healthcare, perhaps looking for articles from reputable sources like WHO, CDC, or academic journals.

Let me try to search for some information.

Alright, based on the search results, it seems that poverty significantly impacts healthcare in various ways. Here are some key points I've gathered:

- **Financial barriers:** Poverty limits access to healthcare services due to inability to pay for insurance, medications, and treatments.

- **Poor living conditions:** Overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and exposure to pollutants increase the risk of infectious diseases and chronic health problems.

- **Malnutrition:** Inadequate nutrition due to limited resources can lead to developmental issues in children and increased susceptibility to diseases in all age groups.

- **Stress:** Chronic stress associated with poverty can weaken the immune system and contribute to mental health disorders
