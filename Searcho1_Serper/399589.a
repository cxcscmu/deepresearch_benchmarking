Alright, so the question is whether the College Football Playoff should expand. Hmm, college football is a big deal in the US, and the playoff system has been a topic of debate for quite some time. Currently


First off, I need to understand what the current setup is. I know that right now, there's a four-team playoff to determine the national champion. The top four teams are selected at the end of the regular season, and they compete in two semifinal games, with the winners meeting in the championship game. This system replaced the previous Bowl Championship Series (BCS), which often led to controversy over which teams were chosen for the national title game.
