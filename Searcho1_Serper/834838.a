Alright, so I've got this question about how smart, connected products are transforming competition. I'm not entirely sure what "smart, connected products" are, but I think they're like devices that can connect to the internet and have some intelligence built-in. Maybe like smartphones or smart home devices. But I need to be sure about that.

First, I should probably define what smart, connected products are. Maybe I can look that up. I think understanding the basics is important before I can see how they're changing competition.

Okay, based on what I found, smart, connected products are physical products that have sensors, software, and connectivity that allow them to collect and share data, as well as provide new capabilities and services. They can interact with their environment, connect to other products and systems, and often leverage cloud computing
