I'm trying to figure out how successful the U.S. military has been at learning from history since 1945. That's a big question, and there's a lot to consider. I need to think about different conflicts and how the military has adapted or not adapted based on past experiences.

First, I should probably look into some of the major wars and operations the U.S. has been involved in since 1945. Starting with World War II, which ended in 1945, then the Korean War, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Iraq War, Afghanistan, and more recent operations. Each of these conflicts has its own context and lessons that the military could have learned from.

Let me start by considering the transition from World War II to the Korean War. After WWII, the U.S. had a massive army, but after the war, there was a drawdown. Then, when the Korean War broke out in 1950, the U.S. had to quickly build up its forces again. I wonder if the military learned from that experience about the need to maintain a certain level of readiness even in peacetime.

Maybe I should look into whether there were changes in defense policies or military strategies after the Korean War that reflected lessons learned from that quick transition.

Also, the Vietnam War is another significant conflict where the U.S. military faced a lot of challenges. The guerrilla warfare tactics of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces were different from what the U.S. was used to in World War II and Korea. I recall that the military had difficulties adapting to this type of warfare.

After Vietnam, there was a lot of soul-searching within the military, leading to changes in doctrine, training, and equipment. For example, the development of the All-Volunteer Force after the draft was ended in 1973. So, it seems like the military did learn some lessons from Vietnam.

Then, in the 1980s, under the leadership of people like General Colin Powell, there was an emphasis
