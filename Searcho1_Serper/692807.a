I'm trying to figure out how value is created from Dubai's resources and capabilities. I don't know much about Dubai besides that it's a city in the United Arab Emirates, known for its skyscrapers, luxury shopping, and being a business hub. But I need to understand how it turns its resources and capabilities into value. Maybe I should start by understanding what resources and capabilities Dubai has.

First, I need to know what resources Dubai possesses. Since it's in the Middle East, I think of oil, but I've heard that Dubai isn't as rich in oil as some of its neighboring countries. Maybe it has other natural resources. Also, being located on the Persian Gulf, perhaps maritime resources or something like that. And capabilitiesâ€”maybe it's skilled workforce, advanced infrastructure, or strategic location.

Let me try to list out potential resources and capabilities:

1. Natural Resources: Oil, gas, possibly fisheries, agriculture (though desert environment suggests limited agriculture).

2. Location: Strategic position connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, which could be a big advantage for trade and transportation.

3. Infrastructure: Modern airports, seaports, roads, etc.

4. Human Capital: Skilled workforce, including in business, finance, tourism sectors.

5. Governance: Stable political environment, business-friendly policies.

6. Tourism Attractions: Man-made wonders like Burj Khalifa, Palm Jumeirah, which attract tourists.

Now, how does Dubai use these to create value?

Starting with natural resources: If Dubai has oil, selling oil would be a direct way to generate revenue. But I recall that Dubai's oil reserves are smaller compared to Abu Dhabi's, so maybe they focus more on other areas.

Next, location. Being at the crossroads of major continents could make Dubai a hub for transportation and logistics. Maybe they earn from transit fees, port services, aviation services, etc.

Infrastructure: Investing in world-class infrastructure can attract businesses to set up operations there, bringing in tax revenues and creating jobs.

Human capital: A skilled workforce can support various industries, from finance to tourism to technology, making Dubai attractive for international companies.

Governance: A stable government with business-friendly regulations can encourage foreign investment, which brings in capital and creates employment opportunities.

Tourism attractions: The man-made wonders draw tourists, who spend money on accommodation, dining, shopping, and activities, all of which contribute to the economy.

It seems like Dubai has diversified its economy beyond just relying on natural resources, especially oil. They've invested heavily in building a global business hub, focusing on services like finance, real estate, commerce, and tourism.

Maybe I should look into specific industries that drive Dubai's economy. I think about places like Dubai Marina, Business Bay, the free zones like DMCC and DIFC, which are hubs for financial services and trade. Also, the Expo 2020 brought in a lot of visitors and investment.

Perhaps another way to think about it is through the value chain. Dubai might be adding value by transforming raw materials or ideas into higher-value products or services. For example, taking the raw material of sand and turning it into high-rise buildings that house offices and hotels
