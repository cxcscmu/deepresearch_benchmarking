Alright, so I need to figure out the short-term and long-term causes of World War I. I don't remember a lot about this off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information. Let me start by understanding what short-term and long-term causes mean in this context.

I think short-term causes are the immediate events or triggers that set off the war, while long-term causes are the underlying tensions and developments that made the war more likely over time. For World War I, which started in 1914, there must have been a buildup of various issues between nations that finally reached a boiling point.

First, I should recall some basic facts about WWI. I know it involved major powers in Europe, divided into the Allies and the Central Powers. The Allies included countries like Britain, France, and Russia, while the Central Powers were Germany, Austria-Hungary, and others. The war was devastating and led to huge losses in lives and resources.

Now, to identify the short-term causes, I need to look at what happened right before the war started that directly led to the fighting. I believe the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary is considered a key short-term cause. Let me confirm that.

Okay, according to the search results, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, was indeed the immediate trigger for WWI. This event happened on June 28, 1914, and within a month, major European powers began declaring war on each other.

So, the assassination is the short-term cause. But there had to be more to it—underlying tensions that made the situation explode into a full-scale war. That's where the long-term causes come in.

What were these long-term causes? I think they include things like militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. Let me see if that checks out.

Militarism refers to the buildup of military strength and the glorification of the military. In the years leading up to WWI, many European countries were engaging in an arms race, especially Britain and Germany in naval power. This increased tension and mistrust between nations.

Alliances were also a significant long-term cause. Countries formed pacts and agreements that created a web of alliances. For example, Germany and Austria-Hungary had a alliance, and Russia was allied with Serbia. France and Russia had a agreement, and Britain was connected through the Entente Cordiale with France and Russia. So, when one country was attacked, its allies were obligated to support it, which escalated local conflicts into wider wars.

Imperialism—the competition for colonies and resources around the world—also fueled tensions. European powers were vying for influence in Africa, Asia, and other regions, leading to rivalries and conflicts of interest.

Nationalism, both ethnic and national pride, played a role as well. In regions like the Balkans, there were diverse ethnic groups with competing national aspirations, which created instability and conflict.

So, these—militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism—are considered the main long-term causes of WWI.

Let me organize this information better.

Long-term causes:

1. Militarism: Arms race, especially in navies between Britain and Germany.

2. Alliances: Complex web of agreements that could pull countries into war.

3. Imperialism: Competition for colonies and resources.

4. Nationalism: Ethnic and national pride leading to conflicts, particularly in the Balkans.

Short-term cause:

1. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, leading Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, which then triggered a chain reaction due to the alliances in place.

Is there anything else I should consider? Maybe the Balkan Wars or the build-up of tensions in that region. The Balkans were often referred to as the "powder keg" of Europe, and the assassination took place there, so perhaps that's relevant.

Also, the concept of "balance of power" in Europe might be important. Countries were trying to maintain or gain power at the expense of others, which led to alliances and militarization.

Perhaps I should look deeper into the alliances. There was the Triple Entente between Britain, France, and Russia, and the Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (though Italy ended up fighting on the side of the Entente). These alliances certainly contributed to the escalation of the conflict.

Moreover, the doctrine of realpolitik and the pursuit of national interests without regard to ethics might have played a role in how leaders handled diplomatic crises before the war.

I should also consider economic factors. Some historians argue that economic competition between rising powers like Germany and established powers like Britain contributed to tensions.

Additionally, the idea of social Darwinism and the belief in the inevitability of conflict may have influenced political decisions.

However, for the purpose of this question, focusing on the main points of militarism, alliances, imperialism, nationalism, and the assassination should suffice.

Let me see if there's a way to structure this information more clearly.

Long-term causes:

- Militarism: Arms race, especially naval between Britain and Germany.

- Alliances: Complex network leading to entangled commitments.

- Imperialism: Competition for colonies and resources.

- Nationalism: Ethnic and national pride leading to instability, especially in the Balkans.

Short-term cause:

- Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, leading to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia, which then, due to alliances, escalated into a wider conflict.

I think that sums it up nicely.

Just to make sure, maybe I should look at a specific example to illustrate how these causes interacted.

Take the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. This was carried out by Gavrilo Princip, who was part of a group seeking independence for Serbia and other South Slavic regions from Austria-Hungary. So, nationalism is at play here.

Austria-Hungary saw this assassination as an opportunity to assert control over Serbia and deal with nationalist movements within its empire. They issued an ultimatum to Serbia with harsh demands, and when Serbia didn't comply fully, Austria-Hungary declared war.

But Serbia was backed by Russia, which saw itself as a protector of Slavic interests. So, Russia began mobilizing its forces in support of Serbia.

Germany, allied with Austria-Hungary, saw Russia's mobilization as a threat and declared war on Russia. Then, to preempt a two-front war, Germany also declared war on Russia's ally, France.

Britain, allied with France and committed to protecting Belgium, entered the war when Germany invaded Belgium.

Thus, what started as a localized conflict in the Balkans quickly escalated into a continental war due to the web of alliances and the military plans in place.

This example illustrates how the short-term cause (the assassination) interacted with the long-term causes (alliances, nationalism) to lead to the outbreak of WWI.

I think this is a solid understanding of the causes of WWI.
