I'm trying to understand why Armenia and Azerbaijan are at war. I know a little bit about it, but I want to get a clearer picture. So, I think I need to look into their history and see what's been going on between them.

First off, both Armenia and Azerbaijan are countries in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Armenia is bordered by Turkey to the west, Azerbaijan to the east, and Georgia to the north, while Azerbaijan shares borders with Russia and Iran as well. So, it's a pretty strategic location.

I recall that there's a disputed region between them called Nagorno-Karabakh. I think that's at the heart of their conflict. Maybe I should start by understanding what Nagorno-Karabakh is.

Alright, so Nagorno-Karabakh is a region in the South Caucasus, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but controlled by ethnic Armenians. It's an autonomous oblast within Azerbaijan, but the population is mostly Armenian, and they've been seeking independence or unification with Armenia.

This must be a source of tension because Azerbaijan claims sovereignty over the region, but the people living there don't want to be part of Azerbaijan. There must be a long history behind this.

I think there have been several conflicts over this region. I remember there was a war in the early 1990s. What was the outcome of that?

So, the Nagorno-Karabakh War was from 1988 to 1994. It seems that the war ended with a ceasefire, and Armenian forces maintained control over Nagorno-Karabakh and some surrounding areas. So, effectively, Armenia has been controlling the region since then, even though internationally it's considered part of Azerbaijan.

But why is there still a war now? I thought there was a ceasefire in place.

It looks like there have been periodic outbreaks of violence along the border, but a full-scale war erupted in 2020. That's when there was intense fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.

What happened in 2020 that triggered this war?

From what I'm reading, the immediate cause was an escalation of border clashes in late September 2020. Both sides accused each other of starting the hostilities. However, the underlying issue remains the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.

It seems that negotiations were ongoing, but they didn't lead to a resolution. Tensions built up, and eventually, armed conflict broke out again.

I see that Russia got involved somehow. What role did Russia play in this conflict?

Russia has historical ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan but has maintained relations with both sides. Interestingly, Armenia is part of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), while Azerbaijan has sought to balance its relationships between Russia, Turkey, and others.

During the 2020 conflict, Russia acted as a mediator and brokered a ceasefire agreement in November 2020. As part of the agreement, Russian peacekeeping forces were deployed to the Nagorno-Karabakh region to monitor the ceasefire.

So, the war in 2020 ended with a ceasefire facilitated by Russia, and Russian peacekeepers are now present in the region.

But why is there still tension? Is the ceasefire holding?
