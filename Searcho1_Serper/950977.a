Alright, I need to understand the causes and consequences of World War I. I don't remember a lot about this from history class, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information. Let's start by figuring out what caused WWI.

I think it had something to do with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but I know that wasn't the only reason. There must have been underlying tensions and alliances that led to the war. Maybe I should look into the system of alliances before WWI.

Also, I've heard about militarism, imperialism, and nationalism being factors. Perhaps those played a role in igniting the conflict. I should probably read up on each of these and see how they contributed to the start of the war.

Once I have a grasp on the causes, I can move on to the consequences. I know that WWI was a major turning point in history, leading to significant changes in the political landscape. The war resulted in the collapse of empires and the redrawing of borders. It also set the stage for WWII, so there must be some long-term consequences that are important to understand.

Maybe I should make an outline to organize my thoughts. First, list the main causes, then discuss the immediate and long-term consequences. That might help me present the information clearly.

Let me start by searching for the causes of WWI.

Alright, based on the search results, it seems that there were several key causes of WWI. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, was the immediate trigger. However, deeper reasons included the complex system of alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism.

Let me break this down. The system of alliances meant that countries had pledged to support each other in case of conflict. So, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia after the assassination, Russia mobilized to support Serbia, which led Germany to declare war on Russia, and so on. This domino effect pulled many nations into the war.

Militarism was another factor. Many countries were engaged in an arms race, building up their military forces, which escalated tensions. Imperialism also played a role, as European powers were competing for colonies and resources around the world, leading to rivalries and conflicts.

Nationalism was particularly potent in the Balkans, where different ethnic groups sought independence or expansion, leading to instability in the region.

So, these are the main causes: the assassination, alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism.

Now, moving on to the consequences of WWI. The war had profound and lasting effects on the global political and social landscape.

Firstly, there were massive human casualties. Millions of soldiers and civilians died, which had devastating impacts on the populations involved.

Secondly, several empires collapsed as a result of the war, including the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires. This led to the redrawing of national boundaries and the emergence of new countries in Europe and the Middle East.

The Treaty of VersVersailles, signed in 1919, imposed harsh penalties on Germany, which many historians believe sowed the seeds for WWII. The treaty required Germany to accept blame for the war, pay reparations, and limit its military capabilities.

Additionally, the war led to the spread of communism, as the Russian Revolution occurred during the war, resulting in the establishment of the Soviet Union.

On the positive side, WWI accelerated women's suffrage in many countries, as women took on roles traditionally held by men who were fighting at the front.

Furthermore, the League of Nations was formed after the war as an international organization aimed at preventing future conflicts through diplomacy and cooperation. Although it was ineffective in preventing WWII, it laid the groundwork for the United Nations.

In terms of warfare, WWI introduced new technologies and tactics, such as tanks, chemical weapons, and trench warfare, which changed the nature of combat.

Overall, the consequences of WWI were far-reaching and had a significant impact on the course of the 20th century.

To summarize:

Causes of WWI:

1. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand

2. System of alliances

3. Militarism

4. Imperialism

5. Nationalism

Consequences of WWI:

1. Massive casualties

2. Collapse of empires and redrawing of borders

3. Treaty of VersVersailles and its effects

4. Spread of communism

5. Acceleration of women's suffrage

6. Formation of the League of Nations

7. Advances in warfare technology and tactics

I think that covers the main points. It's important to understand both the causes and consequences to grasp the significance of WWI in history.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The causes of World War I included the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the system of alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism.
