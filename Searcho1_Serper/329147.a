Alright, so I need to figure out how men and women communicate differently. This seems like a pretty broad topic, and I've heard a lot about differences in communication styles between genders, but I'm not sure how much of that is based on actual research versus stereotypes. I think it's important to approach this with an open mind and look for credible sources that can provide insights backed by data.

I also came across a study that suggests women are more likely to ask questions and seek clarification during conversations, whereas men might dominate the conversation and interrupt more often. However, I need to consider the context in which these observations
