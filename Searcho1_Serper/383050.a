Alright, I need to figure out how the British monarchy changed during the Stuart period from 1603 to 1689. I don't remember a lot about this specific time, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information.

First, I know that the Stuart period refers to the reign of the Stuart dynasty on the English and later British throne. It started with James VI of Scotland becoming King James I of England in 1603, following the death of Queen Elizabeth I. This marked the union of the English and Scottish crowns under one monarch.

I think one of the key changes during this period was the transition from the Tudor dynasty to the Stuart dynasty. The Tudors had ruled England since 1485, and their rule was known for significant religious and political changes, including the establishment of the Church of England.

Under the Stuarts, I believe there were continued religious tensions, especially between Protestants and Catholics. I recall something about the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, where Catholic conspirators attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. That must have had an impact on the monarchy and its relationship with Catholics.

Also, I think the Stuart period saw some conflicts between the monarchy and Parliament over issues of power and authority. There was something called the English Civil War in the 1640s, which led to the execution of King Charles I in 1649. That must have been a major change in the monarchy.

After Charles I was executed, there was a period without a monarch, known as the Interregnum, when Oliver Cromwell ruled as Lord Protector. But then the monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. So, the restoration of the monarchy was another significant change during this period.

Furthermore, I think there were efforts by the Stuart monarchs to assert their divine right to rule, which brought them into conflict with Parliament and led to struggles over constitutional powers.

I should probably look into specific monarchs during this period to understand the changes better. Starting with James I, who was also James VI of Scotland. He believed in the divine right of kings and wrote a book called "The True Law of Free Monarchies" defending this idea. This likely contributed to tensions with Parliament.

Then, his son Charles I inherited these views and his attempts to rule without Parliament led to the English Civil War. After his execution, the monarchy was abolished, and England became a commonwealth under Cromwell.

With the restoration of Charles II, there was an attempt to stabilize the monarchy, but there were still conflicts, such as the Exclusion Crisis in the 1670s, where Parliament tried to exclude James, the Duke of York (later James II), from succeeding to the throne due to his Catholicism.

James II's reign was marked by further conflicts over religion and royal power, leading to the Glorious
