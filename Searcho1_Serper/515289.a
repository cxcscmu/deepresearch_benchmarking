As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I can't conduct actual web searches. However, I can simulate the process based on my existing knowledge and provide a step-by-step reasoning approach to answer the question "How will this study contribute to the body of knowledge?"

Let's assume that "this study" refers to a hypothetical research project. To determine its contribution to the body of knowledge, I need to understand several aspects:

1. **Research Objective**: What is the main goal of the study? What question is it trying to answer or problem is it attempting to solve?

2. **Methodology**: How was the research conducted? What methods were used to collect and analyze data?

3. **Findings**: What are the key results or outcomes of the study?

4. **Novelty**: Does the study introduce new ideas, theories, or techniques? Does it challenge existing assumptions or confirm previous findings?

5. **Impact**: How might these findings influence future research, practical applications, or policy decisions?

6. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: Does the study have implications
