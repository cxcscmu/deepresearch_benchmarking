I've been given this question: "Why are paraphilias more common in men?" I need to think about this carefully. First off, I should understand what paraphilias are. From what I recall, paraphilias are sexual interests that are outside of what's considered typical or normative. Things like fetishism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and others fall under this category. Now, the question is suggesting that these are more common in men, and I need to explore why that might be the case.

But before I dive into that, I should make sure that it's actually true that paraphilias are more common in men. Maybe it's just perceived that way due to societal biases or something. So, perhaps I should look up some statistics on the prevalence of paraphilias in different genders.

Let me consider how I can approach this. Maybe starting with some research on the prevalence of paraphilias in men and women would be a good idea. If I can find studies that have looked into this, that would give me a better foundation to answer the question.

Also, I should think about the possible reasons behind any differences in prevalence. Are there biological factors at play? Hormonal
