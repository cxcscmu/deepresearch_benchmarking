Alright, I need to figure out the impact of World War I on civilians. I don't remember a lot about WWI, so I need to start from the basics. First things first, what was World War I?

I think it was a big war that happened a long time ago, involving many countries around the world. It started in 1914 and ended in 1918. But I'm not entirely sure about the dates; maybe I should look that up.

Also, I know that wars affect not just the soldiers fighting but also the people back home, the civilians. So, I need to think about how WWI impacted ordinary people who weren't directly involved in the combat.

Let me try to list some possible ways civilians were affected. First, there must have been economic impacts. Wars are expensive, so countries had to find ways to fund them. That probably meant increasing taxes or printing more money, which could lead to inflation. So, civilians might have seen the cost of living go up.

Another thing is food shortages. During wars, resources are diverted to the military, so things like food and fuel might become scarce. There might have been rationing, where people could only buy a certain amount of food each week. That must have been tough for families.

Also, many men went off to fight in the war, so there was a labor shortage. Women and other family members might have had to take on new jobs to keep things running. That led to changes in gender roles and society in general.

Moreover, there was probably a lot of anxiety and fear among civilians. Knowing that their loved ones were fighting in far-off places must have been terrifying. There were likely regular updates about the war, some good, some bad, keeping people on edge.

I also recall that during WWI, there were things like propaganda posters and campaigns encouraging people to support the war effort. So, there was a lot of government influence on civilian life.

Furthermore, towards the end of the war, there was a flu pandemic, the Spanish Flu, which killed millions of people worldwide. I'm not sure if that's directly related to the war, but it certainly compounded the suffering of civilians.

Wait, maybe the war contributed to the spread of the flu. With soldiers moving around and living in close quarters, diseases could spread more easily. So, the war conditions might have exacerbated the pandemic.

Also, after the war, there were probably many veterans returning home, some of them injured or traumatized. That must have put a strain on families and communities as they tried to help these individuals readjust to civilian life.

Moreover, the political landscape changed after WWI. The Treaty of Vers
