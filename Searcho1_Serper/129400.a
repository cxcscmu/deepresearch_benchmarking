So I'm trying to understand why chemical weapons are banned. I mean, there are plenty of other weapons out there that cause a lot of harm, so what makes chemical weapons so different? I guess it has something to do with how they work or maybe how devastating their effects can be. But I'm not really sure. Maybe I should look into some history behind the ban to get a better grasp of this.

First off, what exactly are chemical weapons? From what I recall, they're weapons that use chemicals to cause harm, usually through poisoning or suffocation. Things like mustard gas, nerve agentsâ€”stuff like that. They've been used in wars in the past, and apparently, the international community has decided to prohibit their use. But why? Is it because they're considered inhumane, or is there more to it?

I think it would be helpful to look into the history of chemical weapons and see when and why they were banned. Maybe there was a particular incident or event that led to their prohibition. I remember something about World War I; wasn't that when chemical weapons were first widely used? If I can find out more about that period, maybe I can understand the reasons behind the ban.

Let me try to search for some information on this. Maybe I can find some articles or resources that explain the history and the ethical considerations surrounding chemical weapons.

Alright, based on what I just read, it seems that chemical weapons have been around for a long time, but their use was particularly prominent during World War I. The horrors inflicted by these weapons during that war led to a global revulsion and a push for their prohibition.
