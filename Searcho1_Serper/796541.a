As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer on why domestic violence is increasing, as this is a complex issue influenced by various social, economic, and cultural factors. However, I can offer some possible explanations based on research and expert opinions.

Firstly, stress and financial difficulties can contribute to increased domestic violence. Economic pressures, such as job loss or poverty, can lead to frustration and aggression within households. Additionally, substance abuse and mental health issues may also play a role in escalating violent behavior.

Secondly, societal attitudes and norms can influence the prevalence of domestic violence. In some cultures, there may be a tolerance for violence against women or a belief that men have authority over their partners. These harmful stereotypes can perpetuate abusive behaviors and make it more difficult for victims to seek help.

Thirdly, access to resources and support services can impact the reporting and prevention of domestic violence. Limited availability of shelters, counseling services, and legal assistance can hinder victims' ability to escape abusive situations and seek justice.

It is important to note that domestic violence affects individuals from all walks of life and is not limited to any specific demographic group. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that includes education, advocacy, and policy changes aimed at promoting healthy relationships and holding abusers accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, while there is no single reason for the increase in domestic violence, understanding the underlying causes can help inform strategies to prevent and respond to this pervasive problem.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Domestic violence is influenced by a combination of stress, financial difficulties, societal attitudes, and limited access to support services.}} \]
