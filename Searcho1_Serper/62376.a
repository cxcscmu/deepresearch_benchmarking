I'm trying to figure out how the interaction between Helmer and Nora advances the plot in "A Doll's House" by Henrik Ibsen. I haven't read the play in a while, so I need to refresh my memory on the key events and their significance.

First, I need to recall who Helmer and Nora are. Helmer is the husband, and Nora is his wife. From what I remember, their relationship seems superficially happy, but there are underlying issues that gradually come to light.

I think the play starts with Helmer coming home from work, and they have a casual conversation about money and everyday affairs
