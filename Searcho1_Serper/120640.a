As an AI language model, I don't have a physical family or personal experiences, so I don't have a family background that affects how I see the world. However, I am programmed with a vast amount of information and I strive to provide objective and informative responses based on that data. If you have any questions or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask!

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{As an AI language model, I don't have a family background.}} \]
