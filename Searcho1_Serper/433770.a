Alright, so I need to figure out why climate change is considered a threat. I know that climate change is happening, but I'm not exactly sure what makes it dangerous or why it's such a big deal. Maybe I should start by understanding what climate change is.

I think climate change refers to long-term alterations in statistical distributions of weather patterns over multiple decades or longer. It's different from regular weather fluctuations. So, if the average temperature or precipitation patterns change significantly over time, that's climate change.

Now, why would changes in climate be threatening? Well, I've heard about global warming, which is a part of climate change, caused mainly by increased greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and lead to rising temperatures worldwide.

So, one issue is rising temperatures. What's so bad about a little bit warmer weather? Isn't that nice? But I guess if it gets too warm, it can have negative effects. For example, hotter temperatures can lead to more extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, and stronger hurricanes.

I remember reading something about how warmer oceans can fuel stronger storms. Is that right? Maybe I should look that up.

Also, I think sea levels are rising due to melting glaciers and polar
