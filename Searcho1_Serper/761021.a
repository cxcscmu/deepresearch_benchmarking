I'm trying to figure out how traditional store-based retailers have benefited from adding internet channels to their operations. So, first off, I need to understand what traditional store-based retailers are. These are the physical shops and stores that people used to visit in person to buy products. Now, many of these retailers have expanded their reach by establishing an online presence through websites and e-commerce platforms. I need to think about the advantages this brings them.

Let me start by considering the most obvious benefit: increased reach. With an internet channel, retailers can now sell their products to customers beyond their physical location. Before the internet, a store was limited to its local area or maybe regional customers, but now, they can reach a global audience. That means potentially more sales and higher revenue.

Another benefit might be convenience for customers. Online shopping allows customers to browse and purchase products at any time of day, from anywhere, without having to physically go to the store. This 24/7 availability can attract more customers who value convenience.

Also, having an online presence can improve customer engagement. Retailers can use their websites and social media channels to interact with customers, gather feedback, and build a community around their brand. This can lead to better customer loyalty and repeat business.

Furthermore, online channels provide data and analytics that traditional stores might not have access to. Retailers can track customer behavior, purchase history, and preferences, which can help them make informed decisions about inventory, marketing, and customer targeting
