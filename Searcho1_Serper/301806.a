So I have this question: "How has foreign policy changed over time?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I guess I can tackle it by looking at different eras and seeing how approaches to foreign policy have evolved. I should probably start by understanding what foreign policy is. It's basically how a country interacts with other countries and manages its international relations, right? So, it includes things like diplomacy, trade agreements, military alliances, and so on.

I think it would be helpful to look at key periods in history and see how foreign policies have adapted to the global context at those times. For example, starting from the early days of nation-states up to the modern era. Maybe I can divide it into pre-World War I, interwar period, Cold War, and post-Cold War eras.

Let me first think about the pre-World War I period. Back then, Europe was dominated by the balance of power system, where major powers tried to prevent any one country from becoming too strong. This led to complex alliances and ententes, like the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. So, foreign policies were focused on maintaining this balance and preventing any single nation from dominating the continent.

Then, after World War I, during the interwar period, there was an attempt to create a more cooperative international system through the League of Nations. However, this didn't prevent the outbreak of World War II. So, perhaps foreign policies in this period were still rooted in national interests and lacked effective mechanisms for conflict resolution.

Moving on to the Cold War era, foreign policies were heavily influenced by the bipolar world order, with the US and the Soviet Union as superpowers. This led to the formation of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and a lot of foreign policies were aligned based on these blocs. There was also the concept of containment, where the US tried to prevent the spread of communism. So, in this period, ideology played a big role in shaping foreign policies.

After the Cold War, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world became unipolar, with the US as the sole superpower. This led to a shift in foreign policies, with the US having more influence in setting the global agenda. There was also more emphasis
