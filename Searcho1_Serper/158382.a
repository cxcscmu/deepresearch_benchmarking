I'm trying to understand how the Balfour Declaration contributed to tension between Jews and Arabs. I don't remember much about this topic, so I need to look it up and think through it step by step.

First, I need to recall what the Balfour Declaration is. I think it's a statement from the British government during World War I that supported the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. But I'm not sure about the exact details, so I should look that up.

Alright, from what I've read, the Balfour Declaration was a letter from British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Baron Walter Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, in 1917. The letter stated that the British government viewed favorably "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," and they would use their best endeavors to facilitate this.

Now, I need to understand the context. This was during World War I, and Britain was fighting against the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Palestine at the time. So, perhaps Britain made this declaration to gain support from Jewish communities around the world, especially in Russia and the United States, to help with the war effort.

But I should verify that. Maybe there were other reasons behind this declaration.

It seems that there were multiple factors leading to the Balfour Declaration. One was to secure Jewish support in the Allies' war effort, as I thought. Another was Britain's strategic interests in the Middle East, including access to oil resources and control over key trade routes. Additionally, some British officials were sympathetic to the Zionist cause, which sought to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.

So, the declaration was a combination of political, strategic, and ideological considerations.

Now, I need to connect this to the tension between Jews and Arabs. Palestine was inhabited by both Jews and Arabs at the time, right? So, promising a Jewish homeland there might have conflicted with the aspirations of the Arab population, who likely saw Palestine as their own homeland.

I should check the demographic composition of Palestine around that time.

From the information I've found, in 1917, when the Balfour Declaration was issued, the population of Palestine was approximately 700,000 people, of whom about 92% were Arabs (both Muslims and Christians) and 8% were Jews. So, the Arab population was the vast majority.

Given that, it's easy to see why the Arab population might have been concerned or upset by the declaration. It seemed like an external power was promising someone else's homeland without considering the wishes
