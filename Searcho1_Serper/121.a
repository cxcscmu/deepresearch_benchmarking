I'm trying to understand how European "ethnics" became white and what changes made this possible. This seems like a complex topic involving history, sociology, and racial identity. I need to break this down step by step.

First, I should clarify what is meant by "European ethnics." I think this refers to immigrant groups from Europe who came to the United States, particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Groups like Italians, Poles, Jews, Irish, and others who were considered distinct ethnic groups with their own cultures and sometimes faced discrimination upon arrival.

The term "white" in this context likely refers to being accepted into the mainstream white American society, which historically has had its own definitions of who qualifies as white. So, the question is asking how these ethnic groups came to be seen as white and part of the mainstream, and what changes allowed that to happen.

I need to do some research to understand this better. Maybe start by looking into the history of immigration in the US and how different groups were perceived over time.

Alright, from what I've read, European immigration to the US peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Immigrants came from various parts of Europe, including Southern and Eastern Europe, which were different from the earlier waves of immigrants from Northern and Western Europe.

These newer immigrants often faced prejudice and were seen as inferior or even not white by the existing white establishment. Terms like "wop" for Italians, "kike" for Jews, and "mick" for Irish were used derogatorily.

But over time, these groups became accepted as white and integrated into mainstream American society. So, what changed?

One possible factor is assimilation. As these groups adopted American ways, learned English, and moved out of ethnic enclaves, they became more accepted. Maybe intermarriage also played a role, as it often does in breaking down racial barriers.

Another factor could be changes in the legal definition of whiteness. Historically, the law has played a role in defining who is white, particularly in terms of citizenship and voting rights.

I should look into legal cases or legislation that might have expanded the definition of whiteness to include these groups.

Interesting, I found that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were court cases where immigrants from places like Asia and Latin America were fighting to be recognized as white to gain citizenship rights. For example, the Ozawa v. United States (1922) case, where a Japanese man claimed he was white, but the Supreme Court ruled that he was not.

On the other hand, some European groups may have been considered white from the start, at least legally. But I need to see if there were specific laws or court cases regarding Southern and Eastern Europeans.

I recall that the Naturalization Act of 1790 limited naturalization to free white persons, but it didn't specify what "white" meant. Over time, courts had to interpret who qualified as white.

In some cases, like United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), the Supreme Court ruled that Indians from South Asia were not white, even though they were Caucasians, based on a racial rather than purely geographic definition of whiteness.

But I don't recall similar cases for Southern and Eastern Europeans. Maybe they were considered white from the start, at least legally, but socially, they still faced prejudice.

Perhaps the legal definition of whiteness was more flexible for Europeans, and over time, social acceptance grew as these groups became more assimilated.

Another factor might be the quota system established by the Immigration Act of 1924, which set limits on immigration based on national origins. This act favored Northern and Western Europeans over Southern and Eastern Europeans, but still allowed some immigration from these regions.

Over time, as these groups became more established and less threatening to the dominant
