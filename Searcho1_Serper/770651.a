So I need to figure out what causes long-term climate change. I know that climate change can happen over different time scales, but specifically, what causes changes that happen over longer periods, like centuries or even millennia. I think there are several factors that could be involved, but I'm not entirely sure about all of them. Maybe I should start by understanding the difference between weather and climate, since climate is about long-term patterns.

First off, weather is what's happening day to day, while climate is the average pattern of weather conditions over a long period, usually 30 years or more. So, climate change refers to sustained changes in those average patterns. Now, when we talk about long-term climate change, we're probably looking at changes that occur over hundreds or thousands of years. There must be some natural processes that cause these changes.

I recall that one of the main natural causes of long-term climate change is variations in the Earth's orbit around the sun, known as Milankovitch cycles. These cycles alter the amount of solar radiation received on Earth, which can lead to ice ages and warmer periods. There are three aspects to these cycles: changes in the Earth's eccentricity, changes in the tilt of its axis, and precession, which is the wobbling of the Earth's axis. These cycles affect the distribution of sunlight across the planet and can trigger glacial periods or interglacial periods.

Another natural factor is volcanic activity. Major volcanic eruptions can release large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which forms aerosols that reflect sunlight back into space, leading to a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. If there are frequent volcanic eruptions over a long period, this could contribute to long-term climate cooling.

Solar variability is also a natural factor that can influence climate over long periods. The Sun's energy output isn't constant; it fluctuates over time. During periods of high solar activity, the Earth receives more energy, which can lead to warming, and during periods of low solar activity, less energy leads to cooling. The Maunder Minimum, a period from the 17th to 18th century with reduced solar activity, corresponded with a cooler period in some regions, known as the Little Ice Age.

Now, besides these natural causes, there are human-induced factors that contribute to long-term climate change. The most significant of these is the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, methane, and nit

Sorry, I think I made a mistake. The question is about long-term climate change, which typically refers to changes occurring over centuries or millennia, mainly due to natural processes. Human-induced climate change, while significant, is a more recent phenomenon

Wait a minute, you're right. The question is about what causes long-term climate change, and typically, when people talk about long-term climate change, they're referring to natural processes that operate over centuries or millennia. Human-induced climate change is a more recent phenomenon
