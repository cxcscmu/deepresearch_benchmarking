I'm going to try to answer this question about why people commit domestic violence. It's a really serious and complex issue, and I want to approach it carefully. First, I need to understand what domestic violence is. From what I know, domestic violence refers to a pattern of abusive behavior in an intimate relationship or between family members. It can include physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions that harm, control, intimidate, or terrorize another person.

Now, the question is asking why people commit domestic violence. There isn't a single reason; it's usually a combination of factors. I think it's important to consider both individual and societal factors that might contribute to someone becoming abusive.

Let me start by considering individual factors. One possible reason is that the abuser may have grown up in a household where they witnessed violence, so they learned that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts or exert control. This is often referred to as learned behavior. Another individual factor could be mental health issues. Some people who commit domestic violence may have underlying mental health problems like personality disorders
