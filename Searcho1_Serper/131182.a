I'm trying to understand how euthanasia works. First off, I need to make sure I know what euthanasia is. From what I recall, euthanasia is when someone intentionally ends another person's life to relieve their suffering, usually because of a terminal illness. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, so I should probably look that up.

Okay, according to the search results, euthanasia is indeed the act or practice of ending a life in a painless way, specifically in the case of a person suffering from an incurable condition, as a mercy killing. So, that aligns with what I thought.

Now, I need to understand how it works. I guess there are different ways euthanasia can be performed. Maybe there are different types or methods involved. Let me see.

First, I've heard terms like "active euthanasia" and "passive euthanasia." I think active euthanasia involves directly administering something to end someone's life, like medication, while passive euthanasia involves withdrawing or not providing treatment that would prolong life. Is that correct?

Yes, according to the search, there are two main types: active and passive euthanasia. Active euthanasia involves taking deliberate actions to cause death, such as injecting life-ending drugs. Passive euthanasia involves withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments, allowing the underlying condition to cause death.

So, both aim to end suffering, but the methods differ in how they achieve that. Active is more direct, while passive lets nature take its course without intervention.

I also remember hearing about voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary euthanasia. Voluntary is when the person agrees to it, non-voluntary is when they can't express consent, and involuntary is against their will. But I need to confirm that.

<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>

Yes, that's accurate. Voluntary euthanasia is carried out at the request of the person themselves. Non-voluntary is when the person is unable to give consent, such as being in a coma, and a legal representative makes the decision. Involuntary is when it's done against the person's wishes
