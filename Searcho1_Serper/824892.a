So I have this question: "How did slavery impact the Civil War?" Hmm, I know that the Civil War was between the Northern states and the Southern states in the U.S., back in the 1860s. I think slavery was a major issue that led to the war, but I'm not exactly sure how it impacted the war itself. Maybe I should look up some information to get a better understanding.

First, I need to recall what I already know about slavery and the Civil War. Slavery

Alright, so I have this question: "How did slavery impact the Civil War?" I'm not entirely sure where to start with this, but I know that slavery was a major issue leading up to the war. I think understanding the causes of the Civil War might help me see how slavery influenced it. Maybe I should look into the differences between the Northern and Southern states before the war.

I remember that the Northern states were more industrialized, while the Southern states relied heavily on agriculture, especially cotton. Slavery

I remember that the Northern states were more industrialized, while the Southern states relied heavily on agriculture, especially cotton. And slavery was integral to the South's economy because of the need for labor in their plantations. So, perhaps the dependence on slavery is why the South wanted to preserve it, while the North, being more industrial, didn't rely as much on slave labor.

But how did this affect the actual war? Did slavery play a role in the strategies used during the war? Or was its impact mostly political, leading to the secession of the Southern states?

Maybe I should look up some information to get a better understanding. Let me try searching for "slavery
