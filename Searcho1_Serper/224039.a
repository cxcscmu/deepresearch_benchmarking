I'm trying to figure out how the Ottoman genocide ended. First off, I need to make sure I understand what the Ottoman genocide refers to. I think it's related to the mass killings and deportations carried out by the Ottoman Empire, particularly against the Armenian population, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.

Alright, from what I've read, the term "Ottoman genocide" primarily refers to the Armenian Genocide, which occurred during World War I. It seems like the Ottoman government, under the control of the Young Turks, targeted Armenians, as well as other minority groups like Assyrians and Greeks, for deportation and extermination. So, I need to focus on how the Armenian Genocide came to an end.

I should consider the timeline here. World War I lasted from 1914 to 1918, and the Armenian Genocide started around 1915. So, perhaps the end of the war had something to do with the end of the genocide. Maybe when the Ottoman Empire surrendered or lost the war, the genocide stopped.

Hmm, according to these sources, the Armenian Genocide is generally considered to have ended around 1923, with the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. That's interesting because World War I ended in 1918, so there was still persecution and displacement continuing after the war.

I need to understand why the genocide persisted beyond the end of World War I. Was there continued instability in the region? Were there efforts by the new Turkisheran government to continue the policies of the Ottoman government?

Maybe I should look into the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the birth of the Republic of Turkey.

Okay, so the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers in 1914 and suffered defeats, leading to its disintegration. By 1918, the war ended, and the Ottoman Empire was defeated. The victorious Allied powers then divided up the Ottoman territories through the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920.

However, a nationalist movement in Turkey, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, resisted this division and fought for Turkisheran independence. This led to the Turkisheran War of Independence, which concluded with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, establishing the Republic of Turkey.

During this entire period, from 1915 to 1923, there were continued persecutions and deportations of Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks. So, it seems like the genocide didn't have a specific endpoint but rather tapered off with the establishment of the new政府.

But I need to be precise. Maybe there was a particular event or date that marked the end of the genocide.

It appears that there isn't a specific date marked as the end of the Armenian Genocide. Instead, it's considered to have ended around 1923, coinciding with the establishment of the Republic of Turkey and the exchange of populations between Greeceeran and Greeceoania.

The Greco-Turkish War and the Population Exchange of 1923 involved the forced migration of Greeks from Turkey and Turks from Greeceoania, which might have put an end to the targeted persecution of Christian minorities in the region.

Alternatively, some sources suggest that the genocide effectively ended in 1922, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Greek forces in the War of Independence.

I need to synthesize this information. It seems like the Armenian Genocide was a process that unfolded from 1915 to around 1923, with the end of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.

Perhaps the end of the genocide can be linked to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, as the new government under Atatürk began to implement secular and nationalist policies, which may have marked a departure from the previous Ottoman policies of persecution.

Additionally, the international context changed with the Treaty of Lausanne, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres and led to the recognition of the Republic of Turkey. This may have also contributed to the end of the genocide, as international attention and intervention increased.

In conclusion, while there isn't a specific date for the end of the Armenian Genocide, it's generally considered to have concluded around 1923 with the establishment of the Republic of Turkey and the population exchanges that followed.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{1923} \]
