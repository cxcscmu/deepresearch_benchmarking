So I have this question: "How has mental health changed over the years?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I guess it's about how our understanding and approach to mental health have evolved over time. I don't know much about the history of mental health, so I'll need to do some research to answer this properly.

Moving forward to the Middle Ages in Europe, mental health was still poorly understood. People with mental illnesses were often treated cruelly, confined to institutions, or even persecuted as witches.

It wasn't until the Enlightenment period that there started to be more humane approaches to treating mental health. Philippe Pinel in France and Dorothea Dix in the United States advocated for more compassionate treatment, leading to reforms in asylum conditions.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, psychiatry began to develop as a medical specialty. SigmFreud introduced psychoanalysis, which had a profound impact on how psychologists and psychiatrists approachedapproached mental health. Around the same time, behavioral psychology emergedemerged with thinkers like B
