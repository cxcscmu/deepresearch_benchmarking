So I have this question: "How does immigration help the economy?" Now, I'm not an expert in economics or sociology, but I've heard and read bits and pieces about how immigrants contribute to a country's economy. I think to really answer this question well, I need to look into some reliable sources to understand the various ways immigration can benefit the economy.

First off, I know that immigrants often come to a new country to work and support themselves and their families. So, one way they help the economy is by joining the workforce. Maybe they take jobs that native-born citizens aren't interested in or don't have the skills for. I've heard terms like "filling labor shortages" or "taking on low-skilled jobs." But I need to verify this and see what specific sectors rely on immigrant workers.

Also, immigrants start businesses, right? I think some famous companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Maybe looking into entrepreneurship among immigrants would be another angle to explore. Additionally, they bring diversity to the marketplace, which can lead to innovation and cultural exchange that benefits the economy.

Another thing I've heard is that immigrants contribute to social security and other public services through taxes, even though they might not use as much of those services as native-born citizens. So, perhaps they help sustain these systems by paying in more than they take out. But I need to find data to support or refute this idea.

Moreover, younger populations can help balance an aging society's demographics. If a country has a low birth rate and an aging population, immigrants can fill the gap by entering the workforce and supporting the elderly through their tax contributions. This seems like an important point, but again, I need to find evidence to back it up.

I should also consider any potential negative impacts to have a balanced view. Some people argue that immigrants take jobs away from native-born citizens or put a strain on public resources. It's important to address these concerns and see what the data says about them.

To get accurate information, I should look for studies, reports, or articles from reputable organizations such as think tanks, government agencies, or academic institutions. Maybe I can find some recent statistics or longitudinal studies that show the effects of immigration on the economy over time.

Let me start by searching for general information on how immigration affects the economy. I'll look for overview articles that summarize the main points.
