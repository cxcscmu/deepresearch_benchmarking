I've been given this question: "Why do more men commit crimes than women?" It's a sensitive topic, and I need to approach it carefully and objectively. First, I should confirm whether it's actually true that men commit more crimes than women. I think generally, statistics show that men are arrested and convicted at higher rates than women for most types of crimes, but I need to verify that.

Let me start by looking up some data on crime rates by gender. Maybe I can find some reliable sources like government statistics or academic studies.

Alright, from the search results, it seems that indeed, men are overrepresented in crime statistics compared to women. For example, in the United States, men make up a larger proportion of arrests for violent crimes and property crimes. But why is that the case? There must be various social, biological, and environmental factors at play here.

First, let's consider biological factors. Some people might argue that men are biologically predisposed to aggression and risk-taking behaviors, which could lead to higher rates of criminal activity. But I need to be cautious here because attributing behavior solely to biology can be oversimplifying and ignoring other important factors.

I should look into what research says about the relationship between biology and crime.

From the search, I see that there are studies suggesting that testosterone, a hormone more prevalent in males
