So, the question is whether an organization can run effectively without leaders having some form of organizational power. Organizational power typically refers to the influence that leaders have over their subordinates, which can be used to direct activities, make decisions, and achieve goals. Power can come from various sources, such as position, expertise, personality, or relationships.

First, let's consider what organizational effectiveness means. It generally refers to how well an organization achieves its objectives, maintains efficiency, and adapts to changes in its environment. So, for an organization to be effective, it needs to be able to set clear goals, coordinate activities, motivate members, and respond to challenges.

Now, if we imagine an organization without any form of leadership power, what would that look like? It might resemble a completely flat structure where every decision is made collectively, and no one has authority over others. In theory, this could lead to high levels of autonomy and engagement among members, as everyone has a say in decision-making processes.

However, there are potential drawbacks to this approach. For instance, decision-making might become slow and inefficient if consensus is required for every issue. Additionally, without clear leadership, it may be difficult to establish direction and prioritize tasks, which could hinder the organization's ability to achieve its goals.

There are examples of organizations that operate with minimal hierarchical structures and distributed leadership, such as some tech companies and collaborative platforms. These organizations often emphasize empowerment, autonomy, and collective responsibility. They may use mechanisms like open communication channels, transparent decision-making processes, and shared goals to maintain effectiveness without relying on traditional forms of power.

On the other hand, in certain contexts, such as emergency situations or military operations, swift decision-making and clear chains of command are crucial for effectiveness. In these cases, organizational power is essential for ensuring that actions are coordinated and executed efficiently.

Moreover, research in organizational behavior suggests that effective leadership involves not just exercising power, but also building trust, fostering collaboration, and providing support to team members. Leaders who rely solely on positional power may face resistance and low morale among subordinates, whereas those who earn influence through expertise and interpersonal skills can inspire higher performance.

In conclusion, while it is possible for some organizations to function effectively with minimal leadership power, particularly in environments where autonomy and collaboration are valued, there are scenarios where organizational power plays a critical role in ensuring efficiency and adaptability. Therefore, the answer depends on the specific context and nature of the organization.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{It depends on the organization's context and nature.}} \]
