As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or emotions, but I can certainly help explore why managers might engage in actions that conflict with their own ethical values. Let's think through this step by step.

First, it's important to understand that managers, like any other individuals, face various pressures and constraints in their professional lives. These pressures can sometimes lead them to make decisions that go against their personal ethics. So, one possible reason could be external pressures from上级s, colleagues, or even shareholders.

Let me consider an example to illustrate this. Suppose a manager is working in a company where the top management is pushing for higher profits at all costs. The manager personally believes in ethical business practices and sustainability, but to meet the profit targets, they might be forced to cut corners in areas like quality control or employee welfare. This conflict between personal ethics and professional demands could lead them to act against their own values.

Another factor could be the fear of losing their job or missing out on promotions. Managers might feel that conforming to unethical practices is necessary for their career advancement or job security. This fear can override their ethical considerations.

Moreover, there might be instances where the manager is not fully aware of the ethical implications

Wait, hold on. I think there might be more to it than just external pressures and fear. Maybe sometimes managers rational

Actually, maybe managers don't always realize that their actions are conflicting with their ethical values. Maybe there's some kind of moral disengagement happening.
