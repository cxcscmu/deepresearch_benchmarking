So I've been asked to think about how COVID shutdowns, virtual school, and remote work have changed our relationship to technology. Hmm, that's a big question, and there's probably a lot to consider here. I need to break this down step by step.

First off, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about changes in our relationship with technology due to COVID-related shutdowns, virtual schooling, and remote work. So, it's not just about how technology has been used during this time, but how our relationship with it has changed. That could mean how we depend on it, perceive it, use it, maybe even emotionally connect with it.

I should probably start by thinking about what our relationship with technology was like before the pandemic. Back then, technology was certainly important, but maybe not as central to daily life for everyone as it became during the pandemic. For many people, technology was used for work, communication, entertainment, but there were still plenty of face-to-face interactions, physical gatherings, and activities that didn't necessarily involve technology.

Now, with COVID shutdowns, virtual school, and remote work, a lot of those in-person interactions moved online. So, technology became the primary means through which we conducted our daily livesâ€”working, learning, socializing, even attending events or worship
