Alright, I need to figure out how East Francia and England responded to Viking attacks. I don't remember much about this period, so I'll need to do some research. Let me start by understanding who these players are.

First, East Francia. I think Francia was an early medieval kingdom that included parts of modern France, Germany, and Italy. After the division of the Carolingian Empire, it split into West Francia and East Francia. West Francia became the kernel of what would be France, and East Francia was the precursor to Germany. So, East Francia is basically early medieval Germany.

England, at that time, was not unified as it is today. It was divided into several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms like Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, and others. So, I need to consider how these individual kingdoms, as well as later unified England, responded to Viking attacks.

Now, the Vikings were Norse seafarers who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of Europe during the late 8th to early 11th centuries. Their activities included piracy, trade, exploration, settlement, and warfare.

I need to look into how East Francia and England defended against these Viking incursions. Maybe they had similar strategies or perhaps they differed significantly.

Hmm, it seems like there isn't much direct information on how East Francia specifically responded to Viking attacks. Maybe I need to look into the broader context of Frankish defenses against Vikings.

Okay, from what I'm finding, the Franks, including both East and West Francia, faced Viking raids primarily along their river systems, which the Vikings used to penetrate deep into the mainland.

One of the key strategies employed by the Franks was the construction of fortified bridges and blockhouses at strategic points along rivers to hinder Viking access. They also reinforced existing fortifications and built new ones to protect cities and important sites.

Moreover, the Frankish kings often had to mobilize their armies to repel Viking invasions. For instance, King Charles the Bald of West Francia fought several battles
