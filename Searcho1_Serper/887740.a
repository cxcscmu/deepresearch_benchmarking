Alright, so I need to figure out how the colonists reacted to the Stamp Act. I don't remember a lot about this from history class, so I think I should look it up to get accurate information.

First, I need to understand what the Stamp Act was. I think it was a tax imposed by the British government on the American colonies. Maybe it had something to do with putting a stamp on certain documents or products to show that the tax had been paid. But I'm not sure about the details, so I should probably look that up too.

I think the Stamp Act was passed in 1765, but I'm not entirely sure. If I can confirm the date, that might help me find more information about the reaction of the colonists.

Okay, so let me try to search for "Stamp Act colonial reaction." Maybe that will give me some direct information.

<|begin_search_query|>Stamp Act colonial reaction<|end_search_query|>

<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>

Hmm, it seems like there was an error with the search. Maybe I should try rephrasing my query.

Let me try searching for "How did the American colonies react to the Stamp Act?"

<|begin_search_query|>How did the American colonies react to the Stamp Act?<|end_search_query|>

<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>

Again, no search result. This is frustrating. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Perhaps I should look for information on the Stamp Act itself and see if the colonial reaction is mentioned in the information provided.

Let me search for "Stamp Act 1765."

<|begin_search_query|>Stamp Act 1765<|end_search_query|>

<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>

Still no luck. Maybe there's a problem with the search function. I'll try asking for general information about the Stamp Act.

Let me search for "What was the Stamp Act?"

<|begin_search_query|>What was the Stamp Act?<|end_search_query|>

<|begin_search_result|><|end_search_result|>

This is odd; it seems like the search isn't working. Maybe I should try to recall what I know and reason through it.

I remember that after the French and Indian War, Britain was in debt and needed to raise money. So, they started imposing taxes on the colonies to help pay off the debt. The Stamp Act was one such tax.

I think the Stamp Act required colonists to buy special stamped paper for legal documents, newspapers, playing cards, and other items. The tax was supposed to help fund the administration of the colonies.

Now, how did the colonists react to this? I think they were pretty upset about it. They resented being taxed without their consent, as they had no representatives
