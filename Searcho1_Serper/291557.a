I'm trying to understand why Islam spread so quickly throughout the Mediterranean world. I know that Islam is a religion founded by Prophet Muhammad in the 7th century, but I'm not exactly sure about the factors that led to its rapid expansion. I think I need to look into the historical context of that time period and see what was happening politically, socially, and maybe even economically.

First, I should probably recall where the Mediterranean world consists of. It includes regions around the Mediterranean Sea, such as North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and parts of Asia. So, Islam originated in the Arabian Peninsula, and from there, it spread to these surrounding areas. But how did it happen so quickly?

I remember that Prophet Muhammad established the Muslim community in Medina in 622 CE, which is considered the start of the Islamic calendar. After his death in 632 CE, his successors, known as caliphs, continued to lead the Muslim community. Maybe the leadership under these caliphs played a role in the rapid spread of Islam.

Let me think about the Rashidun Caliphate, which was the first caliphate consisting of the four righteous caliphs: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. During their reigns, the Muslim empire expanded significantly, conquering vast territories including the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. So, perhaps military conquests were a major factor in the spread of Islam.

But was it just about warfare and conquest? I think there must be more to it. Maybe the people in the conquered regions converted to Islam voluntarily. What would have attracted them to the new religion? Perhaps the simplicity of Islamic teachings, the concept of one God, social justice, and equality appealed to them.

Also, I recall that Islam places a strong emphasis
