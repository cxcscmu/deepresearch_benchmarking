Alright, so I need to figure out how global warming happens. I've heard about it a lot in the news and from teachers, but I'm not exactly sure what causes it. I think it has something to do with the Earth getting warmer, but there must be more to it than that. Maybe I should start by understanding what global warming actually is.

I know that the Earth has a natural greenhouse effect, which is important for life because it keeps the planet warm enough for us to survive. Gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun and keep the Earth's temperature balanced. Without these gases, the Earth would be much colder and less hospitable.

But global warming seems to be about this natural process getting amplified or somehow disrupted. I think it's because there's an increase in these greenhouse gases, which leads to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere than usual. This excess trapped heat causes the overall temperature of the Earth to rise, leading to what we call global warming.

Now, where is this increase in greenhouse gases coming from? I believe a major contributor is human activity. Things like burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. So, as populations have grown and industrialization has spread, the amount of these gases has increased significantly.

Let me see if I can find some specific examples. Burning coal and oil for electricity and transportation releases CO2. Cutting down forests not only reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 but also releases carbon stored in the trees when they are burned or left to decompose. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, produces methane, which is another potent greenhouse gas.

I also remember hearing about feedback loops in relation to global warming. For example, as temperatures rise, permafrost in Arctic regions thaws, releasing even more methane and CO2, which further accelerates warming. It's like a vicious cycle.

Moreover, the oceans absorb a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere, which helps mitigate some of the warming. But this also leads to ocean acidification, which can have harmful effects on marine life. So, there are multiple interconnected issues here.

I should probably look up some data or sources to confirm what I'm thinking. Maybe check when global warming started becoming a significant issue and what the trends in temperature and greenhouse gas levels have been over time.

Let me try to search for some information on this.

Okay, based on the information I found, global warming is indeed caused primarily by the increase in greenhouse gases due to human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land.

The industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries marked a significant increase in the burning of fossil fuels, which released large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Since then, deforestation and agricultural practices have also contributed to the rise in greenhouse gas concentrations.

Data shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by about 47% since the beginning of the industrial era, from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in pre-industrial times to over 415 ppm today. This increase is directly linked to human activities.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When sunlight reaches the Earth's surface, some of it is reflected back towards space as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as CO2, methane, and water vapor, trap some of this infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space and thereby warming the planet.

However, the enhanced
