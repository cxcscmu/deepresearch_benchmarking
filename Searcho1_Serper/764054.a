I'm trying to understand why people steal cars. It seems like a complex issue, and there might be多种 reasons behind it. I need to think this through step by step.

First off, I should probably start by understanding what motivates someone to steal a car. Is it for transportation, resale, parts, or maybe something else? Each of these could be a reason, but I need to see which ones are most common.

Maybe I should look into statistics on car theft to see patterns or trends. Are certain types of cars more likely to be stolen than others? Does the value of the car play a role? Or is it more about convenience?

Also, I've heard that some cars are stolen for joyriding, especially by younger individuals. Is that a significant factor? And what about organized crime rings
