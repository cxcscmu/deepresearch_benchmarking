So I need to figure out what leads to poverty. That seems like a pretty big topic, but I'll try to break it down. Poverty is when people don't have enough money or resources to meet their basic needs, like food, shelter, and clothing. But what causes that to happen? There must be many factors involved.

First, maybe I should look at some definitions. What exactly is poverty? Is it just about lacking money, or is there more to it? I think there are different types of poverty, like absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty is when people can't afford the basic necessities of life, while relative poverty compares people's incomes to the standard of living in their society.

Hmm, so perhaps poverty is caused by a lack of income or resources. But why do some people have less income than others? Is it because they don't have jobs, or their jobs don't pay well? Or maybe there are other reasons.

Let me think about education. If someone doesn't have a good education, they might not be able to get a good job, which could lead to poverty. So education level could be a factor. Maybe access to education is limited in some areas, leading to higher poverty rates there.

Also, unemployment must play a role. If people don't have jobs, they won't have income, which directly leads to poverty. Economic recessions or depressions can increase unemployment, thereby increasing poverty.

Perhaps there are social factors too. For example, discrimination based on race, gender, or ethnicity can limit job opportunities for certain groups, leading to higher poverty rates among them.

I've heard about the cycle of poverty, where poor families have limited access to resources, which affects their children's opportunities, and the cycle continues. So intergenerational poverty is another aspect.

Maybe there are environmental factors as well. Natural disasters can destroy people's homes and livelihoods, pushing them into poverty. Or living in areas prone to such disasters can make it harder to escape poverty.

I should also consider health issues. If someone has a chronic illness or disability, they might not be able to work, or their medical expenses could drain
