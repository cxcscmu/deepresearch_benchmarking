Alright, I need to figure out how immigrants become citizens. I think this process is called naturalization, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up first.

Okay, so from what I've read, naturalization is indeed the process by which immigrants can become citizens of a country, specifically in the United States. But maybe other countries have similar processes. I should probably focus on the U.S. for now, unless specified otherwise.

So, the naturalization process in the U.S. seems to involve several steps. First, the immigrant usually needs to be a permanent resident, which means they have a green card. I think there are some exceptions to this, like for refugees or asylum seekers, but generally, a green card is required.

Next, I believe there's a waiting period. I'm not sure exactly how long, maybe three to five years, depending on how they obtained their green card. For example, if they got their green card through marriage to a U.S. citizen, the waiting period might be shorter than if they got it through employment.

During this waiting period, the immigrant needs to maintain continuous residence in the U.S. That means they can't leave the country for extended periods of time, or else it might disrupt their residency.

Also, I think they need to demonstrate good moral character. That probably means no criminal records or anything like that.

Then, there's probably an application to fill out, with lots of paperwork and fees to pay. I've heard that the application process can be quite complicated and time-consuming.

After submitting the application, there's likely an interview and a test. The test might cover topics like U.S. history, government, and civics. I think there's also an English language requirement, where they need to show that they can speak, read, and write in English.

If they pass the test and the interview goes well, then they might be approved for citizenship. Finally, there's a ceremony where they take the Oath of Allegiance and receive their certificate of naturalization.

But wait, are there any other requirements? Maybe age requirements? I think applicants need to be at least 18 years old. Although, there are provisions for minors to become citizens through their parents.

Also, I've heard of something called derivative citizenship, where someone becomes a citizen automatically because their parent naturalized. But I'm not sure about the details.

Moreover, there might be special categories of immigrants who have an easier path to citizenship, like military veterans or those with extraordinary
