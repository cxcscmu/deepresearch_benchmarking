Alright, so I need to figure out how extrinsic motivation affects performance in sports. First off, I need to understand what extrinsic motivation is. From what I recall, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because of external rewards or pressures, like winning a trophy, getting money, or pleasing someone else, rather than doing it for the love of the activity itself. In contrast, intrinsic motivation is when you do something because you find it inherently satisfying or enjoyable.

So, in the context of sports, extrinsic motivation could include things like scholarships, medals, endorsements, or even just praise from coaches
