Alright, so I need to figure out if neglect is a form of abuse. Hmm, I've heard these terms before, but I'm not entirely sure about the definitions or how they relate to each other. Maybe I should start by understanding what abuse is in general.

Abuse can take many forms, like physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and maybe others. Neglect seems different because it's more about omission—not doing something that should be done—rather than commission, like hitting someone or saying hurtful things. But I'm not sure if that makes it any less serious.

I think it's important to look up the definitions of both abuse and neglect to see how they overlap or differ. Maybe there's legal documentation or psychological perspectives that can help clarify this.

Let me consider starting with some online research. I'll search for "definition of abuse" and "definition of neglect" to get a basic understanding.

Okay, from what I'm seeing, abuse is generally defined as the improper usage or treatment of someone, often involving harm or mistreatment. It can be physical, emotional, sexual, or even financial. Abuse is usually an active behavior where one person exerts power or control over another in a harmful way.

Neglect seems to be more about a failure to act. It's when someone who has a responsibility to care for another person doesn't meet their needs, whether it's for food, shelter, medical care, or supervision. So, while abuse is often about doing something harmful, neglect is about not doing something that should be done.

But are they both considered forms of maltreatment? I think so. Both can cause harm to the victim, just in different ways. Abuse might be more immediate and visible, while neglect can be more chronic and perhaps less obvious.

Maybe I should look into child abuse and neglect, since that's a common context where these terms are used.
