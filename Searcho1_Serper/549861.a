I've been asked why so many young people seem to like communism. At first, I have to admit that I'm a bit confused by this trend because, from what I've learned, communism has had a pretty bad track record in history. Countries that have tried communist systems often ended up with dictators, economic failures, and human rights abuses. So, why would young people today be attracted to it?

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Perhaps when they say they like communism, they don't mean the strict Marxist-Leninist version that was implemented in places like the Soviet Union or China. Maybe they have a different idea of what communism is. I think I need to do some research to understand this better.

First, I should probably look into what communism really is and how it's defined. Then, I can see how young people today perceive it and why it appeals to them.

Let me start by searching for the basic definition of communism.

Alright, from what I've read, communism is an ideological system that aims for a classless society where means of production are owned communally. It's based on the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who wrote "The Communist Manifesto." In their view, communism is the final stage of society after socialism, where the state becomes unnecessary and wealth is distributed based on need.

But in practice, communist states have often been authoritarian, with centralized control over the economy and suppression of political dissent. Examples include the USSR under Stalin, China under Mao, and North Korea today. These regimes have been criticized for human rights violations, lack of personal freedoms, and economic inefficiencies.

So, if that's the case, why do young people seem to like communism? Maybe they don't know about these historical failures, or perhaps they have a romanticized view of equality and social justice that communism promises.

I recall seeing posts on social media where young adults express support for socialist or communist ideas, especially in relation to issues like income inequality, climate change, and social welfare. Maybe they see communism as a way to address these pressing global issues.

Perhaps I should look into how communism is perceived among young people today, especially in Western countries where capitalism is the dominant
