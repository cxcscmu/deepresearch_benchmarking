Euthanasia, also known as assisted dying or mercy killing, is the practice of intentionally ending a person's life to relieve their suffering from a terminal illness or incurable condition. The ethical, moral, and legal debates surrounding euthanasia are complex and multifaceted.

Firstly, proponents of euthanasia argue that individuals have the right to die with dignity and choose when and how to end their lives, especially when faced with unbearable pain or a loss of quality of life. They believe that euthanasia provides a compassionate option for those who are suffering and wish to avoid further distress.

Secondly, supporters contend that legalizing euthanasia can alleviate the emotional and financial burden on families caring for terminally ill relatives. It allows patients to make autonomous decisions about their own bodies and futures, respecting their autonomy and personal freedom.

On the other hand, opponents of euthanasia raise concerns about the potential for abuse and misapplication of the practice. They worry that vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or economically disadvantaged, may feel pressured into choosing euthanasia due to societal or familial expectations.

Moreover, critics argue that euthanasia undermines the sanctity of life and the inherent value of human existence. They believe that every life is precious, regardless of its circumstances, and that healthcare should focus on providing palliative care and support to alleviate suffering without resorting to ending life.

Additionally, there are religious and philosophical objections to euthanasia, with some faiths considering it akin to murder and therefore morally reprehensible.

From a legal perspective, the status of euthanasia varies significantly across different countries and jurisdictions. Some nations have legalized certain forms of euthanasia, such as in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada, while others have strict laws against it.

In conclusion, whether euthanasia should be legal is a highly debated issue with valid points on both sides. It requires careful consideration of ethical, moral, legal, and societal factors. Ultimately, any decision regarding its legalization must be made thoughtfully, with robust safeguards in place to protect the rights and well-being of all individuals involved.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The legality of euthanasia is a complex issue that requires balancing individual rights, ethical considerations, and societal values.}} \]
