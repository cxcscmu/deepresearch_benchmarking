Alright, so I need to figure out why Reconstruction failed after the Civil War. I don't remember a lot about this period, so I'll need to do some research to get a good understanding. Let me start by recalling what I know about Reconstruction.

Reconstruction was the period after the Civil War when the nation tried to rebuild and integrate the Southern states back into the Union, especially focusing on freeing the slaves and giving them rights. I think it lasted from 1865 to 1877. But I'm not entirely sure about the dates. Maybe I should look that up first.

Okay, according to the search, Reconstruction took place from 1865 to 1877. That matches what I thought. Now, why did it fail? I need to understand what goals were set during Reconstruction and whether they were achieved or not.

I believe the main goals were to reunite the country, to integrate formerly enslaved people into society as free citizens, and to establish a new social and political order in the South. But I need to confirm this.
