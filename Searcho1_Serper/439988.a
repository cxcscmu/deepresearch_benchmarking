Alright, so I've been asked how Medicaid can be improved while keeping it cost-effective. Medicaid is a health coverage program for low-income individuals and families in the U.S., and it's jointly funded by the federal and state governments. It's important because it provides essential healthcare services to those who might not otherwise be able to afford them. But like any large program, there's always room for improvement, especially when it comes to balancing quality of care with costs.

I know that Medicaid covers a broad range of services, including doctor visits, hospitalizations, prescription drugs, and long-term care. It's designed to be comprehensive, but with that comes complexity and potentially higher costs.

One issue I've heard about is administrative inefficiency. With Medicaid being a joint federal-state program, there are often differences in how states implement and manage the program.
