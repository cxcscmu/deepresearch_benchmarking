So I have this question: "How did a war to preserve the Union become a war to end slavery?" It's about the American Civil War, right? I know that it started as a conflict over whether the United States should stay together or if states had the right to secede, mainly because of disagreements over slavery. But I'm not exactly sure how it transformed into a war aimed at ending slavery. I think I need to look into the events and decisions made during the war that changed its focus.

First, maybe I should recall some basic facts about the start of the war. The Confederacy seceded after Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, largely because he was against the expansion of slavery into new territories. So, the initial issue was more about states' rights and the preservation of the institution of slavery in the South. The North, led by the Union, went to war primarily to keep the country united, not necessarily to abolish slavery immediately.

I remember something about the Emancipation Proclamation. Was that issued during the war? I think it was President Lincoln who issued it, declaring that slaves in Confederate-held areas were to be set free. But I'm not sure when that happened or how it affected the war's purpose.

Maybe I should look up when the Emancipation Proclamation was issued and what its implications
