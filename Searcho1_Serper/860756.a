So I have this question: "How did the Mexican Cession impact slavery?" Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I know that the Mexican Cession has something to do with the expansion of the United States in the 19th century. I think it had to do with the Mexican-American War, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, I need to figure out how this event affected slavery in the United States.

First things first, I should probably understand what the Mexican Cession is. I think it refers to the territory that Mexico ceded to the United States after the Mexican-American War in 1848. So, maybe I need to look into that war and the treaty that ended it, which I believe is called the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

I should probably do some research to get the facts straight. Maybe start by searching for "Mexican Cession" to get a better understanding of what it was and when it happened.

Alright, based on the information I found, the Mexican Cession was indeed the transfer of vast territories from Mexico to the United States in 1848, following the Mexican-American War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the new border between the two countries and granted the United States a large swath of land, including present-day California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, about half of New Mexico, about a quarter of Colorado, and a small section of Wyoming.

Now, considering that this was happening in the context of the United States in the mid-19th century, when slavery was a major issue, I need to think about how adding all this new territory would have impacted the balance between free states and slave states.

I recall that the Missouri Compromise in 1820 established a line at 36°30′ north latitude, above which slavery was prohibited in new territories and states. But I'm not sure if that still applied at the time of the Mexican Cession.

Maybe I should look into what the status of slavery was in these newly acquired territories.
