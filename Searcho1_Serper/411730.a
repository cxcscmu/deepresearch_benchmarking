I'm trying to understand this question about whether war makes states, specifically looking at rentierism and state formation in the Middle East. I'm not super familiar with these terms, so I need to break it down and do some research to get a grasp on what's being asked.

First off, what does it mean for war to "make" states? I think this is referring to the idea that conflicts and wars can lead to the creation or strengthening of governmental structures. Maybe something like the notion that nations come together in times of war, or that war necessitates a more organized state apparatus to manage military efforts and resources.

Rentierism sounds familiar; I think it has to do with states that derive a large portion of their revenue from rent-seeking activities, like selling natural resources, rather than from taxing their citizens. In the Middle East, many countries have economies heavily dependent on oil exports, which fits this description.

So, putting it all together, the question seems to be exploring the relationship between war, state formation, and rentier economies in the Middle East. It might be asking whether the experience of war has led to the creation of rentier states in the region, or perhaps how rentierism has influenced the way states have formed and evolved in the context of regional conflicts.

I need to clarify some key concepts here:

1. **State formation**: This refers to the process by which a political entity develops the institutions and structures necessary to govern a territory and its population effectively.

2. **Rentierism**: As I mentioned, this is when a state's revenues come primarily from renting out its resources or from external sources like foreign aid, rather than from taxation of its citizens.

3. **Middle East**: The geographical and cultural region that includes countries from Morocco in the west to Iran in the east, and from Turkey in the north to Yemen in the south.

4. **War**: Armed conflict, especially between nations or large groups.

Given these definitions, I need to explore whether war has been a significant factor in shaping the formation of states in the Middle East, particularly those that have developed into rentier states.

Perhaps I should start by looking at historical examples of state formation in the Middle East and see how war has influenced them.

Let me consider the formation of modern Middle Eastern states. Many of these states were created or had their borders defined during the colonial period, particularly after World War I when the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, and European powers like Britain and France established mandates over various regions.

For instance, countries like Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon were carved out by the British and French based on political considerations, rather than existing national identities or historical boundaries. War, in this case World War I, played a direct role in redrawing the map of the Middle East and creating new states.

Now, considering rentierism, many of these newly formed states later discovered significant oil reserves, which became their primary source of income. This shift towards rentier economies might have been influenced by the circumstances of state formation and the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region.

Maybe I should look into specific cases where war has led to the establishment or transformation of states into rentier entities.

Let's take Saudi Arabia as an example. The modern Saudi state was formed in the 1930s through a series of conquests by Ibn Saud, often involving warfare with rival tribes and factions. The discovery of oil in the 1930s transformed the country's economy, making it heavily reliant on oil revenues. So, in this case, warfare was instrumental in unifying the territory, and the subsequent discovery of oil led to a rentier economy.

Another example could be Kuwait. Its independence was influenced by British policies and regional dynamics, including conflicts with neighboring countries. Once independent, Kuwait's vast oil reserves allowed it to develop a rentier state model, where the government provides extensive social services and subsidies to its citizens in exchange for their political quiescence.

Iran might also be relevant. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the country engaged in a protracted war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988. This war had a profound impact on Iranian society and politics, strengthening the revolutionary government's grip
