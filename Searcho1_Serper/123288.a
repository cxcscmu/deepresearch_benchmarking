Alright, I need to figure out how climate change affects seals. I don't know much about this topic off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research. First, I should probably understand what climate change is and how it impacts the environment, especially the habitats of animals like seals.

I know that climate change refers to long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and lead to global warming, causing various environmental changes.

Seals are marine mammals, mostly found in cold and polar
