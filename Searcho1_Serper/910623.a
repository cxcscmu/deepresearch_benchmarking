I'm trying to figure out what shapes personal ethical standards. So, ethical standards are like the rules people use to decide what's right and wrong in their lives. I think there are many things that influence these standards, like what we learn from our families, our culture, and maybe even our own thoughts and experiences.

First, I think philosophy plays a big role. There are different philosophical theories about ethics, like utilitarianism, which says that the best action is the one that helps the most people, or deontology, which is about following rules and duties no matter what. Then there's virtue ethics, which focuses on being a good person and having good character traits
