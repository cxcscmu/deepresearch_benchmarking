Alright, I need to figure out how Herbert Hoover responded to the demands of the Bonus Army. I don't remember much about this, so I'll need to do some research. First, I should understand who Herbert Hoover is and what the Bonus Army was demanding.

Herbert Hoover was the 31st President of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. He took office just before the stock market crash of 1929, which led to the Great Depression. So, during his presidency, there were a lot of economic hardships and public dissatisfaction.

The Bonus Army refers to a group of World War I veterans who gathered in Washington, D.C., in 1932 to demand early payment of a promised bonus for their military service. The bonus was originally scheduled to be paid in 1945, but with the onset of the Great Depression, many veterans were facing financial difficulties and sought immediate payment.

So, the Bonus Army was essentially protesting for financial relief. Now, I need to find out how President Hoover reacted to their demands.

I think I should look up some information about the Bonus Army and Hoover's response. Maybe start with a general search.

Let me try searching for "Herbert Hoover and the Bonus Army."

Okay, based on the search results, it seems that Hoover's response was quite controversial. The Bonus Army consisted of thousands of veterans and their families who set up temporary camps in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the immediate payment of their bonuses.

Hoover's administration was initially somewhat sympathetic to their cause. The veterans were allowed to camp on government property, and some officials even supported their petition. However, as the protest grew larger and more persistent, Hoover became increasingly concerned about the potential for disorder and the impact on his administration's reputation.

One key event was when the Senate passed a bill to approve the bonus payment, but the House of Representatives rejected it. This rejection led to further protests and tensions escalated.

Hoover then ordered the U.S. Army to disperse the Bonus Army from their camps. This decision has been widely criticized, as the military action against American veterans was seen as heavy-handed and unsympathetic.

General Douglas MacArthur, with the support of Hoover, led the military operation to clear the camps. Troops, armed with bayonets and tear gas, marched on the veterans' encampments and forcibly removed the protesters. This action was widely condemned by the public and the media, and it damaged Hoover's already struggling popularity.

In retrospect, Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army crisis is often cited as a significant mistake in his presidency, contributing to his defeat in the 1932 election to Franklin D. Roosevelt.

So, to summarize, Hoover responded to the Bonus Army's demands by ultimately authorizing military force to disperse the protesters, which was met with public outrage and criticism.

I think that's the main point, but maybe I should look a bit deeper to see if there were any other aspects to his response.

Perhaps I should search specifically for "Hoover's response to the Bonus Army."

From the additional information, it appears that Hoover's initial approach was to try to manage the situation without resorting to force. He authorized the appointment of a committee to look into the veterans' claims and consider possible solutions. However, when the Senate passed the bonus bill and the House rejected it, the situation escalated.

Hoover then considered other options, such as offering transportation and funding for the veterans to return home, but many refused to leave unless their demands were met.

The tipping point came when some veterans marched on the Capitol and allegedly committed acts of vandalism. Hoover saw this as a threat to law and order and decided to take stronger action.

He directed Attorney General William D. Mitchell and Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley to handle the situation. They, in turn, requested that General MacArthur lead the military operation to remove the protesters.

This decision has been heavily criticized, as using military force against American veterans was seen as inappropriate and callous, especially given the economic hardships they were facing.

Moreover, the way the operation was carried out was chaotic and violent. The troops used tear gas and bayonets to驱赶 the veterans, and some civilians were injured. The images of soldiers attacking veterans and their families were broadcasted nationwide, further damaging Hoover's image.

It's also worth noting that Hoover's opponents, particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt, capitalized on this event to paint Hoover as uncaring and authoritarian, which likely influenced public opinion against him.

In contrast, after Hoover left office, some historians have reevaluated his response, arguing that he was faced with a difficult situation and that the Bonus Army posed a genuine
