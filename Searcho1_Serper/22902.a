Alright, so I need to figure out how humans contribute to climate change. I know that climate change is a big topic, and there are a lot of factors involved, but I need to focus on the human aspects. I think starting with some basic understanding would be good. Maybe I should look up what climate change is first.

Wait, no, I already know that climate change refers to long-term changes in global or regional climate patterns, especially changes that disrupt typical patterns. It's mainly attributed to human activities that increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures and other environmental impacts.

So, the key here is identifying those human activities that lead to an increase in greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nit
