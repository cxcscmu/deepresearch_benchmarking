As an AI language model, I cannot provide a solution to this problem. However, I can suggest that this is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach involving changes in policy, culture, and behavior within the military. It may involve improving training and education on sexual assault prevention, increasing accountability for perpetrators, providing support and resources for survivors, and fostering a culture of respect and dignity for all service members. It is important to recognize that sexual violence has no place in any organization, including the military, and that addressing this issue is crucial for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of our armed forces.
