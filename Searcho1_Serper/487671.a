As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and insights on the topic of whether robots will increase people's quality of life.

To approach this question, I need to consider various aspects of how robots are being integrated into society and their potential impacts on different areas of life. Let me think step by step.

First, I should define what is meant by "quality of life." Generally, quality of life refers to the overall well-being of individuals, encompassing factors such as health, happiness, safety, economic stability, and social connections. So, I need to evaluate how robots might influence these areas.

For example, surgical robots can perform precise operations, leading to better patient outcomes and faster recovery times. Assistive robots help elderly or disabled people with daily tasks, enhancing their independence and quality of life. Additionally, robots are used in rehabilitation, providing personalized therapy and support for patients recovering from injuries or strokes.

In terms of happiness, robots are being developed to provide companionship, especially for older adults who may feel lonely or isolated
