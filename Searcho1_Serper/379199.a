So I have this question: "What causes sexism?" Hmm, that's a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down. Sexism is basically prejudice or discrimination based on someone's sex or gender. It's a social issue that's been around for a long time, and it affects people in different ways. To understand what causes sexism, I think I need to look into various factors like society's norms, culture, economics, and even psychology.

First off, I know that in many societies, there are traditional roles assigned to men and women. For example, men are often expected to be providers and leaders, while women are expected to be caregivers and nurturers. These roles can limit opportunities for both genders and lead to inequality. So, maybe societal norms and expectations are one cause of sexism.

Next, I think about culture. Different cultures have different attitudes towards gender. Some cultures are more patriarchal, where men hold more power and authority, while others might be more egalitarian. So, cultural beliefs and practices probably play a role in perpetuating sexism.

Economics could also be a factor. In societies where men dominate the workforce and hold most of the wealth, women might be disadvantaged. This economic imbalance can lead to power disparities and reinforce sexist attitudes.

Moreover, I recall that psychology plays a part in individual biases and prejudices. Maybe people develop sexist attitudes based on their upbringing, experiences, and the media they consume
