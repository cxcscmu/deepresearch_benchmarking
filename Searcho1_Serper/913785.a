As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide you with some points to consider regarding whether university students should be encouraged to start their own businesses.

Firstly, starting a business can be a valuable learning experience for university students. It allows them to apply theoretical knowledge from their courses to real-world situations, fostering practical skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making. Additionally, entrepreneurship can instill a sense of initiative and resilience, which are essential qualities in today's dynamic job market.

Secondly, universities can play a crucial role in supporting student entrepreneurs by providing resources such as business incubators, mentorship programs, and access to funding. These support systems can help mitigate some of the risks associated with starting a business and increase the likelihood of success.

On the other hand, there are potential drawbacks to consider. Starting a business requires significant time and effort, which may distract students from their academic pursuits. Balancing both responsibilities can be challenging and may lead to decreased performance in one or both areas. Moreover, the failure rate of startups is high, and experiencing failure at an early stage could be discouraging for some students.

In conclusion, while there are benefits to encouraging university students to start their own businesses, it is important to weigh these against the potential challenges. Providing adequate support and ensuring that students have a solid understanding of what entrepreneurship entails can help maximize the positive outcomes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{University students should be encouraged to start their own businesses, provided they have access to appropriate support and resources to manage the challenges involved.}} \]
