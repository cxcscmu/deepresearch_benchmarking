Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects our health. Hmm, climate change is a big topic, and health is broad too. I should probably start by understanding what climate change is and then see how it connects to health issues.

First things first, what is climate change? I know it has something to do with the Earth's temperature rising, right? Yeah, it's the long-term warming of the planet due to human activities, like burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a gradual increase in the Earth's temperature. This is often referred to as global warming, but climate change also includes other changes like precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and more extreme weather events.

Okay, so now I need to link this to health. How does an increase in temperature or changes in weather patterns affect people's health? I think there are direct and indirect effects here.

Let me start with the direct effects. Higher temperatures can lead to more heatwaves, which can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing health conditions. Heatwaves can cause heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and dehydration. In severe cases, they can be fatal.

Another direct effect is probably more extreme weather events, like hurricanes, floods, and droughts. These can lead to injuries, displacement, and even death. For example, flooding can cause drownings and damage infrastructure, leading to a lack of clean water and increased risk of waterborne diseases.

Hmm, what about air quality? I've heard that climate change can worsen air pollution
