Alright, I need to figure out how apartheid affected people. I know that apartheid was a system of racial segregation, but I'm not exactly sure how it played out in people's daily lives. I should probably start by understanding what apartheid really was and then see how it impacted different aspects of people's lives.

First things first, I need to recall when and where apartheid took place. I think it was in South Africa, right? And it was a policy that was enacted by the white minority government to maintain their power by segregating different races. So, it's about separating people based on their race in every aspect of life.

But to be thorough, I should confirm this information. Maybe I can look up a definition of apartheid to make sure I have the basics correct.
