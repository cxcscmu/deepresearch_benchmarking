One thing that probably helped Christianity's success was its message. Jesus taught about love, forgiveness, and a personal relationship with God. His teachings were inclusive and offered hope, especially to marginalized groups like women, slaves, and the poor. In a society where many felt oppressed or overlooked, Christianity provided a sense of community and belonging.
