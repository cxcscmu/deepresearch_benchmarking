As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or experiences, but I can certainly help you understand how Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) can encourage nursing-based outcome studies. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what APRNs are and what nursing-based outcome studies entail.

**Step 1: Understanding APRNs and Nursing-Based Outcome Studies**

APRNs are nurses who have advanced education and clinical training beyond the basic registered nurse (RN) level. They include certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and nurse practitioners (NPs). These professionals play crucial roles in healthcare delivery, often providing primary and specialty care.

Nursing-based outcome studies, on the other hand, are research endeavors that focus on evaluating the effects of nursing interventions, practices, or models of care on patient outcomes. These studies are essential for evidence-based practice, as they help determine the effectiveness of nursing care and inform best practices.

**Step 2: Identifying Barriers to Nursing-Based Outcome Studies**

Before I can suggest ways APRNs can encourage these studies, I need to consider what might be hindering their initiation or completion. Potential barriers could include lack of research funding, time constraints, insufficient research training among nurses, and limited access to data.

**Step 3: Strategies for Encouragement**

Given these potential barriers, here are some strategies APRNs could employ to encourage nursing-based outcome studies:

1. **Advocacy for Research Funding:** APRNs can advocate for increased funding for nursing research at institutional, national, and international levels. This could involve lobbying policymakers, writing grants
