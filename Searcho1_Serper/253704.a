Alright, so I need to figure out how police investigate crimes. I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I think beginning with understanding the general process would be helpful. Maybe I should look into the steps they take from when a crime is reported to when they catch the perpetrator.

First, I should probably consider what happens immediately after a crime is reported. I think officers are dispatched to the scene to assess the situation and ensure that everyone is safe. Then, they must start collecting evidence and talking to witnesses. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Maybe I should try to break it down into smaller parts. Like, what does the initial response entail? Who is involved in the investigation? What kinds of evidence do they look for? How do they follow up on leads?

Let me start by thinking about the initial response. When a crime is reported, probably the first officers on the scene are responsible for securing the area, making sure no one tampers with potential evidence, and ensuring that any victims or witnesses are taken care of. They might also provide first aid if necessary.

Next, I imagine that detectives or investigators are called in to take over the scene and begin the detailed investigation. They would be the ones to collect physical evidence, take photographs
