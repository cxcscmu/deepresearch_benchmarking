So I'm trying to figure out what would happen if marijuana was federally legalized in the United States. I don't know a lot about this topic, so I need to do some research. First, I should understand what federal legalization means compared to state legalization. I know that some states have already legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, but it's still illegal at the federal level. So, if it's federally legalized, that would override the state laws, right? But I'm not sure about that.

Maybe I should start by looking up how federal legalization would affect the current state laws. I think there's something called the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution that might be relevant here. I think it says that federal law takes precedence over state law. So, if marijuana is legalized federally, it would probably invalidate any state laws that prohibit marijuana, right? But I need to confirm that.

Also, I should consider the implications
