The perception of increasing crime rates can be attributed to several factors, including changes in prosecution and punishment policies, bail reform, and societal factors that may demoralize law enforcement, as noted by the Heritage Foundation. However, it's important to note that while some areas may experience increases, overall violent crime rates in the U.S. have seen declines since the early 1990s, with recent data showing decreases in certain types of violent crime, such as murder and non-negligent manslaughter.
