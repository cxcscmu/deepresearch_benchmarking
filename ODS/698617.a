The Louisiana Purchase transformed America's understanding of itself by doubling the size of the United States, which significantly strengthened the country both materially and strategically. It also provided a powerful impetus for westward expansion, altering the nation's perception of its potential and destiny. This expansion added a large buffer between the settled areas of the U.S. and the Spanish Empire, further influencing America's self-perception as a growing and powerful nation.
