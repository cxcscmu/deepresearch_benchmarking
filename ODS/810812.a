## Detailed Findings

1. **Causes of the Crusades:**
   - One of the primary causes was the desire of the Pope to increase the power of the Church and heal the schism between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Additionally, some crusaders were motivated by the prospect of acquiring wealth and land[^1].
   - The expansion of Islam and the need to protect Christian territories and pilgrims were significant triggers for the Crusades. The campaigns were seen as a way to liberate the Holy Land and protect Constantinople from Muslim forces[^2].
   - Economic factors also played a role, as the protection of trade routes was crucial. This need led to the rise in power of kings and a corresponding decrease in the influence of the nobility[^3].

2. **Effects of the Crusades:**
   - The Crusades resulted in an increased presence of Christians in the Levant during the Middle Ages and the development of military orders such as the Knights Templar[^4].
   - They caused a polarization between the Christian West and the Muslim East, which has had lasting impacts on Christian-Muslim relations[^4].
   - The Crusades also facilitated cultural and technological exchanges between the East and West, influencing European architecture, science, and trade[^5].

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of sources and the potential bias in historical interpretations. Some sources may present a Eurocentric perspective, and the complexity of the Crusades means that not all causes and effects can be comprehensively covered in a brief report. Additionally, the dynamic nature of historical scholarship means that new interpretations and findings could emerge, altering the current understanding of the Crusades.
