The Crusades were primarily caused by the desire of Western European Christians to secure control of holy sites in the Middle East, as well as the Pope's aim to increase power and heal the schism within Christianity. Some crusaders also hoped to gain wealth. The effects of the Crusades included an increased Christian presence in the Levant, the development of military orders, a polarization between the East and West, the rise of power of kings, a decrease in the power of nobles, and increased wealth in Italy. Additionally, the Crusades led to the persecution of Jews and the breakdown of feudal structures.
