World War I played a significant role in advancing women's suffrage. During the war, women took on roles traditionally held by men, which demonstrated their capability and strengthened the campaign for women's suffrage. This contribution to the war effort helped lead to the passage of the 1918 Representation of the People Act in the UK, which granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications. In the United States, the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote, was passed in 1920, influenced by women's contributions during the war.
