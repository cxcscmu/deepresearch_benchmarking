People believe in fake news due to a combination of psychological, cognitive, and social factors. These include the rapid spread of misinformation on social media, the influence of information source and content, repetition, and individual personality traits. Additionally, factors such as delusionality, dogmatism, religious fundamentalism, and reduced analytic thinking can also contribute to the susceptibility to fake news.
