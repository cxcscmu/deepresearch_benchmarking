The economic effects of the Cold War included significant military expenditures by the United States, estimated at roughly 8-9 trillion dollars, which diverted resources from civilian sectors but also spurred technological advancements. The period saw high inflation by the 1970s, leading to a shift towards supply-side economics, although deficit spending continued. Additionally, global trade was less integrated during the Cold War, with trade to GDP ratios significantly lower than in later periods.
