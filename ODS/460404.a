Climate affects culture in several ways. It influences agricultural practices, which in turn affect social structures, such as the value of cooperation and community size. Climate change can also impact cultural heritage by increasing the frequency and intensity of hazardous events like droughts and floods, which threaten both tangible and intangible cultural assets. Additionally, climate variations, such as seasonal changes, can shape cultural norms and practices.
