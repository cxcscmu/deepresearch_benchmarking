Parental incarceration can have several negative effects on children in the home. It often leads to increased antisocial behaviors, emotional distress, and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Children may also face immediate threats of poverty due to a lack of stable housing and parental income, and they may experience feelings of confusion, guilt, and responsibility for their parent's incarceration. Additionally, the stress associated with having an incarcerated parent can lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other long-term health and social challenges.
