Italian culture differs from American culture in several ways. Italians tend to have a more formal sense of fashion and style compared to Americans. Food is taken very seriously in Italy, with many shops closing for a few hours midday for lunch, reflecting a more relaxed and laid-back lifestyle. Additionally, Italians often prioritize human interaction and living in the present, with a more fluid approach to time, where being fashionably late is common.
