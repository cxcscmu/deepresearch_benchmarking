# Report on the Increase in Domestic Violence

## Executive Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a significant increase in domestic violence globally. This phenomenon, often referred to as the "shadow pandemic," has been exacerbated by factors such as economic stress, social isolation, and restricted movement due to lockdowns. Various studies and reports have highlighted the multifaceted reasons behind this surge, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies to address and mitigate domestic violence.

## Methodology

To gather information on the increase in domestic violence, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and reputable sources. The search focused on articles and reports published during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Key search terms included "domestic violence increase," "COVID-19 lockdowns," and "shadow pandemic." Sources were selected based on their relevance and credibility, including reports from health organizations, academic institutions, and news outlets.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact of COVID-19 Lockdowns**: The imposition of stay-at-home orders during the pandemic led to a significant rise in domestic violence incidents. A report by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice noted an 8.1% increase in domestic violence incidents in the U.S. following these orders[^2]. This increase is attributed to the heightened stress and confinement experienced by individuals during lockdowns.

2. **Global Trends**: The World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office reported that violence against women tends to increase during emergencies, including epidemics. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted social and protective networks, contributing to the rise in domestic violence[^1]. This trend was observed globally, with record levels of violence against women reported following lockdowns[^3].

3. **Economic and Social Stressors**: Financial stress is a well-documented trigger for domestic violence. The pandemic exacerbated economic pressures, leading to increased conflict and violence within households[^6]. Additionally, the overwhelming of health sectors and the limited capacity of domestic violence shelters further compounded the issue[^4].

## Limitations

The findings are primarily based on reports and studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may not fully capture the long-term trends in domestic violence. Additionally, variations in data collection methods and reporting standards across different regions may affect the comparability of the findings. Further research is needed to explore the ongoing impact of the pandemic on domestic violence and to develop effective intervention strategies.
