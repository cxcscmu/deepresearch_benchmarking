# Report on Why Adult Children Become Estranged

## Executive Summary

Parental estrangement, particularly between adult children and their parents, is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is not merely a passing trend but a significant phenomenon influenced by various factors. This report explores the reasons behind this estrangement, highlighting the cyclical nature of such relationships and the diverse causes that lead to a breakdown in familial ties.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources such as Psychology Today, YourTango, and other counseling and therapy websites. The search strategy included keywords like "adult children estrangement," "parent-child estrangement causes," and "reasons for family estrangement." The findings were cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cyclical Nature of Estrangement**: According to Psychology Today, estrangement is often cyclical, with adult children experiencing periods of estrangement and reconciliation. This suggests that estrangement is not always permanent and can be part of a larger pattern of familial relationships [^1].

2. **Common Reasons for Estrangement**: Several sources highlight common reasons for estrangement, including abuse, betrayal, and poor parenting. Morin Holistic Therapy notes that these factors are frequently cited by adult children as reasons for severing ties with their parents [^2].

3. **Diverse Causes**: The reasons for estrangement are varied and can include attachment trauma, neglect, and adverse childhood experiences. Croswaite Counseling PLLC identifies these as significant factors contributing to the decision of adult children to estrange themselves from their parents [^3].

4. **Influence of External Relationships**: Relationships with in-laws can also play a role in estrangement. Dr. Jan Anderson's blog mentions that conflicts with a son-in-law or daughter-in-law can lead to estrangement, highlighting the impact of extended family dynamics [^4].

5. **Lifestyle and Value Differences**: Disagreements over lifestyle choices, religion, values, or politics can also lead to estrangement. Pamela Henkelman discusses how these differences can cause a child to sever relationships with their family, emphasizing the role of personal beliefs and values in familial relationships [^5].
