Adult children often become estranged from their parents due to reasons such as attachment trauma, abuse, neglect, adverse experiences, and disagreements over lifestyle choices, religion, values, or politics. Additionally, a lack of emotional validation and unresolved conflicts can contribute to the decision to sever ties. These choices are typically not made impulsively and may involve a complex interplay of personal and familial factors.
