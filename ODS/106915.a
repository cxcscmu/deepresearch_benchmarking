Schools are addressing society's problems by providing opportunities for students to engage with social issues, re-examining educational approaches to meet new societal challenges, and integrating anti-bias education into the curriculum. They also focus on addressing problems such as low academic achievement, substance abuse, and career planning, while teaching students about bias and using current events and literature to foster understanding.
