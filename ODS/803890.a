# Endangered Species: Causes and Implications

## Executive Summary
Animals become endangered due to a variety of factors, primarily driven by human activities. The most significant causes include habitat loss, over-exploitation, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species. These factors disrupt ecosystems and threaten the survival of numerous species, leading to a decline in biodiversity. Understanding these causes is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies to protect endangered species and maintain ecological balance.

## Methodology
To gather information on why animals become endangered, I utilized a combination of authoritative sources, including educational and governmental websites. The search strategy involved identifying key terms such as "endangered species causes" and "why animals become endangered." The tools used included a search engine to access a variety of sources, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Habitat Loss**: Habitat destruction is the leading cause of species endangerment. This can occur through deforestation, urban development, and agricultural expansion. "The main modern causes of extinction are the loss and degradation of habitat (mainly deforestation)" [^5]. Habitat loss not only reduces the living space for species but also fragments populations, making it difficult for them to survive and reproduce.

2. **Over-Exploitation**: Human activities such as hunting, fishing, and harvesting have led to the over-exploitation of wildlife. "Species can become extinct when humans over hunt and over fish, pollute the environment, destroy habitats, and introduce new species to areas" [^4]. This unsustainable use of natural resources depletes populations faster than they can recover.

3. **Pollution and Climate Change**: Pollution from industrial activities and climate change significantly impact species survival. "Habitat loss and destruction, climate change, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive species are the main factors that contribute to endangerment" [^8]. These factors alter habitats and can lead to toxic environments that are uninhabitable for many species.

4. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of non-native species can disrupt local ecosystems and outcompete native species for resources. "Loss of habitat, the introduction of a foreign species into the environment, hunting, pollution, disease, and loss of genetic variation are all causes of endangerment" [^6]. Invasive species can lead to the decline or extinction of native species.

## Limitations
The information gathered is based on available online resources and may not encompass all possible causes of species endangerment. Additionally, the data is subject to the limitations of the sources used, which may not reflect the most current research or regional variations in causes of endangerment. Further research, including peer-reviewed studies, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
