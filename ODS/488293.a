The debate over whether standardized testing should be abolished is contentious. Critics argue that standardized tests are inaccurate, unfair, and do not truly reflect student learning or progress, as noted by sources like NEA and FairTest. They also claim that these tests can be biased and limit educational opportunities. On the other hand, proponents, such as those mentioned in Britannica, argue that standardized tests provide essential data for resource allocation and understanding educational challenges. The decision to abolish or reform standardized testing depends on weighing these differing perspectives.
