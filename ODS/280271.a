People believe in conspiracy theories due to a combination of personality traits and motivations, such as relying strongly on intuition, epistemic motives (the desire to understand one's environment), existential motives (the need to feel safe), and social influences like the prevalence of social media and 24-hour news cycles. Additionally, people high in collective narcissism are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories.
