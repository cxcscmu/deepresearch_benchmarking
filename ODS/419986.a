Occupational therapy can be therapeutic in recovery by facilitating engagement in everyday activities that promote health and well-being. Occupational therapists assess and support individuals in restoring their roles, creating new occupations, and finding purpose and meaning in life, which can help prevent relapse and support recovery from substance use. They focus on restoring skills and abilities, addressing behavioral and cognitive changes, and using clients' skills to facilitate occupational change and support their recovery journey.
