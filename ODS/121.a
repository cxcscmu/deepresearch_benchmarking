European "ethnics" became considered white through a process of assimilation influenced by social and policy changes. The concept of the "melting pot" played a significant role in this assimilation, promoting the blending of different European ethnicities into a singular white identity. Additionally, federal housing policies and institutional practices contributed to this shift by creating segregated neighborhoods where European ethnics were integrated into the broader category of whiteness.
