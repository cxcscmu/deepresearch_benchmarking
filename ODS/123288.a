Climate change affects seals by altering their habitat and food sources. The warming climate is reducing the reliability, quality, and extent of sea ice, which negatively impacts ice-loving seals such as harp, hooded, and ringed seals. This loss of sea ice threatens their survival and reproductive rates. Additionally, rising sea levels and increased storm activity can flood or block habitats, making them less hospitable for seals. These changes force seals to migrate to less protected areas, impacting their health and behavior.
