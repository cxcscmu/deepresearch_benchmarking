# Climate Change and Its Impact on Seals

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant threats to seal populations worldwide, affecting their habitat, prey availability, and overall health. The reduction in sea ice, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of storms are altering the environments seals depend on for breeding, resting, and hunting. These changes have led to shifts in seal behavior, health issues, and potential declines in reproductive rates, posing a risk to their survival.

## Methodology

To gather information on the impact of climate change on seals, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including government websites, scientific articles, and environmental organizations. The search focused on recent studies and reports that discuss the direct and indirect effects of climate change on seal populations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Habitat Loss and Alteration**: The warming climate is significantly impacting the reliability and extent of sea ice, which is crucial for ice-loving seals such as harp, hooded, and ringed seals. "Ice-loving seals, such as harp, hooded and ringed seals, are among the many species threatened by climate change" [^2]. The loss of sea ice forces seals to migrate to less suitable habitats, increasing their vulnerability to predators and reducing their breeding success.

2. **Health and Behavior**: Seals in Alaska have shown signs of distress due to rapid warming, including sores, hair loss, and lethargic behavior. "Affected seals had sores, hair loss, and lethargic behavior, but most were not in poor nutritional condition" [^8]. These health issues are indicative of the stress seals experience as their environment changes rapidly.

3. **Reproductive Challenges**: Climate change is also affecting the reproductive rates of seals. For instance, research indicates a decline in female harp seal reproductive rates due to changing environmental conditions. "Research has shown this may cause declines in female harp seal reproductive rates" [^3]. This decline is attributed to the reduced availability of suitable breeding sites and prey.

## Limitations

The findings are based on available online resources and may not encompass all recent studies or unpublished data. The information is subject to change as new research emerges. Additionally, the impact of climate change can vary significantly across different seal species and geographic regions, which may not be fully captured in this report.
