# Report on the Causes of Sexism

## Executive Summary

Sexism, a form of discrimination based on gender, is a complex social issue with multiple causes. It is deeply rooted in societal norms, cultural beliefs, and historical practices that perpetuate gender inequality. This report explores the origins and causes of sexism, drawing from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of this pervasive issue.

## Methodology

To gather information on the causes of sexism, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on reputable databases and websites. The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases, focusing on sources that provide detailed insights into the historical, cultural, and social dimensions of sexism.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural and Historical Roots**: Sexism is often perpetuated by longstanding cultural and historical norms that assign different roles and values to men and women. According to Medica Mondiale, "sexism happens because of underlying attitudes that consider women to have less value than men"[^1]. This historical perspective is crucial in understanding how sexism has been institutionalized over time.

2. **Gender Stereotypes and Roles**: The belief in rigid gender roles contributes significantly to sexism. The European Institute for Gender Equality notes that "sexism is linked to beliefs around the fundamental nature of women and men and the roles they should play in society"[^2]. These stereotypes reinforce the idea that certain behaviors and roles are inherently suited to one gender over the other.

3. **Ideological Systems of Oppression**: Sexism is part of broader ideological systems that include other forms of discrimination, such as racism. Wikipedia highlights that "sexism is perpetuated by all major social institutions" and is often compared to racism in its systemic nature[^3]. This comparison underscores the pervasive and institutionalized nature of sexism.

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of sources that specifically address the causes of sexism. While the sources used provide a broad overview, they may not cover all aspects of the issue comprehensively. Additionally, the lack of recent empirical studies in the search results may limit the depth of analysis regarding current trends and changes in societal attitudes towards sexism.
