The concept of sex as a social construct is debated. Some sources argue that while biological sex involves physical characteristics, the strict binary understanding of sex is socially constructed. This perspective suggests that societal norms and cultural contexts influence how sex is categorized and understood. However, others maintain that sex is primarily a biological matter, distinct from gender, which is more widely recognized as a social construct.
