Colonialism continues to impact the world today through various legacies, including environmental degradation, economic instability, and social issues such as racism, racial discrimination, and ethnic rivalries. It has also contributed to the unequal distribution of resources and the lack of governmental institutions and skills in formerly colonized regions. These effects are evident in ongoing challenges like climate change and economic underdevelopment.
