Honesty is not always the best policy because it can sometimes lead to negative consequences, such as emotional distress or harm to relationships. Being too honest can be emotionally taxing and may not be appropriate in situations where it could cause unnecessary hurt or conflict. It is important to consider the context and potential impact before deciding to be completely honest.
