Someone can become immunosuppressed due to a variety of factors, including medical conditions like HIV, cancer, and diabetes, as well as genetic disorders, malnutrition, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, immunosuppression can result from medications, such as chemotherapy, or treatments that intentionally suppress the immune system.
