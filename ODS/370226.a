Bail reform can reduce disparity by eliminating the use of money bail, which disproportionately affects economically disadvantaged individuals and racial minorities. This can be achieved by implementing risk assessment tools to determine pretrial release, focusing on non-monetary conditions for release, and addressing racial and economic biases in the criminal justice system. These reforms aim to ensure a fairer pretrial process and reduce unnecessary pretrial detention.
