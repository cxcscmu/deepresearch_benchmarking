This report synthesizes various perspectives and studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the financial requirements to address global hunger.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a systematic search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources, including international organizations, research studies, and expert opinions. Key search terms included "cost to end world hunger," "world hunger 2030," and "UN hunger estimates." The search was limited to sources published within the last five years to ensure relevance and accuracy.

## Detailed Findings

1. **UN World Food Programme Estimate**: According to David Beasley, Executive Director of the UN World Food Programme, it would take an estimated $40 billion each year to end world hunger by 2030[^1]. This figure is frequently cited in discussions about global hunger eradication.

2. **Oxfam's Perspective**: Oxfam estimates that $23 billion is needed annually to address acute malnutrition and starvation, with an additional $14 billion required to combat chronic hunger[^2]. This suggests a total of $37 billion per year, aligning closely with the UN's estimate.

3. **Alternative Estimates**: A study reported by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) suggests that ending world hunger by 2030 would cost $330 billion[^3]. This figure likely includes broader systemic changes and innovations beyond immediate food aid.

4. **Quora and Other Sources**: Some sources, such as Quora, cite a $30 billion annual requirement based on UN estimates[^4]. This lower figure may reflect a more conservative approach focusing on immediate food distribution rather than long-term solutions.
