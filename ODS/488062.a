Future problems resulting from scarce resources include increased pressure on critical resources due to growing consumerism and urbanization, leading to food and water security challenges. Resource scarcity can also cause critical and potentially irreversible environmental damage, decreased productivity, and economic growth, and exacerbate ecological threats. Additionally, it can lead to destabilizing social effects and conflicts as populations grow and demand for resources rises.
