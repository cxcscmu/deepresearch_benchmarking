# Report on Future Problems Resulting from Resource Scarcity

## Executive Summary

Resource scarcity is an escalating global issue with significant implications for the environment, economy, and social stability. As non-renewable resources become increasingly scarce due to rising demand and unsustainable consumption patterns, the world faces a multitude of challenges. These include environmental degradation, economic disruptions, and heightened social tensions, all of which could reshape global security dynamics.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and resources. The search focused on identifying recent articles, reports, and studies discussing the future implications of resource scarcity. Key search terms included "resource scarcity," "future problems," "economic impact," "environmental degradation," and "social tensions." The search results were filtered to include relevant and credible sources, ensuring a well-rounded analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Environmental Impact**: Resource scarcity is expected to cause significant environmental damage. According to KUKA AG, "Resource scarcity will continue to cause critical and, to a certain extent, irreversible environmental damage" [^1]. This highlights the potential for long-term ecological harm as resources become more limited.

2. **Economic Disruptions**: The scarcity of resources is likely to impact economic productivity and growth. Liu et al. (2023) note that "if resources become increasingly scarce, this can lead to decreased productivity and economic growth" [^2]. This suggests that economies heavily reliant on non-renewable resources may face substantial challenges in maintaining growth.

3. **Social and Security Challenges**: The depletion of resources can exacerbate social tensions and conflict. The Population Matters report indicates that "unsustainable demand is the main driver of the triple planetary crisis: climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution" [^3]. Additionally, resource scarcity is reshaping global security dynamics, as noted by NATO, which states that it is "propelled by climate breakdown and the depletion of vital ecosystems" [^4].

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of up-to-date data and the scope of the sources reviewed. Some sources may not provide comprehensive coverage of all potential future problems related to resource scarcity. Additionally, the lack of specific publication dates for some articles may affect the timeliness of the information. Further research could provide more detailed insights into regional impacts and sector-specific challenges.
