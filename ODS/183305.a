Music influences mood and behavior by affecting brain regions that control emotions, such as the limbic system. Listening to happy, upbeat music can increase the production of chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, leading to feelings of joy and improved mood. Additionally, music can serve as a motivator, help regulate arousal, and enhance social relatedness, impacting behavior and emotional responses.
