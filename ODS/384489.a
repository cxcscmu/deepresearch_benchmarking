Labor unions can potentially hurt the economy by retarding economic growth and delaying recovery from recessions. They may also increase the risk of market disruptions from strikes, lockouts, or firm bankruptcies when negotiations between unions and employers become contentious. Additionally, unions can raise the cost of labor without necessarily improving productivity, which can lower the return on invested capital (ROIC) for companies.
