Christians are encouraged to share their faith for several reasons, including fulfilling the Great Commission, helping others find hope, peace, and purpose, and allowing the power of God to impact and save lives. Sharing faith is also seen as a way to deepen one's gratitude for the cross and to help others experience healing, forgiveness, and the joy of a personal relationship with Christ.
