## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including historical articles, educational websites, and encyclopedias. The search focused on understanding the principles of fascism and its direct impact on the geopolitical landscape leading to World War II. Key search terms included "fascism and World War II," "rise of fascism," and "fascism's impact on WWII."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Fascism's Core Principles and Aggression**: Fascism is described as a "far-right authoritarian political philosophy" that emphasizes extreme nationalism and militarism [^2]. This ideology inherently promotes conflict as a means of achieving national superiority and social improvement [^7].

2. **Expansionist Policies**: The rise of fascism and Nazism led to World War II through "aggressive expansionist policies, territorial conquests, and the invasion of Poland" [^5]. These actions were driven by the fascist belief in the supremacy of the nation and the need for territorial expansion.

3. **Economic and Political Instability**: The rise of the Nazis in Germany was intricately linked to the nation's postwar economic problems, which fascist leaders exploited to gain power [^3]. This exploitation of economic instability allowed fascist regimes to justify their aggressive policies and garner public support.
