Fascism led to World War II through aggressive expansionist policies, intense nationalism, and militarism. Fascist regimes, particularly in Germany and Italy, pursued territorial conquests and invasions, such as the invasion of Poland, which directly contributed to the outbreak of the war. These regimes emphasized warfare and conflict as means of achieving national goals and social improvement, escalating tensions across Europe.
