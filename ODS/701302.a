## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches related to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenia-Azerbaijan relations, and regional geopolitical dynamics.

The search focused on credible sources, including news articles, academic papers, and official statements.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Ethnic Tensions**: The conflict's origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh demanding autonomy or unification with Armenia. This demand intensified during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, leading to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. "The Soviet Azerbaijani authorities worked to suppress Armenian culture and identity in Nagorno-Karabakh, pressured Armenians to leave the region and encouraged..." [^1].

2. **Geopolitical Dynamics**: Russia and Turkey play significant roles in the conflict. Russia has historically maintained a military alliance with Armenia but also sells arms to Azerbaijan, complicating its position as a mediator. "Russia is sometimes described as Armenia's supporter in the conflict, however, this view is widely challenged as Russia extensively sells arms to Azerbaijan" [^1]. Turkey, on the other hand, has been a staunch supporter of Azerbaijan, providing military and diplomatic backing.

3. **Recent Escalations and Ceasefire Violations**: The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020 marked a significant escalation, resulting in a decisive Azerbaijani victory and the recapture of territories. Despite a ceasefire, tensions remain high, with frequent violations. "Following the end of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan has made numerous incursions into Armenian territory and has regularly violated the ceasefire agreement" [^1].
