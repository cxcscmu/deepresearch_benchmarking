Armenia and Azerbaijan are in conflict primarily over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a territory internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. The dispute has historical roots dating back to the early 20th century, with tensions escalating into full-scale wars, the most recent of which occurred in 2020. The conflict is fueled by ethnic, territorial, and political issues, with both countries claiming historical and cultural ties to the region.
