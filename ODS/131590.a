Social media use, especially close to bedtime, can disrupt sleep by reducing sleep quality and increasing the risk of sleep issues. This is often due to exposure to blue light from screens and the addictive nature of social media, which can interfere with rest and lead to sleep deprivation. Additionally, constant notifications and engagement can make it difficult to fall asleep, impacting both physical and mental health.
