# Report: What Makes an Athlete Elite

## Executive Summary
Elite athletes are distinguished by a combination of physical, mental, and technical attributes that set them apart from non-elite athletes. These characteristics include superior physical capabilities such as running economy and VO2 max, a relentless pursuit of improvement, and a strong mental framework that encompasses leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. Understanding these elements provides insight into the factors that contribute to elite performance in sports.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on identifying credible sources that discuss the characteristics and definitions of elite athletes. The search included academic articles, expert opinions, and reputable sports performance websites. Key search terms included "elite athlete characteristics," "elite athlete mentality," and "elite athlete performance."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Physical Attributes**: Elite athletes often possess superior physical characteristics that enhance their performance. According to a study, "Elite endurance athletes consistently test higher than nonelite athletes in running economy, anaerobic threshold, and VO2 max" [^1]. These metrics are critical in determining an athlete's capacity to perform at high levels over extended periods.

2. **Mental Framework**: The mentality of elite athletes is marked by a continuous drive for improvement. As noted in an article, "Elite athletes view their careers as a journey marked by continuous improvement. They're never truly satisfied, always believing they can push a little further" [^2]. This mindset is crucial for maintaining high performance and achieving long-term success.

3. **Technical and Support Skills**: Beyond physical and mental attributes, elite athletes excel in technical skills and benefit from strong support systems. A survey highlighted that "Success at the elite level in sport is often attributed to physical prowess, technical skill, and mental attitude" [^3]. This combination of skills and support is essential for navigating the challenges of elite sports.

## Limitations
The report is limited by the availability of recent data and the potential bias in self-reported surveys and articles. Additionally, the definition of "elite" can vary across different sports and contexts, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Further research could explore these characteristics in specific sports to provide more tailored insights.
