## Methodology

To gather information on the Native American concept of land ownership, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including educational websites, historical articles, and cultural blogs.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Communal Resource**: Native Americans traditionally regarded land as a shared resource owned by the community rather than by individuals. This communal approach emphasized the collective stewardship of land, where "land was primarily seen as a communal resource that was to be shared among the tribe" [^1].

2. **Spiritual and Cultural Significance**: The land was not just a physical space but held spiritual and cultural significance for Native Americans. It was considered sentient and encompassed many life forms and spaces, holding immense energy. The idea of "owning" land was foreign, as "the land is sentient. It encompasses many life forms and spaces. It holds immense energy" [^2].

3. **Contrast with European Views**: The European concept of land as a commodity that could be bought, sold, and owned by individuals was alien to Native Americans. They did not appreciate the notion of land as a commodity, especially not in terms of individual ownership. "Native Americans did not appreciate the notion of land as a commodity, especially not in terms of individual ownership" [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not fully capture the diversity of perspectives among different Native American tribes. Additionally, the historical context and changes over time in the concept of land ownership among Native Americans are complex and may not be fully represented in the available literature. Further research, including primary sources and interviews with Native American scholars, could provide a more comprehensive understanding.
