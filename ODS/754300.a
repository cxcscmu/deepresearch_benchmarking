## Limitations

The primary limitation in assessing Socrates' impact is the lack of direct writings from Socrates himself, which leads to reliance on secondary accounts from his students and contemporaries. This situation, known as the "Socratic problem," complicates efforts to accurately reconstruct his philosophy. Additionally, interpretations of Socrates' ideas have varied significantly over time, influenced by the cultural and intellectual contexts of those studying him.
