Prokaryotic cells are simple, unicellular organisms without a nucleus, while eukaryotic cells are larger, more complex, and contain a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Viruses, which are not cells, can infect both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, often causing disease or cell death. Unlike prokaryotes and eukaryotes, viruses cannot reproduce on their own and must rely on a host cell to replicate.
