Women are paid less than men due to a combination of factors, including occupational segregation, the devaluation of women's work, societal norms, and discrimination. Additionally, women often take more time away from work for pregnancy and childcare, and they are more likely to work part-time or in lower-paying sectors, which impacts their overall earnings.
