# Report on the Evolution of Racism

## Executive Summary

Racism has evolved significantly over the decades, adapting to societal changes and manifesting in new forms. While overt racism has decreased, more subtle and systemic forms have emerged, challenging efforts to achieve racial equality. This report explores the transformation of racism, highlighting the persistence of racial discrimination in contemporary society and the ongoing struggle for civil rights.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a targeted search was conducted using online databases and credible sources. The search focused on recent analyses and historical perspectives on racism's evolution. Key sources included academic publications, government reports, and reputable news articles. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "modern racism," "racial discrimination," and "evolution of racism."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Mutation of Racism**: Racism has been compared to a virus that mutates, adapting to new environments and societal changes. This metaphor highlights how racism has shifted from overt expressions to more covert and systemic forms. "Racism has been likened to a virus that mutates, taking on different forms as it adapts to a changing environment" [^1].

2. **Systemic and Structural Racism**: The distinction between systemic and structural racism is crucial in understanding modern racial dynamics. Systemic racism involves institutional policies and practices that perpetuate racial inequalities, while structural racism refers to the broader societal patterns that reinforce these disparities. "Although systemic racism and structural racism are often used interchangeably, they have somewhat different emphases" [^2].

3. **Progress and Challenges**: Despite significant progress since the 1960s in reducing overt racism, challenges remain in addressing racial gaps and discrimination. The persistence of racial disparities in various sectors, including criminal justice and healthcare, underscores the need for continued efforts to combat racism. "While challenges remain, Americans have made considerable progress since the 1960s in reducing many measures of overt racism and racial gaps" [^3].
