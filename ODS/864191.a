Hinduism is believed to have originated in the Indus Valley, near modern-day Pakistan, between 2300 B.C. and 1500 B.C. It developed over many centuries from a variety of sources, including cultural practices, sacred texts, and philosophical movements. The Indus Valley Civilization is often considered the earliest source of these traditions.
