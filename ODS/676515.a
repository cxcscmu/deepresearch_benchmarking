The Cold War significantly influenced American foreign and domestic policy. Foreign policy was primarily shaped by the strategy of containment, aimed at preventing the spread of communism and limiting Soviet influence globally. Domestically, the Cold War led to heightened fears of subversion, exemplified by events like McCarthyism, which fueled suspicion and fear of communist infiltration within the United States.
