Women are often stereotyped as being nurturing, polite, accommodating, and non-confrontational. They are also expected to be thin and graceful, and are sometimes labeled as "bossy" or "unfeminine" if they are assertive. Additionally, women are often seen as caregivers and are stereotyped as being less competent than men in terms of intelligence and skill.
