The American Revolution had a significant impact on slavery. It inspired African-American resistance, with thousands of slaves obtaining their freedom by running away. The war disrupted the institution of slavery, particularly in the South, where the slave system suffered due to a decline in production and the loss of slaves to the British. Additionally, some states promised freedom to enslaved individuals who fought in the war, as seen in Rhode Island's 1778 regiment of African Americans.
