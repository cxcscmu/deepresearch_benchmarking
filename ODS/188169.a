Research helps make nursing practice safe by providing a scientific foundation for evidence-based practice (EBP), which guides nurses in delivering the highest quality care. It informs every aspect of nursing, from ensuring patient safety to incorporating technology into bedside care, and helps identify potential risk factors, errors in medication administration, and preventive measures. By implementing what is learned from research, care can be made safer and more effective.
