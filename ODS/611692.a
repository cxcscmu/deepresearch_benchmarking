Emotional, cognitive, and practical intelligence significantly influence authentic leadership. Emotional intelligence fosters empathy and self-awareness, allowing leaders to effectively manage relationships and understand emotions in themselves and others. Cognitive intelligence provides the foundation for sound decision-making, while practical intelligence helps leaders apply their knowledge effectively in real-world situations. Together, these forms of intelligence enable leaders to be more authentic and effective in their roles.
