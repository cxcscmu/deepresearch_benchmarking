Climate change affects hurricanes by increasing their intensity and destructiveness. Warmer ocean waters and higher air temperatures allow hurricanes to hold more water vapor, leading to stronger winds, heavier rainfall, and more severe flooding. Additionally, climate change can slow down the speed at which hurricanes travel, prolonging their impact.
