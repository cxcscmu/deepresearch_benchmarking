Birth rates are falling due to a combination of factors, including economic and social changes. As people become wealthier and more educated, they tend to have fewer children. Additionally, women are delaying childbirth until later in life, and there is increased access to modern contraceptives and female education. Economic instability and uncertainty also contribute to declining birth rates, particularly in wealthier nations.
