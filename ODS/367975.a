Animal testing is considered ineffective because a significant percentage of drugs that pass animal tests fail in human clinical trials. Specifically, 92% of potential drugs fail in human trials because they prove unsafe or ineffective in humans, despite having passed animal testing. This suggests that animal experiments do not reliably predict human outcomes.
