The ethics of doctors striking is a complex issue. It is generally considered ethical for doctors to strike if the conditions they work under put patients at risk, as they may be morally obliged to strike to improve these conditions. However, there is a consensus that doctors should maintain their ethical obligation to provide at least emergency services during a strike. Strikes are often aimed at disrupting elective care, which can be deferred, to minimize harm to patients.
