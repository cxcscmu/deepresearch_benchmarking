An administrator can respond to reluctance to comply with legal and ethical standards by addressing the issue directly, such as having a conversation with the individual involved. In cases of extreme ethics violations, more severe actions like termination may be necessary to demonstrate that non-compliance will not be tolerated. Additionally, creating an ethical culture within the organization and providing resources and education can help foster compliance.
