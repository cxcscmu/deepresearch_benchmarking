Veterans are deported primarily due to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which makes non-citizen veterans vulnerable to deportation if they violate certain laws. Common offenses leading to deportation include drunk driving, drug possession, having an unregistered firearm, or domestic violence. Despite their service, these veterans face deportation if they do not have U.S. citizenship and commit such offenses.
