# Report on the Prohibition of Steroids in Sports

## Executive Summary

The use of steroids in sports is a contentious issue, with strong arguments against their acceptance. Steroids, specifically anabolic-androgenic steroids, are used by athletes to enhance performance by increasing muscle mass and strength. However, their use is widely considered unethical and is banned in most sports due to the unfair advantage they provide and the significant health risks they pose to athletes. This report explores the reasons why steroids should not be allowed in sports, focusing on ethical considerations, health risks, and the integrity of sports.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search focused on reputable sources such as medical institutions, sports organizations, and academic publications. The search terms included "steroids in sports," "performance-enhancing drugs," and "risks of steroid use." The findings were synthesized from articles and reports from authoritative sources such as the Mayo Clinic, OrthoInfo, and Marquette Law School.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Ethical Considerations and Fairness**: Steroids provide an unfair advantage to users, undermining the principle of fair competition in sports. According to OrthoInfo, "Using steroids to improve athletic performance is considered cheating, and can lead to athletes being penalized or banned from participating in sports" [^1]. This sentiment is echoed by Marquette Law School, which states, "doping in sport is a problem" that compromises the integrity of athletic competition [^2].

2. **Health Risks**: The use of steroids poses significant health risks to athletes. The Mayo Clinic highlights that anabolic steroids can lead to severe health issues, including liver damage, cardiovascular problems, and psychological effects such as aggression and depression [^3]. Furthermore, a report from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) notes that these drugs are used to improve appearance by building muscle, but they come with dangerous side effects [^4].

3. **Integrity of Sports**: Allowing steroids in sports would fundamentally alter the nature of athletic competition. The NPR article discusses the ongoing debate about steroid use, emphasizing that accepting these drugs would change the essence of sports, where natural talent and hard work should be the primary determinants of success [^5].
