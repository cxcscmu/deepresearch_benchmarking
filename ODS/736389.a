# Report on the Legal and Political Effects of the Dred Scott Decision

## Executive Summary

The Dred Scott decision, delivered by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857, had profound legal and political ramifications. It declared that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, could not be American citizens and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court. This decision invalidated the Missouri Compromise, which had attempted to balance the power between slave and free states, and further polarized the nation, contributing to the tensions that led to the American Civil War.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Legal Implications**: The Dred Scott decision had significant legal consequences. It declared that enslaved individuals were not citizens and thus had no rights to sue in federal courts. This ruling effectively meant that "enslaved persons had no rights in federal court" [^1]. Furthermore, it stated that "slave states no longer had to honor the 'once free, always free' rule," which had previously allowed enslaved individuals to claim freedom if they had lived in a free state [^2].

2. **Political Ramifications**: Politically, the decision intensified the national debate over slavery. It "outraged abolitionists, who saw the Supreme Court's ruling as a way to stop debate about slavery in the territories" [^3]. By striking down the Missouri Compromise as unconstitutional, the decision removed restrictions on the expansion of slavery into new territories, exacerbating sectional tensions between the North and South.

3. **Impact on Citizenship and Rights**: The ruling underscored the lack of legal recognition for African Americans, stating that "no black could claim U.S. citizenship or petition a court for redress" [^4]. This denial of citizenship rights highlighted the systemic racial discrimination embedded in U.S. law at the time.
