The Dred Scott decision had several significant legal and political effects. Legally, it declared that enslaved people were not citizens of the United States and therefore could not expect any protection from the federal government. It also struck down the Missouri Compromise as unconstitutional, asserting that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the territories. Politically, the decision outraged abolitionists and intensified the national debate over slavery, contributing to the tensions that eventually led to the American Civil War.
