# Report: How Reward Systems Serve as Barriers to Integration

## Executive Summary
Reward systems are designed to motivate and incentivize employees by recognizing their achievements and contributions. However, these systems can inadvertently create barriers to integration within organizations. This report explores how reward systems can foster individualism, create divisions among team members, and limit creativity, ultimately hindering organizational cohesion and integration.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online educational platforms and resources. The search focused on identifying relevant articles and discussions that specifically address the role of reward systems as barriers to integration. Key sources included academic help websites like Chegg and Brainly, which provide insights into common academic questions and solutions.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Fostering Individualism**: Reward systems often emphasize individual achievements over collective success, which can lead to a culture of individualism. This focus on personal gain can undermine team cohesion and collaboration. As noted on Brainly, "Reward systems can act as barriers to integration by fostering individualism, creating divisions among team members, limiting creativity" [^1].

2. **Creating Divisions**: By rewarding individual performance, these systems can inadvertently create divisions among team members. This can result in competition rather than collaboration, as employees may prioritize personal success over team goals. The Chegg platform highlights that reward systems "serve as barriers to integration" by promoting such divisions [^2].

3. **Limiting Creativity**: When reward systems are heavily focused on specific outcomes, they can stifle creativity and innovation. Employees may be less inclined to take risks or think outside the box if they believe that only certain achievements will be rewarded. This limitation is discussed in various educational resources, emphasizing the need for a more balanced approach to rewards [^3].
