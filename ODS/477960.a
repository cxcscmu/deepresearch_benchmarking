Racism stems from various factors, including historical efforts to justify slavery by creating the modern concept of "race," greed and self-interest, scientific racism, discriminatory policies, and social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. Additionally, it is influenced by the dominant group's desire to protect their group position and is often perpetuated through media representation and societal norms.
