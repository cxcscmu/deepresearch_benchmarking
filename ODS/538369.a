## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources that provide historical and contemporary perspectives on feminism. Key search terms included "feminism history," "waves of feminism," and "modern feminism." The selected articles were analyzed to extract relevant information and direct quotes.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Waves of Feminism**: Feminism is traditionally divided into waves, each characterized by distinct goals and achievements. The first wave focused on legal issues such as property rights and suffrage. The second wave expanded to include workplace rights and reproductive freedoms. The third wave emphasized diversity and intersectionality, while the fourth wave, driven by digital activism, addresses global issues and inclusivity[^1][^2].

2. **Modern Feminism and Inclusivity**: Recent decades have seen a shift towards inclusivity, with the movement actively incorporating voices previously marginalized. "In recent decades, the movement has begun to proactively include and uplift the voices of people who have typically been left out of past movements"[^1]. This shift reflects a broader understanding of equality that transcends gender to include race, class, and sexual orientation.

3. **Impact of Social Media**: The rise of social media has revolutionized feminist activism, providing a platform for global engagement and rapid dissemination of ideas. "Social media has become a powerful tool for activism and social justice, and Gen Z feminists have been at the forefront of using it to effect change"[^3]. This digital revolution has democratized the movement, allowing for diverse participation and real-time advocacy.
