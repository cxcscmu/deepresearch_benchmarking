Feminism has evolved significantly over time, traditionally categorized into waves. The first wave focused on legal issues such as property rights and women's suffrage. The second wave expanded to address broader issues like workplace discrimination and reproductive rights. In recent decades, feminism has become more inclusive, actively incorporating diverse voices and addressing intersectional issues. Social media has also played a crucial role in modern feminism, enabling activism and amplifying the voices of younger generations, particularly Gen Z feminists.
