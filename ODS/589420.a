Stigma affects mental health by contributing to worsening symptoms, delaying or preventing individuals from seeking treatment, and leading to feelings of shame, hopelessness, and isolation. It can also result in discrimination, which may manifest as negative remarks or withholding of help, further exacerbating the challenges faced by those with mental health issues.
