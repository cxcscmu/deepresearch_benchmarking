Long-term climate change is caused by both natural and human-driven factors. Natural causes include changes in the Earth's orbit and rotation, variations in solar activity, volcanic emissions, and changes in the Earth's reflectivity. Human-driven causes primarily involve the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices, which increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
