# Report on Causes of Long-term Climate Change

## Executive Summary

Long-term climate change is driven by a combination of natural processes and human activities. Natural factors include variations in solar energy, volcanic emissions, and changes in Earth's orbit. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly increased greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to global warming. Understanding these causes is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate climate change impacts.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a targeted search strategy focusing on authoritative sources related to climate change. The search included government agencies, international organizations, and scientific institutions. Tools used included web search engines and databases to access the most recent and relevant information on the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Natural Causes**: Several natural processes contribute to long-term climate change. These include "changes in the Earth's orbit and rotation, variations in solar activity, and volcanic emissions" [^1]. Such factors have historically influenced Earth's climate over millennia.

2. **Human Activities**: The predominant cause of recent climate change is human activity. According to NASA, "Human activity is the cause of increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide" [^2]. This increase in greenhouse gases is a major driver of global warming.

3. **Fossil Fuels**: The United Nations highlights that "Fossil fuels – coal, oil, and gas – are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions" [^3]. This underscores the significant impact of energy production and consumption on climate change.

## Limitations

This report is based on available data up to October 2023 and may not include the latest research findings. Additionally, the complexity of climate systems means that new discoveries could further refine our understanding of long-term climate change causes. The report relies on secondary sources, which may have their own biases or limitations in scope.
