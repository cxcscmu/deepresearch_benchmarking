The question of whether parents are to blame for juvenile delinquency is complex and debated. Some sources suggest that parental influence, such as lack of discipline or positive guidance, can contribute to juvenile delinquency. However, other perspectives argue that parents should not be solely held accountable for their children's actions, as various factors, including peer influence and individual choices, also play significant roles. Overall, while parental behavior can impact juvenile behavior, it is not the sole determinant of delinquency.
