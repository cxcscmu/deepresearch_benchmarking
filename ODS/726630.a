After Mao Zedong's death in 1976, China underwent significant changes. The country moved away from Mao's policies, with agriculture being decollectivized and the economy being refashioned to be more free trade-friendly. Deng Xiaoping emerged as a key leader, shifting China towards a market-oriented economy and introducing reforms that allowed for foreign investment. This period marked a major upheaval in policies and leadership, leading to China's modernization and economic growth.
