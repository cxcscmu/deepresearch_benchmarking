Illegal immigration is a controversial issue because it involves a range of complex factors, including concerns about national security, economic impact, and the rule of law. Critics argue that illegal immigration undermines the rule of law, drains public funds, and creates unfair competition for jobs, while others highlight issues related to crime, terrorism, and resource planning. Additionally, the terminology used, such as "illegal" versus "undocumented," adds to the controversy by influencing public perception and policy discussions.
