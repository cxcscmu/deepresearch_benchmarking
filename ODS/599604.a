People are against critical race theory (CRT) because some critics believe it advocates for discrimination against white people to achieve equity and admonishes all white people as oppressors while classifying Black people as oppressed victims. Additionally, opponents fear that CRT disrupts power imbalances and systems, which can be perceived as divisive when used for political ends.
