Childhood and adulthood differ significantly in terms of responsibilities and experiences. Adulthood is characterized by increased responsibility, independence, and the need to make decisions for oneself, while childhood is a period of learning, development, and forming relationships with less stress and more fun. Both stages share some attributes, such as the development of independence and responsibility, but childhood is often seen as a time of innocence and exploration, whereas adulthood involves navigating societal roles and expectations.
