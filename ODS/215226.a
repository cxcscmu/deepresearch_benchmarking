Mental health can affect crime in several ways. People with mental illness are more likely to be victims of crime rather than perpetrators. However, certain mental health disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, can increase the risk of violent behavior. Additionally, losing access to mental health services can lead to increased criminal involvement. Mental health issues can impair judgment and impulse control, potentially influencing criminal behavior.
