Gas prices are primarily influenced by the cost of global crude oil, which accounts for about 50% of the price. Other factors include refining costs (25%), distribution and marketing costs (11%), and federal and state taxes. Additional influences include inflation, supply-chain disruptions, international instability, and seasonal changes such as the switch to summer blend gasoline.
