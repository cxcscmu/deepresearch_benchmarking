The shift from a war to preserve the Union to a war to end slavery was primarily driven by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln. This proclamation, announced on January 1, 1863, made the abolition of slavery a central goal of the Union's military efforts, thereby transforming the nature of the Civil War.
