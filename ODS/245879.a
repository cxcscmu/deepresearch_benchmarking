# Deforestation and Its Impact on Climate Change

## Executive Summary

Deforestation significantly contributes to climate change by releasing stored carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, disrupting ecosystems, and reducing the planet's capacity to absorb greenhouse gases. This report explores the mechanisms through which deforestation exacerbates climate change and highlights the scale of its impact.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and reputable environmental organizations' websites. The search focused on recent articles and reports discussing the relationship between deforestation and climate change. Key sources included The Nature Conservancy, the London School of Economics (LSE), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

## Detailed Findings

1. **Carbon Release**: Trees play a crucial role in absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. When they are cut down, the carbon stored in their biomass is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to The Nature Conservancy, "When trees are cut down, tons of carbon dioxide is released into our atmosphere" [^1]. Similarly, the LSE notes that "much of the carbon stored by trees is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide" when deforestation occurs [^2].

2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Deforestation not only releases CO2 but also other greenhouse gases, exacerbating global warming. The WWF highlights that "if forests are cleared, or even disturbed, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases" [^3]. This release contributes significantly to the atmospheric concentration of these gases, which are primary drivers of climate change.

3. **Scale of Impact**: The scale of emissions from deforestation is substantial. UNEP reports that "the felling of trees in tropical areas alone releases more than 5.6 billion tonnes of planet-warming greenhouse gases every year" [^4]. This underscores the critical need for global efforts to halt deforestation as a means to mitigate climate change.

## Limitations

This report is based on available online resources and may not encompass all recent studies or data on deforestation and climate change. The information is subject to the limitations of the sources used, which may not cover all geographical regions or the latest scientific findings. Additionally, the dynamic nature of environmental research means that new insights could emerge that are not captured in this report.
