Organic agriculture is often criticized for several reasons. It can lead to lower yields compared to conventional farming due to the absence of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, making it more vulnerable to pests and diseases. This can result in increased land use to meet demand, which may contribute to deforestation and habitat loss. Additionally, organic farming can produce more climate pollution and may cause erosion problems due to the need for regular cultivation. Expanding organic cropland can also inadvertently increase pesticide use in surrounding non-organic fields.
