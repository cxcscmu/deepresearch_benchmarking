Independent filmmakers often make money when they're not making films by working in related fields such as directing, editing, shooting, or acting in commercials and corporate videos. They may also take on various roles on film sets, such as working as corporate or commercial directors. Additionally, some filmmakers may rely on multiple revenue streams and maintain control over production aspects to sustain their income.
