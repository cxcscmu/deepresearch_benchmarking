Some groups tend to be underrepresented in Congress due to a combination of factors, including voting laws that make it difficult for certain groups to vote, such as strict voter ID laws or limited early voting. Additionally, institutional and societal challenges, as well as obstacles rooted in racial inequality, have historically limited access to Congress for women and minorities.
