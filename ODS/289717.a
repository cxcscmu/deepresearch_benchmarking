Global pollution can be considered an economic failure due to its nature as a negative externality. Economic production often leads to environmental damage, which is not accounted for in the market prices, resulting in a misallocation of resources. This is a classic example of market failure, where the full social costs of pollution are not reflected in the market transactions.
