A business can use trade theories to develop its strategies by leveraging Porter's four determinants of competitive advantage: factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and firm strategy, structure, and rivalry. By analyzing these determinants, a business can identify advantageous conditions in different countries, such as skilled labor or technological infrastructure, and tailor its strategies to capitalize on these strengths. This approach helps businesses optimize their operations and enhance their competitive position in the global market.
