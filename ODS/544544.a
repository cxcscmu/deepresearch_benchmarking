The death penalty is often supported for several reasons: it is seen as a means of providing justice and closure to families and victims, it is believed to prevent additional crime by deterring would-be offenders, and it is considered an essential tool for punishing those who commit the most heinous crimes. Additionally, some argue that the death penalty is constitutionally supported by the 5th and 14th Amendments, which allow for deprivation of life with due process.
