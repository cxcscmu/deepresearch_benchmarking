# Report on the Consequences of Children Not Liking to Share

## Executive Summary

The concept of sharing is a fundamental social skill that children are often encouraged to develop. However, the consequences of children not liking to share can vary significantly. While some experts argue that forcing children to share can lead to negative outcomes, others emphasize the importance of teaching sharing as a means of fostering social development. This report explores the potential consequences of children not liking to share, drawing on various perspectives and research findings.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and parenting resources. The search focused on articles, expert opinions, and research studies related to children's sharing behaviors and the implications of not sharing. Key search terms included "children not sharing consequences," "forced sharing," and "social skills development in children." The search was limited to sources available up to October 2023.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact on Self-Esteem and Emotional Well-being**: Forcing children to share can negatively impact their self-esteem and emotional well-being. According to a source, "Forcing toddlers to share not only models taking, but it also affects their self-esteem" [^1]. This suggests that children may feel undervalued or pressured, which can lead to resentment and insecurity.

2. **Development of Generosity**: Some experts argue that not forcing children to share can actually promote genuine generosity. Shumaker notes, "when adults insist on sharing before children are ready, the consequence is that true generosity develops slower" [^2]. This perspective highlights the importance of allowing children to develop sharing behaviors naturally, without coercion.

3. **Social Skills and Fairness**: Sharing is often associated with learning about compromise and fairness. The Raising Children Network states, "Sharing teaches children about compromise and fairness. They learn that if we give a little to others, we can get some of what we want too" [^3]. This indicates that not sharing may hinder the development of these crucial social skills.
