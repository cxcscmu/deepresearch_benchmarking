Improving access to mental health care can be achieved through several strategies: integrating mental health services into general health care settings, promoting systematic mental health education, and investing in community mental health training programs. Additionally, addressing the cost of care through Medicaid expansion, enforcing parity, and creating a diverse workforce are important steps. Reducing stigma, providing peer support services, and ensuring same-day access with warm-handoffs can also enhance accessibility.
