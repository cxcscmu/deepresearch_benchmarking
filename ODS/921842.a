COVID-19 vaccines are generally considered safe and effective. According to the CDC and other reputable sources, while vaccines can have side effects, they are typically mild, such as pain and swelling at the injection site. Serious side effects are rare. Comprehensive reviews indicate that the vaccines do not cause conditions like infertility or Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, although there is some evidence of a rare risk of myocarditis with mRNA vaccines. Overall, getting vaccinated is a safer way to build immunity compared to contracting COVID-19.
