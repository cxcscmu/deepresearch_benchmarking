Yes, there are several arguments in favor of teaching sign language, specifically American Sign Language (ASL), in schools. It is suggested that teaching ASL can benefit both the Deaf community and hearing students by promoting cultural awareness, sensitivity, and inclusivity. Learning ASL can also enhance students' creativity, problem-solving skills, and empathy towards people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
