# Report: Should Sign Language Be Taught in Schools?

## Executive Summary

The debate over whether American Sign Language (ASL) should be taught in schools is gaining traction. Proponents argue that teaching ASL can foster inclusivity, cultural awareness, and empathy among students. It also benefits both the Deaf and hearing communities by promoting better communication and understanding. This report explores the various perspectives and arguments for integrating ASL into school curricula.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on articles, opinion pieces, and academic discussions related to the teaching of ASL in schools. The search aimed to capture a range of viewpoints and evidence supporting the inclusion of ASL in educational settings.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Awareness and Inclusivity**: Teaching ASL in schools is seen as a way to promote cultural awareness and inclusivity. According to an article on EdSource, "For the benefit of the Deaf community as well as the hearing, schools should teach ASL to all students" [^1]. This perspective emphasizes the role of ASL in bridging communication gaps and fostering a more inclusive environment for all students.

2. **Empathy and Support**: The Daily Titan highlights the importance of empathy, stating, "ASL should be offered in high schools to teach students to empathize with people who are deaf or hard of hearing and to better support students who are deaf" [^2]. This suggests that learning ASL can enhance students' emotional intelligence and social skills.

3. **Cognitive and Developmental Benefits**: Learning ASL can also have cognitive benefits. Fraser notes that "Learning ASL and English can help a child be more creative, a better problem-solver, a good listener and possibly, a better student" [^3]. This indicates that ASL education can contribute to overall academic and personal development.

## Limitations

This report is based on a limited number of sources and may not capture the full spectrum of opinions and research on the topic. Additionally, the search was restricted to English-language sources, which may exclude relevant perspectives from non-English speaking regions. Further research could include a broader range of academic studies and input from Deaf community members to provide a more comprehensive view.
