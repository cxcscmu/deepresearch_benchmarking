Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) can encourage nursing-based outcome studies by engaging in evidence-based practice (EBP), which involves translating research findings into clinical practice. They can lead transdisciplinary teams to use evidence to inform clinical decisions, conduct structured literature reviews, and undertake qualitative studies or pilot projects. Additionally, APRNs can facilitate a supportive environment for EBP by providing educational sessions to nurses, encouraging them to question the status quo, and examining evidence to adopt more effective methods.
