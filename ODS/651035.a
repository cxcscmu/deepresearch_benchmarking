# Criminal Minds: Reasons Behind the Conclusion of the Original Series

## Executive Summary
"Criminal Minds," a popular American police procedural crime drama, concluded its original run after 15 seasons on February 19, 2020. The decision to end the series was influenced by a combination of factors, including network decisions, declining ratings, and strategic programming shifts. Despite its conclusion, the series was later revived as "Criminal Minds: Evolution" on Paramount+.

## Methodology
To gather information on why "Criminal Minds" ended, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on Google and database queries on entertainment-focused websites. The primary tools used were Google Search and direct access to reputable entertainment news sites such as Screen Rant, Looper, and Wikipedia.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Network and Programming Decisions**: CBS decided to conclude "Criminal Minds" after its fifteenth season to make room for new programming. According to Looper, "The final season of Criminal Minds aired for only 10 weeks, and then got out of the way to allow a new show the chance to develop a following" [^2].

2. **Declining Ratings**: The show experienced a decline in viewership, which contributed to its cancellation. CBR reported that "After the show barely earned a Season 14 renewal, CBS announced that Season 15 would be Criminal Minds' last" [^5].

3. **Strategic Shift to Streaming**: The series was later revived on a streaming platform, indicating a strategic shift in how the content was delivered. As noted on Wikipedia, "The series originally culminated after its fifteenth season on February 19, 2020, but was revived and re-titled Criminal Minds: Evolution for its sixteenth season, which premiered on Paramount+ in November 2022" [^4].
