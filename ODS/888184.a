Social cognitive theory helps us understand criminal behavior by suggesting that social behavior is learned through observation and interaction. It posits that individuals learn criminal behavior by observing others, particularly in environments where such behavior is modeled and reinforced. This theory emphasizes the role of social influences and cognitive processes in shaping behavior, indicating that crime can result from learned behaviors rather than inherent traits.
