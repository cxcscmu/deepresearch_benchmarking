# The Representation of the American Dream in "The Great Gatsby"

## Executive Summary

F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" is a profound exploration of the American Dream, encapsulated through the character of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby's life story reflects both the allure and the corruption of the American Dream. While he embodies the self-made man who rises from humble beginnings to immense wealth, his pursuit is ultimately tainted by illegal activities and an unattainable ideal. This report delves into how Gatsby represents the American Dream, highlighting the duality of aspiration and disillusionment.

## Methodology

To gather insights on how Gatsby represents the American Dream, a comprehensive search was conducted using various educational and literary analysis platforms. The search focused on reputable sources that provide thematic analysis and critical perspectives on "The Great Gatsby." Tools such as Google Scholar, educational websites like SparkNotes, and literary analysis platforms like LitCharts were utilized to ensure a well-rounded understanding.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Gatsby as a Symbol of the Corrupted Dream**: Gatsby's wealth and success are achieved through dubious means, reflecting the corruption of the American Dream. "Gatsby symbolizes both the corrupted Dream and the original uncorrupted Dream. He sees wealth as the solution to his problems, pursues money via shady schemes" [^1]. This duality highlights the moral decay underlying the pursuit of wealth.

2. **The Original American Dream**: Initially, the American Dream was about discovery and individualism. "As Fitzgerald saw it (and as Nick explains in Chapter 9), the American dream was originally about discovery, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness" [^2]. Gatsby's journey from James Gatz to Jay Gatsby mirrors this original dream, yet his methods and motivations reveal its distortion.

3. **Gatsby's Idealism and the Green Light**: Gatsby's longing for Daisy, symbolized by the green light, represents his pursuit of an idealized version of the American Dream. "Gatsby is stretching his arms toward the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. For Gatsby, this light represents Daisy, his lost love" [^3]. This symbolizes the elusive nature of the dream and the personal sacrifices made in its pursuit.
