We should save endangered animals because preserving them safeguards the intricate balance of ecosystems, ensuring a healthier and more secure future for our planet. Endangered species play crucial roles in maintaining biodiversity, which is essential for ecosystem stability and resilience. Additionally, they provide vital resources such as food, medicine, and raw materials, and their protection can drive important ecological processes like soil formation and water filtration.
