States are legalizing marijuana for several reasons, including the potential economic benefits such as increased tax revenues, job growth, and investment opportunities. Legalization also allows for the regulation and taxation of cannabis products, removing them from the illegal market. Additionally, advocates suggest that legalization can reduce crime, lower criminal justice expenditures, and improve public health.
