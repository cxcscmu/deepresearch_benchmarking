# Democracy: An Overview

## Executive Summary

Democracy is a system of governance where power is vested in the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It is characterized by principles such as popular sovereignty, political equality, and the protection of individual rights. The most prevalent form of democracy today is representative democracy, where citizens elect officials to make decisions on their behalf. This report explores the workings of democracy, its various forms, and the principles that underpin it.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Principles of Democracy**: Democracy is fundamentally about the rule of the people. It involves the participation of citizens in decision-making processes, either directly or through elected representatives. "Democracy is a system of government in which power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or through freely elected representatives" [^1].

2. **Forms of Democracy**: There are two primary forms of democracy: direct and representative. In a direct democracy, citizens have the direct authority to deliberate and decide on legislation. In contrast, a representative democracy involves electing officials to make decisions on behalf of the people. "In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so" [^2].

3. **Characteristics and Values**: Democracy is characterized by free and fair elections, the protection of human rights, and the rule of law. It is a system that emphasizes equality and freedom, allowing citizens to have a say in governance. "Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised" [^3].
