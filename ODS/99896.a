# Report on "Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other"

## Executive Summary

The phrase "we expect more from technology and less from each other" encapsulates a growing societal trend where individuals increasingly rely on technology for connection and fulfillment, often at the expense of direct human interaction. This concept is extensively explored by Sherry Turkle in her book "Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other." Turkle argues that as technology becomes more integrated into our lives, it paradoxically diminishes our capacity for genuine human connection, leading to a decline in emotional fulfillment.

## Methodology

To explore this topic, I conducted a comprehensive search using various online databases and resources. The primary focus was on identifying authoritative sources that discuss Sherry Turkle's work and the broader implications of technology on human relationships. Tools used included Google Scholar, academic databases, and reputable news outlets. The search terms included "Sherry Turkle Alone Together," "expect more from technology," and "technology and human interaction."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Illusion of Companionship**: Turkle suggests that technology creates an "illusion of companionship" without the demands of friendship. She notes, "Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication" [^1].

2. **Emotional Disconnection**: The reliance on technology for emotional support can lead to a decrease in genuine human interaction. Turkle argues, "Our passion to connect with each other through devices and networks is keeping us from interacting with each other face to face" [^2]. This shift results in a society where people are more comfortable with digital interactions than personal ones.

3. **Unfulfilled Promises**: Turkle believes that "sociable technology will always disappoint because it promises what it cannot deliver" [^3]. This highlights the inherent limitations of technology in fulfilling deep-seated human needs for connection and understanding.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources and interpretations of Sherry Turkle's work. While the sources provide a comprehensive overview, direct access to the full text of "Alone Together" would offer a more nuanced understanding of her arguments. Additionally, the report is based on data available up to October 2023, and newer developments in technology and societal trends may not be reflected.
