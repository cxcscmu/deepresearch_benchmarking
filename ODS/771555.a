The Homestead Act of 1862 significantly impacted Native Americans by facilitating the transfer of their ancestral lands to new settlers. This led to a decrease in buffalo numbers, an increase in domesticated animals, and the construction of fences and other infrastructure that disrupted traditional Native American ways of life. Additionally, the act contributed to the massive communal land losses for numerous Native nations, as it promoted large-scale westward expansion and settlement on Native lands.
