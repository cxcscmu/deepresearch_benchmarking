Climate change affects birds by altering their habitats, food availability, and migration patterns. Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns impact birds' ability to find food and reproduce, leading to potential mismatches in food supplies and affecting successful migration and reproduction. Additionally, two-thirds of North American bird species are at increasing risk of extinction due to global temperature rise.
