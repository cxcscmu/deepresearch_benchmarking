# Report on the Prevalence of Late-Term Abortions in the U.S.

## Executive Summary
Late-term abortions, defined as those occurring at or after 21 weeks of gestation, are relatively rare in the United States. They account for a small percentage of the total number of abortions performed annually. Despite their rarity, late-term abortions remain a significant topic in political and public discourse. This report synthesizes current data and insights on the prevalence and context of late-term abortions in the U.S.

## Methodology
To gather information on the prevalence of late-term abortions in the U.S., a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and reputable sources. The search focused on recent publications and data from authoritative organizations and research centers. Key sources included reports from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Pew Research Center, and other scholarly articles.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Prevalence of Late-Term Abortions**: According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, "abortions at or after 21 weeks are uncommon and represent 1% of all abortions in the U.S."[^1]. This statistic highlights the rarity of such procedures compared to earlier-stage abortions.

2. **Statistical Data**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that "about 94 percent of abortions happen before the end of the first trimester, at or before 13 weeks"[^2]. This further underscores the infrequency of late-term abortions, which occur significantly less often than those in the earlier stages of pregnancy.

3. **Annual Estimates**: It is estimated that "about 1% of all abortions in the United States are performed after 20 weeks, or approximately 10,000 to 15,000 annually"[^3]. This estimate provides a numerical context to the percentage-based data, illustrating the absolute number of late-term abortions performed each year.

## Limitations
The data on late-term abortions is subject to limitations due to variations in reporting standards and definitions of what constitutes a late-term abortion. Additionally, political and social factors may influence the availability and reporting of such data. The estimates provided are based on available data, which may not capture all instances of late-term abortions due to underreporting or lack of comprehensive data collection in certain regions.
