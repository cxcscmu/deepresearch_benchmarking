# Report on the End of Apartheid

## Executive Summary

Apartheid, the institutionalized racial segregation system in South Africa, ended due to a combination of internal resistance, international pressure, and significant political changes within the country. The dismantling of apartheid was a complex process influenced by various factors, including economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and the strategic negotiations between the ruling National Party and anti-apartheid movements like the African National Congress (ANC). The transition culminated in the 1994 general elections, marking the first time South Africans of all races could vote.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of historical articles, government archives, and educational resources. The search strategy involved querying databases and websites with keywords such as "end of apartheid," "South Africa apartheid," and "apartheid negotiations." Tools like Google Scholar and online encyclopedias were used to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **International Pressure and Sanctions**: The international community played a crucial role in ending apartheid through economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. The United Nations imposed an arms embargo and encouraged boycotts against South Africa. "The United Nations General Assembly encouraged the boycotting of oil sales to South Africa and requested all nations to suspend cultural, educational, sporting, and other exchanges with the racist regime" [^1].

2. **Internal Resistance and Negotiations**: Within South Africa, resistance movements grew increasingly militant, leading to negotiations between the government and the ANC. "Between 1987 and 1993, the National Party entered into bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading anti-apartheid political movement, for ending segregation and introducing majority rule" [^2].

3. **Political Changes and Leadership**: The leadership of F.W. de Klerk was pivotal in the transition. He initiated the repeal of apartheid laws and facilitated the release of Nelson Mandela. "F. W. de Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress" [^3].

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of sources primarily in English, which may not fully capture the perspectives of all South African communities affected by apartheid. Additionally, the reliance on secondary sources means that some nuances of the negotiations and internal dynamics may not be fully represented. Further research could include primary sources and interviews with individuals directly involved in the anti-apartheid movement.
