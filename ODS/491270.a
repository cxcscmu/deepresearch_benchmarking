Parliamentary scrutiny is a critical function of Parliament, aimed at holding the government accountable through the examination of policies, actions, and spending. However, there are concerns about its effectiveness, as the government often has significant institutional advantages, such as access to civil service expertise, which the opposition lacks. Additionally, effective scrutiny is supported by complex procedures, culture, and resources, but there are ongoing discussions about potential reforms to enhance its effectiveness.
