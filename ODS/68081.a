Preventing bullying in schools involves several strategies, including teaching kindness and empathy, creating opportunities for connection among students, and identifying and addressing 'gateway behaviors' that may lead to bullying. Schools can also establish and enforce clear rules and policies on how students should treat each other, supervise high-risk areas, and adopt a Multi-Tiered System of Supports to address behavioral issues. Additionally, school-based programs that strengthen youths' skills and modify the physical and social environment have been shown to reduce bullying.
