The breakup resulted in the emergence of 15 independent republics, a dramatic economic downturn, and a surge in ethnic conflicts.

This report explores the multifaceted consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse, highlighting its profound impact on regional stability, economic conditions, and international relations.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, historical databases, and reputable websites. The search focused on the political, economic, and social consequences of the Soviet Union's dissolution. Key sources included Britannica, Wikipedia, and other educational platforms. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Soviet Union collapse effects," "post-Soviet economic impact," and "global influence of Soviet dissolution."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Regional Economic and Social Impact:**
   The collapse of the Soviet Union led to severe economic crises in the newly independent states. "The breakdown of economic ties that followed the Soviet collapse led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standard of living in post-Soviet states and the former Eastern Bloc, which was even worse than the Great Depression" [^1]. This economic turmoil resulted in increased poverty and inequality, with millions living on less than $5.50 a day by 1999.

2. **Ethnic Conflicts and Nationalism:**
   The dissolution fueled ethnic conflicts and a rise in nationalism. "Social disintegration and political instability fueled a surge in ethnic conflict. Social and economic disparities, along with ethnic differences, created an upsurge in nationalism within groups and discrimination between groups" [^2]. Territorial disputes became prevalent, as minority groups sought autonomy and self-determination.

3. **Global Geopolitical Shifts:**
   On a global scale, the collapse marked the end of the Cold War and shifted the balance of power. "Its downfall increased the United States' influence as a global power and created an opportunity for corruption and crime in Russia" [^3]. The end of the Soviet Union also allowed neoliberal capitalism to become the dominant global system, influencing economic policies worldwide.
