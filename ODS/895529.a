The breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 had significant impacts both regionally and globally. Regionally, it led to the emergence of 15 independent countries, which were previously part of the Soviet Union, and resulted in internal challenges such as economic instability and ethnic separatism. Globally, the dissolution shifted the balance of power, establishing the United States as the sole superpower and altering global dynamics. Additionally, it influenced the formation of new political and economic alliances, such as the European Union.
