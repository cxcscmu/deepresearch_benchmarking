Women and African Americans played significant roles in various wars. African American women served as nurses, cooks, teachers, and laborers, and some were involved in military service, such as the Women's Army Corps during World War II. They also contributed to the war effort at home by aiding in war production and organization. African Americans and women were integral in supporting the military and maintaining the home front during wartime.
