# Report on the Role of Women and African Americans in World War II

## Executive Summary

During World War II, both women and African Americans played crucial roles that significantly contributed to the war effort. Women served in various capacities, including military service, nursing, and industrial work, while African Americans broke barriers by serving in the military and supporting the war effort on the home front. Despite facing discrimination and segregation, their contributions were vital to the Allied victory.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, I utilized a combination of online research tools and databases. I focused on credible sources such as historical archives, educational websites, and reputable history-focused platforms. The search strategy included keywords like "African American women WWII," "women in WWII," and "African Americans in the military WWII."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Military Service and Nursing**: African American women served in various military branches, including the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) and the Women's Army Corps (WAC). "World War II saw about 500 black nurses in the army, the WAVES eventually saw almost 100 black women, and the Coast Guard's SPAR had 5 black women" [^1]. These women faced significant challenges, including racial discrimination, but they persevered to provide essential services.

2. **Home Front Contributions**: On the home front, African American women were instrumental in war production and organization. They worked in shipyards, factories, and government offices, contributing to the war effort while battling racism. "From shipyards to factories to government administrative offices, Black women worked to battle authoritarianism abroad and racism at home" [^2].

3. **Overcoming Discrimination**: Despite the hostility and discrimination they faced, African American women were determined to serve their country. "African American women chose to serve their country despite the discrimination, hostility, and sometimes outright violence they faced while doing so" [^3]. Their resilience and dedication were crucial in overcoming societal barriers and making significant contributions to the war effort.

## Limitations

The research is limited by the availability of online sources and the potential for incomplete historical records. Some sources may not provide comprehensive coverage of the topic, and there may be a lack of firsthand accounts from the individuals who served. Additionally, the focus on African American women may overlook the broader contributions of other minority groups during the war.
