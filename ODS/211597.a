Reverend Parris abuses his power in "The Crucible" by exploiting the fears of the community to maintain his authority and secure his position. He is more concerned with his reputation and social status than the well-being of his congregation, using fear and manipulation to achieve his goals. His actions reflect his selfishness and ambition, as he prioritizes his personal security over justice and the welfare of others.
