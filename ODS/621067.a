The justification for U.S. involvement in World War I is a subject of historical debate. Some argue that the U.S. was justified due to Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, which threatened American lives and commerce, and the need to support allies financially indebted to the U.S. Others contend that the intervention led to unnecessary loss of American lives and was driven by economic interests rather than moral imperatives. The decision remains controversial, with valid arguments on both sides.
