Social media platforms significantly impact how individuals communicate and behave by providing new opportunities for connection and collaboration, while also altering traditional social skills. They enable people to connect with others across geographical distances, but excessive use can negatively affect relationship quality and increase feelings of jealousy. Additionally, social media can change the way brains form new social connections and influence human behavior, sometimes leading to negative mental health outcomes.
