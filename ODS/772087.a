The definitions of communication and culture can be used to foster intercultural literacy by enhancing awareness of differences among people. Communication, as a process of exchanging information, helps individuals understand diverse perspectives, while culture, encompassing the shared values and practices of a group, provides context for these interactions. Together, they promote tolerance, acceptance, and stronger relationships across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
