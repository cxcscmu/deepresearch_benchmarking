Changes in exchange rates impact businesses by affecting the cost of supplies purchased from other countries, influencing operating profits, and altering the relative value of expenses and income in international operations. A weakening domestic currency can make imports more expensive, leading to higher sourcing and manufacturing costs, which may result in rising consumer prices. Additionally, exchange rate fluctuations can create uncertainty for businesses that trade overseas, impacting budgets, logistics, cash flow, and revenue.
