## Detailed Findings

1. **Increased Competition**: Globalization has led to a more competitive job market. As noted in a LinkedIn article, "Although globalization opens up new job opportunities, it also brings new obstacles, such as higher levels of competition" [^1]. This competition is not only local but also international, as job seekers now compete with candidates from around the world.
