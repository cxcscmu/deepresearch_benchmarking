Apartheid in South Africa significantly affected people's lives by enforcing racial segregation and discrimination. It dictated where individuals could live and work based on their race, restricted their access to education, and prohibited inter-racial marriages. Black South Africans were forced into poverty, removed from their homes, and relocated to segregated neighborhoods, severely limiting their economic and social mobility.
