According to Positive Psychology, "By labeling their inner emotional experiences, known as emotional awareness, they improve their emotional intelligence which is a helpful skill" [^1].

2. **Modeling and Storytelling**: Teachers and parents can model emotional intelligence by sharing personal stories and discussing emotions openly. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) suggests that "Another way teachers can embed emotional intelligence in the classroom routine is by sharing stories about their own feelings" [^2].
