Children's emotional intelligence can be enhanced by helping them become aware of their emotions, practicing reading emotions in others, and reflecting on past emotional reactions. Additionally, parents can engage in emotion coaching, which involves discussing emotions and modeling emotional awareness, to help children develop empathy and better social skills.
