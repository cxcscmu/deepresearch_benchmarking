The question of whether people in prison should be allowed to vote is a subject of debate. Proponents argue that restoring voting rights to incarcerated individuals is a step towards rehabilitation and reintegration into society. They believe that disenfranchisement focuses too much on punishment rather than rehabilitation. Opponents, however, argue that committing a felony should result in the loss of certain rights, including voting, as part of the consequences of breaking the law. The decision varies by jurisdiction, with some places allowing voting rights to be restored upon release, while others maintain restrictions during incarceration.
