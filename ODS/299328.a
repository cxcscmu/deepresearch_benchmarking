# Texas Abortion Law: An Overview

## Executive Summary

Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the United States. The legal framework surrounding abortion in Texas has evolved significantly, particularly following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. The current laws in Texas prohibit most abortions, with limited exceptions, and impose severe penalties for violations. This report provides a detailed analysis of the current legal landscape regarding abortion in Texas.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on legal databases and news websites, to gather the most recent and relevant information on Texas abortion laws. Tools such as Google Scholar and legal research databases were employed to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the findings.

## Detailed Findings

1. **General Prohibition and Exceptions**: Abortion in Texas is largely illegal, with exceptions primarily to save the life of the pregnant patient. The law imposes severe penalties, including life imprisonment and fines up to $100,000 for those who perform or induce an abortion outside these exceptions [^1]. The law is written ambiguously, making it difficult to apply exceptions even in life-threatening situations [^2].

2. **Trigger Law and Heartbeat Act**: The current legal status is a result of a trigger law that came into effect following the Dobbs decision. This law, along with the Texas Heartbeat Act, bans abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks of pregnancy, often before many women know they are pregnant [^3]. The Heartbeat Act uniquely allows private individuals to sue anyone who performs or aids in an abortion, circumventing traditional enforcement mechanisms [^3].

3. **Recent Legislative Developments**: In August 2023, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed HB 3058, which allows abortions in cases of ectopic pregnancies or when a fetus is non-viable due to early water breakage [^3]. Despite these minor allowances, the overall legal framework remains highly restrictive, with significant civil and criminal penalties for violations [^4].
