Texas abortion law, particularly the Texas Heartbeat Act (Senate Bill 8), prohibits abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The law is unique in that it allows private citizens to sue anyone who performs or aids and abets an abortion in violation of the law, rather than having the state enforce the ban. This legal structure has made it difficult to challenge in court.
