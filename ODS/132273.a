Pollution in the East China Sea primarily involves inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, oil hydrocarbons, organic matter, and heavy metals, which lead to eutrophication and harmful algae blooms. Heavy metals can accumulate in marine organisms through the food chain, posing ecological risks. Additionally, oil spills threaten the ecological environments of nearby regions, and emissions from factories and vehicles disrupt natural cycles by depositing excess nutrients into the sea.
