# Report: To What Extent Do Conservatives Agree on Society?

## Executive Summary

Conservatives are not entirely unified in their views on society. While there are common themes such as the importance of hierarchy and the role of law and order, significant differences exist among various conservative strands. These differences often revolve around the degree of individualism versus collectivism and the role of the state in society.

## Methodology

To address the query, I conducted a comprehensive search using various online educational resources and political analysis platforms. The search focused on understanding the conservative perspective on society by examining flashcards, educational documents, and expert opinions. The tools used included search engines and educational websites like Quizlet, Studocu, and Tutor2u.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Hierarchy and Stability**: A common theme among conservatives is the belief in a hierarchical society that provides stability. This view is shared by most conservative strands, which see hierarchy as a counterbalance to human imperfection. "Most of the conservative strands see society as hierarchical that provides stability against the imperfect human nature" [^1].

2. **Individual Rights and Law**: There is a consensus among conservatives that individual rights are contingent upon law and order. This belief underscores the importance of a structured society where laws maintain social order. "To some extent conservatives are united in their view of society because they believe individual rights are dependent upon law and order" [^2].

3. **Disagreements on Atomism**: Despite some commonalities, there are significant disagreements, particularly regarding the atomistic view of society. Some conservatives lean towards a more individualistic approach, while others emphasize the collective good. "Although there are few running themes of hierarchy and pragmatic approaches, conservatives' views on society are not unified" [^3].
