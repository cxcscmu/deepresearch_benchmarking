A researcher can address issues of confidentiality in qualitative research by planning for confidentiality during the research proposal stage and securing approval from ethics review boards. They should collect anonymous data whenever possible, store data in encrypted files or password-protected databases, and restrict access to authorized personnel only. Additionally, researchers should be transparent about data security and confidentiality measures to help participants understand how their data will be protected.
