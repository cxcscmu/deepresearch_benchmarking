To identify personal and professional boundaries in others, you can observe their behavior and interactions, pay attention to non-verbal cues indicating discomfort, and ask questions to understand their needs and boundaries. Additionally, being empathetic and respecting their responses, such as accepting "no" as an answer, can help in recognizing and respecting their boundaries.
