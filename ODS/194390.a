Global warming affects the environment in several significant ways. It leads to rising sea levels due to melting ice sheets and glaciers, increased heat, drought, and more severe wildfires. Additionally, global warming exacerbates water shortages, alters precipitation patterns causing floods and droughts, and results in more frequent and severe heat waves. Warmer temperatures also impact polar regions and mountain glaciers, contributing to further environmental changes.
