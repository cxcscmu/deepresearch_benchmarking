Yes, breed-specific legislation (BSL) laws are generally considered to cause more harm than good. Multiple sources, including the ASPCA and various studies, indicate that BSL does not enhance public safety and can lead to unintended negative consequences, such as increased costs to communities and the relinquishment of pets to shelters. Additionally, there is no substantial evidence that BSL effectively reduces dog attacks.
