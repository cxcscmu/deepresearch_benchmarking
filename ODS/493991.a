# Report on Inequality in Global Cities

## Executive Summary

Global cities are often characterized by significant levels of inequality. This disparity is primarily driven by the concentration of wealth and high-paying jobs, alongside poor-quality public education and the high cost of higher education. The urbanization trend further exacerbates these inequalities, as cities become focal points for both wealth and poverty. This report delves into the reasons behind the pronounced inequality in global cities, drawing from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

## Methodology

To address the query, a systematic search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on identifying credible sources that discuss the causes of inequality in global cities. The search strategy included using keywords such as "inequality in global cities," "urban inequality," and "economic disparity in metropolitan areas." The selected sources were evaluated based on their relevance, credibility, and the depth of information provided.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Concentration of High-Paying Jobs**: Global cities often serve as economic hubs, attracting high-paying jobs that contribute to income inequality. "Global cities contribute to income inequality by concentrating high-paying jobs" [^1]. This concentration creates a significant income gap between those employed in lucrative sectors and those in lower-paying jobs.

2. **Education and Credentialing**: The quality of public education and the cost of higher education play a crucial role in perpetuating inequality. "Poor-quality public education and the high cost of higher education credentialing reinforce inequality rather than correct it" [^2]. This barrier limits access to opportunities for upward mobility for lower-income residents.

3. **Urbanization and Resource Allocation**: The trend towards urbanization has made cities hotspots for inequality. "With a global trend toward urbanisation, cities are becoming a growing site for inequalities" [^3]. The unequal distribution of resources and opportunities between the affluent and the poor further widens the gap.

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of recent data and the scope of the sources accessed. Some sources may not provide the most current insights due to the rapidly changing dynamics of global cities. Additionally, the complexity of urban inequality means that not all contributing factors could be explored in detail within this report.
