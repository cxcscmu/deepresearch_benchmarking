Inequality in global cities is largely due to the concentration of high-paying jobs and the unequal distribution of economic resources and opportunities. These cities often have a mix of wealth and modern infrastructure alongside poverty, which exacerbates the divide between the rich and poor. Additionally, factors such as poor-quality public education and the high cost of higher education contribute to reinforcing inequality rather than addressing it.
