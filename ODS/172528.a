Climate change affects natural disasters by increasing their frequency and intensity. It leads to longer and more extreme droughts, more severe tropical storms due to warmer ocean temperatures, and increased evaporation that results in denser clouds and heavier rainfall. Additionally, a warmer and moister atmosphere contributes to more intense tropical cyclones.
