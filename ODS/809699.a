# Report: The Legality of the Death Penalty

## Executive Summary

The death penalty remains a contentious issue globally, with arguments both for and against its legality. Proponents argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime, provides retribution, and ensures justice for heinous acts. Opponents, however, highlight issues of human rights violations, racial bias, and the potential for wrongful executions. This report explores the various arguments surrounding the death penalty's legality, drawing from multiple sources to present a balanced view.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and resources. The search focused on reputable sources that discuss the death penalty's pros and cons, including legal, ethical, and social perspectives. Tools such as Google Scholar and organizational websites like Amnesty International and the Heritage Foundation were utilized to gather diverse viewpoints.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Deterrence and Retribution**: Proponents argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent to crime and fulfills a retributive function. According to the Heritage Foundation, "the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution" [^1]. This perspective suggests that the fear of execution may prevent potential criminals from committing serious offenses.

2. **Human Rights Concerns**: Opponents of the death penalty, such as Amnesty International, argue that it violates fundamental human rights. They state, "the death penalty breaches human rights, in particular the right to life and the right to live free from torture" [^2]. This argument emphasizes the moral and ethical implications of state-sanctioned executions.

3. **Bias and Legal Flaws**: The Equal Justice Initiative highlights systemic issues within the death penalty's application, noting that it is "a flawed, expensive policy, defined by bias and error" [^3]. This critique points to racial and socio-economic disparities in sentencing, as well as the irreversible nature of wrongful convictions.
