# Report: Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices

## Executive Summary

Ethical individuals sometimes make unethical choices due to a variety of factors, including organizational pressures, psychological safety, and rationalization. This report explores the reasons behind such behavior, drawing insights from multiple sources. The findings suggest that the environment and context in which individuals operate significantly influence their ethical decision-making.

## Methodology

To gather information on why ethical people make unethical choices, I conducted a comprehensive search using various online resources. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "ethical people unethical choices," "unethical decisions," and "organizational ethics." The tools used included academic databases, business journals, and reputable online publications. The search was limited to sources available up to October 2023.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Psychological Safety and Organizational Culture**: One of the primary reasons ethical individuals make unethical choices is the lack of psychological safety in organizations. When employees feel it is unsafe to speak up, they may resort to unethical behavior to align with organizational norms or expectations. "It is psychologically unsafe to speak up" is a common issue that provokes unethical choices [^1], [^2].

2. **Rationalization**: Many individuals justify unethical actions through rationalization. This cognitive process allows them to align their actions with their self-image as ethical individuals. For instance, an employee might rationalize skimming from company accounts by convincing themselves that they deserve it due to being underpaid [^3].

3. **Pressure to Achieve Unrealistic Objectives**: Employees often face pressure to meet unattainable goals, which can lead them to make unethical decisions as a means of coping. "If employees feel that a goal is beyond their reach, they may resort to making unethical choices to avoid the consequences of failure" [^4].
