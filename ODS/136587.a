Terrorism poses significant dangers, including large-scale loss of life, as seen in religious terrorism incidents, and profound psychological impacts on societies, such as diminished trust in governmental institutions. It also threatens national security and democracy by influencing political stability and social attitudes. Additionally, terrorism is closely linked to conflict zones, where the majority of attacks and deaths occur.
