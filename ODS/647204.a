# Report on How Climate Change Affects Sea Level

## Executive Summary

Climate change significantly impacts global sea levels through two primary mechanisms: the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, and the thermal expansion of seawater. As global temperatures rise, these processes contribute to an increase in sea levels, which poses a threat to coastal regions worldwide. This report explores the scientific understanding of these mechanisms and the implications of rising sea levels.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and authoritative climate science resources. The search focused on identifying credible sources that explain the relationship between climate change and sea level rise. Key search terms included "climate change sea level rise," "melting glaciers," and "thermal expansion." The tools used included Google Scholar and direct access to reputable climate science websites such as NASA, NOAA, and the EPA.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Melting Ice Sheets and Glaciers**: One of the primary contributors to sea level rise is the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. As global temperatures increase, ice masses in polar regions and mountain glaciers melt, adding significant volumes of water to the oceans. "Global warming is causing global mean sea level to rise in two ways. First, glaciers and ice sheets worldwide are melting and adding water to the ocean" [^1].

2. **Thermal Expansion of Seawater**: As the ocean absorbs heat from the atmosphere, seawater expands. This process, known as thermal expansion, is a significant factor in rising sea levels. "Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and the expansion of seawater" [^2].

3. **Impact on Coastal Areas**: Rising sea levels have profound impacts on coastal ecosystems and human settlements. They contribute to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and the intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems. "Rising sea level inundates low-lying wetlands and dry land, erodes shorelines, contributes to coastal flooding, and increases the flow of salt water into estuaries and freshwater aquifers" [^3].

## Limitations

This report is based on available data and literature up to October 2023. Some sources may not reflect the most recent research developments. Additionally, the complexity of climate systems means that projections and models are subject to uncertainties. The report relies on secondary data, and primary research would be necessary for more detailed analysis.
