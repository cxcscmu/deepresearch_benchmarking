World War I was caused by a combination of factors, including nationalism, militarism, imperialism, and complex alliances between countries. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria is often cited as the immediate trigger. The consequences of the war were profound, leading to the death of approximately 8.5 million soldiers and 13 million civilians, and the collapse of four imperial dynasties.
