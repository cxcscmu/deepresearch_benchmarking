Yes, social class significantly affects education. Research indicates that lower socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to lower academic achievement and slower academic progress compared to higher SES communities. Children from lower-income families are less likely to succeed in public schools than their wealthier peers, and performance gaps by social class often begin in early childhood and persist over time.
