The British Invasion, which began in the early 1960s, significantly changed music by introducing British rock and pop bands to the American music scene. This movement, led by bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, brought a new sound that blended rock and roll with British musical influences, leading to a cultural exchange that reshaped popular music. It also paved the way for the global success of British artists and influenced the development of various music genres, including rock, pop, and psychedelic music.
