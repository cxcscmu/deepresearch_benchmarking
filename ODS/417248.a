Slavery in America was a legal institution primarily involving the enslavement of Africans and African Americans. It was characterized by the forced labor and dehumanization of enslaved individuals, with significant impacts on national politics, economics, and society. Slavery persisted in about half of the U.S. states until its abolition in 1865. The system was commercialized, racialized, and inherited, with an enduring mythology created to justify and perpetuate it.
