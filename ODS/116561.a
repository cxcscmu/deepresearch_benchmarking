Prisoners have several rights, including protection under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), which mandates individualized housing placements for transgender and intersex prisoners. They also have the right to be free from racial segregation, except in specific circumstances, and the right to practice their religion without substantial burdens unless a compelling reason is provided. Additionally, prisoners' rights are protected by various legal frameworks to ensure humane treatment and protection from abuse.
