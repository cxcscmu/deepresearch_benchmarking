Abortion should be supported because it is considered an essential component of women's health care, allowing individuals to exercise reproductive autonomy and make decisions about their own bodies. Access to safe abortion care can prevent unsafe abortions and complications, thereby protecting lives and health. Additionally, the right to choose abortion is supported by guarantees of life and health, freedom from discrimination, and autonomy in reproductive decision-making.
