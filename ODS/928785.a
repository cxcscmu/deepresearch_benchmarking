## Detailed Findings

1. **Arguments in Favor of Capital Punishment:**
   - Proponents argue that the death penalty provides justice and closure for victims' families. According to Britannica, "The death penalty provides the justice and closure families and victims deserve" [^1].
   - It is also seen as a deterrent to crime. The White House's stance is that "Capital punishment is an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts of lethal violence" [^2].
   - Some argue that society has a moral obligation to protect its citizens, and capital punishment is a means to fulfill this duty.

2. **Arguments Against Capital Punishment:**
   - Critics highlight the unreliability and potential for error in the capital punishment system. A study cited by the Death Penalty Information Center found that "two thirds of all capital trials contained serious errors" [^4].
   - Amnesty International argues that the death penalty violates fundamental human rights, stating, "Amnesty International holds that the death penalty breaches human rights, in particular the right to life and the right to live free from torture" [^5].
   - The Equal Justice Initiative points out systemic biases, stating, "The death penalty in America is a flawed, expensive policy, defined by bias and error. It targets the most vulnerable people in our society" [^6].
