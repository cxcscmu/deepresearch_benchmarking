The question of whether capital punishment should be legalized is highly debated and involves various perspectives. Proponents argue that it provides justice and closure for victims' families and serves as a deterrent to crime. However, opponents, including organizations like Amnesty International and the OHCHR, argue that it breaches human rights, is prone to errors, and does not lead to justice. The debate involves moral, legal, and practical considerations, and opinions vary widely.
