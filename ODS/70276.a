A caregiver can support a person with mental health issues by providing emotional support, helping manage day-to-day tasks, advocating for them, and encouraging them to seek professional help. It's also important for caregivers to educate themselves on mental health, create safe environments, and seek support from supervisors or professionals if they encounter situations they are not equipped to handle.
