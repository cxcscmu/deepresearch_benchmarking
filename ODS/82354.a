The use of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) for weight loss presents both benefits and concerns. Some sources, like the Mayo Clinic, suggest that artificial sweeteners can help reduce sugar intake and assist with weight management in the short term. However, the World Health Organization advises against using non-sugar sweeteners for long-term weight control, as they do not effectively aid in weight management over time. Concerns include potential associations with higher body weight, increased energy intake, and metabolic abnormalities, as noted in various studies. Additionally, there is a risk that people may compensate for reduced sugar intake by consuming more calories from other sources, potentially offsetting any weight loss benefits.
