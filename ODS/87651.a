Home prices are high primarily due to a persistent shortage of available homes, which leads to intense competition among buyers. This shortage is exacerbated by factors such as low inventory, increased demand, and temporary shortages of labor and materials. Additionally, many homeowners who secured low mortgage rates in 2020 are less inclined to sell, further limiting the supply.
