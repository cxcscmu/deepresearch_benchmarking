# Report: Does Religion Cause War?

## Executive Summary

The relationship between religion and war is complex and often misunderstood. While religion is frequently cited as a cause of conflict, historical data suggests that it is not the predominant cause of wars. Various studies and historical analyses indicate that religion is a factor in a minority of conflicts, with political, economic, and ethnic factors often playing more significant roles. This report examines the role of religion in warfare, drawing on multiple sources to provide a nuanced understanding of the issue.

## Methodology

To address the question of whether religion causes war, a comprehensive search was conducted using a variety of online resources, including academic articles, historical databases, and reputable news outlets. The search focused on identifying scholarly perspectives, historical data, and expert opinions on the topic. Key search terms included "religion and war," "causes of war," and "religious conflicts."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Data on Religious Wars**: According to the Encyclopedia of Wars, out of 1,763 recorded historical conflicts, only 121, or approximately 6.87%, had religion as their primary cause [^1]. This suggests that while religion has been a factor in some wars, it is not the predominant cause.

2. **Complexity of Religious Conflicts**: Many conflicts labeled as "religious wars" often have underlying secular motivations. Scholars argue that religion is frequently intertwined with political, economic, and ethnic factors, making it difficult to isolate as a sole cause of war. For instance, the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq involve religious elements but are driven by broader geopolitical issues [^2].

3. **Modern Interpretations of Religious Wars**: The concept of "religious war" is often a modern interpretation, with some historians suggesting that the term is a Western construct. Theologian William T. Cavanaugh argues that the notion of "religious violence" is a recent invention, and many so-called religious wars have significant secular ramifications [^3].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of data and the complexity of defining what constitutes a "religious war." The interpretation of historical conflicts can vary, and the role of religion is often intertwined with other factors, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Additionally, the sources used may reflect Western perspectives, which could influence the interpretation of religious conflicts globally.
