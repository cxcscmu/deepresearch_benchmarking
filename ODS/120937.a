# Vaccine Effectiveness Report

## Executive Summary

Vaccines are a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases, but they are not 100% effective. This report explores the effectiveness of vaccines, highlighting that while they significantly reduce the risk of disease, no vaccine guarantees complete immunity. Various factors, including individual immune responses and the nature of the disease, influence vaccine efficacy.

## Methodology

To address the query regarding vaccine effectiveness, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and authoritative health websites. The search focused on recent articles and reports from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), American Medical Association (AMA), and other health-related publications. The search strategy included keywords like "vaccine effectiveness," "vaccine efficacy," and "100% effective vaccines."

## Detailed Findings

1. **General Vaccine Effectiveness**: According to the World Health Organization, "Vaccines do not provide full (100%) protection because of many factors, including our individual differences in immunity and response" [^1]. This statement underscores the variability in vaccine effectiveness due to personal health factors.

2. **Expert Opinions**: Dr. Crum, as cited by the American Medical Association, stated, “There are really no vaccines that are 100% effective, but there are some vaccines that are more protective than others” [^2]. This highlights the relative effectiveness of different vaccines, with some offering higher protection levels than others.

3. **Specific Vaccine Examples**: UnityPoint Health provides specific examples, noting that "No vaccine is 100 percent effective—for example, the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) is 95-97 percent effective against measles" [^3]. This illustrates that while vaccines like MMR are highly effective, they do not offer complete protection.
