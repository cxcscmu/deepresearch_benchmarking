Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, generally do not aim for zero inflation. Instead, they target a low, positive inflation rate, often around 2%. This target provides a safety buffer against deflation and allows for some flexibility in monetary policy. Zero inflation is not typically pursued because central banks do not have precise control over inflation, and a small positive rate helps prevent economic distortions.
