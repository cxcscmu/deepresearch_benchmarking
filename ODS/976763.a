The Cold War had a significant impact on American society, leading to increased affluence, a baby boom, and sweeping political and cultural changes. It sparked tremendous fear of communist infiltration, encouraged conformity to a positive view of the United States, and led to a cultural antagonism between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The threat of nuclear annihilation also influenced domestic life, with people building bomb shelters and the government focusing on halting the spread of communism.
