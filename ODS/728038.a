Employees are motivated by a variety of factors beyond just monetary compensation. Key motivators include the opportunity to make an impact, learning new things, finding innovative solutions, feeling a sense of meaning and purpose in their work, and having growth opportunities. Additionally, recognition for a job well done, autonomy, and a mix of individual and team-level performance goals also play significant roles in motivating employees.
