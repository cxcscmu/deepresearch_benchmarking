Cloud models in the information age work by providing network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources. Companies host or maintain massive data centers that offer security, storage capacity, and computing power to support cloud services. This allows applications and workloads to migrate to the cloud, shifting network traffic patterns and enabling real-time collaboration and file sharing.
