# Cambodian Genocide: Conclusion and Aftermath

## Executive Summary

The Cambodian Genocide, orchestrated by the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot from 1975 to 1979, resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.5 to 3 million people. The genocide ended with the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, which toppled the Khmer Rouge regime in January 1979. This intervention was prompted by cross-border attacks by the Khmer Rouge into Vietnam, including the Ba Chúc massacre. The Vietnamese installed a new government in Cambodia, which marked the end of the genocide and initiated a period of reconstruction and justice-seeking, including the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal in 2003.

## Methodology

To gather information on the end of the Cambodian Genocide, I utilized a combination of academic resources, historical databases, and reputable online sources. The search strategy involved querying terms such as "Cambodian Genocide end," "Vietnamese invasion Cambodia 1979," and "Khmer Rouge fall." The tools used included academic databases and search engines to access articles, historical records, and expert analyses.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Vietnamese Invasion and Overthrow of the Khmer Rouge**: The genocide concluded when the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia in late 1978, responding to repeated cross-border attacks by the Khmer Rouge, including the massacre of Vietnamese civilians[^1]. "The massacres ended when the Vietnamese military invaded in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge regime"[^2].

2. **Establishment of a New Government**: Following the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese installed a new government in Cambodia. This marked the official end of the Khmer Rouge's genocidal policies. "On 15 July 1979, the new Vietnamese installed government of Cambodia passed 'Decree Law No. 1,' allowing for the trial of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary for the crime of genocide"[^3].

3. **Justice and Reconciliation Efforts**: In the years following the genocide, efforts were made to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, was established in 2003 to try senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge for crimes against humanity and genocide[^4].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may contain biases or inaccuracies inherent in retrospective analyses. Additionally, the complexity of the geopolitical context and the passage of time since the events may result in varying interpretations of the historical facts. Access to primary sources and firsthand accounts would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding the end of the Cambodian Genocide.
