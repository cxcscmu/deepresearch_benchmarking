Soccer is not as popular in the US primarily due to cultural factors. It is often perceived as not being an "American" sport, and there is a preference for sports like American football, which are seen as more exciting due to higher scoring and more action. Additionally, historical resistance to the sport, partly due to its association with immigrants, and the lack of success of the men's national team have also contributed to its lower popularity.
