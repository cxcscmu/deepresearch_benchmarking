# Report: Why Soccer is Not Popular in the US

## Executive Summary

Soccer, known as football in most parts of the world, has struggled to gain the same level of popularity in the United States as it enjoys globally. The reasons for this are multifaceted, involving cultural, historical, and structural factors. Despite its growing youth participation, soccer has not become a dominant spectator sport in the U.S. This report explores the various reasons behind this phenomenon.

## Methodology

To understand why soccer is not more popular in the U.S., I conducted a comprehensive search using online databases and search engines. The search focused on articles, opinion pieces, and expert analyses. The tools used included Google Search and academic databases, with a focus on recent discussions and historical perspectives. The search terms included "soccer popularity in the US," "why soccer isn't popular in America," and "cultural barriers to soccer in the US."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Barriers**: A recurring theme in the discourse is the cultural mismatch between soccer and American sports preferences. According to a Reddit discussion, "The main reason why soccer is not popular in the USA is because of the American culture" [^1]. This sentiment is echoed by Hall & Partners, which states, "We've found it comes down to one fundamental barrier: CULTURE" [^2]. The emphasis in American sports culture is often on high-scoring, fast-paced games, which contrasts with soccer's lower-scoring nature.

2. **Historical Context**: Historically, soccer did not establish a strong foothold in the U.S. due to early decisions by major colleges to adopt other sports. As noted on Quora, "One reason soccer is less popular is that the major colleges back in the day chose to play rugby, or a close derivation thereof, which evolved into American football" [^3]. This historical choice set the stage for the development of American football as a dominant sport.

3. **Structural Challenges**: The structure of soccer leagues and the performance of the national teams also play a role. The NewsHouse highlights that "America's general resistance to the immigrants that played the sport and the expectation that they assimilate to American sports" contributed to soccer's marginalization [^4]. Additionally, the lack of success of the U.S. men's national team on the international stage has not helped in building a strong fan base.

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of sources and the potential bias in opinion pieces. The analysis primarily relies on secondary sources, which may not capture the full complexity of the issue. Additionally, the perspectives included are predominantly from Western sources, which may not fully represent the views of all demographic groups within the U.S. Further research could include primary data collection through surveys or interviews with American sports fans.
