Inequality generally hurts economic growth. Several sources, including the IMF and the Council on Foreign Relations, suggest that high levels of inequality can depress growth by reducing aggregate demand, discouraging skills accumulation, and limiting economic and social mobility. However, some research indicates that the effect of inequality on growth can vary depending on the context, potentially being positive or negative at different levels of inequality.
