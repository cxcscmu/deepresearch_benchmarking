Money laundering typically involves three stages: placement, layering, and integration. In the placement stage, illegally obtained funds are introduced into the legitimate financial system. During the layering stage, the money is moved through complex transactions to obscure its origins. Finally, in the integration stage, the "cleaned" money is reintroduced into the economy as legitimate funds.
