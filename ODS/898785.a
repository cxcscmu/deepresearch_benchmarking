Culture affects intelligence by shaping how it is defined and valued within different societies. In Western cultures, intelligence is often viewed as the ability to categorize and engage in rational thinking, while Asian and African cultures may have broader and more encompassing views of intelligence. The cultural context influences what characteristics are considered essential for intelligence, and this can affect how intelligence is perceived and measured across different cultures.
