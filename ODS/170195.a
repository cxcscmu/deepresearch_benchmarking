Online learning affects students in various ways. It offers flexibility, allowing students to access quality education anytime and anywhere, and can lead to higher retention rates, with students retaining up to 60% more information compared to traditional classroom settings. However, it can also lead to distractions, potentially causing a decline in academic performance and increased anxiety, stress, and social media fatigue. Additionally, some students find virtual learning slow and boring, and it can negatively impact school attendance, particularly in districts with higher poverty rates.
