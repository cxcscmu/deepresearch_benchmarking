# Report: Presentation of Conflict in "Romeo and Juliet"

## Executive Summary

The theme of conflict is central to William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," manifesting in various forms throughout the play. The primary conflict arises from the longstanding feud between the Montagues and the Capulets, which serves as a backdrop for the tragic love story. This enmity not only fuels external conflicts but also triggers internal struggles within characters, particularly Juliet. The play explores how these conflicts impact relationships and drive the narrative towards its tragic conclusion.

## Methodology

To gather insights on how conflict is presented in "Romeo and Juliet," I conducted a comprehensive search using online educational resources, literary analysis platforms, and academic articles. The search focused on identifying key themes and examples of conflict within the play. Tools used included Google Search and academic databases, ensuring a diverse range of perspectives and interpretations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Family Feud as Central Conflict**: The primary conflict in "Romeo and Juliet" is the "ongoing feud between the Montagues and the Capulets" [^1]. This external conflict is the catalyst for the tragic events that unfold, as it creates an environment of hostility and violence that permeates the play.

2. **Internal Conflict in Juliet**: Juliet experiences significant internal conflict as she navigates her love for Romeo and her loyalty to her family. One source notes, "Juliet suffers a lot of internal conflict as she struggles between her love for Romeo and her loyalty to her family" [^2]. This internal struggle is a poignant aspect of the play, highlighting the personal toll of the familial feud.

3. **Conflict in Relationships**: The theme of conflict extends to personal relationships, notably between Juliet and her father. When Juliet refuses to marry Paris, it results in a severe conflict with her father, who threatens to disown her: “Hang thee, young baggage!” [^3]. This illustrates how the external family feud exacerbates personal conflicts within the family unit.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of sources and interpretations up to October 2023. Some sources may present subjective interpretations, and the lack of direct quotes from the play itself limits the depth of textual analysis. Additionally, the focus on English-language sources may exclude diverse perspectives from non-English interpretations of the play.
