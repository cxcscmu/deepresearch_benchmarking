The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are essential because they provide a comprehensive framework to address global challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and discrimination. They aim to create a better and more sustainable future by promoting actions that protect the planet, ensure prosperity, and foster peace and justice. The SDGs encourage innovation, education, and adherence to climate commitments, which are crucial for sustainable development.
