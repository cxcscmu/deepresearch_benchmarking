The Protestant Bible has fewer books than the Catholic Bible because, during the Protestant Reformation, Protestants excluded certain books that are considered deuterocanonical by other Christian traditions. These books were not included in the Hebrew Bible and were therefore not accepted by Protestants, who sought to align their Old Testament more closely with the Jewish canon.
