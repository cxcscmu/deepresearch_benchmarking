# Report: Why the Protestant Bible Has Fewer Books

## Executive Summary

The Protestant Bible contains fewer books than the Catholic Bible due to historical and theological decisions made during the Protestant Reformation. The primary difference lies in the Old Testament, where the Protestant Bible excludes seven books that are included in the Catholic Bible. These books, known as the deuterocanonical books, are considered apocryphal by Protestants. The exclusion was influenced by various factors, including alignment with the Hebrew Bible and theological disagreements.

## Methodology

To address the query, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on academic databases and general web searches. Tools such as Google Scholar and online forums like Reddit were used to gather diverse perspectives. The search focused on historical and theological sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences between Protestant and Catholic Bibles.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Reformation Influence**: The Protestant Reformation played a crucial role in the exclusion of certain books from the Protestant Bible. "Historically, we have to say Protestants removed seven books that were universally in the Bible at the time of the Reformation" [^1]. This decision was influenced by a desire to align more closely with the Hebrew Bible, which does not include these books.

2. **Theological Considerations**: The books excluded by Protestants are known as the deuterocanonical books. These were rejected for several reasons, including theological disagreements. For instance, "The Protestants rejected the books for several reasons, two of which we will focus on here. The first was a 'problematic' passage in 2 Maccabees" [^2]. Such passages were seen as inconsistent with Protestant theological views.

3. **Canonical Decisions**: The Protestant Bible's canon was influenced by the Jewish Hebrew Bible, which comprises 39 books of the Old Testament. "Protestant Bibles comprise 39 books of the Old Testament (according to the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon, known especially to non-Protestants as the protocanonical books) and the 27 books of the New Testament for a total of 66 books" [^3]. This contrasts with the Catholic Bible, which includes 73 books.

## Limitations
