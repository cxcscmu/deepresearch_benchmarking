U.S. foreign policy has evolved significantly over time. Initially, the United States focused on political isolation from European powers and non-interventionism, particularly during the 19th century. This approach shifted in the 20th century, especially after World War II, when the U.S. adopted a more active global role, emphasizing liberalism and containment strategies during the Cold War. In recent years, globalization has broadened the foreign policy agenda to include issues like infectious diseases, poverty, and governance.
