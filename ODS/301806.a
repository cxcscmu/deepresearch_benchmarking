# U.S. Foreign Policy: Evolution Over Time

## Executive Summary

The foreign policy of the United States has undergone significant transformations from its inception to the present day. Initially characterized by isolationism and non-interventionism, U.S. foreign policy evolved into a more interventionist and global approach, particularly during and after the World Wars. The Cold War era marked a period of strategic containment against communism, while the post-Cold War era saw the U.S. emerge as a global hegemon. Recent years have witnessed shifts towards multilateralism and strategic competition with rising powers like China and Russia. This report explores these changes, highlighting key trends and influences that have shaped U.S. foreign policy.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive review of available literature and historical documents was conducted. Key sources included government archives, scholarly articles, and reputable news outlets. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "U.S. foreign policy history," "evolution of American foreign policy," and "U.S. international relations." Tools like Google Scholar and institutional databases were utilized to access a wide range of perspectives and analyses.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Early Isolationism and Non-Interventionism**: In the early years, U.S. foreign policy was guided by a principle of political isolation from European powers. This approach was rooted in the desire to avoid entanglements in foreign conflicts and maintain independence in international affairs. "During the first 50 years of the nation, diplomats were guided by the idea that the United States should observe political isolation from European powers" [^1].

2. **Shift to Global Engagement**: The 20th century saw a significant shift as the U.S. became more involved in global affairs, particularly during the World Wars and the Cold War. The strategy of containment during the Cold War was a defining feature, aimed at curbing the spread of communism. "The main trend regarding the history of U.S. foreign policy since the American Revolution is the shift from non-interventionism before and after World War I, to its growth as a world power and global hegemon during World War II and throughout the Cold War" [^2].

3. **Post-Cold War and Modern Era**: After the Cold War, the U.S. emerged as the sole superpower, leading to a foreign policy characterized by liberal hegemony and deep engagement. However, recent years have seen a pivot towards addressing the rise of other global powers and focusing on multilateralism. "Advancing a 'Free and Open Indo-Pacific' has become the core of the U.S. national security strategy and has been embraced by both Democratic and Republican administrations" [^3].
