The debate over taxing the rich more involves several pros and cons. Proponents argue that a wealth tax could help address rising wealth and income inequality, generate significant revenue, and reduce the federal deficit (source: pgpf.org, debt.org). On the other hand, critics claim that wealth taxes raise little revenue, create high administrative costs, and can harm economic growth (source: Tax Foundation, Boston Review). Additionally, there are concerns about double taxation and the potential for wealthy individuals to relocate to avoid higher taxes (source: Money Crashers).
