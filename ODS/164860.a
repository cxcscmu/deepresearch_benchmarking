A hostile work environment is characterized by unwelcome conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or abusive atmosphere. This can include discrimination, harassment, or retaliation that interferes with an employee's ability to perform their work. The conduct must be severe and pervasive enough to affect the work environment negatively.
