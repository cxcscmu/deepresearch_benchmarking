Social media, including platforms like Facebook, can have both positive and negative impacts on life. Positively, it offers opportunities for creativity, professional networking, and educational growth. However, excessive use can lead to negative effects such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, and exposure to inappropriate content. It can also contribute to issues like cyberbullying and sleep disturbances. The impact varies among individuals, with some experiencing more adverse effects than others.
