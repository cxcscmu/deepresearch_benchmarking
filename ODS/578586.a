The question of whether violence should be censored in the media is debated. Some argue that censoring media violence would be ineffective in reducing societal violence, as indicated by sources like the Cato Institute and the OJP. Others believe that censorship might be necessary to protect vulnerable groups from potential harm, as discussed in a Georgetown event. Additionally, a Pew Research study found that most Americans favor restrictions on violent content online. The perspectives vary, highlighting the complexity of the issue.
