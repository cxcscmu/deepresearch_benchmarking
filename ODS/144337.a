The pros of gun ownership include having a means of self-protection, potential deterrence against intruders, and the ability to respond immediately if police are far away. On the other hand, the cons include increased risks of accidents, suicide, domestic disputes, and the responsibility of understanding legal regulations surrounding gun use. Additionally, having a gun in the home statistically makes living there more dangerous.
