# Report: Consequences of the Government Running Out of Money

## Executive Summary
When a government runs out of money, it faces severe economic and operational challenges. The inability to meet financial obligations can lead to a default, which would have widespread repercussions on the economy, including increased unemployment, higher interest rates, and potential recessions. This report explores the implications of such a scenario, focusing on the U.S. context, where the debt ceiling plays a critical role in government financing.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search focused on credible financial and governmental analysis websites, including Investopedia, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The aim was to gather diverse perspectives on the potential outcomes of a government running out of money.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Impact of Default**: If the government defaults on its obligations, it could severely damage the economy. "The government could go into default, severely damaging the economy and causing unemployment to surge" [^1]. This highlights the immediate economic risks associated with a government running out of money.

2. **Operational Constraints**: Hitting the debt ceiling without resolution would restrict the government's ability to finance its operations. "Even short of default, hitting the debt ceiling would hamstring the government's ability to finance its operations, including providing for the national defense" [^2]. This indicates that essential services and national security could be compromised.

3. **Consequences of a Default**: A default on the national debt could lead to several adverse outcomes. "Economists say consequences of a default on the national debt could include higher interest rates, a stock market crash, a recession and massive unemployment" [^3]. These potential consequences underscore the critical nature of maintaining financial solvency.
