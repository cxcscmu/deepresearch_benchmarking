Pressure groups can enhance democracy by promoting political pluralism, encouraging political participation, and providing representation for diverse interests and causes. They offer opportunities for citizens to engage in the political process without needing to join a political party, thus broadening the scope of democratic involvement. However, it is also noted that not all groups are equally well mobilized, which can lead to imbalances in representation.
