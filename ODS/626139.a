# Report: Why Managers Might Act Against Their Ethical Values

## Executive Summary

Managers often face situations where their actions may conflict with their personal ethical values. This report explores the reasons behind such decisions, highlighting the influence of external pressures, organizational culture, and personal beliefs. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing strategies to promote ethical decision-making in management.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, business journals, and educational platforms. The search focused on identifying reasons why managers might act against their ethical values. Tools like Google Scholar, Quora, and Harvard Business Review were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **External Pressures**: Managers often face significant pressure from superiors or organizational policies that may compel them to act against their ethical beliefs. According to a source, "Managers may do things that conflict with their own ethical values due to external pressures, such as organizational policies or economic constraints" [^1].

2. **Fear of Consequences**: The fear of negative repercussions, such as rejection by peers or financial harm, can drive managers to compromise their ethics. A Quora discussion highlights that managers might act unethically due to "fear of rejection by respected others" or "fear of physical or financial harm" [^2].

3. **Belief in Impunity**: Some managers might believe they can act unethically without facing consequences. This belief can stem from a lack of accountability within the organization. As noted in a Harvard Business Review article, "How could top-level executives at the Manville Corporation have suppressed evidence for decades that proved that their product was harmful?" [^3].
