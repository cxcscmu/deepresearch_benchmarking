Same-sex marriage is not illegal in many parts of the world, including the United States, where it is legally recognized following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015. However, in some countries and regions, same-sex marriage remains illegal due to cultural, religious, or political reasons, often reflected in laws that define marriage strictly as a union between a man and a woman.
