The decision to reward students for good grades is debated. Some sources suggest that rewards can motivate students, particularly high-ability ones, while others argue that it may decrease long-term motivation and that appreciation and encouragement are more effective motivators. Ultimately, the effectiveness of rewarding students may depend on individual circumstances and the type of reward used.
