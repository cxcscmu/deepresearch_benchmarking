Homelessness is a problem because it is closely linked to poverty and a lack of affordable housing, which makes it difficult for individuals to secure stable living conditions. It exacerbates existing health issues or leads to new ones due to inadequate access to healthcare. Additionally, homelessness can result from various factors, including economic challenges, domestic violence, family issues, chronic health conditions, and substance abuse. These issues collectively contribute to the persistence and complexity of homelessness.
