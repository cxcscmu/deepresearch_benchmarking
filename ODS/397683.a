"Charlotte Temple" by Susanna Rowson highlights women's roles in society during the 1800s by portraying the limited options and societal expectations placed on women. The novel illustrates how women were often dependent on men for financial and social stability and were expected to adhere to strict moral codes. The story of Charlotte, who is seduced and abandoned, underscores the vulnerability and lack of agency women faced, as well as the harsh consequences of deviating from societal norms.
