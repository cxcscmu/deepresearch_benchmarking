Immigrants can become U.S. citizens through the process of naturalization. This involves several steps, including determining eligibility, preparing and submitting Form N-400 (Application for Naturalization), attending a biometrics appointment, completing an interview, passing English and civics tests, and taking the Oath of Allegiance. More detailed guidance can be found on the USCIS website.
