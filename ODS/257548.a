Immigrants can become U.S. citizens primarily through the process of naturalization. This involves meeting specific eligibility criteria, completing necessary documentation, and undergoing a series of steps outlined by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The process is designed to ensure that applicants are fully integrated into American society and understand their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
