During the Stuart period from 1603 to 1689, the British monarchy underwent significant changes. The period began with the union of the English and Scottish crowns under James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England. This era saw the English Civil War, which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored in 1660 with Charles II, but tensions between the monarchy and Parliament persisted. The period concluded with the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689, which resulted in the overthrow of James II and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy under William III and Mary II, significantly limiting the powers of the monarchy and enhancing the role of Parliament.
