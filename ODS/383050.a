# Report on Changes in the British Monarchy During the Stuart Period (1603-1689)

## Executive Summary

The Stuart period (1603-1689) was a transformative era for the British monarchy, marked by significant shifts in political power and governance. This period saw the monarchy's power diminish as Parliament's influence grew, leading to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Key events such as the English Civil War, the execution of King Charles I, the Interregnum under Oliver Cromwell, and the Glorious Revolution were pivotal in reshaping the monarchy's role in British governance.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of online resources, including historical websites, encyclopedias, and academic articles. The primary search strategy involved querying terms like "Stuart period British monarchy changes," "Stuart dynasty political shifts," and "British monarchy 1603-1689." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases for historical context and scholarly perspectives.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Shift of Power from Monarchy to Parliament**: The Stuart period was characterized by intense religious and political conflicts that gradually shifted power from the monarchy to Parliament. "The Stuart period witnessed intense religious and political conflicts, which shifted power from the monarchy to Parliament" [^1]. This shift was a result of the monarchy's attempts to rule without Parliament, leading to civil unrest and eventual changes in governance.

2. **The English Civil War and Its Aftermath**: The English Civil War (1642-1651) was a critical event that led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy. "The period was plagued by internal and religious strife, and a large-scale civil war which resulted in the execution of King Charles I in 1649" [^2]. This event marked a significant reduction in monarchical power and set the stage for the Interregnum, where Oliver Cromwell ruled as Lord Protector.

3. **The Glorious Revolution and Constitutional Monarchy**: The Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689 was a turning point that established the constitutional monarchy. "James II was overthrown in 1689 in the Glorious Revolution. He was replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary II and her Dutch husband William III" [^2]. This event solidified the principle that the monarchy could not govern without Parliament's consent, laying the foundation for modern British constitutional monarchy.
