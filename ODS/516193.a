Yes, there are problems with allowing interest groups to exercise influence over government. One significant issue is the potential for these groups to exert disproportionate influence, which can lead to policy decisions that favor specific interests over the public good. Additionally, the influence of interest groups can slow down the process of addressing problems and may lead to concerns about elitism and the "buying" of influence by wealthy entities.
