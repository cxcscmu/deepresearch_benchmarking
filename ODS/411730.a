In the context of the Middle East, the theory that "war makes states" is challenged by the presence of rentier states. These states, which rely heavily on revenue from natural resources like oil, do not follow the European model where war played a significant role in state formation. Instead, rentier states in the Middle East often defy this theory, as their state formation processes are influenced more by rentierism than by war.
