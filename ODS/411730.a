# Report on "Does War Make States? Rentierism and the Formation of States in the Middle East"

## Executive Summary

The concept of "war makes states" is a well-established theory in political science, suggesting that warfare has historically played a crucial role in the formation and consolidation of states, particularly in Europe. However, this theory does not hold uniformly across different regions, particularly in the Middle East. The presence of rentier states—those that derive a significant portion of their revenues from renting natural resources to external clients—alters the dynamics of state formation in this region. This report explores how rentierism interacts with war in the Middle East, often leading to state deformation rather than formation.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and scholarly journals. The search focused on articles and papers discussing the relationship between war, rentierism, and state formation in the Middle East. Key search terms included "war makes states," "rentierism," "state formation," and "Middle East." The search yielded several relevant sources, which were analyzed to extract direct quotes and insights.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Rentierism vs. War-Making in State Formation**: The traditional theory that "war makes states" is challenged in the context of the Middle East due to the prevalence of rentier states. "The history of state-making in the Arab Middle East shows that rentier states defy the 'war makes states' theory" [^1]. This suggests that the economic structure of these states, heavily reliant on external rents, diminishes the role of war in state-building.

2. **War's Destructive Role**: In contrast to the European experience, where war often led to stronger state structures, in the Middle East, war tends to have a destructive impact. "In short, unlike in Europe, wars do not make states in the Middle East; they destroy them" [^2]. This highlights a fundamental difference in how war influences state dynamics in different regions.

3. **Case Study of Iraq**: The interaction between rentierism and war has been particularly detrimental in Iraq. "The combination of rentierism and war-making was particularly deadly to the Iraqi state, as it contributed to the deformation and collapse of the state" [^3]. This case exemplifies how rentier economies can exacerbate the negative impacts of conflict.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of sources specifically addressing the interplay between rentierism and war in the Middle East. Additionally, the findings are primarily based on theoretical and historical analyses, which may not fully capture the contemporary dynamics of state formation in the region. Further empirical research could provide more nuanced insights into these complex interactions.
