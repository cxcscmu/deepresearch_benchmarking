Accounting conservatism affects financial reporting by requiring a high degree of verification before recognizing profits, which helps prevent the overstatement of financial performance. It ensures that gains are recorded only when they are certain, while potential losses are recognized even if they are only remotely possible. This approach provides more reliable financial information for investors but may also lead to more conservative financial statements that could impact the perceived performance of a company.
