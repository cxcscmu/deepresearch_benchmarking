South Asians are more prone to diabetes due to factors such as higher insulin resistance, impaired Î²-cell function, and the way fat is stored in their bodies, which leads to increased insulin resistance. Additionally, they often have lower lean muscle mass and more visceral fat, contributing to these risks. For Black ethnicities, the context does not provide specific reasons, but it is generally documented that race/ethnic minorities, including Black individuals, have a higher prevalence of diabetes compared to non-minority groups.
