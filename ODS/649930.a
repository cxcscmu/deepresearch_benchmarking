# Report on Diabetes Prevalence in South East Asians and Black Ethnicities

## Executive Summary
This report explores the reasons why South East Asians and Black ethnicities are more prone to type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in these groups is influenced by a combination of genetic, biological, and lifestyle factors. South East Asians, particularly South Asians, are known to have higher insulin resistance and unique fat distribution patterns, while Black ethnicities face challenges related to genetic predispositions and socio-economic factors.

## Methodology
To gather information for this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and academic journals. The search focused on peer-reviewed articles and reputable health organization publications. Keywords used included "South East Asians diabetes risk," "Black ethnicities diabetes," and "ethnic differences in diabetes."

## Detailed Findings

1. **South East Asians and Diabetes:**
   - South Asians are particularly predisposed to diabetes due to a combination of biological and lifestyle factors. They tend to have higher levels of insulin resistance and are more likely to store fat viscerally, which contributes to their increased risk of developing diabetes [^1].
   - "South Asians are predisposed to the development of diabetes due to biologic and lifestyle factors. Furthermore, they experience significant morbidity and mortality from diabetes-related complications" [^2].
   - The propensity for insulin resistance in South Asians is often attributed to genetic factors and the way fat is stored in the body, which is different from other ethnic groups [^3].

2. **Black Ethnicities and Diabetes:**
   - While the search results did not provide specific articles on Black ethnicities, it is generally understood from existing literature that Black individuals face a higher risk of diabetes due to genetic predispositions, socio-economic factors, and access to healthcare.
   - The American Diabetes Association notes that African Americans are disproportionately affected by diabetes, with a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension, which are significant risk factors for diabetes.

## Limitations
The search results provided limited information specifically on Black ethnicities and their predisposition to diabetes. Further research is needed to explore the socio-economic and genetic factors affecting Black populations. Additionally, the data primarily focused on South Asians within the broader category of South East Asians, which may not fully represent the diversity within this group.
