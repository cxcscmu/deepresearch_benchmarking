Anxiety can significantly impact relationships with family and friends by causing strain and stress. Individuals with anxiety may have difficulty regulating emotions, leading to more frequent and intense arguments. They might also withdraw from social interactions, become overly dependent, controlling, or avoidant, which can further isolate them and affect their relationships negatively.
