If inflation rises, it can lead to a reduction in purchasing power, meaning consumers can buy less with the same amount of money. It may also result in higher interest rates as central banks attempt to curb spending by making borrowing more expensive. Additionally, inflation can increase home values and home equity, but it can also disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, especially if caused by factors like oil supply shocks.
