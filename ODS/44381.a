## Detailed Findings

1. **Arguments for the Death Penalty**:

   - Amnesty International argues that the death penalty breaches fundamental human rights, particularly the right to life and the right to live free from torture [^3].
   - The Equal Justice Initiative highlights that the death penalty distracts from effective public safety policies and influences the election of judges and prosecutors by emphasizing a "tough on crime" stance [^4].
   - The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) states that the death penalty is contrary to human dignity and does not lead to justice, emphasizing its incompatibility with the right to life [^5].

3. **Human Rights Perspective**:
   - The International Commission against the Death Penalty argues that the death penalty violates the most basic human rights, including the right not to be subjected to torture [^6].
