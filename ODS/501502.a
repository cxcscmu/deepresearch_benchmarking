The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted student learning and development, leading to notable learning loss and increased mental health challenges. School closures and the shift to hybrid or virtual learning environments adversely affected student achievement, motivation, and morale. On average, students lost about half a grade level in math and a quarter of a grade level in reading. Additionally, the pandemic highlighted inadequacies in addressing students' mental health and social-emotional development.
