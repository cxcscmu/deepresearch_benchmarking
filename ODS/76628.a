Social media helps communication by allowing people to connect across geographical, cultural, and linguistic boundaries, creating an interconnected community. It facilitates quick conversations and the easy relay of information, enabling users to share opinions and experiences with a wider audience. However, it can also lead to more superficial interactions and reduced face-to-face communication.
