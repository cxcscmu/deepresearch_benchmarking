The major differences between higher education in China and the United States include the focus on memorization versus inquiry-based learning, with China emphasizing rote memorization and the U.S. increasingly adopting inquiry-based approaches. American universities tend to be more autonomous compared to their Chinese counterparts. Additionally, the cost of attending college is generally higher in the U.S. than in China. Classroom dynamics also differ, with Chinese education traditionally focusing on memorization.
