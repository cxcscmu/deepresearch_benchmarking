Slavery was a central issue that led to the Civil War, with most professional historians agreeing that it was at the heart of the crisis that plunged the United States into conflict. The primary catalyst for secession was slavery, particularly the Southern political leaders' resistance to Northern antislavery political forces. The Civil War ultimately led to the liberation of enslaved people, although the initial aim was the preservation of the Union rather than the abolition of slavery.
