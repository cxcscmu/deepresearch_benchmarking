## Methodology

To gather insights into why people vote Republican, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on Google and Reddit, and consulted reputable sources such as Wikipedia, Pew Research, and academic articles. The search focused on understanding the motivations and demographic trends associated with Republican voters.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Policies and Business Interests**: The Republican Party has long been associated with pro-business policies, advocating for low taxes, deregulation, and supply-side economics. This economic stance appeals to voters who prioritize economic growth and believe in the efficiency of private spending over government intervention. "Modern Republicans advocate the theory of supply-side economics, which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth" [^1].

2. **Social Conservatism and Cultural Values**: Social issues play a significant role in attracting voters to the Republican Party. The party's positions on issues such as abortion, gun rights, and immigration resonate with socially conservative voters. "On social issues, it advocates for restricting abortion, supports tough on crime policies, such as capital punishment and the prohibition of recreational drug use, promotes gun ownership and easing gun restrictions, and opposes transgender rights" [^2].

3. **Demographic Trends**: The Republican Party's core support comes from specific demographic groups, including rural voters, White Southerners, evangelical Christians, and individuals without college degrees. These groups often align with the party's cultural and economic policies. "In the 21st century, the Republican Party receives its strongest support from rural voters, White Southerners, evangelical Christians, men, senior citizens, and voters without college degrees" [^3].
