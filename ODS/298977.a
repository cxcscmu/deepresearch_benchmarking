Fashion has changed over time due to globalization, technology, social media, and cultural influences. These factors have led to a rapid evolution in the fashion industry, with trends shifting from the rebellious flapper dresses of the 1920s to the tech-driven, inclusive designs of the 2020s. Fashion is also influenced by geography, culture, and tradition, resulting in diverse styles around the world.
