The 9/11 terrorist attacks led to increased federal support for state and local first responders by highlighting the need for enhanced capabilities to respond to all hazards, including terrorist attacks. This resulted in efforts by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the all-hazards capabilities of first responders, as noted in the GAO report on DHS' efforts. Additionally, the attacks underscored the importance of effective communication and coordination among public safety agencies, prompting initiatives to improve public safety communications.
