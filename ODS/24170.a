Preventing school shootings involves a combination of strategies, including implementing strong gun safety measures, identifying and supporting students in crisis, and educating communities to recognize warning signs. Schools can play a crucial role by creating supportive environments and having threat assessment protocols in place. Additionally, organizations like Sandy Hook Promise emphasize the importance of empowering youth and adults to prevent violence by knowing the signs and taking action.
