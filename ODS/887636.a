Religion has changed over time in several ways. In the United States, the proportion of adults identifying as Christians has decreased from about 90% in the early 1990s to around two-thirds today. Globally, the religious landscape is shifting due to differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations, affecting the growth and decline of various religious groups. Additionally, the importance of religion has declined among older Americans, particularly those aged 65 and over.
