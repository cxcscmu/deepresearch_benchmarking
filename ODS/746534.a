Alliances contributed to the start of World War I by transforming a local conflict into a global war. When countries were bound by alliances, they were obligated to support their allies in the event of a conflict. This meant that when a war broke out between two nations, allied countries were drawn into the conflict, escalating it into a larger war involving multiple nations. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered these alliances, leading to a chain reaction that resulted in World War I.
