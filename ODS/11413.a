Medicare Advantage plans are heavily advertised and promoted because they offer extra benefits such as reduced cost-sharing, dental coverage, gym memberships, and debit cards for over-the-counter purchases. Additionally, these plans are funded by the federal government, which pays the carriers, allowing for low or nonexistent premiums. This funding structure incentivizes the promotion of Medicare Advantage plans.
