Vaccinated people represent a larger share of COVID-19 deaths now compared to earlier in the pandemic, but this does not necessarily mean they are dying at higher rates than unvaccinated individuals. The increase in the share of deaths among vaccinated people is partly due to the higher overall vaccination rates and the fact that vaccines, while effective, are not 100% protective, especially without booster doses. Unvaccinated individuals remain at a higher risk of severe outcomes, including death, from COVID-19.
