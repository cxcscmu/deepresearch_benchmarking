Jesus' followers today face similar opposition in various forms, such as relational challenges, including derogatory comments from family or friends, as well as broader societal rejection and persecution. These experiences mirror the opposition Jesus faced, as his teachings often led to misunderstanding and rejection by his own people. Followers are encouraged to respond with humility and love, following the example set by Jesus.
