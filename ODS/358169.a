# Stone Age Life: An Analytical Overview

## Executive Summary

The Stone Age, a prehistoric period characterized by the use of stone tools, represents a significant portion of human history. Life during this era was primarily focused on survival, with humans living as hunter-gatherers before transitioning to agriculture. The period is divided into three main phases: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each marked by advancements in tool-making and societal organization. This report delves into the lifestyle, societal structures, and technological advancements of Stone Age humans.

The search focused on gathering detailed information about the Stone Age lifestyle, societal norms, and technological advancements. Tools such as Google Scholar and educational platforms like Study.com were utilized to ensure a broad and accurate representation of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Lifestyle and Survival:**
   - Stone Age humans were primarily hunter-gatherers, focusing on procuring food and shelter. "People living in the Stone Age had two main concerns â€“ food and shelter. People in the Stone Age were hunter-gatherers" [^1]. This lifestyle was dictated by the need to adapt to harsh environmental conditions and limited resources.

2. **Life Expectancy and Health:**

The life expectancy of humans was around 20-40 years old, and many died from illness, poor hygiene, and..." [^2]. This was compounded by the lack of modern medical knowledge and practices.

3. **Technological and Societal Advancements:**
   - The Stone Age saw significant technological advancements, particularly in tool-making. "The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make stone tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface" [^3]. These tools were essential for hunting, building shelters, and later, in agricultural practices.
