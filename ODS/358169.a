Life in the Stone Age was primarily focused on survival, with people living as hunter-gatherers. They moved frequently in search of food, leading a nomadic lifestyle. Life was harsh, with a low life expectancy of around 20-40 years, and many people died from illness and poor hygiene. Over time, some groups transitioned to a more settled lifestyle with the advent of agriculture, particularly during the Neolithic period.
