The question of whether the government should be responsible for the homeless is a matter of debate. Some sources argue that the government has a responsibility to provide shelter and support for homeless individuals, as highlighted by the need for adequate housing and the role of federal agencies like HUD in funding shelters and housing programs. Others suggest that systemic issues, such as economic policies, contribute to homelessness, implying a governmental responsibility to address these root causes. However, opinions vary, and some argue for fewer laws and decriminalization as potential solutions.
