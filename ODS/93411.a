The healthcare market differs from other markets due to several factors: it involves inherent market failures, such as information asymmetry between clinicians and patients, and the presence of externalities. Additionally, the healthcare product is often ill-defined, and the outcomes of care are uncertain, which complicates the typical supply and demand dynamics seen in ordinary markets.
