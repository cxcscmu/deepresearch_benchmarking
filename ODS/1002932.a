## Detailed Findings

2. **Forms and Identification**: Neglect can manifest in various forms, including the failure to provide adequate supervision, nourishment, or medical care.

3. **Impact on Development**: The consequences of neglect are profound, affecting both physical and mental health. "Neglect can affect the body physically by affecting a child's development and health, sometimes leading to chronic medical problems" [^3].
