Lowering the voting age to 16 is advocated to make the electoral system more inclusive and to strengthen democracies by bridging the gap between young people and decision-makers. Proponents argue that it can enhance youth engagement and representation in political processes, as young people are affected by political decisions and should have a say in them. Additionally, research suggests that common assumptions against lowering the voting age are unfounded, supporting the idea that 16-year-olds are capable of informed voting.
