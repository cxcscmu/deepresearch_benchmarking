## Methodology
To compile this report, a targeted search was conducted using online databases and educational resources. The search focused on identifying reputable sources that discuss government policies and strategies to reduce unemployment. Tools such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, and educational websites were utilized to gather diverse perspectives and expert opinions.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Stimulating Aggregate Demand**: One of the primary methods to combat cyclical unemployment is by stimulating aggregate demand. This can be achieved through expansionary fiscal policies, such as increasing government spending and reducing taxes. "The goal of expansionary fiscal policy is to reduce unemployment. Therefore the tools would be an increase in government spending and/or a decrease in taxes" [^3].

2. **Investing in Education and Training**: Long-term unemployment can be addressed by equipping the workforce with necessary skills. "Policies such as apprenticeship schemes aim to provide the unemployed with the new skills they need to find fresh employment and to improve the incentives to work" [^5]. Additionally, vocational education and training are emphasized as crucial for equipping individuals with market-relevant skills [^8].

3. **Public Works and Wage Subsidies**: Governments can also implement public works programs and offer wage subsidies to encourage businesses to hire more employees. "Consider policies like wage subsidies or incentives for hiring new employees to encourage job creation by businesses" [^4]. These measures can provide immediate employment opportunities and stimulate economic activity.
