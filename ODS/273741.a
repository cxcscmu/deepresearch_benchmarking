Governments can reduce unemployment through expansionary fiscal policies, which involve increasing government spending and decreasing taxes to boost aggregate demand and economic growth. Additionally, investing in training schemes and education, improving geographical mobility, targeting high unemployment areas, and funding infrastructure projects are effective strategies. Active labor market policies, such as public employment services, training, and subsidized employment, can also help reduce unemployment in the short run.
