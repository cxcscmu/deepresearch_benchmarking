Redlining continues to affect people today by contributing to health inequities and economic disparities in historically marginalized communities. It is linked to increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, and early mortality due to heart disease. Additionally, redlined neighborhoods often experience poorer environmental quality, higher poverty rates, and reduced access to healthcare and educational opportunities. These factors collectively perpetuate the cycle of disadvantage in these communities.
