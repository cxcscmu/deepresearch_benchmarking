## Detailed Findings

1. **Emotional Transfer and Compassion Fatigue**: Working with distressed individuals can lead to emotional transfer, where the caregiver absorbs the emotional state of the person they are helping. This can result in compassion fatigue, a condition characterized by emotional exhaustion and a reduced ability to empathize with others. "Working with a distressed individual can lead to emotional transfer and compassion fatigue, impacting your own well-being" [^1].

2. **Psychological and Physical Symptoms**: Caregivers may experience a range of psychological and physical symptoms due to the stress of supporting distressed individuals. These symptoms can include increased anxiety, headaches, and elevated blood pressure. "Possible impact, e.g. role/responsibilities, increased emotion, trauma, headaches, stress/anxiety, own distress, raised blood pressure, breathing" [^2].

3. **Negative Self-Perception and Mental Health**: Over time, caregivers may develop a negative self-perception and experience a decline in mental health. This can manifest as feelings of inadequacy and decreased job satisfaction. "Over a period of time, working with a person who is distressed may lead the care worker to feel negative about themselves. Their mental health may be affected" [^3].
