# Report on Nurse Practitioners as Primary Care Providers

## Executive Summary

Nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly recognized as primary care providers (PCPs) across the United States. This shift is driven by the growing demand for healthcare services, especially in underserved and rural areas. NPs are advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) who have the training and qualifications to perform many of the same functions as physicians in primary care settings. This report explores the acceptance and role of nurse practitioners as primary care providers.

## Methodology

To gather information on the acceptance of nurse practitioners as primary care providers, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search focused on articles, position statements, and policy documents from reputable healthcare organizations and associations. Key search terms included "nurse practitioners as primary care providers," "scope of practice for NPs," and "NPs in primary care." The search was conducted using Google and specific healthcare-related websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Recognition in Statutes**: Some states have explicitly recognized nurse practitioners as primary care providers in their statutes. This legal recognition allows NPs to serve as PCPs, which includes providing comprehensive care to populations [^1].

2. **Role in Primary Care**: Millions of Americans choose nurse practitioners as their primary care providers. NPs are equipped to perform annual checkups, prescribe medications, and conduct diagnostic tests, making them a viable option for primary care [^2].

3. **Contribution to Healthcare Access**: Nurse practitioners are more likely than physicians to practice in rural and underserved areas, thereby increasing access to primary care services for these populations. This is particularly important as 85% of NPs practice in primary care settings [^3].

## Limitations

The report is based on available online resources and may not capture the most recent changes in state laws or healthcare policies regarding nurse practitioners. Additionally, the acceptance of NPs as primary care providers can vary significantly by state and healthcare system, which may not be fully reflected in the sources reviewed. Further research, including interviews with healthcare professionals and policymakers, could provide more comprehensive insights.
