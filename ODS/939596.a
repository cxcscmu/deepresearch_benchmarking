# Report on the Increase in Used Car Prices

## Executive Summary

In 2025, used car prices have been on the rise due to a combination of factors including increased demand, tariffs on new vehicles, and historical trends from the pandemic era. This report explores the reasons behind the surge in used car prices, providing insights from various industry experts and recent market analyses.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and news outlets. The search focused on recent articles and expert opinions regarding the used car market in 2025. Key sources included reputable automotive news sites, financial analysis platforms, and expert commentary from industry leaders.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Demand Shift from New to Used Cars**: As new car prices increase, largely due to tariffs, consumers are turning to the used car market. This shift in demand is causing used car prices to rise. According to Kelley Blue Book, "Tariffs will likely raise the prices of new vehicles and indirectly impact used cars" [^1].

2. **Impact of Tariffs**: The introduction of tariffs on new cars by President Donald Trump's administration has been a significant factor. Experts at Kelley Blue Book suggest that this policy could lead to a spike in demand for used cars, as consumers seek more affordable alternatives [^2].

3. **Historical Context and Market Dynamics**: The pandemic's impact on the automotive industry continues to influence current market conditions. Brauer from TheStreet notes, “During the pandemic, new car prices spiked when automotive factories closed, and production fell short of demand” [^3]. This historical context has set a precedent for current market behaviors.
