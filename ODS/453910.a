The question of whether all vaccines for all diseases should be mandatory is complex and depends on various factors, including the magnitude of the health problem and the nature of the disease. While no US federal laws mandate vaccination, all 50 states require certain vaccinations for children entering public schools. The justification for mandatory vaccination typically considers the severity and transmissibility of the disease, as well as public health benefits.
