Literature changes the way we think by altering our perceptions and actions, making us aware of new perspectives and possibilities. It helps us cope with current and future challenges by reshaping how we view ourselves and the world, and it plays a significant role in shaping our cultural identity. Literature also inspires, motivates, and exposes us to new thoughts and ideas, thereby increasing our knowledge and understanding.
