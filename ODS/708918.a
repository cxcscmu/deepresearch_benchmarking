If democracy were to end, various scenarios could unfold. According to the Seattle Times, there might be political paralysis or attempts by leaders to seize power through undemocratic means. The DGAP suggests that the end of democracy in the U.S. could lead to American isolationism, impacting global alliances like the European Union. Additionally, a lack of democracy could result in restricted freedoms, prompting individuals to seek more open societies, as noted by the Common Reader. Overall, the absence of democracy could lead to significant changes in governance, personal freedoms, and international relations.
