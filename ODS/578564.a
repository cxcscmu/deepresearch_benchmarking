The question of whether the Electoral College should be reformed is a topic of debate. Many sources, including the Brookings Institution and the Brennan Center for Justice, argue for its abolition in favor of a direct popular vote. A Pew Research survey from September 2024 indicates that 63% of U.S. adults favor changing the system so that the winner of the popular vote becomes president. These perspectives suggest significant support for reforming or eliminating the Electoral College.
