Companies become platform leaders primarily through two strategies: "coring" and "tipping." Coring involves creating a new platform by developing a set of techniques that establish a core product or service as essential. Tipping refers to strategies that shift the market towards the company's platform, often by leveraging network effects and partnerships to create an ecosystem of innovation.
