The 2000 U.S. presidential election was controversial primarily due to the disputed results in Florida, which ultimately decided the election. The controversy centered around issues with ballot design, such as "hanging chads" and "butterfly ballots," and the subsequent recount process. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore effectively halted the Florida recount, awarding the state's electoral votes to George W. Bush, despite Al Gore winning the popular vote nationwide.
