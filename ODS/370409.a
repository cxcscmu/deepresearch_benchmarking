Dealing with drug problems involves a combination of strategies, including counseling, lifestyle changes, and treatment options such as medicines and therapy. Early intervention, such as a conversation with a healthcare professional, can be crucial for those in the early stages of substance use issues. Programs that balance risk and protective factors, as well as tools like naloxone distribution and drug courts, are also effective in reducing harm and supporting recovery.
