Paraphilias are more common in men due to a combination of biological, psychological, and cultural factors. Biologically, there may be differences in male and female sexual arousal patterns and hormonal influences. Culturally, societal norms and expectations may also play a role in the expression and reporting of paraphilic interests. Additionally, psychological factors such as personality traits and experiences can contribute to the prevalence of paraphilias in men.
