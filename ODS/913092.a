Funerals are changing for the younger generation as they show a preference for experiences and traditional burial over cremation, unlike older generations. Millennials and Gen Z are driving these changes by pre-planning funerals, seeking clarity and control in funeral planning, and utilizing crowdsourcing for funeral funding. They are also contributing to a shift in cultural norms by engaging in open dialogues about death, which is part of the "death positive" movement.
