# Capital Punishment: Ethical Considerations

## Executive Summary

The ethicality of capital punishment remains a contentious issue, with arguments both for and against its use. Proponents argue that it serves as a necessary deterrent and a form of justice for heinous crimes, while opponents view it as an inhumane practice that violates fundamental human rights. This report explores various perspectives on the ethics of capital punishment, drawing from philosophical, moral, and human rights viewpoints.

## Methodology

To address the question of whether capital punishment is ethical, a comprehensive search was conducted using online academic resources, ethical discussion platforms, and human rights organizations' publications. The search focused on gathering diverse perspectives, including philosophical arguments, public opinion data, and human rights considerations. Key sources were selected based on their relevance and authority in the field.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Moral Obligation and Justice**: Some argue that capital punishment is justified as a moral obligation to protect society. According to Santa Clara University, "Capital punishment is often defended on the grounds that society has a moral obligation to protect the safety and welfare of its citizens" [^1]. This perspective suggests that executing murderers is a way to ensure justice and deter future crimes.

2. **Human Rights Violations**: Opponents of the death penalty, such as Amnesty International, argue that it is "the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment" and oppose it in all cases without exception [^2]. This view is supported by The Lancet, which states that "The death penalty is inhumane and violates the fundamental right to life" [^3]. These arguments emphasize the ethical issues related to human rights and the sanctity of life.

3. **Public Opinion and Ethical Concerns**: Public opinion on the death penalty is shifting, with a significant portion of Americans viewing it as morally unacceptable. According to a report, "The percentage of Americans who consider the death penalty morally unacceptable was 38%, remaining near the record high of 40% set in 2020" [^4]. This shift reflects growing ethical concerns about the fairness and application of capital punishment.
