The ethics of capital punishment is a highly debated topic with differing perspectives. Some argue that it is justified as a means of protecting society and that offenders forfeit their right to life through their actions. Others contend that it is inhumane, violates fundamental human rights, and is disproportionate, especially for lesser crimes. Organizations like Amnesty International oppose it in all cases, labeling it as cruel and degrading. Ultimately, whether capital punishment is ethical depends on one's moral framework and the values they prioritize.
