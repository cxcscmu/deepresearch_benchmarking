# Report on the Short-term and Long-term Causes of World War I

## Executive Summary

World War I, which began in 1914, was the result of a complex interplay of long-term and short-term causes. The long-term causes include militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism, while the short-term causes revolve around the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent diplomatic crises. This report delves into these causes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors that led to one of the most devastating conflicts in human history.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including educational websites, historical databases, and scholarly articles. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "long-term causes of WWI," "short-term causes of WWI," and "origins of World War I." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a broad and reliable collection of information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Long-term Causes:**
   - **Militarism:** The arms race among European powers created a tense environment. As David Stevenson notes, "A self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness... was an essential element in the conjuncture that led to disaster" [^1].
   - **Alliances:** The complex web of alliances, such as the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, meant that a conflict involving one power could quickly involve others. This interconnectedness is highlighted in various historical analyses [^2].
   - **Imperialism and Nationalism:** The competition for colonies and the rise of nationalistic fervor contributed to international tensions. The decline of the Ottoman Empire also created a power vacuum that exacerbated these tensions [^3].

2. **Short-term Causes:**
   - **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand:** The immediate trigger for the war was the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir by a Bosnian Serb nationalist. This event set off a chain reaction of alliances being activated [^4].
   - **July Crisis:** The diplomatic crisis following the assassination involved miscommunications and rapid escalations, leading to declarations of war [^5].
