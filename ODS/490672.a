Universal healthcare in Europe generally involves a system where healthcare is provided to a high percentage of citizens, often funded and managed by the government through taxation. Most European countries offer universal health care, which means that medical services are available to all citizens, often free of charge or at a reduced cost. In some cases, patients may need to pay for certain services, but the overall system ensures broad access to healthcare for residents.
