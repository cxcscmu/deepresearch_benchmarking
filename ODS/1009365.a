# Report on the Beginning of the American Civil War

## Executive Summary

The American Civil War, a pivotal conflict in United States history, began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. This marked the culmination of escalating tensions between the Northern and Southern states, primarily over the issues of slavery and states' rights. The war lasted until 1865, resulting in significant casualties and the eventual abolition of slavery.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including government websites, educational platforms, and historical databases. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "American Civil War beginning," "Fort Sumter," and "Civil War causes." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. The conflict officially began when "Confederate forces opened fire on the Union-held Fort Sumter" in the early hours of April 12, 1861 [^1]. This attack was the result of months of tension over the fort's status, as it was a Union stronghold in the seceded state of South Carolina.

2. The broader causes of the Civil War included "uncompromising differences between the free and slave states over the power of the national government to prohibit slavery in the territories that had not yet become states" [^2]. The election of Abraham Lincoln, who opposed the expansion of slavery, further exacerbated these tensions.

3. The immediate aftermath of the attack on Fort Sumter saw a surge in military enlistment and the secession of additional Southern states. "On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to field 75,000 volunteer troops for 90 days," which was quickly met by the Union states [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may present varying interpretations of historical events. Additionally, the complexity of the Civil War's causes and its extensive historiography mean that this report provides only a high-level overview. Further research into primary sources and scholarly analyses would provide a more nuanced understanding of the war's origins.
