Thinking, intelligence, and creativity are related but distinct constructs. Intelligence and creativity are moderately and positively correlated, suggesting they share a common cognitive basis. However, they are separate skills, with intelligence often seen as a necessary but not sufficient condition for high creativity. Some theories, like the threshold theory, propose that beyond a certain level of intelligence, the correlation with creativity diminishes.
