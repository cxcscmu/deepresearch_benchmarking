Nostalgia is a sentimental longing for the past, often triggered by memories of meaningful or positive experiences. It can be most prominent during challenging times and serves to remind individuals of their authentic selves, providing a sense of love, protection, and reduced anxiety. This emotional response helps people feel more secure and connected to their past.
