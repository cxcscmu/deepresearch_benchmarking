Chemical weapons are banned because they are considered morally reprehensible and lack a legitimate military purpose, being primarily effective against civilians. Their use is a violation of international law, as outlined in agreements like the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibit their use, development, production, and stockpiling.
