# Report on the Ban of Chemical Weapons

## Executive Summary

Chemical weapons are banned globally due to their devastating humanitarian impact, lack of military efficacy, and the moral repugnance associated with their use. The international community has established treaties such as the Geneva Protocol and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to prohibit their use, development, and stockpiling. These measures are enforced by organizations like the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which plays a crucial role in monitoring compliance and facilitating the destruction of existing stockpiles.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including reputable news articles, official organizational websites, and educational platforms. The search focused on historical treaties, international law, and the roles of key organizations in the prohibition of chemical weapons. Tools such as Google Search and academic databases were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Moral and Humanitarian Concerns**: Chemical weapons are considered morally hideous due to their indiscriminate nature and the severe suffering they cause to civilians. "The world banned chemical weapons. Yes, it's because they're morally hideous. But it's also because they don't work" [^1]. This highlights the dual rationale behind the ban: ethical considerations and practical ineffectiveness.

2. **Lack of Military Utility**: Chemical weapons are deemed ineffective for legitimate military purposes. They are primarily effective against civilians, which undermines their utility in achieving strategic military objectives. "Chemical weapons are only really effective against civilians and lack a legitimate military purpose now" [^2].

3. **International Legal Framework**: The Geneva Protocol of 1925 and the Chemical Weapons Convention are pivotal in the legal prohibition of chemical weapons. The CWC, which came into force in 1997, prohibits the use, development, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, with strict verification measures. "The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)...prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and the large-scale development, production, stockpiling, or transfer of chemical weapons or their precursors" [^3].
