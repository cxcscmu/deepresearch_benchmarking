Information systems are vulnerable to destruction, error, and abuse due to several factors, including cyber-attacks, system vulnerabilities, and human exploitation. Additionally, the interconnected nature of computer networks exposes them to unauthorized access, and poorly coded software can introduce malicious code into systems. Lack of proper security and controls further compromises these systems, leading to potential data breaches and other security issues.
