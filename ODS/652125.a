# Report: Environmental Impact of Gasoline Cars

## Executive Summary
Gasoline-powered vehicles significantly contribute to environmental pollution and climate change. The combustion of gasoline in cars releases a variety of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, which have detrimental effects on air quality and global warming. This report examines the specific pollutants emitted by gasoline cars and their impact on the environment.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and authoritative sources related to environmental science and automotive emissions. The search focused on identifying the key pollutants emitted by gasoline vehicles and their environmental impacts. Sources included government websites, environmental organizations, and reputable media outlets.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Air Pollution and Toxic Emissions**: Gasoline combustion in vehicles releases several harmful byproducts, including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, benzene, and formaldehyde. These substances contribute to air pollution and pose health risks to humans and wildlife [^1].

2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Gasoline vehicles emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), all of which are potent greenhouse gases. These emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change [^2].

3. **Contribution to Smog and Air Quality Degradation**: Vehicles are a major source of air pollution in the United States, producing about one-third of all air pollutants. The emissions from gasoline cars contribute to the formation of smog, which affects air quality and visibility [^3].

## Limitations
This report is based on data available up to October 2023, and some sources may have been updated since then. Additionally, the report focuses on general trends and impacts without delving into specific regional variations or technological advancements in emission reduction. Further research could explore the latest innovations in reducing vehicle emissions and their effectiveness.
