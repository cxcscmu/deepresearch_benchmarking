Gas cars are bad for the environment primarily because burning gasoline and diesel fuel releases harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, benzene, and formaldehyde. These emissions contribute to air pollution and climate change, with carbon dioxide being a significant greenhouse gas that leads to global warming. Additionally, gasoline consumption results in the release of toxic vapors that further degrade air quality.
