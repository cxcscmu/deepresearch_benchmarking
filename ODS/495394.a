The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Dickens poverty A Christmas Carol" and "themes of poverty in A Christmas Carol." The tools used included Google Search and academic databases to access articles, study guides, and educational PDFs.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Sympathetic Attitude Towards the Poor**: Dickens is noted for his sympathetic portrayal of the poor, viewing them as victims of circumstance. According to QuickLits, "Dickens has a very sympathetic attitude towards the poor in A Christmas Carol. He views them as victims of circumstance, not as lazy people who refuse to work" [^1]. This perspective challenges the prevailing attitudes of the time, which often blamed the poor for their own misfortunes.

2. **Representation Through Characters**: The Cratchit family is a central example of poverty in the novella. As noted by Save My Exams, "Dickens shows the family's poverty and vulnerability through Mrs Cratchit's frugal choices: She makes their Christmas dinner go further by..." [^2]. This depiction highlights the daily struggles and resilience of poor families.

3. **Symbolism of Ignorance and Want**: Dickens uses the characters of Ignorance and Want to symbolize the dire consequences of poverty. The BBC Bitesize guide explains, "Dickens uses two wretched children, called Ignorance and Want, to represent the poor. a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted..." [^3]. These characters serve as a stark reminder of the societal neglect of the impoverished.
