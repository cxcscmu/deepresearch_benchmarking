Charles Dickens presents poverty in "A Christmas Carol" with a sympathetic attitude, portraying the poor as victims of circumstance rather than as lazy individuals. He uses characters like the Cratchit family to illustrate the struggles and frugality of the poor, and employs symbolic figures such as the children Ignorance and Want to highlight the dire consequences of poverty and social neglect. Through these depictions, Dickens emphasizes the vulnerability and hardships faced by the impoverished, urging readers to recognize and address social injustices.
