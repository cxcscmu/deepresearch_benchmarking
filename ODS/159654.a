# Report on the Use of Ivermectin for COVID-19

## Executive Summary

Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, has gained attention as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Despite its popularity in some circles, the scientific community and health authorities have largely dismissed its efficacy against COVID-19. This report explores the reasons behind its use, the scientific evidence available, and the stance of health authorities on the matter.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and reputable news sources. The search focused on articles and studies discussing ivermectin's use for COVID-19, its perceived benefits, and the scientific community's response. Key sources included the FDA, BBC, The New York Times, and peer-reviewed journals.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Popularity and Misconceptions**: Ivermectin has been touted as a "miracle" drug by some groups, particularly those opposing vaccines. This perception is partly due to misinformation and the desire for alternative treatments. The BBC reported that "Ivermectin has been called a Covid 'miracle' drug, championed by vaccine opponents" [^1].

2. **Scientific Evidence**: The scientific community has largely found no substantial evidence supporting ivermectin's efficacy in treating COVID-19. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that "treatment with ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of Covid-19" [^2].

3. **Health Authorities' Stance**: The FDA has not authorized ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment, emphasizing the lack of evidence supporting its use. According to the FDA, "There continues to be interest in a drug called ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in humans. The FDA has not authorized..." [^3].
