# Report: Why Britain Left the European Union

## Executive Summary

The United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit," was the result of a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors. Key motivations included concerns over national sovereignty, economic considerations, and a rising tide of nationalism. The referendum held on June 23, 2016, resulted in a narrow majority voting to leave, leading to the UK's formal exit on January 31, 2020. This decision has had profound implications for the UK and the EU, affecting trade, immigration, and political dynamics.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, news reports, and official documents. The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases. The search focused on understanding the motivations behind the Brexit vote and the subsequent political and economic impacts.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Sovereignty and National Identity**: A significant factor driving the Brexit vote was the desire to reclaim national sovereignty. Many voters felt that decisions affecting the UK should be made domestically rather than in Brussels. "Nearly half (49%) of leave voters said the biggest single reason for wanting to leave the European Union was 'the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK'" [^1].

2. **Economic Concerns**: Economic arguments played a crucial role in the Brexit debate. Proponents of leaving the EU argued that the UK could benefit economically by negotiating its own trade deals and reducing contributions to the EU budget. However, studies projected that Brexit would exacerbate regional economic inequality in the UK, hitting already-struggling regions the hardest [^2].

3. **Immigration and Nationalism**: Rising nationalist sentiment and concerns over immigration were also pivotal. The end of free movement was seen as a way to control immigration more effectively. "Rising nationalist sentiment, coupled with concerns over the economy and British sovereignty, led the majority of voters in the U.K. to vote to leave the EU" [^3].
