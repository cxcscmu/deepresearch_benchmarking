Britain left the European Union primarily due to a referendum held in June 2016, where 52% of voters chose to leave. Key reasons for the decision included concerns over national sovereignty, immigration control, and dissatisfaction with EU regulations and financial contributions. The process, known as Brexit, was driven by a desire for the UK to regain control over its laws and borders.
