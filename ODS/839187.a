The view of independence and interdependence varies across societies. In many Western societies, independence is often valued as an important virtue, emphasizing self-reliance and personal decision-making. Conversely, interdependence is seen as the degree to which individuals perceive themselves as connected to others, fostering mutual support and collaboration. Different cultural contexts may prioritize these concepts differently, balancing personal autonomy with collective responsibility.
