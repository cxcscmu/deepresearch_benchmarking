The League of Nations failed primarily because it was too weak to enforce disarmament, collective security, and negotiation. It struggled to take decisive action, as seen in its inability to intervene effectively in events like the occupation of Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of Abyssinia by Italy in 1935. Additionally, the worldwide economic depression led countries to prioritize their own interests over global peace, further undermining the League's authority and effectiveness.
