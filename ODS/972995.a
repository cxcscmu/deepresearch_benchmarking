# Report: Reasons for the Failure of the League of Nations

## Executive Summary

The League of Nations, established after World War I to maintain global peace and prevent future conflicts, ultimately failed to achieve its objectives. The League's inability to enforce its resolutions, lack of authority, and the prioritization of national interests over collective security were significant factors contributing to its downfall. This report explores these reasons in detail, drawing from various historical analyses and sources.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and educational resources. The search focused on reputable historical websites, educational platforms, and scholarly articles. Key search terms included "League of Nations failure," "reasons for League of Nations collapse," and "historical analysis of League of Nations." The findings were synthesized from multiple sources to provide a well-rounded understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Weak Enforcement Mechanisms**: The League of Nations lacked the power to enforce its decisions, which severely undermined its authority. As noted by History on the Net, "it was too weak to enforce disarmament, collective security and negotiation"[^1]. This weakness was evident in its failure to act decisively in major international conflicts.

2. **Member Nations' Self-Interest**: The global economic depression of the 1930s led countries to prioritize their own interests over international cooperation. According to Quizlet, "the worldwide economic depression made countries' self-interests their priorities, rather than world peace"[^2]. This shift in focus weakened the League's ability to function as a unified body.

3. **Lack of Seriousness and Commitment**: The League was not taken seriously by its member states, which often acted independently and selfishly. A discussion on Reddit highlights that "the League failed because it was not taken seriously enough"[^3]. This lack of commitment from powerful nations further eroded the League's credibility and effectiveness.

## Limitations

This report is based on secondary sources and interpretations of historical events, which may vary in perspective. The lack of primary source analysis limits the depth of understanding of the internal dynamics of the League. Additionally, the report relies on the availability of online resources, which may not cover all aspects of the League's operations and challenges comprehensively. Further research, including primary documents from the League's archives, would provide a more detailed insight into its failures.
