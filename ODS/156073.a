## Detailed Findings

1. **Military Intervention Ordered by Hoover**: President Hoover ordered the U.S. Army to clear the Bonus Army's campsite. This decision was executed by Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur, who led a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by tanks, to evict the veterans and their families. The operation involved the use of tear gas and resulted in the burning of the veterans' shelters [^1].

2. **Hoover's Justification and Political Consequences**: Hoover justified the military intervention by claiming that a minority of the marchers were communists and criminals, which he believed justified the use of force. However, this action proved politically disastrous for Hoover, contributing to his loss in the 1932 presidential election to Franklin D. Roosevelt [^2].

3. **Public and Governmental Reaction**: The public reaction to Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army was largely negative. The violent dispersal of the veterans, many of whom were unemployed and desperate, was seen as a harsh and unsympathetic response. This incident highlighted Hoover's reluctance to provide direct relief during the Great Depression, further damaging his public image [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may contain biases or inaccuracies. Additionally, the lack of direct quotes from primary sources such as government documents or personal accounts from the veterans themselves limits the depth of analysis. Further research into archival materials and firsthand accounts would provide a more nuanced understanding of the events.
