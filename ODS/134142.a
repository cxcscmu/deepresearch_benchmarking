Climate change cannot be completely fixed, but it can be slowed and its impacts mitigated. Major actions, such as drastically reducing fossil fuel consumption and emissions, are necessary to limit global warming and its effects. While we cannot stop global warming overnight, efforts to reduce human emissions and implement new technologies can help manage and reduce its impact.
