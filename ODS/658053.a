The question of whether trial by jury should be abolished is debated, with arguments on both sides. Some sources argue for abolition, suggesting that a judge-based system could be more efficient and effective, as seen in the essay from St. Hugh's College. Others, like the article in Psychology Today, question the jury system's relevance in a polarized society and suggest considering bench trials instead. However, the decision to abolish the jury system would depend on weighing these arguments against the traditional view of juries as a safeguard of liberties.
