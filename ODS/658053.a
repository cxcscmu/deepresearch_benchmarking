## Detailed Findings

1. **Arguments for Abolishing the Jury System:**
   - Some experts argue that the jury system is outdated and inefficient. According to an article in *Psychology Today*, the United States should consider moving away from the standard jury process and instead shift toward "bench trials" where a panel of judges decides a case [^1].
   - A publication from the Office of Justice Programs suggests that while the jury system is seen as a safeguard of liberties, a strong case can be made for its abolition due to inefficiencies and potential biases [^2].
   - An essay from St. Hugh's College argues for replacing juries with a judge-based system to create a more efficient and effective legal process [^3].

2. **Arguments Against Abolishing the Jury System:**
   - On platforms like Quora, some argue that the jury system should not be abolished but rather improved. The system is seen as a critical component of democratic justice, ensuring that a diverse group of peers evaluates the evidence [^4].
   - A Reddit discussion highlights that the unanimous requirement in jury decisions makes them more reliable than a single judge, as it requires consensus among 12 individuals [^5].

3. **Alternative Perspectives:**
   - An article in *The Guardian* suggests that while jury trials are seen as archaic, they should only be abandoned in exceptional cases, indicating a middle ground where the system is retained but reformed [^6].
