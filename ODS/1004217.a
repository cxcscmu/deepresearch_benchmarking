The United Nations faces several challenges in maintaining global security, including geopolitical constraints, structural limitations, geopolitical rivalries, and inadequate funding and resources. Additionally, the organization struggles with political conflicts among member states and the complexity of addressing diverse security threats such as health, environment, crime, migration, and poverty. These issues are compounded by ongoing conflicts in regions like the Gaza Strip, Ukraine, and Sudan.
