# United Nations Challenges in Maintaining Global Security

## Executive Summary

The United Nations (UN) faces a myriad of challenges in maintaining global security, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, structural limitations, and resource constraints. These challenges are compounded by emerging global issues such as climate change, health crises, and socio-economic disparities. This report delves into the specific obstacles the UN encounters in its mission to uphold international peace and security.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and authoritative sources related to the United Nations and global security. The search focused on recent publications and articles to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the information. Key sources included the Crisis Group, United Nations official pages, and academic papers.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Geopolitical Constraints and Rivalries**: The UN's ability to maintain global security is significantly hindered by geopolitical tensions. "The geopolitical constraints on the UN are not new, but their effects on the organisation are intensifying" [^1]. These tensions often lead to deep rifts among major powers, such as Russia and Western countries, affecting the UN's decision-making processes and peacekeeping efforts.

2. **Structural and Resource Limitations**: The UN's structural framework and resource allocation are inadequate to address the complex nature of modern conflicts. "Despite its ambitious goals, the UN faces significant challenges, including structural limitations, geopolitical rivalries, and resource constraints" [^2]. This inadequacy limits the UN's capacity to respond effectively to crises and implement long-term peacebuilding initiatives.

3. **Emerging Global Issues**: The UN is increasingly challenged by non-traditional security threats such as climate change, health pandemics, and socio-economic inequalities. "Once viewed as peripheral security threats, issues of health, environment, crime, migration, poverty, among others are increasingly central to international security" [^3]. These issues require a coordinated international response, which is often difficult to achieve due to varying national interests and priorities.

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of up-to-date information and the inherent bias in sources that may emphasize certain challenges over others. Additionally, the dynamic nature of global politics means that the challenges faced by the UN are constantly evolving, and this report may not capture the most recent developments.
