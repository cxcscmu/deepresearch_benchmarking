# Report on the Effect of Increased Automation on the 'Service Desk' Practice

## Executive Summary

Increased automation in the service desk practice has been a significant trend, impacting how service desks operate and deliver customer service. The primary effects include a reduction in low-level tasks, decreased phone contact, and an enhanced focus on customer experience (CX) when personal interaction is necessary. Automation allows service desk agents to concentrate on more complex issues, thereby improving overall service quality.

## Methodology

To gather information on the effects of increased automation on the service desk practice, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on educational platforms like Quizlet and Brainly, as well as professional resources like DexNova Learning and CertifQ. The search focused on recent and relevant sources to ensure the findings reflect current industry practices.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Reduction in Low-Level Tasks and Phone Contact**: Automation reduces the need for service desk agents to engage in repetitive, low-level tasks. This shift allows them to focus on more complex issues that require human intervention. As one source notes, "The impact on service desks is reduced phone contact, less low-level work, and a greater ability to focus on excellent customer experience when personal contact is needed" [^1].

2. **Enhanced Customer Experience**: With automation handling routine inquiries, service desk agents can dedicate more time to enhancing customer experience during personal interactions. This is echoed in multiple sources, such as, "A greater ability to focus on customer experience when personal contact is needed" [^2].

3. **Focus on Complex Issues**: Automation enables service desk personnel to concentrate on resolving complex issues, which can lead to improved customer satisfaction. According to a source, "Increased automation in service desk practices helps improve customer experience by allowing agents to focus on complex issues" [^3].
