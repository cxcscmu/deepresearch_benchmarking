Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, led to World War II because it prompted Great Britain and France to declare war on Nazi Germany in response to the aggression. This invasion marked the beginning of the conflict as it violated international agreements and demonstrated Germany's expansionist ambitions, leading to a broader war in Europe.
