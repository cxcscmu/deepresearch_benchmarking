## Detailed Findings

1. **The Invasion and Immediate Reactions**: On September 1, 1939, German forces launched a coordinated attack on Poland, utilizing a strategy known as blitzkrieg, which involved rapid and overwhelming force. "German tanks steamrolled into the country. The Luftwaffe destroyed airfields, bombed passenger trains and mowed down civilians indiscriminately" [^1]. This swift and brutal assault caught Poland off guard and led to its quick defeat.

2. **International Response**: The invasion prompted immediate international reactions. "In response to German aggression, Great Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany on September 3, 1939" [^2]. This declaration marked the official start of World War II, as these nations honored their commitments to Poland under mutual defense agreements.

3. **Geopolitical Context and Consequences**: The invasion of Poland was not an isolated event but part of a broader strategy by Nazi Germany to expand its territory and influence. "None of the parties to the conflict—Germany, the Western Allies or the Soviet Union—expected that the German invasion of Poland would lead to a war that would surpass World War I in its scale and cost" [^3]. The invasion set off a chain reaction of military alliances and conflicts that expanded the war across Europe and eventually the world.
