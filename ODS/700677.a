Immigration reform is important because it supports economic growth, keeps families together, and addresses systemic issues affecting immigrants. It provides pathways to legal status and citizenship for undocumented residents, which benefits the economy by increasing the productive capacity and raising GDP. Additionally, reforms can ensure full labor market rights for immigrants, benefiting the entire U.S. economy.
