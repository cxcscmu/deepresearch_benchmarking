## Detailed Findings
1. **Escape with Infant Daughter**: Sojourner Truth escaped slavery in late 1826 with her infant daughter, Sophia. She had to leave her other children behind because they were not legally freed under the emancipation order until they had served as bound servants into their twenties. Truth later recounted, "I did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right" [^1].

2. **Legal Battle for Her Son**: In 1828, Truth went to court to recover her son, Peter, who had been illegally sold to a slave owner in Alabama. She became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man, marking a significant legal victory in her life [^2].

3. **Influence of New York's Gradual Emancipation Law**: The State of New York began legislating the abolition of slavery in 1799, with the process not fully completed until July 4, 1827. Truth's master had promised her freedom a year before the state's emancipation date, but reneged on his promise, prompting her to take action and escape [^3].
