# Report on Rising Petrol Prices

## Executive Summary

Petrol prices have been on the rise due to a combination of factors including supply constraints, increased demand, and geopolitical influences. Recent reports indicate that refinery maintenance, seasonal changes, and fluctuations in crude oil prices are significant contributors to the current increase in petrol prices. Additionally, economic policies such as tariffs have also played a role in influencing these prices.

## Methodology

To gather information on the reasons behind the rise in petrol prices, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search focused on recent articles and reports from reputable sources such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration, GasBuddy, AAA, and Reuters. The search strategy included using keywords like "petrol price rise," "gasoline price increase," and "factors affecting gas prices."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gasoline prices tend to increase when the available gasoline supply decreases relative to real or expected gasoline demand or consumption [^1]. This basic economic principle is a primary driver of price fluctuations.

2. **Seasonal and Maintenance Factors**: AAA reports that several factors are driving the current increase in gas prices, including refinery maintenance and the switch to summer-blend gasoline, which is more expensive to produce [^2]. This seasonal transition often results in temporary price hikes.

3. **Crude Oil Prices and Economic Policies**: A recent oil rally has contributed to higher gas prices, with crude oil prices hovering above $70 per barrel [^3]. Additionally, new tariffs on imports from Canada have raised wholesale gasoline prices in the U.S. Northeast, further impacting pump prices [^4].

## Limitations

The report is based on available data and articles up to April 2025. The dynamic nature of global oil markets and economic policies means that new developments could further influence petrol prices. Additionally, the report relies on secondary sources, which may not capture all nuances of the factors affecting petrol prices. Further primary research and data analysis would be required for a more comprehensive understanding.
