Poverty is caused by a variety of factors, including low wages and unemployment, lack of affordable housing, racism and discrimination, inadequate education and healthcare, inequality and marginalization, conflict, hunger, malnutrition, poor healthcare, lack of access to clean water and nutritious food, and government failures. These factors can vary in significance depending on the region and context.
