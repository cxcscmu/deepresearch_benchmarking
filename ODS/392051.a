Illegal immigration helps America by contributing to the economy in several ways. Undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in taxes annually, with households led by undocumented immigrants contributing $89.8 billion in total taxes in 2023, including $33.9 billion in state and local taxes and $55.8 billion in federal taxes. They also support the U.S. economy by spending billions of dollars per year, which helps create new jobs and increase the productive capacity of the economy. Additionally, because they are ineligible for most federal benefits, they are considered net contributors to programs like Medicare and Social Security.
