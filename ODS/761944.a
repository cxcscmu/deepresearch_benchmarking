## Methodology

To gather information on the theme of corruption in "Animal Farm," I utilized a combination of online literary analysis resources, academic publications, and thematic discussions. The search strategy involved querying terms such as "Animal Farm corruption theme," "power and corruption in Animal Farm," and "George Orwell Animal Farm analysis." The tools used included academic databases, literary analysis websites, and video content platforms.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Corruption Through Power**: The novella demonstrates that "power always corrupts" through its portrayal of the pigs' rise to dominance. Initially, the animals seek to create a utopian society, but the pigs, led by Napoleon, gradually assume control and exploit their power for personal gain [^1].

2. **Betrayal of Ideals**: The pigs' corruption is evident as they begin to adopt human traits and behaviors, such as sleeping in beds and drinking alcohol, which they initially condemned. This shift highlights the betrayal of the original revolutionary ideals and the establishment of a new oppressive regime [^2].

3. **Foreshadowing and Symbolism**: Orwell uses foreshadowing and symbolism to underscore the theme of corruption. The theft of milk and apples by the pigs is an early indication of their selfishness and foreshadows their eventual complete domination over the other animals [^3].
