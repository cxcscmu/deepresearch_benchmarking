Corruption in "Animal Farm" is depicted through the actions of the pigs, who gradually assume more power and privileges at the expense of the other animals. Initially, the pigs steal milk and apples for themselves, and as the story progresses, they begin to sleep in the farmhouse, establish a school for their pig children, and ultimately become indistinguishable from the oppressive humans they replaced. This illustrates the theme that power tends to corrupt, as the pigs' leadership becomes increasingly tyrannical and self-serving.
