# Can 100% Renewable Energy Power the World?

## Executive Summary

The feasibility of powering the world entirely with renewable energy sources is a topic of significant interest and debate. Recent studies and expert analyses suggest that achieving a 100% renewable energy system is not only possible but also increasingly viable with advancements in technology and policy support. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential for a fully renewable global energy system.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and platforms, including YouTube, TED-Ed, Green America, Reddit, and academic publications. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the potential for a 100% renewable energy system. The search strategy included keywords such as "100% renewable energy," "global energy system," and "renewable energy feasibility."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Feasibility and Timeline**: According to a study analyzed by 23 scientists, the world can achieve a 100% renewable energy system by or before 2050. This conclusion is supported by hundreds of scientific studies that demonstrate the feasibility of such systems on global, regional, and national levels [^1].

2. **Economic and Employment Impact**: A report from Green America highlights that transitioning to a fully renewable energy system could support an estimated 35 million local jobs, with solar energy leading in job creation. This suggests significant economic benefits alongside environmental advantages [^2].

3. **Technological Advancements**: An article on Substack emphasizes that within less than a decade, electricity from solar, wind, and water could potentially power the entire world. This assertion is based on current technological trends and the rapid development of renewable energy technologies [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not provide the most up-to-date data or comprehensive analysis. Additionally, the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy system is contingent on various factors, including political will, economic investment, and technological breakthroughs, which are subject to change. Furthermore, the environmental and social impacts of transitioning to renewable energy were not extensively covered in the available sources.
