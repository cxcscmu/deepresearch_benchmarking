Overfishing negatively impacts the economy by reducing fish populations, which leads to decreased catches and lower incomes for fishermen. It can also result in increased food prices and food insecurity, as well as job losses for the approximately 60 million people who work directly and indirectly in the fishing industry. Additionally, overfishing threatens the socio-economic stability of communities that depend on marine resources.
