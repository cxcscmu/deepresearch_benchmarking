Poverty affects healthcare by limiting access to necessary resources such as health insurance, medications, and medical procedures. It also restricts access to proper nutrition, safe living environments, and clean air and water, which are essential for maintaining good health. Additionally, poverty can lead to increased health risks due to unsafe working environments and can cause financial strain through medical debt, further exacerbating health issues.
