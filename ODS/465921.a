Microbiology affects human life in numerous ways. Microbes play a crucial role in shaping our metabolism, immune system, and susceptibility to diseases. They are essential for human survival, providing more genes that contribute to our survival than the human genome itself. Microorganisms also aid in decomposing dead matter, breaking down harmful substances, and influencing our behavior and health.
