The relationship between violent video games and real-life violence is debated. Some studies and sources, such as Harvard Health Publishing and the American Psychological Association, suggest that exposure to violent video games can increase aggression and contribute to real-life violent behavior. However, other studies, like those mentioned in Ka Leo and a 2023 article, indicate that there is no correlation between violent video games and violent behavior in adolescents. Overall, the evidence is mixed, with some research indicating a potential for increased aggression, while others find no significant link to real-world violence.
