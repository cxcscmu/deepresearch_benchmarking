# Why Don't Young People Vote?

## Executive Summary

Despite the increasing political engagement of young people in social movements, their voter turnout remains significantly lower compared to older demographics. This report explores the reasons behind the low voting rates among young Americans, dispelling common myths and highlighting the actual barriers they face. The findings suggest that structural obstacles, rather than apathy, are the primary reasons for the low electoral participation of young people.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources that discuss youth voting behavior, including academic articles, news reports, and research studies. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "youth voting," "young people don't vote," and "barriers to voting for young people."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Myth of Apathy**: Contrary to popular belief, young people are not apathetic about politics. A report from FiveThirtyEight highlights that "younger Americans are very interested in politics, but the majority don't turn out to vote because of restrictions on registration, voter ID, and other structural barriers" [^1].

2. **Structural Barriers**: The New York Times notes that "fewer than half of Americans aged 18 to 29 voted in the 2016 presidential election," attributing this gap to logistical challenges such as registration difficulties and lack of information about the voting process [^2].

3. **Perception of Impact**: Many young people feel that their votes do not matter. According to a study by CIRCLE at Tufts, "young people often believe that the government does not care about their needs, which discourages them from participating in elections" [^3].
