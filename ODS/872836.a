The tremendous growth in cotton cultivation from 1790 to 1860 was driven by several factors, including technological advancements like the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney, which significantly increased the efficiency of cotton processing. Additionally, the high demand for cotton from textile mills kept prices high, prompting southern farmers to acquire more land and enslaved labor to increase production. The expansion of the cotton industry was also supported by the availability of slave labor, which was crucial for the labor-intensive cultivation and harvesting processes.
