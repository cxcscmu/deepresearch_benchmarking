East Germany fell primarily due to a combination of economic struggles, political pressure, and widespread public protests. The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, symbolized the collapse, driven by the weakening of Soviet influence, the rise of reform movements, and the demand for greater freedom and democracy by East German citizens. These factors culminated in the eventual reunification of Germany in 1990.
