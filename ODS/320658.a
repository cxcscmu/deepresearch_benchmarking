Euthanasia can be justified from various ethical perspectives. Some arguments in favor include the respect for individual autonomy, allowing people to choose a dignified death, and alleviating suffering, especially in cases of severe physical pain. However, organizations like the American Medical Association oppose it, advocating for improved life measures instead. The justification often depends on ethical, legal, and personal viewpoints.
