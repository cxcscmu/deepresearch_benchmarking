To become carbon neutral, a business can follow several steps: measure its emissions, reduce emissions over time, and compensate for its carbon footprint through carbon offsetting programs. This often involves investing in emission reduction activities like reforestation, switching to renewable energy, and implementing internal reduction targets. Additionally, businesses may engage in the exchange of carbon credits or the buying and selling of offsets.
