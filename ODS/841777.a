Architecture is influenced by the environment through factors such as climate, natural landscape, and available building materials. These elements shape the design and construction of buildings to ensure they are energy-efficient, sustainable, and harmonious with their surroundings. Additionally, architects consider the use of natural materials and renewable energy to minimize environmental impact and address issues like climate change and resource depletion.
