When a firm holds a high cash balance, shareholders may take actions such as advocating for the company to invest the excess cash in money market placements or high-yielding certificates of deposit, buy shares of blue-chip companies, or return cash to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. These actions aim to optimize the use of excess cash to enhance shareholder value.
