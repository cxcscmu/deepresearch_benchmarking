# Report on Potential Shareholder Actions for Firms with High Cash Balances

## Executive Summary
When a company holds a high cash balance, shareholders may become concerned about the efficient use of these funds. Shareholders have several potential actions they can take to influence management decisions regarding excess cash. These actions can range from direct communication with management to more assertive measures such as voting against management proposals or initiating shareholder activism campaigns.

## Methodology
To gather information on potential shareholder actions, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search focused on articles and reports discussing shareholder rights, corporate governance, and financial management strategies. Key sources included Investopedia, CFO Hub, and PwC, among others. The search aimed to identify credible and relevant insights into how shareholders can respond to high cash balances in firms.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Direct Communication and Proposals**: Shareholders can express their concerns directly to the company's management. They may propose alternative uses for the excess cash, such as increasing dividends or share buybacks. According to PwC, "Directors can help ensure the company anticipates which activists might target the company, and which issues they might raise" [^6].

2. **Voting and Legal Actions**: Shareholders have the right to vote against management proposals that they believe do not align with their interests. They can also initiate lawsuits if they feel that management is not acting in the best interest of the shareholders. As noted by ClientEarth, "Here are five examples of shareholder actions that led the way in compelling management to improve the way the companies they are invested in are run" [^8].

3. **Shareholder Activism**: In cases where direct communication and voting do not yield desired results, shareholders may resort to activism. This can involve organizing campaigns to pressure management into deploying excess cash more effectively. Shareholders can "express concerns, and take action if management underperforms, including voting against proposals, lawsuits, or board changes" [^7].
