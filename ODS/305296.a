Behavioral problems in children can significantly impact other areas of development. Untreated behavioral disorders may lead to children growing up to be dysfunctional adults, affecting their social, emotional, and academic development. These issues can place children on a pathway towards continuing difficulties as they enter school, influencing their ability to form relationships and succeed academically. Additionally, behavioral problems can manifest differently in various environments, such as home and school, further complicating their developmental trajectory.
