Germany emerged from defeat at the end of the First World War by transitioning into a new democratic government known as the Weimar Republic. The German Revolution of 1918â€“1919 played a crucial role in this transition, as it led to the abdication of the Kaiser and the establishment of a republic. Despite the political and economic turmoil, this new government signed an armistice to end the war, although it faced significant challenges from extremist political groups and widespread public resentment over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.
