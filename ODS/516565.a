Biological, psychological, and social-cultural factors interact to produce specific psychological disorders through a complex interplay where each factor contributes to the development and manifestation of these disorders. Biological factors may include genetics and neurochemical imbalances, psychological factors involve emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, and social-cultural factors encompass societal norms, relationships, and cultural influences. Together, these elements create a comprehensive framework for understanding how psychological disorders develop and affect individuals.
