Nursing interventions to improve feeding and eating for clients include providing nutrition education and dietary counseling, offering smaller and more frequent meals, ensuring a comfortable environment free of odors, providing good oral hygiene to enhance appetite, and using assistive feeding devices to maintain independence. Additionally, serving meals in a dining room environment and using assistants to feed patients can also be beneficial.
