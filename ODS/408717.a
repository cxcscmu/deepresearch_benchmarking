# Report: Is Manipulation a Form of Abuse?

## Executive Summary
Manipulation is widely recognized as a form of abuse, particularly within the context of emotional and psychological abuse. It involves tactics that seek to control or influence another person's emotions and behaviors, often leading to significant harm. This report explores the nature of manipulation as an abusive tactic, its manifestations, and its impact on victims.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and resources focused on domestic abuse and psychological health. The search strategy included keywords such as "manipulation," "abuse," "emotional abuse," and "psychological manipulation." The findings were drawn from reputable sources, including legal services, psychological health websites, and domestic violence support organizations.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Manipulation as Emotional Abuse**: Manipulation is a form of emotional abuse that involves controlling another person's emotions to gain power over them. According to Psych Central, "Emotional manipulation is a form of psychological manipulation in which a person seeks to control another person's emotions" [^1]. This form of abuse can be subtle and insidious, making it difficult for victims to recognize.

2. **Common Tactics**: Abusers employ various manipulation tactics to exert control. Choosing Therapy highlights that "Common manipulation tactics include gaslighting and seeking control, but an abuser can use many other tactics to control their victims" [^2]. These tactics are designed to undermine the victim's sense of reality and self-worth.

3. **Impact on Victims**: The effects of manipulation can be profound, leading to emotional distress and difficulty in leaving abusive relationships. The National Legal Service notes that "It takes seven attempts on average to leave an abusive relationship. Getting away from an abuser is not easy - particularly if they're a manipulator" [^3]. This underscores the complexity and danger of manipulation as a form of abuse.
