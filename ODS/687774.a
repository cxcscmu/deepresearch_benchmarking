The 13th Amendment was effective in abolishing slavery as an institution in the United States, as it officially ended chattel slavery with its ratification in 1865. However, the amendment's exception clause, which allows for involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime, has been criticized for enabling forms of forced labor to persist, particularly within the prison system. This has led to ongoing debates about the amendment's effectiveness in fully eradicating slavery and its legacy.
