Child development is influenced by a variety of factors, including brain development, the child's temperament, and the care they receive from parents and others. Environmental factors such as climate, cognitive stimulation, diet, housing conditions, and stress also play a significant role. Additionally, genetics, family and social life, education, and early life experiences can impact a child's growth and development.
