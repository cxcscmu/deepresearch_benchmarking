Abortions are generally considered very safe, with most people experiencing no serious physical or emotional complications. However, like any medical procedure, there is a risk of complications, which can increase with the duration of the pregnancy. Some women may experience psychological effects such as depression or anxiety, but these are not universally experienced. Overall, the consensus from reputable sources like the NHS and Mayo Clinic is that abortions are safe, especially when performed early in the pregnancy.
