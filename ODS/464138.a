The 1840 World's Anti-Slavery Convention affected the women's suffrage movement by highlighting the exclusion of women from full participation. This exclusion, particularly of key activists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, motivated them to focus on advocating for women's rights, ultimately contributing to the development of the women's suffrage movement.
