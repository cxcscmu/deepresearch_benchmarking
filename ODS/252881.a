"Why Parties? The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America" by John Aldrich explores the development and evolution of political parties in the United States. Aldrich argues that political parties are formed as solutions to problems that existing institutional arrangements fail to address, and they evolve as ambitious politicians pursue goals of reelection and policymaking. The book examines how parties have transformed from loose coalitions to more structured, candidate-centered organizations, particularly since the 1960s.
