Stereotypes are perpetuated within popular culture because media often conforms to and appeases the masses by reinforcing existing beliefs and perceptions. This can lead to a reliance on stereotypes, especially when there is a lack of direct contact between different groups, as people use media portrayals to form ideas about others. Additionally, media representation plays a significant role in shaping perceptions across identity differences, which can further entrench stereotypes.
