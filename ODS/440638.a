# Report on the Abolition of the Electoral College

## Executive Summary

The debate over whether the Electoral College should be abolished is a contentious issue in American politics. Proponents of abolition argue that the system is outdated and undemocratic, as it allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. Opponents claim it protects smaller states and prevents tyranny of the majority. This report examines various perspectives on the issue, drawing from recent articles and expert opinions.

## Methodology

To gather information on the topic, I conducted a search using a combination of keywords such as "Electoral College abolition," "Electoral College debate," and "Electoral College pros and cons." The search was performed using a database of articles and publications, focusing on reputable sources such as academic journals, think tanks, and news outlets. The findings were synthesized from a selection of articles that provided diverse viewpoints on the subject.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Arguments for Abolition**: Many argue that the Electoral College is an outdated system that does not reflect the democratic principle of one person, one vote. According to a Brookings Institution article, "The 1800 election deadlocked because presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson received the same number of Electoral College votes as his vice presidential candidate"[^1]. This highlights the potential for confusion and lack of clarity in the system. Additionally, a majority of Americans favor moving away from the Electoral College, with a Pew Research study noting that "63% of U.S. adults say the way the president is elected should be changed so that the winner of the popular vote nationwide wins"[^2].

2. **Expert Opinions**: Jack Rakove, a professor of history and political science, argues for abolition, stating, "In this extraordinarily strange system, the Electoral College can produce a president who did not win the popular vote"[^3]. This sentiment is echoed by other scholars who believe the system undermines the democratic process.

3. **Arguments Against Abolition**: Some argue that the Electoral College protects smaller states and prevents the tyranny of the majority. An article from the Ripon Society suggests that the system "protects against tyranny" by ensuring that presidential candidates must appeal to a broader range of states rather than just populous urban areas[^4].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of recent and comprehensive data on public opinion and expert analysis. The sources selected may not cover all perspectives, particularly those from smaller or less influential publications. Additionally, the complexity of the Electoral College system and its implications may not be fully captured in a brief report. Further research and analysis would be necessary to provide a more exhaustive understanding of the issue.
