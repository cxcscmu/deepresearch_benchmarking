The debate over whether the Electoral College should be abolished is ongoing, with arguments on both sides. Proponents of abolishing it argue that it is outdated and undemocratic, as it allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote, which has happened in several elections. They believe that a direct popular vote would be a fairer system. On the other hand, supporters of the Electoral College argue that it protects the interests of smaller states and prevents larger states from dominating presidential elections. They claim it ensures a more balanced representation across the country. Ultimately, the decision to abolish the Electoral College involves weighing these considerations and the values prioritized in the electoral process.
