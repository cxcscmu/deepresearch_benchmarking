Legalizing divorce can provide several benefits, including enabling individuals to escape dysfunctional or abusive marriages, which can improve their mental health and overall well-being. It also allows for increased labor force participation among married women and can improve the welfare of household members, even for couples that remain together. Additionally, legalizing divorce grants individuals the legal rights to leave a marriage that is no longer viable, offering a path to healing and rebuilding their lives.
