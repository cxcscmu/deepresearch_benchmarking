Republicans' distrust of the media is rooted in a belief that mainstream news outlets are biased against them and seek to ostracize conservative viewpoints. This sentiment has been growing for decades, with efforts to delegitimize mainstream media dating back to the late 1960s and early 1970s. Additionally, Republicans are less likely to trust media they perceive as mainstream, and social media has contributed to a general mistrust of all media sources.
