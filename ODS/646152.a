Global stratification impacts local culture by leading to cultural homogenization, where wealthier nations influence local cultures, potentially resulting in a loss of cultural diversity. It affects various aspects of everyday life, including housing, employment, education, and material conditions, often widening the gap between rich and poor. This influence can also lead to the adoption of dominant cultural aspects by local cultures, altering traditional norms and practices.
