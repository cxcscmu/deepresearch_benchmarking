People immigrated to America for various reasons, including seeking economic opportunities, escaping political instability, religious persecution, and famine, as well as pursuing greater freedom and opportunity. The United States was perceived as a land of economic opportunity, attracting those facing crop failures, land and job shortages, and rising taxes in their home countries. Additionally, the U.S. government allows legal immigration for work, education, family reunification, safety, and to encourage diversity.
