# Should College Be Less Expensive?

## Executive Summary

The cost of college education has been a contentious issue, with many arguing that it should be more affordable. The high cost of college limits access, burdens students with debt, and can exacerbate social inequalities. Various perspectives suggest that reducing college costs could lead to a more educated population, greater economic equality, and less financial strain on students and families.

## Methodology

To address the question of whether college should be less expensive, I conducted a search using a variety of online resources, including educational institutions, opinion pieces, and research articles. The search focused on recent discussions and analyses of college affordability, the implications of high tuition costs, and the potential benefits of reducing these costs. Key search terms included "college affordability," "lowering college tuition," and "free college education."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Affordability and Access**: The high cost of college is a significant barrier for many students, limiting their educational choices and financial futures. An opinion piece from the Salt Lake Tribune highlights that "The high cost of college is a big problem that affects many students. It limits our choices, hurts our creativity and risks our financial future" [^1].

2. **Economic and Social Benefits**: Lowering college costs could lead to a more educated population and reduce economic inequality. According to BestColleges.com, "Free college leads to greater completion rates, which would result in a more educated population. We know college degrees benefit individuals" [^2].

3. **Debt Reduction**: Reducing or eliminating college costs could alleviate the financial burden on younger generations. College Raptor notes that "Student Debt Will No Longer Crush the Younger Generations" if college were free or more affordable [^3].
