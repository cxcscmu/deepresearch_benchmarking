The study "Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment" found that working from home led to a 13% increase in performance. This improvement was attributed to working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick days) and making more calls. Additionally, home workers reported improved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover, although their promotion rate conditional on performance fell.
