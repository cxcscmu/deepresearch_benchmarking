# Report: Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment

## Executive Summary

The study "Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment" investigates the impact of remote work on employee performance and satisfaction. Conducted in a Chinese context, the research reveals a significant increase in productivity and job satisfaction among home workers. However, it also highlights a decrease in promotion rates for these employees. The findings suggest that while remote work can enhance performance and reduce turnover, it may also affect career advancement opportunities.

## Methodology

To gather information, I utilized a combination of academic databases and search engines, focusing on peer-reviewed articles and credible sources. The primary search terms included "working from home," "Chinese experiment," and "remote work productivity." Tools such as Google Scholar and JSTOR were instrumental in locating relevant studies and articles.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Performance Increase**: The experiment demonstrated a 13% increase in performance among home workers. This improvement was attributed to "working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick days)" accounting for 9%, and "more calls per shift" contributing 4% [^1], [^2].

2. **Job Satisfaction and Turnover**: Home workers reported higher job satisfaction and experienced a reduction in turnover rates. Specifically, the attrition rate for remote workers was halved compared to their office-based counterparts [^3].

3. **Promotion Rates**: Despite the positive outcomes in performance and satisfaction, the study found that the "promotion rate conditional on performance fell" for home workers. This suggests potential challenges in career progression for employees working remotely [^2], [^3].

## Limitations

The study is context-specific, focusing on a Chinese company, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other cultural or organizational settings. Additionally, the research does not explore long-term impacts of remote work on career development or organizational dynamics. Further studies could provide a broader understanding of remote work's implications across different industries and regions.
