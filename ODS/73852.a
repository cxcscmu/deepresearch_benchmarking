Islam spread through a combination of military conquests, trade, missionary activities, and the appeal of its religious and social teachings. The early Islamic caliphates expanded rapidly through military campaigns, which facilitated the spread of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe and Asia. Additionally, Muslim traders and missionaries played a significant role in spreading Islam to regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The religion's emphasis on community, charity, and justice also attracted converts.
