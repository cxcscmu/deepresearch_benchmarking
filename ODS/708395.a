Women are often paid less than men due to a variety of factors, including occupational segregation, differences in work experience, and discrimination. Women are more likely to work in lower-paying jobs and industries, and they often face barriers to advancement in their careers. Additionally, women are more likely to take career breaks for caregiving, which can impact their earnings over time. Discrimination and biases in the workplace also contribute to the gender pay gap.
