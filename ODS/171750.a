Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) is considered a non-partisan site that evaluates the bias and credibility of news sources, providing bias and factual reporting ratings for over 8,000 media sources. It is generally viewed as a credible resource for assessing media bias and factual reliability, as it uses a comprehensive methodology to systematically assess media outlets' ideological bias and factual reliability. However, as with any fact-checking resource, it is important to use it in conjunction with other sources to ensure a well-rounded understanding.
