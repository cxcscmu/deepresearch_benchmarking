# Media Bias/Fact Check Credibility Report

## Executive Summary

Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) is a widely used online resource that evaluates the bias and credibility of news sources. Founded in 2015, it provides ratings on political bias and factual reporting for over 8,000 media outlets. While MBFC is popular and frequently cited, its credibility has been questioned due to its methodology, which combines objective measures with subjective analysis. Despite these criticisms, studies have shown that MBFC's ratings often align with other fact-checking datasets, suggesting a level of reliability in its assessments.

## Methodology

To assess the credibility of Media Bias/Fact Check, I conducted a comprehensive search using various academic and informational databases. The search focused on articles, studies, and reviews discussing MBFC's methodology, credibility, and usage in research. Key search terms included "Media Bias/Fact Check credibility," "MBFC methodology," and "fact-checking resources." The search was conducted using Google Scholar, academic library databases, and reputable news literacy websites.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Methodology and Criticism**: Media Bias/Fact Check uses a combination of objective measures and subjective analysis to rate media outlets. It assesses sources based on four main categories: wording and headlines, fact-checking and sourcing, choice of stories, and political affiliation. However, its methodology has been criticized for lacking scientific rigor. A 2018 review by the Columbia Journalism Review described MBFC as "an armchair media analysis" with "subjective assessments [that] leave room for human biases, or even simple inconsistencies, to creep in" [^1].

2. **Alignment with Other Fact-Checking Sources**: Despite criticisms, MBFC's ratings have shown high agreement with other fact-checking datasets. A study published in Scientific Reports noted that MBFC's ratings correlate strongly with those from NewsGuard and BuzzFeed journalists, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 [^2]. This suggests that while MBFC's methodology may be subjective, its outcomes are consistent with other reputable sources.

3. **Usage in Research and Media Literacy**: MBFC is widely used in studies of media bias and misinformation. It has been employed in research on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to track the prevalence of misinformation. The site is also used in educational contexts to teach media literacy, as it provides a large dataset covering biased and low factual news sources [^3].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources and reviews, which may themselves be subject to bias. Additionally, the subjective nature of MBFC's methodology means that its ratings should be interpreted with caution. While the alignment with other datasets suggests reliability, the lack of a transparent, scientific methodology remains a concern. Further research could involve a direct analysis of MBFC's rating process and comparison with other fact-checking organizations.
