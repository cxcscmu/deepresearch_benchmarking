Cities grow due to a combination of factors including urban population growth, economic opportunities, and urban expansion. Urbanization is often linked with increased job opportunities, a centralized market, better pay, and higher individual wealth, which attract people to cities. Additionally, factors such as transportation, housing supply, and amenities also drive the population growth of cities.
