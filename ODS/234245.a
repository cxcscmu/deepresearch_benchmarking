The gold standard collapsed primarily due to its inability to provide the necessary flexibility for governments to manage their economies during times of crisis, such as the Great Depression. The rigid constraints of the gold standard limited monetary policy options, leading to deflationary pressures and economic instability. As countries sought to stabilize their economies, many abandoned the gold standard to allow for more flexible monetary policies.
