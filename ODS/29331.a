Abusive parents can significantly impact a child's development in various ways. Child abuse and neglect can lead to trauma that impairs brain development and is linked to physical, emotional, and behavioral issues later in life. Children who experience abuse are more likely to develop anxiety, depression, and memory issues, and they may block out traumatic memories. Additionally, maltreatment causes stress that disrupts early brain development, and extreme stress can impair overall development.
