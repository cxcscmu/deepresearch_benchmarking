Factions are considered a threat to a democratic government because they can lead to a tyranny of the majority, where a dominant group may prioritize its own interests over the rights and needs of the minority. James Madison, in Federalist No. 10, argued that factions could cause instability and potentially oppress minority rights, undermining the principles of democracy.
