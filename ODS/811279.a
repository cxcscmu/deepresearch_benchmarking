The question of whether private citizens should be allowed to own a gun is a subject of debate. According to a Pew Research Center report, a majority of Americans (64%) believe that most people should be able to legally own guns, although some people should not. This indicates a general support for gun ownership with certain restrictions. However, opinions vary widely, and the topic remains contentious with arguments both for and against gun ownership.
