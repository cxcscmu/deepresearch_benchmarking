Judges make decisions through a detailed and methodical analysis of legal issues, often involving the interpretation of legal documents and the application of relevant laws and precedents. They may use theories such as the Formalist theory, which involves determining the facts and applying the appropriate rule of law. Judges also have discretion in interpreting legal documents, and their decisions can be influenced by their views on judicial activism or restraint. Additionally, judges strive to avoid personal biases and rely on constitutions, statutes, regulations, and precedents to guide their decision-making processes.
