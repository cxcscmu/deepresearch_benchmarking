If marijuana becomes federally legal, it could lead to significant changes in the industry and legal landscape. It might jeopardize social equity licensing programs designed to boost minority participation in marijuana markets. Additionally, while marijuana would no longer be a barrier to security clearances, it would still be barred in the military for some time. The federal government would likely reschedule marijuana from a highly restricted Schedule I drug to a less tightly controlled category, allowing for regulation and taxation. However, each state would still have the authority to regulate marijuana within its borders.
