Climate change is a threat because it impacts human health, food and water security, and the environment. It leads to more frequent and intense droughts, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, and melting glaciers, which can harm animals, destroy habitats, and disrupt human systems. Additionally, climate change increases the spread of diseases and poses risks to infrastructure and essential services.
