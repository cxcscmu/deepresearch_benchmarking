Social media is considered dangerous for several reasons, including its potential to replace time with family and friends, leading to a lack of social skills development. It can also be a platform for bullying, exclusion, and unrealistic expectations about body image. Additionally, excessive use is linked to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia, as well as privacy risks like identity theft and phishing scams.
