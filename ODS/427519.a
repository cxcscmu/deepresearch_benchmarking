Capital punishment is often argued to be necessary for several reasons: it is believed to deter crime more effectively than other punishments because people fear death the most, it provides justice and closure for the families and victims, and it serves as a tool for protecting public safety by punishing those who commit the most heinous crimes. Additionally, it is seen as fulfilling a moral obligation to protect society by deterring potential murderers.
