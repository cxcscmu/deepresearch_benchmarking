# Report: Are Dream Catchers Cultural Appropriation?

## Executive Summary

The use of dream catchers by non-Native individuals has sparked a debate on whether it constitutes cultural appropriation. Dream catchers, originally created by the Ojibwe people, have become widely commercialized and are often used as decorative items. This report explores the perspectives on whether this practice is considered cultural appropriation or cultural appreciation.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on articles, blogs, and forums discussing the cultural significance of dream catchers and their use by non-Native individuals. The search aimed to gather diverse viewpoints from both Indigenous and non-Indigenous sources.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Significance and Appropriation**: Dream catchers are deeply rooted in Indigenous culture, specifically the Ojibwe tribe, and were traditionally used to protect sleepers from bad dreams. The Indigenous Foundation states, "In essence, when non-Native people make and sell dreamcatchers it is in fact cultural appropriation" [^1]. This highlights the concern that commercializing and using dream catchers without understanding their cultural significance can be seen as disrespectful.

2. **Commercialization and Acceptance**: The commercialization of dream catchers has led to a broader acceptance of their use by non-Natives. A Reddit discussion notes, "The dream catcher has been commercialized by both natives and non-natives, meaning that it is viewed as acceptable by the majority of Indians" [^2]. This suggests that some Indigenous people may not view the use of dream catchers by non-Natives as inherently offensive.

3. **Cultural Appreciation vs. Appropriation**: The distinction between cultural appreciation and appropriation is nuanced. An article from Helpful Professor explains, "Dreamcatchers can be offensive cultural appropriation or a heartwarming appreciation of Native American culture" [^3]. This indicates that the context and intent behind using dream catchers play a crucial role in determining whether it is appropriation.

## Limitations

The findings are based on available online sources, which may not fully represent the diversity of opinions within Indigenous communities. Additionally, the perspectives of individual Indigenous people may vary, and the commercial nature of some sources could influence their stance on the issue. Further research, including direct consultations with Indigenous communities, would provide a more comprehensive understanding.
