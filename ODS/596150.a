## Detailed Findings

1. **Rousseau's General Will and Revolutionary Ideals**: Rousseau's concept of the "General Will" was central to revolutionary ideology. It was interpreted as the collective will of the people, which justified radical actions during the Revolution.

His philosophy provided a common ideological ground for diverse groups. "Rousseau was adopted as a symbol at one time or another by all the political factions from conservative anti-revolutionaries to radical democrats" [^2].

3. **Inspiration for Revolutionary Events**: Rousseau's writings inspired significant revolutionary events and ceremonies. For instance, the inauguration of the new republican constitution featured a cantata based on Rousseau's democratic pantheistic deism. "Ceremonial and symbolic occurrences of the more radical phases of the Revolution invoked Rousseau and his core ideas" [^3].
