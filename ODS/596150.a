Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political philosophy significantly influenced the French Revolution. His ideas, particularly those expressed in "The Social Contract," emphasized the entitlement of basic human rights and the concept of the general will, which became central to revolutionary thought. Rousseau's writings inspired various political factions during the revolution, from conservative anti-revolutionaries to radical democrats, and his influence was more profound than that of any other figure during this period.
