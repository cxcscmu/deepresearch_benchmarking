# Report: Reasons for Staff Turnover in Higher Education

## Executive Summary

The turnover of staff in higher education institutions has become a significant concern, with a notable percentage of employees considering leaving their positions. The primary reasons identified for this trend include the desire for higher pay, lack of remote work options, and other workplace-related issues. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving this exodus.

## Methodology

To gather information on why staff are leaving higher education, a targeted search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The search focused on recent articles, surveys, and reports from reputable sources within the higher education sector. Key search terms included "higher education staff turnover," "reasons for leaving higher education," and "higher education employee retention." The search yielded several relevant articles and reports, which were analyzed to extract pertinent data and insights.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Desire for Increased Pay**: A significant factor driving staff to leave higher education is the need for better compensation. According to a survey, "75% of respondents said an increase in pay was their primary reason for considering leaving"[^1]. This sentiment is echoed across multiple sources, highlighting compensation as a critical issue.

2. **Lack of Remote Work Options**: The absence of flexible work arrangements, particularly remote work, is another major reason for turnover. The CUPA-HR 2023 study found that "lack of remote work was the second-highest indicated reason for higher education professionals to leave their role"[^2]. This suggests a growing demand for work-life balance and flexibility among employees.

3. **General Workplace Dissatisfaction**: Beyond pay and remote work, other factors contributing to staff turnover include workplace culture and management practices. One source notes that "compensation is employees' most-cited reason for leaving advancement and among the top reasons for quitting jobs overall"[^3]. This indicates that while pay is a primary concern, other aspects of the work environment also play a significant role.
