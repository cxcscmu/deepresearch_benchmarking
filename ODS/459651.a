Air pollution is a global issue because it poses significant risks to human health and the environment. It is estimated to cause millions of premature deaths annually and is closely linked to climate change and ecosystem degradation. The drivers of air pollution, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, contribute to both air quality deterioration and global warming, affecting populations worldwide, especially in lower-income groups.
