# Report on the March 2024 Cuban Protests

## Executive Summary

In March 2024, Cuba witnessed significant protests primarily centered in Santiago de Cuba, driven by severe food shortages and persistent power outages. These protests reflect deep-seated economic challenges exacerbated by U.S. sanctions and internal governance issues. The Cuban government's response has included curtailing internet access and deploying security forces, while international reactions have varied, with calls for both support and restraint.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches for "Cuban protests March 2024," "Cuba economic crisis," and "Cuba U.S. sanctions." The primary tools used were search engines and databases that index news articles, government statements, and international reports. The information was cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Hardships as a Catalyst**: The protests were primarily fueled by "food shortages and power outages" in Cuba, particularly affecting Santiago de Cuba, the country's second-largest city [^1]. The economic crisis has been described as the worst since the early 1990s, with inflation and a significant GDP contraction exacerbating the situation [^2].

2. **Impact of U.S. Sanctions**: The Cuban government attributes much of the economic distress to the U.S. embargo, intensified by Cuba's inclusion on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. This designation has led to new economic sanctions, discouraging foreign investment and severely impacting tourism [^1]. U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro criticized the Biden administration for not removing Cuba from this list, calling it "a serious missed opportunity" [^1].

3. **Government and International Responses**: In response to the protests, the Cuban government has restricted internet access and mobilized security forces to prevent organization among protesters [^1]. Internationally, reactions have been mixed. The U.S. embassy urged the Cuban government to respect human rights, while Cuban officials accused the U.S. of interference [^1]. Additionally, Cuban-Americans in Miami organized solidarity protests, highlighting the diaspora's engagement with the situation [^1].

## Limitations

This report is based on available data up to October 2023 and the specific search results provided. The dynamic nature of political and economic situations means that new developments may not be captured. Additionally, the reliance on secondary sources may introduce biases inherent in the original reporting. Further primary research and direct interviews with stakeholders in Cuba would provide a more nuanced understanding of the protests' causes and implications.
