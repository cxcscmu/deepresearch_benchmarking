Slavery was justified through various means, including religious, economic, and cultural arguments. Some proponents used biblical passages to claim divine sanction for slavery, arguing it was a positive good that exposed non-Christians to Christianity. Others contended that slavery was more humane than killing captives, and some believed it was economically necessary or beneficial for society. Cultural ethical relativism also played a role, as slavery was accepted by the majority in certain societies.
