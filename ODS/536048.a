The Stamp Act contributed to the Boston Massacre by inciting widespread protests and resistance among the colonists. The Act imposed direct taxes, leading to significant anger and resentment towards British rule. This growing hostility resulted in the formation of groups like the Sons of Liberty and increased tensions, which eventually culminated in the Boston Massacre.
