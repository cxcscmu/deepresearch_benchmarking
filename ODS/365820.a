The use of steroids in sports is a contentious issue. Anabolic steroids can enhance athletic performance by building muscle and increasing strength, but their use is considered cheating and can lead to penalties or bans for athletes. Additionally, there are significant health risks associated with steroid use. Many argue that steroids have no place in sports due to these ethical and health concerns.
