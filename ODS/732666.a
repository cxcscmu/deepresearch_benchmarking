Global warming affects humans by worsening air quality, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular health issues, increasing the risk of extreme heat events, and causing complications from underlying health conditions like asthma and heart disease. It also threatens essential health resources such as clean air, safe drinking water, and nutritious food supply, and can lead to the spread of diseases due to flooding and other climate-related events.
