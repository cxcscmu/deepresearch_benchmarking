# Global Warming and Its Effects on Human Health

## Executive Summary

Global warming, a significant aspect of climate change, poses a profound threat to human health and well-being. The increase in global temperatures and the resulting environmental changes have led to a range of health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems, increased disease transmission, and challenges to food and water security. This report synthesizes current research and expert opinions on the health impacts of global warming, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate these effects.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a targeted search was conducted using various online databases and authoritative sources on climate change and health. The search focused on recent publications and expert analyses to ensure the inclusion of up-to-date information. Key sources included government agencies, international health organizations, and scientific research institutions.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Respiratory and Cardiovascular Health**: Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns can exacerbate air quality issues, leading to increased asthma attacks and other respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. According to the Chicago Climate Change website, "warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns can worsen air quality, which can lead to asthma attacks and other respiratory and cardiovascular health issues" [^1].

2. **Heat-Related Illnesses**: Extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and severe, posing direct risks to human health. The US EPA notes that "climate change poses many threats to the health and well-being of Americans, including increasing the risk of extreme heat events" [^2]. These events can lead to heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and exacerbate existing health conditions.

3. **Disease Transmission**: Climate change affects the spread of infectious diseases by altering the habitats of vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks. The World Health Organization states, "climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health, affecting the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems" [^3]. This includes the potential for increased transmission of diseases like malaria and dengue fever.

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of data up to October 2023, and some sources may have more recent updates that are not included. Additionally, the complexity of climate change impacts means that not all potential health effects are covered comprehensively. Further research is needed to explore regional variations and long-term health outcomes related to global warming.
