The question of whether rich people should help the poor is a topic of debate. Some argue that the rich have a moral obligation to assist the poor, as they possess resources that can significantly improve the lives of those in need. Others believe that while the rich can help by creating opportunities, they are not necessarily obligated to provide direct aid. The perspectives vary, and the decision often depends on individual beliefs about wealth distribution and social responsibility.
