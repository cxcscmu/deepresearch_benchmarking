Social media cleanses can be effective in improving various aspects of well-being. According to a study, a two-week social media detox improved smartphone and social media addiction, sleep, life satisfaction, stress, and perceived wellness. Other sources also highlight benefits such as reduced anxiety and depression, enhanced focus, increased productivity, and better sleep. However, some research suggests that abstaining from social media might lead to a reduction in positive emotions.
