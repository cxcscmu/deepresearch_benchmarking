Extrinsic motivation in sports focuses on external rewards and recognition, which can drive athletes to perform at their best. However, an over-emphasis on extrinsic motivation may lead athletes to become discouraged if they do not meet performance expectations, potentially resulting in a downturn in form. Balancing extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is important for maintaining consistent performance and motivation.
