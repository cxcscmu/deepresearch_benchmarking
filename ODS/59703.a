# Report on the Effects of Extrinsic Motivation on Sports Performance

## Executive Summary

Extrinsic motivation, characterized by external rewards such as trophies, money, or recognition, plays a significant role in sports performance. While it can provide short-term boosts in performance, over-reliance on extrinsic motivation may lead to negative outcomes such as decreased intrinsic motivation and performance downturns when expectations are not met. This report explores the dual nature of extrinsic motivation in sports, highlighting both its benefits and potential drawbacks.

## Methodology

To gather information on the effects of extrinsic motivation on sports performance, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and academic resources. The search focused on articles, research papers, and expert opinions related to sports psychology and motivation. Key search terms included "extrinsic motivation in sports," "effects of motivation on athletic performance," and "extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Short-Term Performance Boosts**: Extrinsic motivation often provides immediate incentives that can enhance performance temporarily. "Short-Term Focus: Extrinsic motivation often provides short-term incentives, such as rewards or recognition. While this can boost performance temporarily, it..." [^1]. This suggests that athletes may perform better in the short term when motivated by external rewards.

2. **Potential for Discouragement**: Athletes who rely heavily on extrinsic motivation may experience discouragement if they fail to meet performance expectations. "Athletes who are predominantly extrinsically motivated tend to become discouraged when they do not perform to expectations and can experience a downturn in form..." [^2]. This indicates that the reliance on external rewards can lead to negative emotional outcomes and decreased performance.

3. **Impact on Youth Participation**: Extrinsic motivation is a significant factor in youth sports participation. "Extrinsic motivation is an important element affecting youth sport participation (Wendling et al., 2018)" [^3]. This highlights the role of extrinsic rewards in encouraging young athletes to engage in sports, although the long-term effects on their motivation need careful consideration.

## Limitations

The findings in this report are based on available literature and may not encompass all aspects of extrinsic motivation in sports. The research is limited by the availability of recent studies and the potential bias in self-reported data from athletes. Additionally, the dynamic nature of motivation means that individual differences can significantly affect outcomes, which may not be fully captured in the existing literature.
