Anti-science attitudes can be caused by several factors, including the perception that scientific sources lack credibility, identification with groups that hold anti-science views, and overconfidence in one's understanding of complex scientific issues. Additionally, social identities, political affiliations, and the influence of social media and diverse news sources can contribute to the rise of anti-science beliefs.
