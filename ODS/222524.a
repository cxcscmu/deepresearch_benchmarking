# Is Illiteracy a Disability?

## Executive Summary

Illiteracy, defined as the inability to read or write at a functional level, is not considered a disability by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in the United States. However, it can significantly impact an individual's ability to perform work-related tasks and may be considered when evaluating eligibility for disability benefits. This report explores the nuances of how illiteracy is treated in the context of disability benefits and the implications for individuals seeking such benefits.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including legal and governmental websites, to gather information on the treatment of illiteracy in the context of disability benefits. The search focused on authoritative sources such as the Social Security Administration's rulings and legal analyses from law firms specializing in disability claims.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Consideration by SSA**: The SSA defines illiteracy as the inability to read or write a simple message, such as instructions or inventory lists, even if the individual can sign their name. Illiteracy is not classified as a medical condition or disability by the SSA, but it is considered a level of education[^1][^2].

2. **Impact on Disability Claims**: Illiteracy can affect an individual's ability to perform work-related functions, such as understanding and following instructions or communicating effectively. This can be a factor in disability claims, particularly for older individuals who may not have a disease but are unable to secure employment due to illiteracy[^3][^4].

3. **Legal Interpretations and Implications**: Legal experts note that while illiteracy itself is not a disability, it can be a significant factor in disability determinations. For instance, the inability to perform certain jobs due to illiteracy may be considered when assessing an individual's overall ability to work[^5].
