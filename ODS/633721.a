# Report on IPO Underpricing in China's SME Market

## Executive Summary

IPO underpricing is a prevalent phenomenon in financial markets, where the initial offering price of a stock is set below its market value. This report explores the causes of IPO underpricing in China's Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) market. The primary factors identified include mis-valuation, particularly due to the irrational behavior of individual investors, deliberate pricing strategies by issuing corporations, and market failures. These elements contribute to the significant initial returns observed in the Chinese IPO market.

## Methodology

To gather information on the causes of IPO underpricing in China's SME market, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and online research platforms. The search focused on scholarly articles, research papers, and credible online sources that discuss IPO underpricing in the context of China's financial markets. The search terms included "IPO underpricing China," "SME market IPO," and "IPO mis-valuation factors."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Mis-valuation and Investor Behavior**: A significant cause of IPO underpricing in China's SME market is attributed to mis-valuation factors, particularly the irrational behavior of individual investors. This behavior leads to discrepancies between the offering price and the market value of the IPOs. "We find it is mis-valuation factors, especially, the irrational behaviour of individual investors that mainly cause the IPO underpricing in China's SME market" [^1][^2][^3].

2. **Deliberate Pricing and Market Failure**: Another contributing factor is the deliberate pricing strategies employed by issuing corporations in the primary market, coupled with market failures such as mis-valuation. These strategies are often used to ensure successful IPOs by attracting investors through lower initial prices. "Discloses the reasons causing IPO underpricing contains deliberate pricing of issuing corporations in the primary market and market failure (i.e., mis-valuation)" [^5].

3. **Corporate Governance and Information Environment**: Poor corporate governance and an opaque information environment exacerbate agency problems and increase monitoring costs, which in turn contribute to IPO underpricing. "Poor corporate governance and opaque information environment worsen agency problems and increase monitoring costs, thereby exacerbating IPO underpricing" [^7].
