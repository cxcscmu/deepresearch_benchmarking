Video games can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Some studies suggest that video games can improve hand-eye coordination, problem-solving skills, and cognitive functions such as attention and spatial awareness. However, excessive gaming can lead to negative outcomes, including poor sleep, decreased academic performance, and issues with mood and mental health, such as depression and anxiety. The impact of video games largely depends on the amount of time spent playing and the type of games played.
