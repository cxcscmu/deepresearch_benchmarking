Climate change affects people in various ways, including increasing the risk of illness through higher temperatures, more frequent heavy rains, and storms. It contributes to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and hurricanes. Additionally, it threatens essential health ingredients like clean air and safe drinking water, intensifies competition over land and water, affects food production, and drives up hunger.
