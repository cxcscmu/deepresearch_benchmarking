High school and college differ in several key areas. High school is typically mandatory and free, with a structured schedule largely determined by others. In contrast, college is voluntary and can be expensive, offering a more flexible schedule where students have greater control over their time. High school classes often have a more frequent test schedule, while college courses may require more independent study and critical thinking. Additionally, college students generally experience a richer and more dynamic social life, surrounded by a diverse group of people.
