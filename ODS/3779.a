## Executive Summary

The rise of dictators in the interwar period significantly contributed to the outbreak of World War II. Key figures such as Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin capitalized on economic instability and political discontent to establish authoritarian regimes.

This report explores the factors that facilitated the rise of these dictators and how their actions directly led to World War II.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including educational websites, scholarly articles, and historical databases. The search focused on the period between World War I and World War II, examining the political and economic conditions that allowed dictators to gain power and the subsequent impact on international relations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Instability and Political Discontent**: The Great Depression of the 1930s created widespread economic hardship, leading many to lose faith in liberal democracies. This environment was ripe for authoritarian figures to rise to power. "During the worldwide economic crisis of the Great Depression in the 1930s, many people lost faith in liberal democracy and countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes" [^1].

2. **Aggressive Expansionist Policies**: Dictators like Hitler and Mussolini pursued aggressive foreign policies aimed at territorial expansion. Hitler's ambitions for Lebensraum and the unification of all Germans under one Reich were central to his foreign policy. "The Nazis took totalitarian power in Germany from 1933 and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. Their ambitious and aggressive domestic and foreign policies reflected their ideologies" [^2].

3. **Militarization and Alliances**: The militarization of Germany, Italy, and Japan, coupled with strategic alliances, further escalated tensions. These countries defied international treaties and pursued military build-ups. "By the early 1930s, militaristic and aggressive national ideologies prevailed in Germany, Japan, and Italy. The attitude fuelled advancements in military technology, subversive propaganda and ultimately territorial expansion" [^3].

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of online resources and the potential bias in historical interpretations. Some sources may present a Eurocentric view, underrepresenting the impact of Japanese militarism in Asia. Additionally, the complexity of international relations in the interwar period means that not all contributing factors to World War II can be fully explored in this brief report.
