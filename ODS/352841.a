## Detailed Findings

1. **Legislative and Executive Branches**: In the United States, fiscal policy is determined by both the legislative and executive branches. The legislative branch, primarily Congress, is responsible for drafting and passing legislation related to fiscal policy, such as tax laws and budget allocations. The executive branch, led by the President, plays a crucial role in proposing fiscal policy initiatives and signing legislation into law. "In the United States, fiscal policy is determined by the legislative and executive branches" [^1].

2. **Collaboration Between President and Congress**: The President and Congress must work together to implement fiscal policy effectively. Any fiscal policy legislation passed by Congress must be signed by the President to become law. This collaboration ensures that both branches have a say in the fiscal direction of the country. "The president and Congress work in tandem to determine fiscal policy" [^2].

3. **Role of the Federal Reserve**: While the Federal Reserve plays a significant role in monetary policy, it does not determine fiscal policy. Fiscal policy decisions are solely the responsibility of Congress and the Administration. "In the U.S., fiscal policy decisions are determined by Congress and the Administration; the Fed plays no role in determining fiscal policy" [^3].
