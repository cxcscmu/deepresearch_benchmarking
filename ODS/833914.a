Vaccine mandates can lead to claims of discrimination, particularly in contexts involving religious freedom and workplace policies. For example, the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Lucky v. Landmark Medical found that COVID-19 vaccine mandates might violate Title VII through religious discrimination. Additionally, there are concerns that employer vaccine mandates could exacerbate intolerance and discrimination in the workplace. However, mandatory vaccination and human rights law are generally considered compatible, suggesting that mandates can be implemented in a way that respects individual rights.
