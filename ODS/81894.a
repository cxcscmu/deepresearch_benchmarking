Global citizenship is important because it promotes social responsibility, encourages understanding and empathy across different cultures, and helps individuals recognize the interconnectedness of global issues. It enables people to work collaboratively to address challenges that are too large for any one nation to solve alone, fostering a sense of shared humanity and responsibility for the well-being of all societies.
