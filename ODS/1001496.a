The argument against stricter gun laws often centers on the belief that such laws do not effectively reduce crime and may infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens. For example, sources like the NRA-ILA argue that gun control laws are flawed and that the right to bear arms protects citizens from violent crime. Additionally, some perspectives, such as those from House Republicans, suggest that mass shootings are carried out by disturbed individuals and that laws alone won't prevent such violence.
