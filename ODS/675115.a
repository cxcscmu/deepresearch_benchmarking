Social media can have both positive and negative effects on people's mental health. It is associated with increased risks of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and psychological distress. Additionally, it can lead to poor sleep quality and reduced sleep duration, particularly in young people. However, social media also offers opportunities for creativity, professional networking, and education. The impact varies among individuals, with some experiencing more negative effects than others.
