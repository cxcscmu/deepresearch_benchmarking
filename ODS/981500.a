The Bill of Rights protects citizens by guaranteeing civil rights and liberties, such as freedom of speech, press, and religion. It sets rules for due process of law and places specific limitations on government power to safeguard individual freedoms. Additionally, it includes protections like the Fourth Amendment, which requires a warrant for government intrusion into homes, ensuring citizens' privacy and security.
