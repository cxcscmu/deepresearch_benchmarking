# Report: Underrepresentation of Women in the U.S. Congress

## Executive Summary
The underrepresentation of women in the U.S. Congress is a multifaceted issue influenced by societal, institutional, and political factors. Despite efforts to increase female representation, women continue to face significant barriers that hinder their participation in federal politics. This report explores the reasons behind the low numbers of women in Congress, drawing on recent studies and expert analyses.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and publications. The search focused on recent articles, reports, and studies that discuss the underrepresentation of women in U.S. politics, particularly in Congress. Key search terms included "women in Congress," "female political representation," and "barriers to women in politics." The search was refined to include sources from reputable organizations and recent publications to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the findings.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Societal Expectations and Role Models**: Societal norms and the scarcity of female role models in politics contribute significantly to the underrepresentation of women. "The scarcity of female role models in politics—caused by societal expectations, inadequate candidate recruitment, and a lack of interest—hinders women's political ambitions" [^1].

2. **Institutional Barriers**: Women face institutional challenges such as access to fundraising and systemic sexism. "There are also well-documented institutional barriers to women running for office – whether it's access to fundraising dollars or blatant sexism" [^2]. These barriers make it difficult for women to compete on an equal footing with their male counterparts.

3. **Perceptions and Biases**: Public perceptions and biases also play a role. A Pew Research survey found that "men are more likely than women to point to women being less interested in holding political office as a major reason why there are fewer women" [^3]. This perception can discourage women from pursuing political careers and affect voter support.
