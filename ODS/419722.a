The rich often avoid taxes through various legal strategies, such as using the "buy, borrow, die" strategy to gain capital gains tax advantages, investing in tax-efficient assets like capital gains, maximizing pension contributions, and utilizing tax-exempt charitable organizations. They may also use tax-preferred corporate forms to achieve lower tax rates and take advantage of tax breaks like claiming depreciation, deducting business expenses, and earning income from investments rather than wages.
