The American Revolution was revolutionary because it popularized radical ideals such as liberty, equality, government of the people, and the rule of law. It was a struggle for self-government and demonstrated the human capacity for self-determination, aligning with Enlightenment principles like those of John Locke. The revolution also involved a class struggle and was marked by the desire to transform societal structures and governance.
