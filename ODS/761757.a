Teachers can refrain from unprofessional conduct by adhering to established codes of ethics, such as avoiding behaviors like sexual or physical harassment, and not accepting gifts or favors that might impair their judgment. Additionally, they should engage in continuous professional development, maintain respectful communication with students and colleagues, and demonstrate genuine care for the well-being of everyone in their classroom.
