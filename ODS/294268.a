# Report: Human Contributions to Climate Change

## Executive Summary

Human activities have significantly contributed to climate change, primarily through the release of greenhouse gases. Key activities include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of reputable sources, including government agencies, scientific organizations, and educational platforms. The search strategy involved identifying authoritative sources that discuss the causes of climate change, focusing on human activities. Tools used included search engines and databases that index scientific and governmental publications.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Burning Fossil Fuels**: The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil is a major contributor to increased greenhouse gas concentrations. "Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere" [^1].

2. **Deforestation and Land Use**: Human activities such as deforestation and agriculture have altered the natural carbon cycle. "Burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature" [^2].

3. **Industrial and Agricultural Activities**: Industrial processes and agricultural practices release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane. "Human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which has changed the earth's climate" [^3].

## Limitations

This report is based on available data up to October 2023 and may not include the most recent research findings. Additionally, while the sources used are reputable, the complexity of climate systems means that ongoing research may further refine our understanding of human impacts on climate change.
