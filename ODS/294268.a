Humans have caused climate change primarily by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has been done through activities such as burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity generation, and industry, as well as deforestation and agriculture. These activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to global warming.
