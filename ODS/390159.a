To reduce crime in society, several strategies can be implemented. These include helping victims of crime, reducing the demand for law enforcement by addressing root causes, fixing distressed spaces, and making crime attractors less appealing. Additionally, setting clear goals to stop violence, identifying key people and places driving violence, and creating plans to engage these elements are essential actions. Solving more violent crimes to increase accountability, making data-driven investments in violence prevention, and addressing trauma are also effective measures.
