The executive branch is often considered the most powerful due to several factors: the President's role as Commander-in-Chief of the military, the ability to negotiate and sign treaties, control over foreign policy, the power to veto legislation, and the authority to issue Executive Orders. Additionally, the executive branch has broad powers of secret surveillance and enforcement of laws, which further enhance its influence.
