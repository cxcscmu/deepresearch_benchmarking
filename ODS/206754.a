Factors that affect psychopathology include biological factors such as genes and brain chemistry, chronic medical conditions, and family history of mental illness. Additionally, social and environmental factors like race, gender, culture, sexual preference, education level, economic status, feelings of isolation, maltreatment, poverty, inequality, discrimination, and involvement with the criminal justice system can also influence the development of psychopathology.
