Wealthy countries can aid other countries by providing financial assistance, often referred to as foreign aid or official development assistance. This aid can take various forms, including humanitarian aid, development projects, and economic support. For example, there is an international commitment for wealthy countries to provide 0.7% of their GNP to assist poorer nations. Additionally, in 2023, rich countries spent $223.7 billion on foreign aid, which can be used to support infrastructure, health, education, and emergency relief efforts in recipient countries.
