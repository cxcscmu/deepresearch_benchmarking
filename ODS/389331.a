The long-term effects of the Holocaust include significant psychological and neurobiological impacts on survivors, such as poorer psychological well-being, increased post-traumatic stress symptoms, and a higher risk of mental health issues like depression and paranoia. Economically, regions heavily affected by the Holocaust, such as parts of Russia, have experienced lower economic growth and wages. Culturally and demographically, the Holocaust caused profound changes, including the displacement of survivors and the establishment of new communities, such as the State of Israel. Additionally, the Holocaust has had enduring impacts on global awareness and education about genocide and human rights.
