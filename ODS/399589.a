# College Football Playoff Expansion: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

The College Football Playoff (CFP) is set to expand from its current four-team format to a 12-team format for the 2024-25 season. Discussions are ongoing about further expanding to a 14-team format by 2026. This report examines the potential benefits and drawbacks of such expansions, considering the perspectives of various stakeholders within college football.

## Methodology

To gather information on the topic, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on major sports news websites, forums, and official NCAA publications. The tools used included Google Search and direct access to sports news platforms like ESPN, Reddit, and NCAA.com. The focus was on gathering recent and relevant data to provide a comprehensive view of the current discussions surrounding CFP expansion.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Current Expansion to 12 Teams**: The CFP will expand to a 12-team format starting in the 2024-25 season. This change is intended to increase inclusivity and competitiveness within college football. According to NCAA.com, "The College Football Playoff will introduce a 12-team playoff bracket for the 2024-25 season, expanding from the four-team format" [^1].

2. **Potential 14-Team Expansion**: There is ongoing consideration for further expansion to 14 teams by 2026. This proposal is still under discussion, with CFP executive director Rich Clark stating, "the commissioners are considering the addition of two more teams in 2026" [^2]. The decision hinges on various factors, including the interests of major conferences like the SEC and Big Ten.

3. **Debate on Necessity and Impact**: The expansion has sparked debate among stakeholders. Some argue that the current excitement and drama of college football do not necessitate further expansion. As noted by USA Today, "the excitement and drama from this spectacular college football season have proven that you don't need to expand the Playoff any more" [^3]. Others believe that a larger playoff could lead to more competitive national championship games.
