Veterans in America face a higher risk of homelessness due to several factors, including poverty, lack of support networks, and dismal living conditions. Combat exposure, PTSD, mental health issues, substance abuse, low income, and economic instability also contribute significantly to the problem. Additionally, the transition from military to civilian life can be challenging, as military skills may not easily transfer to civilian jobs, further exacerbating the risk of homelessness.
