The Holocaust had a devastating impact on the Jewish population, resulting in the murder of six million Jews, which was about one-third of the total worldwide Jewish population at the time. Jewish communities across Europe were shattered, and many survivors were determined to leave Europe due to persistent antisemitism. The demographic and cultural effects of the Holocaust have had long-lasting impacts, and the Jewish population in some areas has not fully recovered.
