After World War I, Europe underwent significant changes. Four empires collapsed: the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, German, and Russian empires. New countries were formed, including Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, while boundaries were redrawn. Several countries, such as Romania, Italy, and Greece, gained new territories. Additionally, international organizations were established to promote peace and cooperation.
