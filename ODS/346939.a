Climate change significantly impacts tourism by altering travel destinations and affecting tourism demand. Rising global temperatures can make popular tourist destinations intolerable due to heat waves and increase the likelihood of natural disasters like hurricanes and forest fires. Coastal tourism is particularly at risk from severe storms and rising sea levels, which can disrupt essential services and deter travelers. Additionally, the tourism sector contributes to climate change, accounting for around 8-10% of global carbon emissions.
