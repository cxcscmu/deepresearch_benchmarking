# Report: Should Underaged Children Be Allowed to Own Social Media Accounts?

## Executive Summary

The debate over whether underaged children should be allowed to own social media accounts is multifaceted, involving considerations of mental health, privacy, and parental control. Recent studies and expert opinions highlight both the potential benefits and risks associated with social media use by minors. While some advocate for stricter regulations and parental consent, others emphasize the importance of digital literacy and responsible usage.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and reputable sources. The search focused on recent articles, expert opinions, and legislative updates regarding minors' access to social media. Tools such as Google Scholar, news websites, and organizational reports were utilized to gather diverse perspectives.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Parental Consent and Legislation**: A significant portion of U.S. adults (81%) support requiring parental consent for minors to create social media accounts, compared to 46% of teens who share this view[^1]. This indicates a generational divide in perceptions of autonomy and safety online.

2. **Health Concerns**: U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has expressed concerns that age 13 is too young for social media use, citing risks to young people's self-worth and mental health[^2]. This aligns with ongoing discussions about the psychological impact of social media on developing minds.

3. **Legislative Efforts**: In response to these concerns, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators has proposed legislation to ban children under 13 from joining social media platforms[^3]. This reflects a growing legislative interest in regulating minors' online activities to protect their well-being.
