The question of whether underaged children should be allowed to own social media accounts is debated. Some experts, like the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, suggest that 13 is too young due to potential risks to self-worth. Additionally, some recommend waiting until at least eighth grade, while others, like Senator Schatz, believe children 12 and under should not be on social media at all. There is also a significant portion of US adults who favor requiring parental consent for minors to create social media accounts.
