The global coffee market links producers and consumers through a series of interconnected steps. Coffee is produced in coffee-growing countries, then exported to international markets where it is processed, marketed, and sold to consumers. This supply chain involves various stakeholders, including farmers, exporters, importers, roasters, and retailers, all of whom play a role in bringing coffee from the field to the consumer's cup.
