## Executive Summary

Mortgage Loan Originator (MLO) compensation structures have been identified as a significant source of fair lending risk. Regulatory bodies and legal frameworks, such as Regulation Z, have established guidelines to mitigate these risks. However, concerns persist, particularly regarding practices that may lead to disparate impacts on different borrower groups. This report explores the potential fair lending issues associated with MLO compensation, drawing on recent regulatory insights and industry analyses.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Regulatory Concerns and Guidance**: Loan originator compensation is a recognized source of fair lending risk.

"Loan originator compensation is a key source of fair lending risk. Through the years, we have seen both regulator guidance and DOJ settlements" [^1].
