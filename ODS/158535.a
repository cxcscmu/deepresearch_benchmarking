# Report: Impact of Selling a Home on Social Security Benefits

## Executive Summary
Selling a home generally does not affect Social Security retirement or survivor benefits. However, it may have implications for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and could influence the taxation of Social Security benefits if the sale results in significant capital gains. This report explores the nuances of how real estate transactions can impact different types of Social Security benefits.

## Methodology
To gather information, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including financial news websites, government publications, and expert blogs. The search focused on the impact of selling a home on Social Security benefits, specifically looking for recent articles and authoritative sources.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Social Security Retirement and Survivor Benefits**: Selling a home does not directly affect eligibility for Social Security retirement or survivor benefits. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), "eligibility for Social Security retirement or survivor benefits comes with no limits on income or assets" [^1].

2. **Tax Implications**: While selling a home does not affect the benefits directly, it can have tax implications. If the sale results in significant capital gains, it might increase the taxable portion of Social Security benefits. As noted by True Parity, "if you make a profit from the sale, it might be subject to capital gains tax, which could affect the taxation of your Social Security benefits" [^2].

3. **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**: The situation is different for SSI, which is a needs-based program. Proceeds from selling a home could temporarily make an individual ineligible for SSI payments. As highlighted by a source, "if you receive SSI, then proceeds from the sale of your home could temporarily make you ineligible for SSI payments" [^3].
