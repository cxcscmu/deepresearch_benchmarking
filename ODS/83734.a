Survival in Auschwitz was extremely difficult and often depended on a combination of factors, including luck, timing, and personal resilience. Some people survived by being sent to the camps later in the war, having skills that were useful to the Nazis, or by being younger but not too young. Additionally, survival could be influenced by the ability to avoid the most brutal tasks, access to extra food or clothing, and sometimes the help of fellow prisoners. However, the conditions were so harsh that survival was often a matter of chance.
