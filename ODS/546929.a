A good play-based learning environment should be visually appealing, welcoming, and stimulating, often incorporating natural materials and colors. It should provide opportunities for inquiry-based learning with manipulatives, relevant picture books, and open-ended activities. Additionally, it should be child-led, allowing students freedom and choice over their actions and play behavior, which promotes engagement and holistic development.
