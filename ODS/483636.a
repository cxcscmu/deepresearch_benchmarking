Culture affects identity by providing the framework within which individuals navigate their roles, relationships, and aspirations. It shapes how people perceive themselves and the world, influencing their values, beliefs, and sense of self. Cultural identity is formed through shared norms and values that individuals learn as part of growing up in a particular cultural group.
