Algeria gained independence from France on July 5, 1962, following a prolonged and violent struggle known as the Algerian War of Independence, which lasted from 1954 to 1962. The conflict involved guerrilla warfare, political negotiations, and significant civilian casualties. The war ended with the signing of the Ã‰vian Accords in March 1962, which led to a referendum in July 1962 where Algerians overwhelmingly voted for independence.
