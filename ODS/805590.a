# Algeria's Path to Independence

## Executive Summary

Algeria's journey to independence from French colonial rule was a complex and multifaceted process that spanned from 1954 to 1962. The struggle was marked by intense guerrilla warfare, political negotiations, and significant international pressure. The conflict, known as the Algerian War, culminated in the signing of the Évian Accords in March 1962, which paved the way for a referendum in July 1962 where an overwhelming majority of Algerians voted for independence. The official recognition of Algeria's independence by France occurred on July 3, 1962, with Algeria declaring its independence on July 5, 1962.

## Detailed Findings

1. **The Algerian War and Évian Accords**: The Algerian War, also known as the Algerian Revolution, was a pivotal conflict between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) from 1954 to 1962. It was characterized by guerrilla warfare and significant political turmoil in France. The war concluded with the signing of the Évian Accords on March 18, 1962, which "ushered in a newly independent Algeria and thus ended the 8-year long Algerian War" [^1].

2. **Referendum and Independence**: Following the Évian Accords, a referendum was held in Algeria on July 1, 1962, where "some 6,000,000 votes were in favor of independence and only 16,000 against" [^2]. This overwhelming support led to France recognizing Algeria as an independent state on July 3, 1962, and Algeria officially declared its independence on July 5, 1962 [^3].

3. **International and Domestic Pressures**: The war and subsequent negotiations were influenced by both international and domestic pressures. The United Nations General Assembly annually considered the Algerian question, and the FLN's position gained increasing support. French President Charles de Gaulle eventually acknowledged the untenability of the status quo, leading to negotiations with the FLN and the eventual signing of the Évian Accords [^4].

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of sources primarily in English, which may not capture the full scope of perspectives, particularly those from French or Arabic sources. Additionally, the complexity of the conflict and the multitude of actors involved mean that some nuances may be oversimplified in this summary. Further research into primary documents and firsthand accounts would provide a more comprehensive understanding of Algeria's path to independence.
