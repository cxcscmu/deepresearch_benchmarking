Theories of development and educational frameworks influence current practice by providing a structured understanding of children's behavior, reactions, and learning processes. These theories guide educators in creating effective teaching strategies and interventions that cater to the social, emotional, and cognitive development of children. By applying these frameworks, practitioners can better support children's growth and adapt their approaches to meet individual needs.
