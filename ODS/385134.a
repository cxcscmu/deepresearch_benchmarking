Biology influences our behavior through genetic variations, hormonal regulation, and the structure and activity of the brain. Genetic predispositions can affect an individual's risk for certain mental health disorders, while hormones act as messengers carrying signals from the brain to organs and tissues, influencing behavior. Additionally, the physical structure and activity of different brain areas impact learning, information processing, and responses to stimuli.
