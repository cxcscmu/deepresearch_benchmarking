The executive compensation issue relates to equity theory as it involves comparing the compensation of executives to that of other employees or referent groups. According to equity theory, individuals assess fairness by comparing their input-output ratio to others. If executives perceive their compensation as equitable compared to their peers or other benchmarks, it is considered fair. Conversely, significant disparities in compensation can lead to perceptions of inequity, potentially causing dissatisfaction and counterproductive behaviors among employees.
