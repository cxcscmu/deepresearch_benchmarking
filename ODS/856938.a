Nursing homes have been addressing the mental health of elderly residents post-COVID-19 by implementing various strategies. These include managing the effects of isolation through programming, staffing adjustments, and encouraging safe in-person visits. Additionally, there is a focus on addressing increased rates of anxiety and depression among older adults, which were exacerbated by the pandemic. Efforts are being made to improve mental health care and reduce the emotional toll experienced by residents due to isolation and disrupted care during the pandemic.
