# Report: What Do People Look for in a President?

## Executive Summary

Understanding what people look for in a president is crucial for political candidates and parties as they strategize for elections. Recent surveys and studies reveal that Americans prioritize leadership skills, decision-making abilities, and honesty in presidential candidates. These traits are consistently valued across different demographics, although there are variations in preferences based on political affiliations and age groups.

## Methodology

To gather insights on what people look for in a president, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on political preferences and presidential qualities. I accessed reputable sources such as YouGov, American Psychological Association, and The Hill, which provide data-driven insights and expert analyses. The search was conducted using online databases and search engines to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Leadership and Decision-Making**: A survey highlighted by The Hill indicates that "leadership skills, the ability to make decisions, and honesty top a long list of traits that Americans want most for US presidents" [^1]. This suggests a strong preference for candidates who can lead decisively and transparently.

2. **Personality Traits**: According to the American Psychological Association, great presidents are often characterized by being "extraverted, open to experience, assertive, achievement striving, and excitement seeking" [^2]. These personality traits are believed to contribute to effective leadership and governance.

3. **Diverse Preferences**: A YouGov article notes that the frontrunners in the presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have "different backgrounds and resumes," reflecting the diverse preferences among the electorate [^3]. This diversity indicates that while certain traits are universally valued, individual candidate backgrounds also play a significant role in voter preferences.

## Limitations

The findings are based on available data and surveys, which may not capture the full spectrum of voter preferences. Additionally, the data is subject to change as new surveys are conducted and as political landscapes evolve. The analysis is also limited by the availability of recent studies and the potential biases inherent in survey methodologies.
