Abortion is legal in many places because it is considered a matter of human rights, protecting autonomy, and ensuring access to safe and legal medical procedures. Legal access to abortion is seen as essential for protecting women's health and rights, as well as reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. Additionally, criminalizing abortion is argued to violate fundamental human rights and does not effectively dissuade women from seeking abortions.
