Governments can help the environment by implementing carbon taxes, establishing cap and trade systems, setting clean energy standards, and participating in international agreements. They can also promote green energy, protect and restore ecosystems, and enforce stricter environmental laws to promote sustainability and public health. Additionally, governments can deploy tax incentives, favorable lending, and sustainable finance options like green bonds to support environmental initiatives.
