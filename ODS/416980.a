Immigrants are pivotal in enhancing the productive capacity of the economy, which in turn raises the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). They also contribute to job creation, wage increases, and overall economic productivity. This report delves into the various ways immigration benefits the U.S. economy, drawing on multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a systematic search was conducted using online databases and credible sources related to immigration and economic impact. The search focused on recent publications and expert analyses to ensure the information is current and relevant.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic Growth and Labor Force Expansion**: Immigrants significantly contribute to the expansion of the labor force, which is a critical driver of economic growth. According to the Migration Policy Institute, "Immigrants boost overall economic growth by expanding the labor force and increasing consumer spending" [^1]. This expansion is essential for sustaining economic momentum and addressing labor shortages in various sectors.

2. **Innovation and Human Capital**: Immigration enhances the economy's stock of human capital and ideas, which are vital for long-term economic growth. The Economic Policy Institute notes that "People who immigrate to the United States increase the economy's stock of human capital and ideas, two crucial ingredients for long-run economic growth" [^2]. This influx of diverse skills and perspectives fosters innovation and technological advancement.

3. **Job Creation and Wage Increases**: Immigrants not only fill existing jobs but also create new ones, which can lead to wage increases for native workers. FWD.us highlights that "Immigrants help create jobs, raise wages, reduce inflation, and increase productivity and innovation" [^3]. This dynamic contributes to a more robust and resilient economy, benefiting all Americans.
