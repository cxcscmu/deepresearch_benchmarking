The barriers to our collective learning in the age of information include misinformation, sensationalism, hidden agendas, and the spread of false news. Other obstacles are information overload, confirmation bias, filter bubbles, the digital divide, lack of critical thinking skills, and cultural and emotional barriers. Additionally, issues such as lack of electricity, illiteracy, weak financial systems, and government regulations also hinder collective learning.
