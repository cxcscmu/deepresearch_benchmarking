# Report on Relying on Other People's Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures

## Executive Summary

The practice of relying on third parties for Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is increasingly common in various sectors, particularly in financial and legal services. This report explores the conditions under which firms can depend on the CDD conducted by others, highlighting the regulatory frameworks and necessary agreements that govern such reliance. While reliance can streamline processes and reduce duplication of efforts, it is subject to strict criteria to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and industry-specific resources. The search focused on recent articles, regulatory guidelines, and expert opinions on the topic of CDD reliance. Key search terms included "Customer Due Diligence reliance," "third-party CDD," and "CDD regulatory requirements." The search aimed to gather diverse perspectives and authoritative sources to provide a well-rounded analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Regulatory Frameworks**: The Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (MLR 2017) in the UK allow firms to rely on third parties for CDD measures, provided there is consent from the third party. "MLR 2017, reg. 39 allows relevant persons to rely on certain other people to carry out CDD measures, provided that the other person consents to being relied on" [^1].

2. **Criteria for Reliance**: Firms can rely on CDD conducted by another firm, but this is contingent upon meeting strict criteria, including the existence of a written reliance agreement. "You can rely on the CDD undertaken by the other firm but there are strict criteria which must be met including the requirement for a written reliance agreement" [^2].

3. **Guidance from Legal Authorities**: The Legal Sector Affinity Group provides guidance that allows reliance on another person's CDD, subject to their agreement. "The Legal Sector Affinity Group guidance states: You may rely on another person to conduct CDD for you, subject to their agreement" [^3].
