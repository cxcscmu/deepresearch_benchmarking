During World War II, Jews were subjected to systematic persecution and mass murder by Nazi Germany. This included accelerated persecution, deportation, and the deliberate murder of approximately six million European Jews. The Nazis introduced legislation to deny Jews their freedom, restrict their rights, and ultimately carried out mass murders, particularly in concentration and extermination camps.
