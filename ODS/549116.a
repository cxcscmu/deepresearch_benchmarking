The Holocaust, as it came to be known, resulted in the murder of approximately six million Jews, alongside millions of others deemed undesirable by the Nazis.

This report delves into the various aspects of Jewish persecution during the war, highlighting key events and the broader impact on Jewish communities across Europe.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including historical articles, museum archives, and educational websites. The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases, focusing on credible sources such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The National WWII Museum, and Wikipedia. The search strategy involved using keywords like "Holocaust," "treatment of Jews in WWII," and "Nazi persecution of Jews."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Systematic Persecution and Extermination**: The Holocaust was a methodical genocide orchestrated by Nazi Germany, aiming to eliminate the Jewish population in Europe. "The Holocaust was Nazi Germany's deliberate murder of approximately six million European Jews and at least five million prisoners of war" [^1]. This genocide was part of a broader plan known as the "Final Solution," which was discussed and formalized during the Wannsee Conference in January 1942.

2. **Deportations and Extermination Camps**: Jews were forcibly deported from their homes and sent to extermination camps, where they faced mass murder. "By December 1941, Adolf Hitler decided to completely exterminate European Jews... They began to systematically deport Jewish populations from the ghettos and all occupied territories to the seven camps designated as Vernichtungslager, or extermination camps" [^2]. These camps included Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Sobibór, among others.

3. **Widespread Pogroms and Anti-Jewish Legislation**: Before and during the war, Jews were subjected to violent pogroms and discriminatory laws. "Leading to World War II, nearly all Jewish businesses in Nazi Germany had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government as part of the 'Aryanization' policy inaugurated in 1937" [^3]. Pogroms, such as Kristallnacht in 1938, marked the beginning of open violence against Jews in Germany.
