# Is Crime Necessary in Society?

## Executive Summary

The question of whether crime is necessary in society has been a topic of debate among sociologists and criminologists. The consensus among many scholars, particularly those influenced by the work of Emile Durkheim, is that crime plays a functional role in society. It is argued that crime is not only inevitable but also necessary for the establishment of moral boundaries and the promotion of social change. This report explores the perspectives on the necessity of crime in society, drawing from various sources and theoretical frameworks.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and scholarly articles. The search focused on key terms such as "crime necessity," "Durkheim crime theory," and "functionality of crime." Sources were selected based on their relevance and contribution to the discussion on the role of crime in society. The search included academic articles, online forums, and educational resources to provide a well-rounded view of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Durkheim's Perspective on Crime**: Emile Durkheim, a foundational figure in sociology, argued that crime is an integral part of all societies. He believed that crime is necessary to establish moral boundaries and promote social cohesion. According to Durkheim, "Crime is normal because a society without crime would be impossible" [^1]. This perspective suggests that crime serves as a catalyst for societal evolution and adaptation.

2. **Crime as a Societal Feature**: The notion that crime is a feature of society rather than a pathological deviation is supported by various scholars. A discussion on Reddit highlights that "Crime is present in all societies, it must be a feature of societies, rather than a deviant pathological feature of individuals" [^2]. This view aligns with the idea that crime is embedded in the social fabric and contributes to the dynamic nature of societal norms.

3. **Functional Benefits of Crime**: Beyond establishing moral boundaries, crime is argued to have functional benefits, such as creating employment opportunities in law enforcement and the legal sector. An article from SUU News states, "Crime creates jobs in law enforcement and in the legal world. Criminal lawyers, police officers, sheriffs and other such lines of work would not exist without crime" [^3]. This perspective highlights the economic and structural roles that crime plays in society.

## Limitations

The analysis is limited by the availability of sources and the potential bias in interpretations of Durkheim's theories. Additionally, the discussion is largely theoretical and may not fully account for the complexities of crime in contemporary society. The reliance on secondary sources, such as online forums and non-peer-reviewed articles, may also affect the depth and accuracy of the findings. Further empirical research is needed to substantiate the theoretical claims regarding the necessity of crime in society.
