Jews in the first century expected a warrior Messiah primarily because of the Old Testament descriptions of a future Messiah as a conquering king and powerful political ruler. This expectation was influenced by their desire for liberation from Roman oppression and the restoration of their political fortunes, as they anticipated a Messiah who would lead a revolt and establish peace by defeating their enemies.
