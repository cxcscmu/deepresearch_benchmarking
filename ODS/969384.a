Abortions should be legal because they are considered a fundamental human right, essential for protecting the health and autonomy of pregnant individuals. Legal access to abortion prevents unsafe procedures, reduces maternal mortality, and supports economic empowerment by allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive lives without facing financial barriers. Additionally, criminalizing abortion does not deter individuals from seeking it but rather forces them into unsafe conditions, violating their human rights.
