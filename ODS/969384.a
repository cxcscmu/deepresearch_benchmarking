# Report: Why Abortions Should Be Legal

## Executive Summary
The legality of abortion is a critical issue that intersects with human rights, health care, and socio-economic factors. Legalizing abortion is argued to be essential for safeguarding women's health, ensuring their human rights, and promoting economic empowerment. This report synthesizes various perspectives and research findings to elucidate why abortion should be legal.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and reputable sources. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "abortion legality," "human rights," "health care," and "economic impact." The tools used included Google Scholar, organizational websites like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, and academic databases. The focus was on gathering diverse viewpoints and empirical data to provide a balanced analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Human Rights Perspective**: Legal restrictions on abortion often lead to unsafe procedures, which can increase maternal mortality rates. Human Rights Watch emphasizes that "legal restrictions on abortion often result in more illegal abortions, which may also be unsafe and may drive higher maternal mortality" [^1]. Amnesty International supports this by stating that laws should "respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of pregnant persons and not force them to seek out unsafe abortions" [^2].

2. **Health Care Argument**: Abortion is considered a safe medical procedure when performed legally. According to Britannica, "the death rate for legal abortions is 0.7 deaths for every 100,000 abortions," highlighting the safety of legal abortions compared to illegal ones [^3]. Doctors Without Borders also notes that "safe abortion care saves lives," underscoring the health benefits of legal access [^4].

3. **Economic Empowerment**: Legal abortion supports economic empowerment by allowing individuals to make decisions about their reproductive lives without financial barriers. The Women's Centers argue that "legal abortion supports economic empowerment by allowing individuals to make decisions about their reproductive lives without facing financial barriers" [^5]. Research from the Urban Institute further indicates that "access to legal abortion improves women's economic and social lives, and being denied an abortion creates economic hardship and financial insecurity for women" [^6].
