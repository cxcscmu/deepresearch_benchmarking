# Report: Evolution of Mental Health Over the Years

## Executive Summary
The landscape of mental health has undergone significant transformations over the past several decades. These changes are characterized by shifts in treatment approaches, societal attitudes, and the overall understanding of mental health disorders. Key developments include the closure of asylums, increased awareness and acceptance, and a focus on self-care and prevention. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the rising incidence of mental health issues among young adults persist.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online databases and resources. The search focused on articles and studies that discuss the historical and contemporary changes in mental health care and societal attitudes. Tools such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and organizational websites like the American Psychological Association (APA) were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Transformation in Treatment Approaches**: 
   - "Mental health has been transformed over the last seventy years. There have been so many changes: the closure of the old asylums; moving care into the community; and the development of new treatments and therapies" [^1]. This indicates a significant shift from institutionalized care to community-based and personalized treatment options.

2. **Increased Awareness and Acceptance**:
   - "Much of the focus on mental health has shifted from pathology to awareness and self-care. With 1 in 5 adults in the United States experiencing mental illness, there is a growing emphasis on understanding and managing mental health" [^2]. This reflects a broader societal change towards recognizing mental health as a critical component of overall well-being.

3. **Rising Incidence Among Young Adults**:
   - "The rate of individuals reporting symptoms consistent with major depression in the last 12 months increased 52 percent in adolescents from 2005 to 2017" [^3]. This statistic highlights a concerning trend in the mental health of younger populations, necessitating targeted interventions and support systems.
