Mental health has changed significantly over the years, with major transformations in treatment and societal attitudes. The closure of old asylums and a shift towards community-based care have marked a significant change in mental health treatment. There has also been an increase in mental health awareness, with a focus on self-care and reducing stigma. Despite these advancements, the prevalence of mental health disorders has increased, with reports indicating a rise in conditions like major depression, particularly among young adults.
