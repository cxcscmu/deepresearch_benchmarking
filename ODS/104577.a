# Climate Change: Mechanisms and Impacts

## Executive Summary
Climate change is a significant alteration in the Earth's climate patterns, primarily driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and subsequent changes in weather patterns. This report delves into the mechanisms of climate change, its causes, and its potential impacts on the environment and human society.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various authoritative sources on climate change. The search focused on understanding the mechanisms of climate change, its causes, and its effects. Key sources included the United Nations, NASA, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other reputable organizations. The search strategy involved identifying and reviewing articles and reports that provide scientific explanations and evidence of climate change.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Mechanisms of Climate Change**: Climate change is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. According to the United Nations, "As greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat. This leads to global warming and climate change" [^1].

2. **Human Activities and Climate Change**: Human activities, including industrial processes, deforestation, and the burning of fossil fuels, significantly contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases. The Royal Society notes that "Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth's energy balance and thus its climate" [^2]. This alteration in energy balance is a critical factor in the ongoing changes in global climate patterns.

3. **Impacts of Climate Change**: The effects of climate change are widespread and include rising temperatures, sea level rise, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. The DCCEEW highlights that climate change leads to "increases in temperature in the air and ocean, sea level rise affecting coastlines, and extreme events, including heatwaves" [^3]. These impacts pose significant challenges to ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide.

## Limitations
This report is based on available data and literature up to October 2023. The rapidly evolving nature of climate science means that new findings and data may emerge that could alter current understandings. Additionally, while the report draws from reputable sources, it does not encompass all perspectives or the full breadth of research on climate change. Further research and continuous monitoring of scientific developments are recommended for a more comprehensive understanding.
