Climate change works through the buildup of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, which trap heat and lead to global warming. This process alters the Earth's energy balance, resulting in long-term changes in weather patterns and climate. Human activities, such as the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, significantly contribute to this phenomenon.
