The disadvantages of renewable energy resources include their intermittent nature, as they are not available round the clock and are vulnerable to weather conditions. They also have high upfront costs, require significant space, and can be limited by geographic and natural factors. Additionally, renewable energy technologies often have lower efficiency and can produce noise and visual pollution, particularly in the case of wind turbines.
