Victims often return to their abusers due to a combination of factors, including financial insecurity, lack of alternative housing, emotional attachment, fear of further violence, and the complex dynamics of power and control in abusive relationships. These situations are often compounded by the abuser's manipulation and the victim's hope for change.
