Poverty can be addressed through a variety of solutions, including expanding safety net programs, creating good-paying jobs, raising the minimum wage, providing quality education, ensuring access to healthcare, and empowering women and girls. Additionally, economic growth that is less carbon emissions-intensive and addressing policies that exploit the poor are also important strategies. These approaches aim to tackle both the immediate needs and the systemic issues contributing to poverty.
