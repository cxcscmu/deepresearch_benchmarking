## Detailed Findings

1. **Strategic Buffer Zone**: One of the primary reasons for the Soviet Union's establishment of communist governments in Eastern Europe was to create a buffer zone against potential Western attacks. This was a strategic move to protect Soviet borders from future invasions, as highlighted by sources stating, "The Soviet Union established communist governments in Eastern Europe after World War II to create a buffer against Western attacks" [^1].

2. **Ideological Expansion**: The spread of Marxist-Leninist ideology was another significant factor. The Soviet Union sought to transform Eastern European societies along socialist lines, reflecting the Marxist-Leninist view that socioeconomic transformation was essential for establishing Soviet control. As noted, "Stalin felt that socioeconomic transformation was indispensable to establish Soviet control, reflecting the Marxistâ€“Leninist view that material bases, the distribution of the means of production, shaped social and political relations" [^2].

3. **Political and Economic Control**: The Soviet Union aimed to exert political and economic control over Eastern Europe. This involved the establishment of puppet regimes and the integration of these countries into Soviet economic structures like the Comecon. The Soviets "modeled economies in the rest of Eastern Bloc outside the Soviet Union along Soviet command economy lines" and used "draconian procedures to ensure compliance with directives to invest all assets in state planned manners" [^3].
