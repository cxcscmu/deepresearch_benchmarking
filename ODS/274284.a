Market forces of supply and demand affect interest rates by influencing the cost of borrowing. When the demand for credit is high or the supply of credit is low, interest rates typically rise. Conversely, when the demand for credit is low and the supply is high, interest rates tend to fall. These changes in interest rates can impact the economy by affecting consumer borrowing and spending, investment decisions, and overall economic growth.
