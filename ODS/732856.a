Inflation generally leads to an increase in home prices, as the cost of goods and services, including housing, rises. Higher inflation can also result in increased mortgage rates, which raises monthly housing costs. However, inflation can dampen housing demand and potentially cool down prices, allowing for a more modest pace of appreciation or even stagnant home prices.
