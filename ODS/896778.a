The question of whether animals should be treated the same as humans is debated. Some argue that animals should have rights to prevent suffering and ensure humane treatment, as they can experience pain and emotions similar to humans. However, others believe that while animals deserve humane treatment, they should not be treated exactly the same as humans due to differences in capabilities and roles in society. The consensus leans towards treating animals with compassion and respect, but not necessarily granting them the same rights as humans.
