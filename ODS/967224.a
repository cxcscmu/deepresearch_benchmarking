The energy shortage is primarily due to a combination of factors, including the rapid economic recovery post-pandemic, geopolitical tensions such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. These elements have led to rising energy prices and supply disruptions. Additionally, localized shortages, market manipulation, and infrastructure issues like pipeline failures have also contributed to the crisis.
