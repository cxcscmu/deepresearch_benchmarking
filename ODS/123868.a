Gender inequality affects children in several ways. It can lead to young girls receiving less nutrition, fewer opportunities to play, and limited access to early learning compared to boys. Girls often face lower self-esteem and underestimate their intelligence, while boys may overestimate their abilities. Additionally, gender inequality is associated with negative impacts on children's health, such as low birth weight, undernourishment, and higher child mortality rates. As children grow, learning inequalities widen, with girls typically receiving less support to pursue studies in fields like science.
