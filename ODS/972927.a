In the United States, the concept of "at-will" employment generally allows employers to terminate employees without a specific reason, as long as the termination is not for an illegal reason, such as discrimination or retaliation. This is the standard in all states except Montana, where certain protections may require a good cause for termination. Whether the law should allow this is a matter of debate, with arguments on both sides regarding fairness and business flexibility.
