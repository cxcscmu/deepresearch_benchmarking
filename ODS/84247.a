Yes, freedom of speech does have limits. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects free speech but allows for limitations on certain categories of speech, such as speech that is harmful, threatening, or incites violence. These restrictions can also include regulations on the time, place, and manner of speech, provided they are not related to the content of the speech.
