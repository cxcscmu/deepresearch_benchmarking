Graciela Iturbide has chosen to interpret the Kahlo Home and Studio site using black and white photography to focus on the essence and emotions of the site, rather than being distracted by colors. Her stark images provide an emotional narrative about the intimate space within the "Blue House," where Frida Kahlo was born and died.
