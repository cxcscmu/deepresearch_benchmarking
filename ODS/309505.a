The Glorious Revolution was primarily caused by religious and political conflicts in England. King James II, a Catholic, faced opposition in a predominantly Protestant nation. His religion and actions, along with the fear of a Catholic succession, led to his deposition and replacement by his Protestant daughter Mary and her husband, William of Orange.
