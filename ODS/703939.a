Social media affects the economy in several ways. It can influence stock values through user-generated content, even from those with little financial expertise. Social media also increases news knowledge, facilitates protests in democracies, and impacts economic growth by affecting productivity. Additionally, it enhances market intelligence, connects businesses with export opportunities, and influences the economy through advertising revenue, job creation, e-commerce, and data monetization.
