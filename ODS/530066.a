A church can leave a legacy by reproducing itself, ensuring its teachings and community impact continue beyond its current life cycle. This can involve fostering a profound faith among its members, encouraging them to live for Christ, and creating a spiritual legacy through discipling relationships. Additionally, a church can leave a positive legacy by living with integrity, compassion, and purpose, influencing the world long after its members are gone.
