Low levels of employee job satisfaction in recent years can be attributed to several factors, including inflation and financial difficulties, inconsistent return-to-office policies, unfair treatment at work, inconsistent compensation, and lack of support from co-workers and bosses. Additionally, toxic work environments characterized by hostility, gossip, or unfair treatment can also significantly impact employee satisfaction.
