# Report: The Impact of Beauty Pageants on Mental Health

## Executive Summary

Beauty pageants have long been a subject of debate regarding their impact on participants' mental health. While some argue that pageants can boost self-esteem and confidence, a growing body of evidence suggests that they may also contribute to negative mental health outcomes, such as body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and disordered eating. This report synthesizes findings from various studies and articles to provide a comprehensive overview of how beauty pageants affect mental health.

## Methodology

To gather information on the impact of beauty pageants on mental health, a systematic search was conducted using online databases and news articles. The search focused on recent studies, expert opinions, and participant testimonials. Key search terms included "beauty pageants mental health," "body image," "self-esteem," and "disordered eating." Sources were selected based on relevance and credibility, including academic studies, news articles, and expert analyses.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Body Image and Self-Esteem Issues**: Participation in beauty pageants is often linked to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. A study highlighted in a PubMed article suggests that childhood beauty pageant participation may lead to adult body dissatisfaction and interpersonal distrust [^1]. Similarly, a report from The Hawkeye notes that children involved in pageants are more likely to develop body dissatisfaction and eating disorders [^2].

2. **Disordered Eating and Mental Health**: The pressure to maintain a certain body image can lead to disordered eating behaviors. A PDF report from SUNY discusses how adult women who participated in beauty pageants often struggle with body dissatisfaction and disordered eating [^3]. This is echoed in a study by Wonderlich and Henderson, which found increased chances of eating disorders among former pageant participants [^4].

3. **Mixed Outcomes on Self-Esteem**: While some studies suggest that pageants can enhance self-esteem, they also reveal potential negative effects. A 2011 study from West Virginia University found that although pageant participants reported higher self-esteem, they also experienced increased body image concerns [^5].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of recent and comprehensive studies on the topic. Some sources may have inherent biases, particularly opinion pieces or articles with a specific agenda. Additionally, the impact of beauty pageants on mental health can vary significantly among individuals, making it challenging to generalize findings. Further research, particularly longitudinal studies, is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of beauty pageant participation on mental health.
