After Reconstruction, the American West experienced significant changes characterized by the expansion of the transcontinental railroad, which facilitated settlement and economic growth. There was a notable influx of settlers, including immigrants, leading to increased cultural diversity. The region also saw the decline of Native American populations as they were forced off their lands, the near extinction of American bison, and the rise of mining, ranching, and urbanization.
