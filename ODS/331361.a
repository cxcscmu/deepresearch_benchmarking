# Impact of World War I on Civilians

## Executive Summary

World War I had a profound and multifaceted impact on civilian populations across the globe. The war not only resulted in significant loss of life but also led to widespread economic, social, and political changes. Civilians faced hardships such as food shortages, displacement, and increased mortality due to malnutrition and disease. The war also catalyzed shifts in societal roles, particularly for women, and influenced political landscapes, including the expansion of suffrage.

## Methodology

To gather information on the impact of World War I on civilians, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including historical archives, educational websites, and scholarly articles. The search focused on identifying credible sources that provide detailed insights into the economic, social, and political consequences of the war on civilian populations.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Economic and Social Hardships**: The war led to severe economic strain and social upheaval. "One of the main ways the war affected civilians was a shortage of food. Agriculture felt the strain of war; production declined and prices rose" [^1]. This scarcity was exacerbated by blockades and inefficient transportation systems, particularly in the Ottoman Empire, leading to inflation and economic decline [^5].

2. **Loss of Life and Displacement**: The war resulted in significant civilian casualties and displacement. "Many cities and towns were destroyed. Many families were displaced and lost their homes. There were also around 20 million deaths, both military and civilian" [^2]. In Germany, approximately 763,000 civilians died due to malnutrition and disease caused by blockades [^6].

3. **Political and Social Changes**: The war prompted significant political and social changes, including the introduction of conscription and shifts in gender roles. "The war led the government to introduce conscription and the Defence of the Realm Act. The role of women changed and political engagement grew" [^3]. Women's contributions to the war effort were recognized with expanded suffrage in several countries [^5].
