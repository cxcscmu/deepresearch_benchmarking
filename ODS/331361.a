World War I had a profound impact on civilians, leading to significant hardships. Many cities and towns were destroyed, and families were displaced, losing their homes. Civilians faced food shortages and malnutrition due to strained agriculture and rising prices. The war also resulted in millions of civilian deaths from occupation, bombardment, hunger, and disease. Additionally, the war led to changes in societal roles, such as increased political engagement and shifts in women's roles due to conscription and government policies like the Defence of the Realm Act.
