# Report on Causes of Recent Inflation

## Executive Summary

Recent inflation, particularly post-2020, has been influenced by a confluence of factors. Key drivers include supply chain disruptions, increased consumer demand, energy price volatility, and significant fiscal and monetary interventions. These elements have collectively contributed to the inflationary pressures observed in the U.S. and globally.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including government publications, economic think tanks, and reputable news outlets. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the causes of inflation from 2020 onwards. Tools such as Google Scholar and institutional websites were utilized to ensure a diverse range of perspectives.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Supply Chain Disruptions and Demand Shifts**: The pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions have been a significant factor. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "backlogs of work orders for goods" have contributed to rising inflation[^1]. This disruption, coupled with shifting consumer demand, has strained supply chains, leading to price increases.

2. **Energy Prices and Fiscal Policy**: Energy price volatility has been another critical driver. The National Bureau of Economic Research highlights that "energy prices, food prices, and price spikes due to shortages were the dominant drivers of inflation in its early stages"[^2]. Additionally, fiscal policies, including substantial government stimulus spending, have injected liquidity into the economy, further fueling inflationary trends.

3. **Broader Economic Factors**: Other factors include geopolitical conflicts and labor shortages. CNBC notes that "geopolitical conflict and changed consumer behaviors due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic" have also played roles in the inflationary environment[^3]. These elements have compounded the effects of supply and demand imbalances.
