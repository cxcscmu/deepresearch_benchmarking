Video games do not cause violence because studies consistently show that the long-term impacts of violent games on youth aggression are negligible. Research indicates that while violent video games may lead to desensitization to violence, they do not directly cause increased aggression or violent behavior. Most studies conclude that there is no causal link between video games and real-world violence.
