Keeping animals in cages is considered cruel because it restricts their natural behaviors and can lead to physical and mental distress. Animals in captivity often lack the space and enrichment needed to lead fulfilling lives, which can result in depression and other health issues. Captivity goes against their natural adaptations, depriving them of the ability to express their natural desires and behaviors.
