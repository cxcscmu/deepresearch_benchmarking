# Report: The Cruelty of Keeping Animals in Cages

## Executive Summary
The practice of keeping animals in cages is widely regarded as cruel due to its detrimental effects on their physical and mental well-being. This report explores the reasons why caging animals is considered inhumane, focusing on the deprivation of natural behaviors, the psychological impact, and the ethical considerations surrounding animal captivity.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, organizational reports, and public opinion platforms. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "cruelty of caging animals," "animal captivity effects," and "ethical concerns of animal confinement." The tools used included Google Scholar, organizational websites, and public forums like Reddit and Quora.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Deprivation of Natural Behaviors**: Animals in cages are unable to express their natural behaviors, which is essential for their well-being. According to the World Animal Protection, "It limits the natural behaviour of an animal and places both their mental and physical wellbeing at risk" [^1]. This restriction can lead to severe stress and anxiety in animals.

2. **Psychological Impact**: The confinement of animals often results in psychological distress. A persuasive writing sample highlights that "animals kept in cages become terribly depressed. They cease eating food and drinking water as they no longer have the will to live" [^2]. This indicates a significant impact on their mental health, leading to behaviors such as self-harm or lethargy.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: The ethical argument against caging animals is rooted in the belief that animals have a right to freedom. A Quora discussion points out that "It is considered cruel because they belong to be free, at least having the freedom of walking away from you if they wanted" [^3]. This perspective emphasizes the moral obligation to respect animal autonomy and natural habitats.

## Limitations
The report is limited by the availability of up-to-date academic research and the reliance on publicly available online resources, which may not always provide comprehensive scientific data. Additionally, the perspectives included are primarily from Western viewpoints, which may not represent global attitudes towards animal captivity. Further research could include more diverse cultural perspectives and empirical studies on the long-term effects of caging on different animal species.
