The Syrian civil war was primarily caused by a combination of political, social, and economic factors. Key triggers included widespread dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, demands for political reform, and the influence of the Arab Spring protests that swept across the region in 2011. The conflict was further exacerbated by sectarian tensions, economic hardship, and government crackdowns on peaceful protests, which eventually escalated into a full-scale civil war.
