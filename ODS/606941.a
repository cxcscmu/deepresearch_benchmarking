# Report on the Causes of the Syrian Civil War

## Executive Summary

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, is a complex conflict with roots in political, economic, and social issues. The uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime was initially part of the broader Arab Spring movement, characterized by demands for political reform and greater freedoms. The conflict quickly escalated into a full-scale civil war due to a combination of internal discontent and external influences. Key factors contributing to the war include political repression, economic hardship, sectarian tensions, and foreign interventions.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including encyclopedic entries, news articles, and academic analyses. The primary search tools included Google Scholar for academic perspectives and Google Search for current and historical news articles. Key terms used in the search included "Syrian Civil War causes," "Arab Spring Syria," and "Bashar al-Assad regime."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Political Repression and Lack of Freedoms**: The Assad regime's authoritarian rule, characterized by political repression and lack of freedoms, was a significant catalyst for the uprising. The regime's harsh crackdown on peaceful protests in 2011 further fueled the conflict. "The civil uprising against the longtime rule of the Assads deteriorated into protracted civil war" due to the regime's violent response to protests [^1].

2. **Economic Hardship and Inequality**: Economic factors, including high unemployment, widespread corruption, and economic inequality, contributed to public discontent. The economic liberalization policies of the 2000s exacerbated socio-economic inequalities, alienating the middle and working classes. "Syria is a country which has seen massive impoverishment over the last decade, especially in the rural areas" [^2].

3. **Sectarian Tensions and Foreign Interventions**: Sectarian divisions, particularly between the ruling Alawite minority and the Sunni majority, played a role in the conflict's escalation. Additionally, foreign interventions by countries like Iran, Russia, and the United States further complicated the situation. "The civil war has also served as a proxy war as a number of foreign countries–including Turkey, Iran, Russia and the United States–have been directly involved in the conflict" [^3].
