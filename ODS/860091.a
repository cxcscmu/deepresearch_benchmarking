The impact of Trump's tax cuts on the middle class is debated. Some sources, like The Hill, argue that the 2017 tax reform lowered taxes for all income groups, including the middle class. However, other sources, such as Brookings and AFSCME, claim that the tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy and did not significantly help the middle class. This indicates a lack of consensus on the extent to which the middle class benefited from the tax cuts.
