The "Era of Good Feelings" is a term used to describe the period in U.S. history during President James Monroe's administration (1817-1825), characterized by a sense of national unity and political cooperation following the War of 1812. However, the term is somewhat misleading, as this period also saw significant political conflicts, economic challenges, and sectional tensions, particularly over issues like slavery and states' rights. While there was a temporary decline in partisan politics, underlying divisions persisted, making the label "Era of Good Feelings" only partially accurate.
