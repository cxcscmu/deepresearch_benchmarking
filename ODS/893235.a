A poor quality product can have several negative impacts on a company, including lost revenue, decreased customer loyalty, increased costs, and potential legal actions. It can also lead to mechanical breakdowns, work slowdowns, or stoppages, and may result in product recalls, warranty claims, and lost sales. Additionally, poor quality can damage a company's reputation and financial performance.
