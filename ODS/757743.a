# Report on Radical Republicans' Disapproval of Presidential Reconstruction

## Executive Summary

The Radical Republicans, a faction within the Republican Party during the Reconstruction era, strongly opposed Presidential Reconstruction led by President Andrew Johnson. Their disapproval stemmed from the belief that Johnson's policies were too lenient towards the Southern states and insufficient in securing rights and protections for newly freed African Americans. The Radicals advocated for more stringent measures to ensure civil rights and political representation for former slaves and to prevent former Confederates from regaining political power.
