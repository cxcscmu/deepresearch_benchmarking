Despite progress in recent decades, gender inequality remains a significant global challenge.

## Methodology
To address the query on the historical existence of gender inequality, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search focused on historical analyses, academic articles, and credible online publications. Key search terms included "gender inequality history," "origin of gender inequality," and "gender gap historical timeline." The selected sources were evaluated for their relevance and credibility.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Ancient Origins**: According to Cosmos Magazine, gender inequality may have originated around 8,000 years ago. This period marks significant societal changes, such as the development of agriculture, which may have contributed to gender disparities [^1].

2. **Long-term Trends**: The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) highlights that data from the Human Biological Record shows no long-term trend in women's status over the last 5,000 years, suggesting that gender inequality has been a persistent issue without significant improvement until recent times [^2].

3. **Historical Context**: Around Robin discusses how gender equality has been a long-standing issue, deeply rooted in civilization's history. It notes that while gender inequality has been prevalent for thousands of years, there has been a decline in recent times, indicating progress towards gender equality [^3].

## Limitations
The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not provide a comprehensive view of the historical context of gender inequality. Additionally, the lack of specific dates and detailed historical data in some sources limits the ability to pinpoint the exact origins and evolution of gender inequality. Further research, including archaeological and anthropological studies, would be beneficial to gain a more nuanced understanding of this complex issue.
