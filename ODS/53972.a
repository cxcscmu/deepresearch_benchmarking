The question of whether equity and common law should be fused is debated among scholars and legal practitioners. Some argue for the "fusion theory," which suggests that common law and equity should be codified into one unified system, while others warn against the "fusion fallacy," which suggests that merging them could lead to misunderstandings and misapplications of legal principles. The Judicature Acts have already merged them procedurally, but the debate continues on whether they should be substantively fused.
