Social media can provide a more positive experience for users by allowing them to connect and reconnect with others, overcoming barriers of distance and time. It can also inspire better health and well-being, both physically and mentally, and provide a platform for sharing meaningful information and positive stories that bring people together. Engaging with supportive friends and family and using social media to source useful information are additional ways to enhance the positive experience.
