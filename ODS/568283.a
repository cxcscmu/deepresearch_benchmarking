Gender inequality is a problem because it violates rights, limits participation in society, and leads to poorer health, economic, and social outcomes for individuals. It underpins many issues disproportionately affecting women and girls, such as domestic and sexual violence, lower pay, and lack of access to resources. Additionally, gender inequality holds back the growth of individuals, the development of countries, and the evolution of societies, disadvantaging both men and women.
