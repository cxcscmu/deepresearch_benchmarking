The context presents differing views on whether the government should have a say in abortion. Some sources argue that the government should not interfere in abortion decisions, emphasizing it as a matter of personal autonomy and human rights. Others highlight that abortion is a fundamental human right that should be nationally legalized, suggesting that its legality should not be left to individual states. Overall, the debate reflects a division between those advocating for federal non-interference and those supporting national legalization to protect reproductive rights.
