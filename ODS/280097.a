## Detailed Findings

1. **Mood Enhancement through Color and Style**: The colors and styles of clothing can significantly impact an individual's mood. Bright and cheerful colors are known to boost energy levels, while darker colors may have a more subdued effect. "The colors one chooses to wear can also impact the wearer's mood. Cheerful or bright colors have been known to boost one's energy" [^1].

2. **Confidence and Self-Perception**: Wearing certain types of clothing, such as nice undergarments or lingerie, can enhance self-confidence and self-perception. This effect is not necessarily for others to see but can be a personal boost. "Wearing nice undergarments or lingerie under your clothes 'just for yourself' can make you feel and look stronger, more confident, and sexier" [^2].

3. **Social Perception and Interaction**: Clothing sends various signals about an individual's personality, status, and interests, affecting how they are perceived by others. This can influence social interactions and the impressions one makes. "Our clothing sends many signals. Power, poverty, sexuality, and wealth are all obvious ways our clothing can define us" [^3].

4. **Physical Comfort and Mood**: The physical comfort of clothing also plays a role in mood regulation. Tight or restrictive clothing can lead to discomfort, irritability, and distraction, negatively impacting mood. "Physical discomfort caused by tight or restrictive clothing can lead to feelings of irritability and distraction, which can negatively impact mood" [^4].
