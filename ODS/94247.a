Ableism affects society by perpetuating discrimination and prejudice against people with disabilities, often viewing them as lesser or abnormal compared to nondisabled individuals. This leads to barriers in accessibility, social participation, and can result in bias and discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment, education, and healthcare. Ableism can also manifest in a patronizing desire to "cure" disabilities, further marginalizing those with disabilities.
