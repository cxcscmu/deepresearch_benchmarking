Human trafficking can be prevented through several measures, including raising awareness via social media, increasing training and education on the issue, and promoting online safety and situational awareness. Additionally, individuals can support prevention efforts by contacting the National Human Trafficking Hotline, participating in peaceful demonstrations, and advocating for policy changes by voting and writing to elected officials.
