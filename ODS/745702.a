The question of whether knowledge can be independent of culture is debated. Some argue that certain fields, like mathematics, may transcend cultural influences, suggesting that some knowledge can be independent of culture. However, others believe that all knowledge is influenced by cultural contexts, as it is often derived from or connected to cultural experiences and perspectives.
