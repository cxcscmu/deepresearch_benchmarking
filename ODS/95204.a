Fugitives often survive on the run by maintaining a low profile and avoiding contact with family and friends to prevent being traced. They may use anonymous corporations to set up apartments, cars, and bank accounts, allowing them to live almost entirely virtually. Additionally, they must be willing to abandon their previous lives and accept a significantly diminished quality of life.
