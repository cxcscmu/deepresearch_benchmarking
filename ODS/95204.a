# Report: How Fugitives Survive on the Run

## Executive Summary
Fugitives on the run employ a variety of strategies to evade capture and maintain their freedom. These strategies often involve severing ties with their past lives, adopting new identities, and utilizing both legal and illegal means to sustain themselves. Despite the challenges, many fugitives manage to survive for extended periods, although the risk of capture remains high due to various factors, including technological advancements and human error.

## Methodology
To gather information on how fugitives survive while on the run, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on Google and exploration of relevant articles and forums. The tools used included search engines and databases that provide access to news articles, personal accounts, and expert analyses on the subject.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Maintaining Anonymity and New Identities**: Fugitives often create new identities to avoid detection. This can involve setting up bank accounts and living arrangements under anonymous corporations. "Their apartments, cars and bank accounts can be set up under anonymous corporations. They can live almost entirely virtually" [^1].

2. **Severing Personal Ties**: A common reason fugitives are eventually caught is due to maintaining contact with family and friends. "The fugitive remains in contact with family members, friends, or acquaintances" [^2]. This contact can lead to their location being discovered by authorities.

3. **Adapting to a Diminished Lifestyle**: Surviving on the run often requires a willingness to accept a lower quality of life. "It's possible but there would need to be willingness to abandon your whole life and accept an extremely diminished quality of life" [^3]. This includes living in less desirable conditions and constantly being on alert.
