The effectiveness of counterterrorism measures can be attributed to their ability to prevent terror attacks and reduce casualties, as highlighted in studies examining post-9/11 U.S. counterterrorism policies. These measures often involve international cooperation, law enforcement operations, and strategies to combat financing of terrorism, which collectively contribute to enhancing security and stability. However, it is important to note that poorly implemented or overly draconian measures can be counterproductive.
