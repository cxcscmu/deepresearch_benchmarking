People who support overturning Roe v. Wade often argue that returning the decision on abortion to individual states would revive democracy by allowing citizens to advocate for laws at the state level. Additionally, some believe that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and that the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly protect the right to abortion, thus it should not be considered a federal constitutional right.
