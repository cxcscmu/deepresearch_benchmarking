# Report on Reasons for Overturning Roe v. Wade

## Executive Summary
The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has been a contentious issue in the United States, with various arguments presented by those advocating for its reversal. The primary reasons for overturning Roe v. Wade include returning the decision-making power to individual states, addressing perceived constitutional misinterpretations, and moral and ethical considerations regarding the sanctity of life. This report delves into these reasons, drawing from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the motivations behind the movement to overturn this landmark decision.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a targeted search was conducted using a combination of keywords such as "reasons to overturn Roe v. Wade," "Supreme Court decision on abortion," and "constitutional arguments against Roe v. Wade." The search was conducted using academic databases, legal analysis websites, and reputable news sources to ensure a balanced perspective. The findings were then synthesized to highlight the most prevalent arguments.

## Detailed Findings

1. **State Autonomy and Democratic Process**: One of the primary arguments for overturning Roe v. Wade is the belief that abortion laws should be determined by individual states rather than at the federal level. This perspective suggests that returning the decision to the states would enhance democratic engagement by allowing citizens to advocate for laws that reflect their values at the state level. As one source notes, "Returning abortion to the states would also help to revive democracy. Citizens should be going to their state capitols to advocate for laws" [^1].

2. **Constitutional Interpretation**: Critics of Roe v. Wade argue that the decision was based on a flawed interpretation of the Constitution, particularly the right to privacy implied in the 14th Amendment. They contend that this interpretation overstepped the bounds of judicial authority. According to the Brennan Center, "In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decided that the right to privacy implied in the 14th Amendment protected abortion as a fundamental right" [^2]. However, opponents argue that this was an overreach.

3. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: Many who support overturning Roe v. Wade do so from a moral standpoint, emphasizing the sanctity of life. They argue that the decision to allow abortion undermines the value of human life. The USCCB articulates this viewpoint by stating, "Many Americans, including members of Congress, believe or act as if Roe v. Wade and the U.S. Constitution have equal authority. They are wrong, both as to Roe's" [^3].
