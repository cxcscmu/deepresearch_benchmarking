Laws governing organ transplantation are necessary to ensure a safe, fair, and ethical system for the allocation, distribution, and transplantation of donated organs. They help protect the rights of donors and recipients, ensure equitable access to transplants, and maintain public trust in the organ donation system. Additionally, legislation provides a framework for healthcare personnel involved in the process, from donation to transplantation, to operate within established ethical and legal standards.
