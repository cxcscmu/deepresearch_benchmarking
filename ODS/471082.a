Gas prices are high primarily due to the cost of crude oil, which accounts for a significant portion of the price. Other contributing factors include refining costs, distribution and marketing expenses, and federal and state taxes. Additionally, global economic conditions, such as inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical events, can also impact gas prices.
