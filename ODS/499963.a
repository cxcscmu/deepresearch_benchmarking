The effectiveness of online learning compared to face-to-face learning varies depending on the context. Some sources, like a meta-analysis by the US Department of Education, suggest that students learn better in online classes on average. However, other studies indicate that traditional face-to-face teaching is more effective for skill development and academic performance. Online learning offers benefits such as flexibility and reduced energy consumption, but the best choice depends on individual needs and learning objectives.
