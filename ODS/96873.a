Doctors generally should not lie to their patients. Ethical guidelines, such as those from the American Medical Association, emphasize that physicians should not intentionally deceive patients. While some "white lies" might be considered relatively harmless, they are not strictly ethical and can be illegal if they cause harm to the patient or others.
