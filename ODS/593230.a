Opioids are a problem because they are highly addictive and can lead to opioid use disorder, which is a major driver of the drug overdose crisis. They trigger powerful reward centers in the brain, leading to addiction, and their use can result in extremely slow breathing, reducing oxygen to the brain, and potentially causing death. Additionally, opioid overprescription has been a significant factor in the opioid crisis, contributing to widespread addiction and overdose deaths.
