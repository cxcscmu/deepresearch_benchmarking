The 9/11 terrorist attacks significantly changed America in various ways. They led to a heightened focus on national security, resulting in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to protect against large-scale attacks. Public safety communications were transformed, and there was a shift in American immigration law enforcement towards border security. Additionally, the attacks had a profound cultural impact, permanently altering the way many Americans live and perceive security threats.
