Women took a prominent role in the reform movement primarily because they were denied the right to vote and sought to address social issues such as political corruption, economic and political equality, and social justice. Their involvement was also driven by a desire to improve the lives of individuals and to expand their sphere of activities beyond the home, as well as to engage with issues like abolition and education reform.
