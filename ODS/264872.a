The effectiveness of standardized tests is debated. Critics argue that standardized tests are inflexible and do not accurately measure student learning or development, as noted by sources like NEA and Britannica. They suggest that these tests are not valid measures of excellence or scholastic ability. However, proponents, such as the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, acknowledge that while not perfect, standardized tests have improved over time and can provide valuable insights into student progress by comparing scores over time.
