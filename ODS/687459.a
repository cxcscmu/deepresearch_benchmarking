Management greed can significantly influence budget decisions by prioritizing short-term gains over long-term stability. Greedy management might misallocate resources, favoring projects that benefit them personally or provide immediate incentives, rather than those that align with the company's long-term goals. This can lead to a focus on short-term profits and potentially harmful financial practices.
