Human activities, particularly the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, are the primary drivers of the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century. This consensus is supported by multiple authoritative sources, including NASA, the United Nations, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
