# Report: Human Responsibility for Climate Change

## Executive Summary
The overwhelming consensus among scientific communities and authoritative organizations is that human activities are the primary drivers of climate change. This conclusion is supported by extensive research and data showing that the increase in greenhouse gases, primarily from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, is significantly altering the Earth's climate. This report synthesizes findings from various reputable sources to confirm the human impact on climate change.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using a variety of scientific and educational resources. The search strategy involved identifying authoritative sources that discuss the causes of climate change, focusing on those that specifically address human contributions. Tools used included academic databases and reputable websites such as NASA, the United Nations, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

## Detailed Findings
1. **Human Activity and Greenhouse Gases**: According to NASA, "Human Activity Is the Cause of Increased Greenhouse Gas Concentrations. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)"[^2]. This increase in greenhouse gases is a major factor in global warming.

2. **Scientific Consensus**: The United Nations states, "Humans are responsible for global warming. Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years"[^7]. This highlights the broad agreement among scientists regarding human responsibility for climate change.

3. **Impact of Human Activities**: The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) outlines that "Humans are the main cause of climate change â€” burning fossil fuels, producing livestock, clearing trees and otherwise increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"[^8]. These activities contribute significantly to the enhanced greenhouse effect, leading to climate change.

## Limitations
The report is based on available data up to October 2023, and some sources may have more recent updates that are not included. Additionally, while the consensus is strong, there are always ongoing studies that may provide new insights into the nuances of climate change and human impact. The report focuses on widely accepted scientific views and does not delve into less mainstream theories or opinions.
