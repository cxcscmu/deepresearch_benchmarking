In healthcare, the terms "interdisciplinary," "multidisciplinary," and "interprofessional" describe different types of team approaches. An interdisciplinary team involves professionals from various disciplines working interdependently in the same setting to provide comprehensive care. A multidisciplinary team consists of professionals from different disciplines working independently but in parallel, each contributing their expertise. Interprofessional teams require more flexible attitudes towards discipline-specific roles and responsibilities, emphasizing collaboration across different professional backgrounds.
