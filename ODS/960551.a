# Report on the Assassination of Anwar Sadat

## Executive Summary

Anwar Sadat, the third President of Egypt, was assassinated on October 6, 1981, during a military parade in Cairo. The assassination was carried out by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a radical Islamist group. The primary motive behind the assassination was Sadat's peace treaty with Israel, which was perceived as a betrayal by many in the Arab and Islamic world. This report delves into the reasons behind Sadat's assassination, the events leading up to it, and its aftermath.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including Wikipedia, History.com, and Brookings Institution articles. The search focused on credible sources that provide detailed accounts of the events surrounding Sadat's assassination. The information was cross-referenced to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Peace Treaty with Israel**: One of the primary reasons for Sadat's assassination was his decision to sign the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979. This treaty was seen as a betrayal by many Arab nations and Islamist groups, as it was perceived to prioritize Egypt's national interests over Arab unity and the Palestinian cause. "The peace treaty was also one of the primary factors that led to his assassination; on 6 October 1981, militants led by Khalid Al-Islambuli opened fire on Sadat" [^1].

2. **Opposition from Islamist Groups**: Sadat's policies, particularly his peace initiatives with Israel, angered various Islamist factions within Egypt. These groups, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, viewed Sadat's actions as contrary to Islamic principles. "Islamic extremists assassinate Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt, as he reviews troops on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War" [^2].

3. **Internal Political Tensions**: Sadat's presidency was marked by significant internal unrest. In the months leading up to his assassination, Sadat had ordered a crackdown on opposition figures, which included the arrest of many Islamist leaders. This increased his unpopularity among certain factions. "Following a failed military coup in June 1981, Sadat ordered a major crackdown that resulted in the arrest of numerous opposition figures" [^3].
