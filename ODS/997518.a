The effectiveness of carbon credits is debated. Some experts, like those at MIT, suggest that carbon credits can be effective under certain circumstances if thoroughly evaluated. However, other sources, such as the Sierra Club and Carbon Brief, indicate that carbon offsets have had a negligible impact on emissions and may not have significantly reduced deforestation or changed forest management practices. Overall, the effectiveness of carbon credits depends on the integrity and implementation of the projects involved.
