To help stop human trafficking, you can raise awareness through social media using hashtags like #endtrafficking, educate yourself and others about the facts, seek help from appropriate organizations, increase training on the issue, and support those at risk. Additionally, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline for assistance or to report potential trafficking situations.
