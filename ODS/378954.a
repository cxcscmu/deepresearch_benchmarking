## Methodology

To compile this report, a targeted search was conducted using online databases and search engines to identify credible sources discussing strategies to combat human trafficking. The search focused on government websites, educational institutions, and reputable organizations involved in anti-trafficking efforts. The selected sources were analyzed to extract key recommendations and strategies.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Raising Awareness and Education**: One of the primary strategies to combat human trafficking is through education and awareness campaigns. The State Department suggests using social media platforms to raise awareness, employing hashtags like #endtrafficking and #freedomfirst to spread the message[^1]. Similarly, the University of Nevada emphasizes the importance of online safety and situational awareness as foundational steps in prevention[^2].

2. **Support and Resources for Victims**: Providing support and resources for victims is crucial. The National Human Trafficking Hotline offers a lifeline for victims, providing a means to seek help through calls, texts, or online chats[^3]. This service connects victims with necessary resources and support networks.

Our Rescue encourages individuals to vote, write to elected officials, and participate in peaceful demonstrations to influence policy and legislative changes[^4].
