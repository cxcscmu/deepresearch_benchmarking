No, the United States healthcare system is not truly a free and market-based system. Multiple sources, including the Cato at Liberty Blog and Open Health Policy, indicate that the US healthcare system is not based on unfettered market principles and that the idea of a "free market" in US healthcare is a myth. The system involves significant regulation and government involvement, contrary to the notion of a purely free-market system.
