# Gender Pay Gap: Why Women Earn Less Than Men

## Executive Summary

The gender pay gap remains a persistent issue globally, with women earning less than men across various sectors and regions. Despite progress in education and workforce participation, the gap has only slightly narrowed over the past decades. This report explores the reasons behind the gender pay gap, its impact, and potential solutions to address this inequality.

## Methodology

To gather information on the gender pay gap, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, organizational reports, and news publications. The search focused on recent data and analyses to provide an up-to-date understanding of the issue. Key search terms included "gender pay gap," "women earnings," and "income inequality."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Definition and Current Status**: The gender pay gap is defined as the difference in earnings between women and men, often expressed as a percentage of men's earnings. In the U.S., women earned an average of 85% of what men earned in 2024, according to a Pew Research analysis[^1]. This gap has narrowed slightly over the past two decades but remains significant.

2. **Contributing Factors**: Several factors contribute to the gender pay gap, including occupational segregation, differences in work experience, and discrimination. According to the American Progress report, "The gender wage gap is driven by a variety of factors, including differences in industries and jobs worked, education and experience, and discrimination"[^2].

3. **Global Perspective**: The issue is not confined to the U.S. In the European Union, women earn on average 12% less per hour than men[^3]. Globally, women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, highlighting a widespread issue of income inequality[^4].
