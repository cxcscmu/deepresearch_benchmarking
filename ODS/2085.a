Women earn less than men due to a variety of factors, including unequal gender norms, racial disparities, and differences in economic opportunities. These disparities often begin before women enter the workplace and persist due to systemic issues such as discrimination, occupational segregation, and differences in work experience and hours worked. Additionally, women are more likely to take career breaks for caregiving, which can impact their earnings over time.
