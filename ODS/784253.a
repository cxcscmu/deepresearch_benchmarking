Culture affects food choices by influencing the types of foods people select, the cooking styles they use, and the eating patterns they follow. Cultural beliefs, religious practices, and traditions can dictate what foods are considered acceptable or preferred, as well as when and how they are consumed. Additionally, cultural background can impact food-related etiquette and the role food plays in social and religious contexts.
