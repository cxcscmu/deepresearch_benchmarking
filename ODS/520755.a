Attachment theory can help social workers by providing a framework to understand the risks and protective factors in people's lives, which can be crucial in assessing and supporting families. It allows social workers to use attachment styles and working models in assessment and treatment, helping clients achieve a secure attachment style and improve their relationships. Additionally, it aids in understanding how early experiences shape current relationships, which can be beneficial in therapy and case management.
