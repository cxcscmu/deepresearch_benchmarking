## Executive Summary

The debate over the removal of Confederate statues has intensified in recent years, particularly in the wake of social justice movements.

They believe that removing these monuments is a step towards acknowledging and rectifying historical injustices. Conversely, opponents argue that these statues are a part of history and their removal could lead to a loss of historical context. This report explores the arguments for the removal of Confederate statues, highlighting the perspectives of various stakeholders.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources that discuss the historical, social, and ethical implications of Confederate statue removal. Key search terms included "Confederate statues removal," "historical monuments debate," and "racial implications of Confederate symbols." Sources were selected based on their relevance and the diversity of perspectives they offered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Symbols of Racial Oppression**: Confederate monuments are often seen as symbols of racial oppression. According to a Stanford Report, these monuments have become "political flashpoints, with some demanding their removal as symbols of racial oppression"[^1]. This perspective is rooted in the belief that these statues glorify a past that upheld slavery and segregation.

2. **Reinforcement of Racist Ideals**: The scholarly consensus suggests that the original intent of Confederate monuments was to reinforce racist ideals. The Society of Architectural Historians states, "the original intent of monuments to the Confederacy was to reinforce racist ideals"[^2]. This historical context supports the argument that their presence in public spaces perpetuates outdated and harmful ideologies.

3. **Educational Opportunities**: Some argue that removing these statues can lead to more comprehensive educational opportunities. The National Trust for Historic Preservation notes that "when removed, these monuments can provide an even deeper understanding of history in other venues, such as museums, that can offer fuller and more inclusive narratives"[^3]. This suggests that relocation rather than destruction can serve educational purposes while addressing public concerns.
