Confederate statues are often removed because they are seen as symbols of racial oppression and were originally intended to reinforce racist ideals. These monuments are viewed as glorifying figures who embraced racial hierarchy, treason, and slavery, which many believe should not be celebrated in public spaces. Removing them allows for a more inclusive understanding of history and addresses the concerns of those who see them as perpetuating a racist ideology.
