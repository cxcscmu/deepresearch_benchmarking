# Taxation Perceptions in the United States

## Executive Summary

Recent surveys and polls reveal a complex landscape of American perceptions regarding taxation. A significant portion of the population feels that their tax burden is excessive and unfair, with particular dissatisfaction directed towards the perceived inequities in the tax contributions of corporations and wealthy individuals. While there is some variation in opinions over time, the general sentiment leans towards a belief that the tax system is not equitable or efficient.

## Methodology

To gather insights on American perceptions of taxation, I utilized a combination of recent survey data and opinion polls from reputable sources such as Gallup, Pew Research Center, and AP-NORC. The search strategy involved identifying key themes related to fairness, tax burden, and the perceived efficiency of tax dollar usage. Tools used included online databases and search engines to access the latest reports and articles on the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Perception of Fairness**: A Gallup poll from May 2023 indicates that a new high of 51% of Americans believe their income taxes are not fair[^1]. This sentiment is echoed in a 2024 Gallup report, where 47% of respondents felt their taxes were unfair[^2].

2. **Tax Burden**: According to an AP-NORC poll, a majority of U.S. taxpayers feel they pay too much in taxes, with many expressing that they receive poor value in return[^3]. Similarly, a CBS News report highlights that only about 27% of taxpayers believe their federal income taxes are fair, with 60% believing their burden is too high[^4].

3. **Equity Concerns**: A Pew Research Center article from April 2024 reveals that a majority of Americans feel that corporations and wealthy individuals do not pay their fair share in taxes[^5]. This concern is consistent with findings from 2023, where 56% of Americans felt their tax contributions were more than their fair share given the returns from the federal government[^6].

## Limitations

The findings are based on survey data, which can be influenced by the phrasing of questions and the timing of the survey. Additionally, the data reflects perceptions, which may not always align with actual tax policies or economic realities. The reports primarily focus on federal income taxes, potentially overlooking state and local tax perceptions. Furthermore, the data is limited to the United States and may not reflect global perspectives on taxation.
