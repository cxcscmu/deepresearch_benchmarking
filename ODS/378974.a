The United States' response to the Holocaust was complex and has been criticized for being insufficient. While some Americans protested against Nazism and there were efforts by individuals and organizations to publicize the Holocaust, there was no sustained, nationwide effort to oppose the Nazi treatment of Jews. The U.S. government did not welcome Jewish refugees, with 83% of Americans opposed to admitting them in 1939. Despite some public protests and individual acts of heroism, the overall response was limited by economic concerns, xenophobia, and antisemitism.
