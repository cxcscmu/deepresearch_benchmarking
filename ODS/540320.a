## Detailed Findings

### Advantages of Globalization

1. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: Globalization promotes free trade, which can lead to global economic growth, job creation, and increased competitiveness among companies. It also lowers prices for consumers by providing access to a wider range of goods and services [^1].
