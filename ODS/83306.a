In the 1800s, slavery in the United States was a thriving institution, particularly in the Southern states. Enslaved African Americans were primarily forced to work on small farms and large plantations, with legal codes becoming increasingly harsh. The economy of the era was heavily reliant on slavery, and the enslaved population was able to increase its numbers through natural reproduction.
