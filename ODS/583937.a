Outsourcing affects employees in several ways. It can lead to cost savings for companies, which might be reinvested in employee benefits and training programs. However, it can also raise concerns about job security among employees, as they may feel threatened by the potential for their roles to be outsourced. Additionally, outsourced workers often earn less than non-outsourced workers doing the same jobs, and outsourcing can impact company culture by making employees feel they are being replaced.
