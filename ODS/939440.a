Perception affects behavior by acting as a filter through which we interpret reality, guiding our decisions and actions. It influences our behavior reflexively, as we tend to act according to the things we perceive. Additionally, social perception can automatically influence behavior, sometimes without our conscious awareness, by increasing the likelihood of performing actions we have recently perceived.
