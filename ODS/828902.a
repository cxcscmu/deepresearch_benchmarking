# Report on the Prevalence of Spousal Abuse

## Executive Summary

Spousal abuse, also known as intimate partner violence (IPV), is a significant public health issue affecting millions globally. It encompasses various forms of abuse, including physical, emotional, sexual, and economic. The prevalence of spousal abuse is alarmingly high, with statistics indicating that a substantial portion of the population experiences such violence at some point in their lives. This report synthesizes current data to provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence and nature of spousal abuse.

## Methodology

To gather information on the prevalence of spousal abuse, a systematic search was conducted using online databases and reputable websites. The search focused on recent statistics and reports from authoritative sources. Tools used included Google Search and academic databases like NCBI Bookshelf. Keywords such as "spousal abuse prevalence," "domestic violence statistics," and "intimate partner violence" were employed to locate relevant data.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Prevalence Rates**: According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, "an average of 24 people per minute are victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the United States," which translates to more than 12 million individuals annually [^1].

2. **Gender Disparities**: The majority of IPV victims are women. Healthline reports that "while intimate partner violence can affect men and women, more often than not, women are the targets of serious physical abuse and sexual violence" [^2]. This is corroborated by data from Emory University, which states that "eighty-five percent of IPV victims are women" [^3].

3. **Underreporting and Hidden Nature**: Domestic abuse is often underreported. Women's Aid highlights that "domestic abuse is a largely hidden crime, occurring primarily at home," and many women do not report or disclose abuse to authorities [^4].

## Limitations

The data on spousal abuse is often limited by underreporting, as many victims do not come forward due to fear, stigma, or lack of resources. Additionally, variations in definitions and methodologies across studies can lead to discrepancies in reported statistics. Cultural and regional differences also affect the prevalence and reporting of spousal abuse, making it challenging to obtain a comprehensive global picture.
