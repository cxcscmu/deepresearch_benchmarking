The search results do not provide a direct answer to why the cost of the death penalty might be considered worth it. Instead, they focus on the high costs associated with the death penalty, such as longer trials, appeals, and extensive legal processes, which make it more expensive than life imprisonment. If you are looking for arguments in favor of the death penalty, such as justice or deterrence, those are not covered in the provided context.
