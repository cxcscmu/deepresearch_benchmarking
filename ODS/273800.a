Slavery ended through a combination of legal, political, and social changes. In the United States, it was officially abolished with the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, following the Civil War. In other parts of the world, slavery was abolished at different times through legislation and treaties, often influenced by abolitionist movements and changing economic and social conditions.
