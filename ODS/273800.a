# Report on the End of Slavery in the United States

## Executive Summary

The abolition of slavery in the United States was a complex process that culminated in the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865. This amendment legally abolished slavery nationwide, following a series of legislative and military actions during and after the American Civil War. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, was a pivotal step that declared the freedom of slaves in Confederate states. However, it was the Thirteenth Amendment that formally ended the institution of slavery across the entire country. The journey to abolition was marked by significant political, social, and military efforts, reflecting the deep divisions and eventual reconciliation within the nation.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Thirteenth Amendment**: The Thirteenth Amendment was a critical legal instrument that abolished slavery in the United States. It was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865. The amendment states, "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction" [^1].

2. **Emancipation Proclamation**: Issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate states were to be set free. This was a strategic war measure that aimed to weaken the Confederacy and bolster the Union's moral cause. "On January 1, 1863, the Proclamation changed the legal status under federal law of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the secessionist Confederate states from enslaved to free" [^2].

3. **Juneteenth**: On June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced General Order No. 3, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in Texas, the last Confederate state with institutionalized slavery. This day has since been celebrated as a significant milestone in the abolition of slavery and was declared a federal holiday in 2021 [^3].
