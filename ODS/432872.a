# Report on Interprofessional Collaboration During Patient Transitions

## Executive Summary

Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is crucial during patient transitions, such as moving from hospital to home care, to ensure continuity and quality of care. Various strategies are employed by healthcare facilities to promote IPC, including regular interdisciplinary meetings, the use of case managers, and structured communication protocols. These strategies aim to enhance team dynamics and improve patient outcomes.

## Methodology

To gather information on how facilities promote interprofessional collaboration during patient transitions, I conducted a search using online academic databases and educational platforms. The search focused on articles and discussions related to healthcare practices, specifically those involving IPC during patient transitions. The tools used included Google Scholar, PubMed Central, and educational resources like Chegg and Course Hero.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Regular Interdisciplinary Meetings**: Many facilities hold regular interdisciplinary meetings that involve all healthcare professionals involved in a patient's care. These meetings provide a platform for team members to collaborate and plan the best possible care for patients. "This allows everyone to collaborate together at one time in one room to discuss and plan the best possible care for that patient" [^1].

2. **Role of Case Managers**: The use of case managers is a common strategy to coordinate care during patient transitions. Case managers help in assessing and intervening in patient care, ensuring that all aspects of the patient's needs are addressed. "The most common clinical strategies were to use interprofessional assessment and intervention and to have a case manager to coordinate care" [^2].

3. **Structured Communication Protocols**: Effective communication is a cornerstone of IPC. Facilities often implement structured communication protocols to ensure that all team members are informed and aligned on patient care plans. "Effective interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is understood as another complementary intervention to increase team dynamics and improve the patient's outcomes" [^3].

## Limitations

The findings are based on available online resources and may not cover all possible strategies employed by different healthcare facilities. Additionally, the information is limited to what is publicly accessible and may not reflect the most current practices in all settings. The search was also constrained by the availability of full-text articles and the specificity of the search terms used.
