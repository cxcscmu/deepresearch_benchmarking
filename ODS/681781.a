## Detailed Findings

1. **Public Policy and Citizen Participation**: Political ideology influences public policy by reflecting the attitudes and beliefs of citizens who engage in the political process. As these attitudes evolve, so do the policies, indicating a dynamic relationship between ideology and policymaking. "Public policy reflects the attitudes and beliefs of the citizens who choose to participate in politics at that time, and so policies change over the years" [^1].

Different political parties advocate for policies that align with their ideological beliefs, which can lead to varied policy outcomes. "They advocate for specific policies aligned with their beliefs, contributing to the negotiation process in government decision-making" [^2].

3. **State-Level Policy Differences**: Ideological differences are evident at the state level, where Democratic and Republican governors implement distinct policies. Democratic governors tend to favor more expansionary and liberal policies, while Republican governors often pursue conservative approaches. "Ideology-induced policies are prevalent at the state level: Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than Republican" [^3].

Additionally, the sources vary in their depth and focus, with some providing more general overviews rather than detailed analyses. The absence of recent data from 2023 in some sources may also limit the current applicability of the findings. Further research with a broader range of academic and empirical studies would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.
