# Report on Rising Used Car Prices in 2025

## Executive Summary

In 2025, the used car market is experiencing a significant rise in prices. This trend is driven by a combination of factors including tariffs on new cars, a persistent low supply of used vehicles, and lingering effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. These elements have collectively contributed to a challenging market environment for both buyers and sellers.

## Methodology

To gather information on the rising used car prices, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search strategy included reviewing recent articles, market analyses, and expert opinions from reputable sources such as USA Today, Kelley Blue Book, and TheStreet. The search focused on identifying the key reasons behind the price increase and understanding the broader market implications.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact of Tariffs**: A significant factor contributing to the rise in used car prices is the imposition of tariffs on new cars. President Trump implemented a 25% tariff on all new cars entering the country starting April 3, 2025. This has led to increased prices for new cars, subsequently driving up demand and prices for used cars as consumers seek more affordable alternatives [^1].

2. **Supply Constraints**: The supply of used cars remains low, a situation exacerbated by the pandemic. According to Kelley Blue Book, "The increase came as a result of low supply of used cars. The nationwide used car supply will likely remain thin for years" [^2]. This scarcity is a result of reduced production during the pandemic and ongoing supply chain disruptions.

3. **Pandemic Aftereffects**: The COVID-19 pandemic had a lasting impact on the automotive industry. As noted by TheStreet, "During the pandemic, new car prices spiked when automotive factories closed, and production fell short of demand" [^3]. This created a backlog that continues to affect the market, with consumers now facing higher prices for both new and used vehicles.
