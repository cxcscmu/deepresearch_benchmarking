Humans have caused global warming primarily by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has been done through activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), deforestation, and industrial processes, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. These activities amplify Earth's natural greenhouse effect, leading to a rise in global temperatures.
