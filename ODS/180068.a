# Report on Human Contributions to Global Warming

## Executive Summary

Human activities have significantly contributed to global warming, primarily through the release of greenhouse gases. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and leading to a rise in Earth's average temperature. This report synthesizes information from various authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive overview of how human actions have driven climate change.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a targeted search was conducted using online databases and search engines to identify credible sources discussing human contributions to global warming. The search focused on authoritative websites and publications, including government agencies, scientific organizations, and environmental advocacy groups. The selected sources were analyzed to extract relevant information and direct quotes that illustrate the impact of human activities on climate change.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Burning of Fossil Fuels**: The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. According to NASA, "Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide"[^1].

2. **Deforestation and Land Use Changes**: The removal of forests for agriculture and urban development reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. The European Commission notes that "cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature"[^2].

3. **Industrial and Agricultural Activities**: Industrial processes and agricultural practices release significant amounts of greenhouse gases. The NRDC highlights that "Transportation, Electricity generation, Industry & manufacturing, Agriculture, Oil & gas development, Buildings" are key human-driven causes of climate change[^3].
