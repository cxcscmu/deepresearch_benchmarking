# Report: What Drives Innovation

## Executive Summary
Innovation is a multifaceted process influenced by various factors, including intellectual property rights, historical events, education, and state involvement. Understanding these drivers is crucial for businesses and policymakers aiming to foster innovation. This report synthesizes insights from recent literature and expert opinions to identify key drivers of innovation.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and reputable online sources. The search focused on identifying articles and papers that discuss the drivers of innovation. Tools such as Google Scholar and ScienceDirect were utilized to access peer-reviewed articles, while additional insights were gathered from industry blogs and expert commentaries.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Intellectual Property Rights and Technical Change**: According to a paper from Harvard Business School, innovation is significantly driven by intellectual property rights institutions and the supply-side of technical change. These elements create an environment conducive to innovation by protecting inventors and encouraging investment in new technologies [^1].

2. **Historical Events and Technological Opportunities**: An article from ScienceDirect highlights that many innovations arise in response to discrete historical events and specific problems, as well as new technological opportunities. This suggests that innovation is often reactive, driven by the need to solve pressing issues or capitalize on emerging technologies [^2].

3. **Role of Education and State Involvement**: William H. Janeway, writing for Project Syndicate, emphasizes the role of the state as a prime mover in technological progress since industrialization. Additionally, education is identified as a fundamental driver, providing the necessary skills and knowledge base for innovation [^3].
