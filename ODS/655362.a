Innovation is driven by several key factors, including intellectual property rights institutions, the supply-side of technical change, education, the rule of law, and responses to discrete events and history-specific problems. Additionally, internal business factors such as reconfiguring a company's message or making changes to products, processes, and organization can also drive innovation.
