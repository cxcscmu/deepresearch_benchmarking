Propaganda played a crucial role in Hitler's rise to power by shaping public opinion and reinforcing Nazi ideology. It was used to portray Jews and Communists as enemies of the German people, thereby justifying their persecution. Joseph Goebbels, as the Minister of Propaganda, was instrumental in disseminating Nazi messages through various media, which helped to consolidate Hitler's control over Germany and facilitate the Nazi Party's ascent.
