Police discretion is influenced by several factors, including the desire to maintain a certain public image, the location where officers perform their duties, their personal beliefs and values, legal factors, the nature of the offense, legal constraints, and officer experience. Additionally, the Theory of Planned Behavior suggests that police intentions to make discretionary decisions, such as referrals to treatment, are also influenced by these factors.
