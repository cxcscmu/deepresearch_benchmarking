# Report on Why Capital Punishment Should Be Banned

## Executive Summary
Capital punishment, commonly known as the death penalty, is a contentious issue with strong arguments for its abolition. The primary reasons for banning capital punishment include its violation of fundamental human rights, its ineffectiveness as a deterrent, and its inherent cruelty. Various human rights organizations and advocacy groups argue that the death penalty is inhumane and unjust, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities and failing to deliver the justice it purports to provide.

## Methodology
To gather information on the reasons for banning capital punishment, I utilized a combination of online search strategies, focusing on reputable human rights organizations and scholarly articles. The search was conducted using keywords such as "death penalty abolition," "capital punishment human rights," and "arguments against the death penalty." The primary tools used were Google Search and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Violation of Human Rights**: The death penalty is widely criticized for breaching fundamental human rights, particularly the right to life and the prohibition against torture. Amnesty International states, "The death penalty breaches human rights, in particular the right to life and the right to live free from torture" [^1]. This perspective is echoed by other human rights organizations, emphasizing the inalienable nature of these rights.

2. **Cruel and Inhuman Punishment**: The death penalty is often described as a cruel and inhuman form of punishment. According to a report by Amnesty International, "The UDHR categorically states that 'No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'" [^2]. This aligns with the view that capital punishment is inherently degrading and fails to respect human dignity.

3. **Ineffectiveness as a Deterrent**: There is significant debate over the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime. While some argue that it deters crime due to the fear of death, evidence supporting this claim is inconclusive. The Death Penalty Information Center notes, "Capital punishment is likely to deter more than other punishments because people fear death more than anything else" [^3]. However, this assertion is contested by numerous studies and experts who argue that the death penalty does not effectively prevent crime.

## Limitations
The report is limited by the availability of up-to-date data and the potential bias of sources advocating for the abolition of the death penalty. Additionally, the complexity of legal and ethical arguments surrounding capital punishment means that not all perspectives may be fully represented. Further research, including empirical studies and diverse viewpoints, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
