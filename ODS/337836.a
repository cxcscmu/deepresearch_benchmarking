# Global Warming: An Overview

## Executive Summary

Global warming is a critical environmental issue characterized by the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. This phenomenon is primarily driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which enhance the natural greenhouse effect. The consequences of global warming are far-reaching, impacting weather patterns, sea levels, and biodiversity.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of authoritative sources and scientific literature available online. The search strategy involved querying reputable environmental and scientific organizations' websites, such as NASA, the United Nations, and the NRDC, to gather comprehensive and up-to-date information on the causes and effects of global warming.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The primary driver of global warming is the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space, thus warming the planet. According to the NRDC, "Global warming results from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the earth's atmosphere" [^1].

2. **Human Activities**: Human activities significantly contribute to the enhanced greenhouse effect. The United Nations notes that "burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures" [^2]. Additionally, deforestation and industrial processes further exacerbate the accumulation of these gases.

3. **Natural Phenomena**: While human activities are the primary cause, natural phenomena also play a role in climate variability. The NRDC acknowledges that "some amount of climate change can be attributed to natural phenomena," such as volcanic eruptions and solar radiation fluctuations [^3]. However, these natural factors are not sufficient to explain the rapid warming observed in recent decades.

## Limitations

This report is based on available online resources and may not encompass all recent scientific findings due to the dynamic nature of climate research. Additionally, the absence of specific publication dates for some sources may affect the currency of the information. Further research and continuous monitoring of scientific publications are recommended to stay updated on this evolving topic.
