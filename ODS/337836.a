Global warming occurs due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space, which leads to a rise in global temperatures. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and farming livestock, significantly contribute to the increase in these greenhouse gases.
