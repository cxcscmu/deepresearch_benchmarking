Prices are going up primarily due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have led companies to raise prices in response to increased costs. These tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for a range of products, including a 2.8% overall increase in food prices, with fresh produce seeing a 4% rise. Additionally, these tariffs can contribute to inflationary pressure, combining high prices with potential economic challenges like stagflation.
