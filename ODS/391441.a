Socialized medicine is a system where the government owns and operates healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals are government employees. In this system, the government provides healthcare services to all citizens, typically funded through taxation. This model aims to ensure that healthcare is accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.
