Adjustment to late-life divorce is often more difficult for women due to several factors. Women may experience higher levels of psychological distress, as indicated by increased antidepressant use, and they may face unique challenges such as financial insecurity and the loss of a life partner, which can be emotionally devastating. Additionally, women often assume more caregiving roles, which can impact their career and financial stability, making the transition after divorce more challenging.
