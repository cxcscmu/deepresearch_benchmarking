Atypical development in children can impact various areas of development, including delayed physical development, gross motor skills, emotional, and social skills. It can also slow down growth in other areas of a child's life, such as language development, if a child cannot speak any words by 15 or 16 months. Additionally, atypical development may present unusual patterns that adversely affect a child's overall development.
