The impact of birth order on personality is debated. Some theories, like Adler's, suggest that birth order can influence traits such as responsibility in firstborns and a desire for attention in middle children. However, research, including a study published in PMC, indicates that birth order has little to no effect on personality traits, except for intelligence and self-reported intellect.
