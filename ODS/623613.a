The Reggio Emilia Approach, originating in Reggio Emilia, Italy, after World War II, has evolved over the years into a community-constructed system that emphasizes collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Initially envisioned by Loris Malaguzzi in the 1940s, it has incorporated influences from various sociological and academic ideas, supporting the independence of young children and focusing on a child-centered approach to early childhood education.
