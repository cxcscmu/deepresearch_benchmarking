## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on available online sources, which may not cover all aspects of the Reggio Emilia Approach's evolution comprehensively. Additionally, some sources may not be up-to-date, and the lack of specific publication dates for some articles could affect the timeliness of the information. Further research, including academic journals and books, would provide a more in-depth understanding of the approach's development.
