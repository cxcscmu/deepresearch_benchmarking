# Report: Should Central Banks Issue Digital Currency?

## Executive Summary

The question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies is a topic of significant debate among economists and policymakers. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have the potential to transform the financial landscape by improving payment systems, enhancing financial inclusion, and offering protection against financial fraud. However, their introduction also poses challenges, such as impacts on interest rates and economic activity. This report synthesizes current research and perspectives on the potential benefits and drawbacks of CBDCs.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and financial publications. The search focused on recent studies and articles discussing the implications of central banks issuing digital currencies. Key sources were selected based on their relevance and the depth of analysis provided on the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Financial Inclusion and Payment Systems**: One of the primary arguments in favor of CBDCs is their potential to enhance financial inclusion and improve payment systems. According to the Economics Observatory, "Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could improve payment systems, promote financial inclusion, protect against financial fraud" [^1]. This suggests that CBDCs could provide a more accessible and secure financial infrastructure.

2. **Economic Activity and Welfare**: Several studies have examined the broader economic implications of CBDCs. A paper from the Philadelphia Fed notes, "We study how the introduction of central bank digital currency affects interest rates, the level of economic activity, and welfare" [^2]. This indicates that while CBDCs could influence economic variables, the overall impact on welfare remains a critical consideration.

3. **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights the complexity of implementing CBDCs, proposing a framework for decision-making under uncertainty. The IMF states, "This paper proposes a dynamic decision-making framework under which the central bank can make decisions under uncertainty" [^3]. This underscores the need for careful planning and analysis before adopting CBDCs.

## Limitations

This report is based on a limited selection of sources and may not capture all perspectives on the issue. The rapidly evolving nature of digital currencies means that new research and data could alter the current understanding of CBDCs. Additionally, the specific economic and regulatory contexts of different countries may lead to varied outcomes from the implementation of CBDCs, which this report does not fully explore.
