Privacy legislation plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of both employers and employees. From the employer's perspective, these laws help define the boundaries of monitoring and managing their workforce, ensuring that any data collection or surveillance is conducted within legal limits. For employees, privacy legislation protects their rights to be free from unnecessary monitoring and intrusion, safeguarding their personal information and ensuring that their privacy is respected in the workplace.
