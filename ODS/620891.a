## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on publicly available sources, which may not capture the full scope of private or less-publicized contributions by wealthy countries. Additionally, the data and recommendations are subject to change as global economic conditions and health priorities evolve. The lack of a universally accepted standard for contributions also means that recommendations can vary significantly between sources.
