The question of whether the death penalty should be reintroduced is a subject of significant debate. Proponents argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime and provides justice for victims, as highlighted by sources like the White House and Britannica. Opponents, such as Amnesty International, argue against it, advocating for its abolition worldwide due to ethical concerns and the risk of wrongful executions. The decision to reintroduce the death penalty involves weighing these arguments and considering the ethical, legal, and social implications.
