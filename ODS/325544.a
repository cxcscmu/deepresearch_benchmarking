# Report on Why People Leave Their Jobs

## Executive Summary

Employee turnover is a significant concern for organizations, impacting productivity and morale. Understanding why employees leave their jobs is crucial for developing strategies to improve retention. Common reasons include lack of career advancement, inadequate compensation, and poor workplace culture. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the factors influencing employees' decisions to quit.

## Methodology

To gather information on why people leave their jobs, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on Google and database queries on platforms like Harvard Business Review, Indeed, and Pew Research. The tools used included web browsers and access to online databases to ensure a wide range of perspectives and data points were considered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Lack of Career Advancement**: A significant factor driving employees to leave is the absence of clear career progression. According to Forbes, "No clear career pathâ€”This is the top reason employees leave. Nearly one-quarter (24%) don't see future opportunities in the organization" [^1].

2. **Inadequate Compensation**: Financial dissatisfaction is a common reason for job changes. The Pew Research Center highlights that "low pay, a lack of opportunities for advancement and feeling disrespected at work are the top reasons why Americans quit their jobs" [^2].

3. **Workplace Culture and Respect**: Employees often leave due to negative workplace environments. A Reddit user shared, "For me, almost every single move has come down to the company culture. No job is worth going home in tears no matter how much it pays" [^3].
