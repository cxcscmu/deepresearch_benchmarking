Social class significantly affects education by influencing educational opportunities and outcomes. Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often face challenges such as reduced access to advanced courses, higher dropout rates, and slower academic skills development. These disparities are compounded by factors like chronic stress and low literacy, which can hinder educational achievement from an early age. Conversely, students from higher social classes generally have greater educational opportunities and are more likely to achieve higher academic success.
