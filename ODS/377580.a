The Central Powers lost World War I due to several key factors: the Allied naval blockade caused severe food and raw material shortages, their allies like Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were defeated, and there were significant logistical issues such as breakdowns in transportation. Additionally, the Central Powers faced internal challenges like mass starvation and a lack of imports, which weakened their war effort and morale.
