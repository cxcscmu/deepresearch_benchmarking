Climate change affects food supply by disrupting food availability, reducing access to food, and impacting food quality. It leads to increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and storms, which can reduce crop yields and affect livestock and fisheries. These changes can result in reduced food supplies and increased food prices.
