# Climate Change and Its Impact on Food Supply

## Executive Summary

Climate change poses significant challenges to global food supply by affecting agricultural productivity, food availability, and food quality. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are key factors that disrupt food systems. These changes threaten food security by reducing crop yields, affecting livestock, and impacting fisheries. As a result, food prices may rise, and access to food may become more limited, exacerbating global hunger and malnutrition.

## Methodology

To gather information on how climate change affects food supply, I conducted a comprehensive search using various online databases and resources. The search focused on reputable sources such as government reports, academic publications, and articles from recognized institutions. The primary tools used included Google Scholar, government websites, and academic databases. Keywords such as "climate change," "food supply," "agriculture," and "food security" were employed to refine the search results.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Impact on Crop Production**: Climate change affects crop production through increased temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, "Climate change can disrupt food availability, reduce access to food, and affect food quality" [^1]. This disruption is primarily due to the adverse effects on crop yields and the increased difficulty in maintaining consistent agricultural practices.

2. **Effects on Livestock and Fisheries**: The impact of climate change extends beyond crops to include livestock and fisheries. A report from Columbia University highlights that "climate change has broad-ranging impacts on agricultural practices, increasing water use and scarcity, nitrous oxide and methane emissions, soil degradation, and more" [^2]. These factors contribute to reduced productivity in livestock and fisheries, further straining the food supply.

3. **Food Security and Prices**: The overall impact of climate change on agriculture is expected to be negative, leading to reduced food supplies and increased food prices. The Food System Primer notes that "the overall impact of climate change on agriculture, however, is expected to be negativeâ€”reducing food supplies and raising food prices" [^3]. This situation poses a significant threat to global food security, particularly in vulnerable regions.

## Limitations

The findings are based on available data and reports up to October 2023. Some sources may not reflect the most current research or emerging trends in climate science. Additionally, the complexity of climate systems and their interactions with agricultural practices means that predictions and models may have inherent uncertainties. Further research and updated data are necessary to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term impacts of climate change on food supply.
