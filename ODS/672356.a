The different policy tools for dealing with cyclical unemployment include expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates, and expansionary fiscal policies, such as increasing government spending and implementing tax cuts. These measures aim to stimulate economic growth and increase aggregate demand. Additionally, active labor market policies can also be used to address cyclical unemployment.
