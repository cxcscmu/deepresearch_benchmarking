# Crude Oil Price Increase: An Analysis

## Executive Summary

Crude oil prices have been on the rise due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and economic factors. Recent developments, including U.S. sanctions on Iran, military actions in the Middle East, and changes in U.S. tariff policies, have contributed to the volatility and upward trend in oil prices. This report delves into the specific reasons behind the recent increase in crude oil prices, drawing on various sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Methodology

To gather information on the reasons behind the rising crude oil prices, a systematic search was conducted using online databases and news outlets. The search focused on recent articles and reports from reputable sources such as Reuters, The New York Times, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The search strategy included keywords like "crude oil prices," "oil supply disruptions," and "geopolitical tensions." The findings were then synthesized to provide a detailed analysis.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Geopolitical Tensions and Sanctions**: Recent U.S. sanctions against Iran have played a significant role in driving up oil prices. According to a Reuters article, "Oil prices settled more than $1 per barrel higher on Tuesday as new U.S. sanctions against Iran and rising equity markets helped spark a rally" [^1]. These sanctions have increased uncertainty about future oil supplies, contributing to price volatility.

2. **Supply Disruptions**: Events that disrupt oil supply or increase uncertainty about future supplies tend to drive up prices. The EIA notes that "Events that disrupt supply or increase uncertainty about future oil supplies tend to drive up prices" [^2]. This is consistent with historical patterns where geopolitical events have led to supply concerns and subsequent price increases.

3. **Military Actions and Regional Conflicts**: Military actions in the Middle East, particularly involving the U.S. and Iran-backed groups, have also contributed to rising oil prices. Euronews reported that "Crude oil prices jumped following the US military strikes on the Iran-backed Houthi militants" [^3]. Such conflicts heighten the risk of supply disruptions, leading to increased prices.
