The effectiveness of online learning compared to classroom learning varies. Some studies, such as a meta-analysis by the U.S. Department of Education, suggest that students in online learning conditions perform better on average than those receiving face-to-face instruction. However, other research indicates that online coursework generally yields worse student performance than in-person coursework. Both online and classroom learning have unique advantages and disadvantages, and their effectiveness can depend on factors such as the student's learning style and discipline.
