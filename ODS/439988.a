Medicaid can be improved while delivering cost-effectiveness by implementing strategies such as using nationally recognized data sets, encouraging health organizations to clearly communicate the benefits of services, aligning incentives to reward quality and lower costs through integrated care, and focusing on preventive, appropriate, and coordinated care for enrollees. Additionally, exploring flexible use of Medicaid funds for nonmedical services and streamlining enrollment processes can enhance service delivery and improve the quality of care.
