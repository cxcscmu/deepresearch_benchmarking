Islam spread quickly throughout the Mediterranean world due to a combination of factors, including military conquests, trade, and the appeal of its religious message. The early Islamic caliphates expanded their territories rapidly through military campaigns, which facilitated the spread of Islam. Additionally, the extensive trade networks in the region helped disseminate Islamic culture and ideas. The religion's emphasis on community and social justice also attracted many converts.
