Police officers should receive developmentally informed training, de-escalation and trauma recognition training, and participate in community engagement programs to improve interactions with juveniles. Programs like "Policing the Teen Brain" provide officers with strategies to effectively interact with youth, focusing on understanding youth behavior and improving police/youth relations. Additionally, consistent training standards can help set clear expectations and increase the consistency of law enforcement interactions with young people.
