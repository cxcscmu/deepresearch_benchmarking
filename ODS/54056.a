World War II had several lasting effects on international relations, including the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as global superpowers, leading to a bipolar power structure and the onset of the Cold War. The war also ended the traditional Euro-centric international power structure and contributed to the disintegration of Europe's overseas empires. Additionally, it transformed the United States into the leader of the "free world" and led to significant political changes globally.
