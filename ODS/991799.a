# Report on the Origins of Racism

## Executive Summary
The origins of racism are complex and multifaceted, with scholars debating its beginnings and evolution over time. While some argue that racism is a modern phenomenon linked to the development of the race concept in the 15th century, others suggest that forms of racial prejudice existed in earlier historical periods. This report explores various perspectives on when racism first started, highlighting key historical developments and scholarly interpretations.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases, online encyclopedias, and scholarly articles. The search focused on historical analyses, theoretical discussions, and definitions of racism. Tools such as Google Scholar and academic journal repositories were utilized to gather diverse viewpoints and credible sources.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Modern Phenomenon Argument**: Many scholars argue that racism, as understood today, is a relatively modern concept. It is often linked to the European age of imperialism and the Atlantic slave trade. The term "racism" itself gained widespread usage in the 1930s, particularly in relation to the ideologies of Nazism[^1]. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, "The origins of racism, these scholars argued, were tethered to the rise of centralized states or nationalism or anthropology or biological science"[^1].

2. **Race Concept Development**: The concept of race, which is central to racism, is believed to have developed in the 15th century. This period marked the beginning of categorizing humans into distinct races, which laid the groundwork for racial discrimination[^2]. A Reddit discussion on Critical Theory notes, "Racism per se does not exist without a race concept, which does not exist until the 15th century at the earliest"[^2].

3. **Historical Prejudices**: While the modern concept of racism may be recent, forms of racial prejudice and ethnocentrism have existed throughout history. The Wikipedia entry on racism highlights that "racism was a major driving force behind the Transatlantic slave trade" and other historical events[^3]. It also notes that "racism is frequently described as a modern phenomenon, evolving during the European age of imperialism"[^3].

## Limitations
The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may present interpretations rather than primary historical evidence. Additionally, the complexity of defining racism and its historical manifestations means that conclusions may vary significantly among scholars. The report also does not cover all possible perspectives, particularly those from non-Western contexts, which may offer different insights into the origins of racism.
