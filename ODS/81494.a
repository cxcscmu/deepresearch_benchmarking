Language affects culture by serving as a primary tool for expression and communication, shaping the way people perceive the world and interact with one another. It reflects cultural values and priorities, influences thought processes, and helps build relationships within a community. Language can define and separate cultures, as it carries meanings and references that represent the culture of a particular social group.
