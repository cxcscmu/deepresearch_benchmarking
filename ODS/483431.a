Native American peoples were vulnerable to conquest by European adventurers primarily due to their lack of immunity to European diseases, such as smallpox, which led to deadly epidemics. Additionally, they did not have the same advanced weapons as the Europeans, who came with guns and cannons. Lack of political unity among Native American groups also contributed to their vulnerability.
