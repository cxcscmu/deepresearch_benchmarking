The League of Nations did not directly cause World War II, but its inability to effectively enforce its resolutions and maintain peace contributed to the conditions that led to the war. The League failed to stop aggressive actions by countries like Japan, Italy, and Germany in the 1930s, which undermined its credibility and emboldened these nations to pursue expansionist policies. This failure to prevent aggression and maintain collective security is often cited as a factor that contributed to the outbreak of World War II.
