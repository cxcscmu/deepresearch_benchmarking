Men commit crimes, particularly violent and sexual offenses, at higher rates than women due to a combination of biological, social, and environmental factors. These include differences in aggression levels, socialization processes that encourage risk-taking behaviors in men, and societal norms that may tolerate or even encourage certain aggressive behaviors in males. Additionally, men are more often in situations or environments where crime is more likely to occur.
