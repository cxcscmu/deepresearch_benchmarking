Public goods are considered a market failure because they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that individuals cannot be effectively charged for their use, and one person's use does not reduce availability to others. This leads to inefficiencies in the market as providers cannot easily recoup costs, resulting in underproduction or overuse of these goods.
