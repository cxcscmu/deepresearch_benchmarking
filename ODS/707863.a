# Report: Why Public Goods Are Considered a Market Failure

## Executive Summary
Public goods are often cited as a classic example of market failure due to their inherent characteristics that defy the traditional market mechanisms of supply and demand. These goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they cannot be efficiently allocated through the market, leading to issues such as overuse and underfunding. This report explores the reasons why public goods result in market failure and the implications of these characteristics on economic efficiency.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and educational platforms. The search focused on identifying authoritative sources that explain the concept of public goods and their relationship to market failure. Tools such as Google Scholar, educational websites like Khan Academy, and economic resource libraries like Econlib were utilized to gather relevant information.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Non-excludability and Non-rivalry**: Public goods are characterized by their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature. This means that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from using the good, and one person's use does not reduce its availability to others. As a result, these goods are not efficiently allocated through market mechanisms. "Public goods exemplify market failure because their infinite and non-excludable nature means they are susceptible to overuse and mismanagement" [^1].

2. **Challenges in Charging and Provision**: The inability to charge users directly for public goods leads to underfunding and potential overuse. Providers cannot easily exclude non-payers, which discourages private investment in such goods. "Public goods create market failures if a section of the population that consumes the goods fails to pay but continues using the good as actual payers" [^2].

3. **Inefficient Distribution**: The market's failure to efficiently distribute public goods results in a misallocation of resources. This inefficiency is a core aspect of market failure, as the goods are not provided in optimal quantities. "The existence of pure public goods can cause market failure because they are not efficiently allocated through the market mechanism of supply" [^3].

## Limitations
The report is based on secondary data from online resources, which may not cover all perspectives or the latest research on the topic. Additionally, the lack of specific data on the economic impact of public goods in different contexts limits the ability to generalize findings universally. Further empirical research could provide more comprehensive insights into the nuances of public goods and market failure.
