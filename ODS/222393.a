The shape of chemical data can enable data-driven materials discovery by providing a structured framework that allows for the efficient exploration and analysis of chemical space. This approach can help reduce the traditional 20-year 'molecule-to-market' timeframe by facilitating a design-to-device pipeline, which accelerates the discovery and development of new materials.
