Technology can help make roads safer through various means, such as implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that reduce the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. The use of 5G technology enables quicker access to live alerts for traffic accidents and road hazards, enhancing real-time communication and response. Additionally, AI dash cams can significantly reduce harsh driving incidents, and AI can be used to optimize traffic signals for pedestrian safety. Automated vehicle technologies also support drivers by reducing human errors and the resulting crashes.
