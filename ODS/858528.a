People want gun control for various reasons, including the belief that stricter gun laws can reduce gun violence and save lives. According to Pew Research Center, about 58% of U.S. adults favor stricter gun laws, suggesting a significant portion of the population believes that such measures could enhance public safety. Additionally, organizations like Everytown Research argue that states with stricter gun laws experience fewer deaths from gun violence, supporting the idea that gun control can be an effective tool in reducing firearm-related incidents.
