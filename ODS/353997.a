# Report: Why Was the Holocaust Started?

## Executive Summary
The Holocaust, a catastrophic event in human history, was initiated due to a combination of deep-rooted antisemitism, the rise of Nazi ideology, and the socio-political aftermath of World War I. The Nazi regime, led by Adolf Hitler, systematically orchestrated the genocide of six million Jews and millions of others deemed undesirable. This report explores the underlying causes and motivations behind the Holocaust, drawing from historical analyses and expert insights.

## Methodology
To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and historical databases. The search focused on reputable educational and historical institutions that provide detailed explanations of the Holocaust's origins. Key search terms included "Holocaust causes," "Nazi ideology," and "antisemitism." The tools used included academic databases and historical archives, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings
1. **Historic Antisemitism and Nazi Ideology**: The Holocaust was deeply rooted in historic antisemitism, which was exacerbated by the rise of Nazi ideology. The Nazis, under Adolf Hitler's leadership, propagated the belief that the Aryan race was superior, leading to the systematic persecution of Jews. "In 1921 Adolf Hitler became leader of the Nazi party. The Nazis were racists and believed that their Aryan race was superior to others" [^1].

2. **Socio-Political Climate Post-World War I**: The aftermath of World War I created a fertile ground for extremist ideologies. The Treaty of Versailles and the economic turmoil in Germany contributed to the rise of nationalism and the scapegoating of Jews. "Historic antisemitism, the rise of eugenics and nationalism, the aftermath of the First World War, the rise of the Nazis, the role of Adolf Hitler" [^2].

3. **Systematic State-Sponsored Persecution**: The Nazi regime's systematic approach to persecution began in the mid-1930s and escalated into genocide by 1941. This was a state-sponsored effort to eliminate Jews and other groups deemed undesirable. "The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored, persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945" [^3].
