The Holocaust was initiated due to a combination of historic antisemitism, the rise of eugenics and nationalism, the aftermath of World War I, and the rise of the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler. The Nazis, led by Hitler, believed in the superiority of the Aryan race and systematically persecuted and murdered six million Jews and millions of others they deemed undesirable.
