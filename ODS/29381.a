## Executive Summary

Abortion remains a contentious issue with deeply rooted beliefs and arguments on both sides. Those who oppose abortion often do so based on moral, religious, and ideological grounds. This report explores the various reasons why some individuals and groups are against abortion, highlighting the complexity and diversity of their perspectives.

## Methodology

To gather information on why some people oppose abortion, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search strategy included reviewing articles, opinion pieces, and research studies from reputable sources.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Moral and Religious Beliefs**: A significant reason for opposing abortion is the belief that it equates to murder. Many individuals view the fetus as a person with a right to life, and thus, terminating a pregnancy is seen as morally wrong. "The idea that abortion is 'murder,' and the killing of an innocent fetus is the most heinous sin a woman can partake in" reflects this perspective[^1].

2. **Religious Convictions**: Some people oppose abortion due to religious beliefs, viewing it as an affront to divine will. For instance, "Depriving a soul of its intended body is seen as an affront to the will of God"[^2]. This belief is often tied to the notion of life beginning at conception, a view held by many religious groups.

3. **Health and Feminist Concerns**: There are arguments against abortion based on potential health risks to women. Some believe that abortion can have long-term physical and emotional consequences for women. Additionally, some feminist arguments suggest that abortion violates women's rights by potentially harming their health[^3].
