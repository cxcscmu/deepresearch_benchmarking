Some people oppose abortion because they believe it involves taking a human life, as they consider a fetus to be a person. Others argue that abortion can harm the long-term physical and emotional health of women. Additionally, some view abortion as morally wrong or against religious beliefs, considering it an affront to the will of God. Ideological beliefs, personal histories, and sexual strategies also play a role in shaping people's attitudes toward abortion.
