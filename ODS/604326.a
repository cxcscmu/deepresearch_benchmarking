People oppose abortions for various reasons, including the belief that abortion is equivalent to murder and the killing of an innocent fetus is morally wrong. Some argue that abortion can harm women's long-term physical and emotional health. Additionally, there are views that opposing abortion aligns with certain religious beliefs, such as the idea that it is an affront to the will of God. Others suggest that anti-abortion attitudes may be influenced by differing sexual strategies and perspectives on gender roles.
