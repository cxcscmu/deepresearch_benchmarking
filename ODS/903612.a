Resources that can be used to help police bridge the gap with the Black community include organizations like The Policing Project, which focuses on changing law enforcement policy discussions, and training programs such as "Just Policing: Disability Inclusion Training" that provide officers with comprehensive knowledge and tools. Additionally, local alliances between activists, communities of color, and police departments can create spaces for meaningful dialogue, as highlighted in the context of North Carolina.
