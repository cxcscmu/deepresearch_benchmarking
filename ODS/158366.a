Some people age faster than others due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Genetics play a significant role, as some individuals are predisposed to age more quickly. Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as social connectedness, sleeping habits, and overall lifestyle choices, also heavily influence biological aging. Additionally, research suggests that people age along specific biological pathways in the body, including metabolic, hepatic (liver), immune, and nephrotic (kidney) systems.
