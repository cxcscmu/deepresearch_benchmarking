Dementia can lead to social isolation as individuals with the condition may become more withdrawn over time, socializing or communicating less due to cognitive decline. This decline can affect their ability to interact with others, leading to increased isolation. Additionally, the symptoms of dementia, such as memory loss and confusion, can make social interactions challenging, further contributing to isolation.
