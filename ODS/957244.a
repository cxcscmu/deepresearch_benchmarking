Climate change is primarily driven by human activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. These activities include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which trap heat and lead to global warming. Natural factors, such as changes in the sun's activity, can also contribute to climate change, but the current rapid changes are mainly due to human influence.
