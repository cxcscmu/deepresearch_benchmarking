# Climate Change: Causes and Implications

## Executive Summary

Climate change is a critical global issue characterized by long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. The primary driver of recent climate change is human activity, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities increase the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and subsequent climate changes. Understanding these causes is essential for developing strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts.

## Methodology

To gather information on the causes of climate change, a comprehensive search was conducted using reliable sources such as the United Nations, NASA, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The search focused on identifying authoritative articles and reports that discuss the scientific basis of climate change and its anthropogenic drivers. The search strategy included using specific keywords like "causes of climate change," "greenhouse gases," and "human activities."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The United Nations highlights that "as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat," which is a primary cause of global warming and climate change [^1]. This process is exacerbated by human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation.

2. **Human Activities**: According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), human-driven causes of climate change include "transportation, electricity generation, industry & manufacturing, agriculture, oil & gas development, and buildings" [^2]. These activities significantly contribute to the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases.

3. **Industrial Revolution Impact**: The US Geological Survey (USGS) notes that "human activity has increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution," marking a significant shift in the Earth's climate system [^3]. This period saw a dramatic rise in the use of fossil fuels, leading to increased carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may not capture the latest scientific research or emerging trends in climate science. Additionally, the data is limited to the information available up to October 2023, and newer studies or findings may not be included. Furthermore, while the sources used are reputable, the complexity of climate systems means that there are still uncertainties and ongoing debates within the scientific community regarding specific aspects of climate change.
