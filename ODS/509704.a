Culture influences deviance by shaping the norms and values that define what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior within a society. Cultural deviance theory suggests that crime and deviant behavior are influenced by the cultural values of the surrounding community, meaning that individuals may engage in deviance when they are influenced by the norms and values of a deviant subculture. This theory highlights the role of social and environmental factors in shaping deviant behavior.
