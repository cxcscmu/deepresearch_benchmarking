# Report: Influence of Culture on Deviance

## Executive Summary

This report explores the relationship between culture and deviance, focusing on how cultural norms and values shape what is considered deviant behavior. Deviance is defined as actions or behaviors that violate societal norms, and cultural context plays a significant role in determining these norms. The cultural deviance theory suggests that crime and deviant behavior are influenced by the cultural environment, highlighting the importance of understanding cultural influences in the study of deviance.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including academic articles, educational websites, and expert discussions. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the cultural transmission theory of deviance and related sociological perspectives. Tools such as Google Scholar, educational platforms like Quizlet, and academic blogs were utilized to gather diverse viewpoints and insights.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Cultural Deviance Theory**: This theory posits that crime and deviant behavior are significantly influenced by the cultural values and norms of the surrounding community. "Cultural deviance theory states that rates of crime are heavily influenced by the cultural values of the surrounding community" [^1]. This suggests that individuals in environments with deviant cultural norms are more likely to engage in deviant behavior.

2. **Cultural Norms and Deviance**: Deviance is often defined in relation to the prevailing cultural norms and values. "Deviance refers to any behavior or action that violates the norms and expectations of a particular society or social group" [^2]. This indicates that what is considered deviant can vary greatly between different cultures and societies.

3. **Social Influences on Deviance**: Social and environmental factors, alongside cultural influences, play a crucial role in shaping deviant behavior. "Although research is being done to link crime to biology, social influences and environmental factors are significant" [^3]. This highlights the complex interplay between culture and other social factors in the development of deviant behavior.

## Limitations

The findings are based on available online resources, which may not cover all aspects of the topic comprehensively. Some sources may lack peer-reviewed credibility, and the interpretations of cultural deviance can vary widely, leading to potential biases. Additionally, the dynamic nature of cultural norms means that what is considered deviant can change over time, making it challenging to provide a definitive analysis.
