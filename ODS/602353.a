# Citizen Journalism: A Double-Edged Sword

## Executive Summary

Citizen journalism, the practice of non-professional individuals reporting news, has become increasingly prevalent with the rise of digital platforms. This report explores the benefits and drawbacks of citizen journalism, highlighting its impact on traditional journalism and the broader media landscape. While citizen journalism democratizes information dissemination and provides real-time news coverage, it also raises concerns about accuracy, credibility, and ethical standards.

## Methodology

To assess the merits and demerits of citizen journalism, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search strategy involved querying reputable websites, academic articles, and opinion pieces to gather diverse perspectives. Tools such as Google Search and academic databases were utilized to ensure a balanced view of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Democratization and Accessibility**: Citizen journalism allows for a more inclusive media environment where anyone with a smartphone can report news. This democratization is seen as a positive development, as it enables diverse voices to be heard. According to Britannica, "Citizen journalism, journalism that is conducted by people who are not professional journalists, allows for a broader range of perspectives" [^1].

2. **Real-Time Reporting**: One of the significant advantages of citizen journalism is its ability to provide immediate coverage of events. Jeff Hayward on Medium notes, "Citizen journalism can be great for breaking news coverage" [^2]. This immediacy can be crucial during emergencies or rapidly developing stories.

3. **Challenges of Credibility and Accuracy**: Despite its benefits, citizen journalism often struggles with issues of credibility and accuracy. The Krehbiel Group highlights that "the phrase 'citizen journalism' seems to imply that anybody can do journalism," which can lead to misinformation if not properly fact-checked [^3]. This lack of professional oversight can result in the spread of false information.

4. **Ethical Concerns**: The absence of formal training and ethical guidelines for citizen journalists can lead to ethical dilemmas. As noted in a Quora discussion, "fact checking is not always done," which can compromise the integrity of the information being shared [^4].
