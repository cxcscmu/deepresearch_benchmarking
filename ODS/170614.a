Ableism affects men in dating by perpetuating stereotypes and biases that can lead to social exclusion and misunderstandings, particularly for those with disabilities. For example, autistic men may face ableist attitudes that unfairly associate their social skills with negative personality traits. This can result in missed opportunities and a lack of understanding in romantic contexts, as ableism influences perceptions and interactions in dating scenarios.
