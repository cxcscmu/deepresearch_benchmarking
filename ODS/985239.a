The ethical concerns about sharing health data online include unauthorized access by third parties, which can lead to exploitation of patient data, and the potential loss of control over personal data by individuals. Additionally, there are issues related to privacy and confidentiality, security breaches, and the need for transparency to ensure informed consent from patients. These concerns can undermine public trust in health institutions and research if not handled ethically.
