## Detailed Findings

1. **East Francia's Response:**
   - East Francia primarily responded to Viking invasions by fortifying cities and forming strategic alliances. "East Francia responded to Viking invasions by building fortifications, forming alliances, and improving naval defenses" [^1]. This approach aimed to protect key territories and deter further Viking incursions.

2. **England's Response:**
   - In England, King Alfred the Great played a pivotal role in organizing defenses against the Vikings. He is noted for creating a network of fortified towns known as burhs and reforming the military. "Alfred the Great (871-899 CE) managed to fortify his kingdom and create a standing army" [^2]. These measures were crucial in resisting Viking advances and eventually led to the Treaty of Wedmore, which established the Danelaw.
   - Additionally, England engaged in diplomatic strategies, such as paying the Danegeld, a form of protection money, to prevent Viking attacks. However, this approach was not always successful, leading to further conflicts. "The English government decided that the only way of dealing with these attackers was to pay them protection money" [^3].

3. **Comparative Outcomes:**
   - The responses of East Francia and England to Viking attacks were shaped by their unique political landscapes. While East Francia's strategy of fortification and alliances helped in maintaining territorial integrity, England's combination of military reform and diplomacy under leaders like Alfred the Great led to significant territorial and political changes, including the establishment of the Danelaw.
