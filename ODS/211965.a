Littering affects the environment by contributing to air, land, and ocean pollution. It can entangle, suffocate, or poison animals, lowering biodiversity, and contaminate water sources. Litter also releases harmful chemicals and microparticles as it degrades, and can harm plants, stunt their growth, and alter the natural balance of ecosystems.
