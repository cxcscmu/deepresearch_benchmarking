# Impact of Litter on the Environment

## Executive Summary

Littering is a pervasive environmental issue that affects ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. It contributes to various forms of pollution, including air, land, and water pollution, and poses significant risks to biodiversity. The degradation of litter releases harmful chemicals and microparticles, further exacerbating environmental damage. This report explores the multifaceted impacts of littering on the environment, drawing from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Methodology

To gather information on the environmental impacts of littering, a targeted search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources such as environmental organizations, government websites, and educational platforms. Keywords used in the search included "littering effects," "environmental impact of litter," and "litter pollution." The search aimed to identify recent and relevant articles that provide insights into the consequences of littering.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Pollution and Ecosystem Disruption**: Littering contributes significantly to air, land, and ocean pollution. According to Texas Disposal Systems, "Increases in littering and illegal dumping contribute to air pollution, land pollution and ocean pollution" [^1]. This pollution disrupts ecosystems and can lead to long-term environmental degradation.

2. **Impact on Wildlife**: Litter poses a direct threat to wildlife, as it can entangle, suffocate, or poison animals, leading to decreased biodiversity. Environmental Volunteers highlight that "Litter can entangle, suffocate or poison animals which lowers biodiversity" [^2]. This impact is particularly severe in aquatic environments where animals mistake litter for food.

3. **Chemical Release and Soil Contamination**: As litter degrades, it releases harmful chemicals and microparticles into the environment. An article from Robins Air Force Base notes, "Litter takes a long time to decompose, and the degradation process releases chemicals and microparticles into the environment" [^3]. These substances can contaminate soil and water sources, affecting plant growth and human health.

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of recent data and the scope of sources accessed. Some sources may not have been updated recently, which could affect the relevance of the information. Additionally, the focus was primarily on English-language sources, which may exclude valuable insights from non-English publications. Further research could expand on these findings by incorporating a broader range of international perspectives and more recent studies.
