Implicit bias and microaggressions can cause emotional trauma to people from marginalized groups by dictating emotional reactions and behaviors that harm or disadvantage the targets. These biases and microaggressions can be psychologically damaging, leading to feelings of exclusion, invalidation, and chronic stress. Repeated exposure to such experiences can contribute to psychological trauma and conditions like PTSD, particularly for those who regularly encounter discriminatory incidents.
