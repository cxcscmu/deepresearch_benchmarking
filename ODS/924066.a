The South lost the Civil War due to a combination of factors, including inferior resources in military personnel and equipment, social divisions within Southern society, and the Union's superior military strategy and supply lines. Additionally, issues such as food shortages, inflation, and desertion among Confederate soldiers further weakened the Southern war effort.
