The carbon cycle affects climate change by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, which is a key greenhouse gas. Excess carbon in the atmosphere contributes to global warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect, leading to higher global temperatures. Additionally, as the climate warms, the carbon cycle is expected to weaken, resulting in more CO2 remaining in the atmosphere, which further exacerbates climate change. Warmer oceans also absorb less CO2, leaving more in the atmosphere and intensifying the warming effect.
