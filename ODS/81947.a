The Cold War lasted for so long due to several factors, including the ideological and political rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was intensified by the presence of nuclear weapons that acted as a deterrent, preventing direct military conflict. Additionally, the struggle for global influence and the establishment of opposing alliances contributed to the prolonged tension. The Cold War persisted from the end of World War II until the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union.
