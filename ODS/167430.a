High schools should be able to dispense contraceptives to students because it can help reduce the incidence of underage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, as well as provide a stress-free environment for students to access these resources. School-based condom availability programs have been shown to improve condom coverage and promote positive sexual behaviors. However, it is important to note that many schools currently do not provide or refer students to contraceptive services, which can limit access to these important resources.
