Trickle-down economics is criticized for failing because it primarily benefits the wealthy, who tend to save rather than spend their additional income, leading to stagnant wages and limited economic benefits for the middle and lower classes. Research suggests that these policies do not significantly boost economic growth or reduce inequality, as the wealth does not effectively "trickle down" to the broader population.
