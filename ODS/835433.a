# Report on the Short-Term Causes of World War I

## Executive Summary

World War I, a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918, was precipitated by a complex interplay of short-term and long-term causes. This report focuses on the short-term causes, which primarily revolve around the events and decisions made during the summer of 1914, known as the July Crisis. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was the immediate trigger, but the situation was exacerbated by existing alliances, militaristic postures, and diplomatic failures.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including educational websites, historical databases, and scholarly articles. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the short-term causes of World War I. Tools such as Google Scholar and academic databases were utilized to ensure the reliability of the information gathered.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, on June 28, 1914, is widely recognized as the immediate catalyst for World War I. This event set off a chain reaction among the major European powers, leading to the outbreak of war [^1].

2. **The July Crisis**: The assassination led to the July Crisis, a series of diplomatic and military maneuvers among the European powers. Austria-Hungary, with the backing of Germany, issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which was only partially accepted. This refusal led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, triggering a series of alliances and counter-alliances [^2].

3. **Alliance System and Mobilization**: The complex web of alliances played a crucial role in escalating the conflict. Russia mobilized in defense of Serbia, prompting Germany to declare war on Russia. France, allied with Russia, was then drawn into the conflict, followed by Germany's invasion of Belgium, which brought the United Kingdom into the war [^3].

Additionally, the report relies on secondary sources, which may present varying interpretations of the events leading up to the war.
