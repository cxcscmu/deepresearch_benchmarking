# Armenian Genocide: An Analytical Overview

## Executive Summary

The Armenian Genocide, occurring between 1915 and 1923, was a systematic campaign of mass deportation and killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire. It is often cited as the first genocide of the 20th century, resulting in the deaths of approximately 1.5 million Armenians. The genocide was driven by a complex interplay of nationalism, wartime radicalization, and political motives, primarily orchestrated by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Despite being a well-documented historical event, the genocide remains a contentious issue, particularly in its recognition and interpretation.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using academic databases and reputable historical resources. The primary tools included Google Scholar, JSTOR, and online encyclopedias such as Britannica and Wikipedia. The search focused on scholarly articles, historical overviews, and expert analyses to ensure a balanced and factual representation of the events and their causes.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context and Execution**: The genocide began with the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and leaders in April 1915, followed by mass deportations and killings. "The Ottoman government embarked upon the systematic decimation of its civilian Armenian population" [^1]. The CUP, which had initially sought to preserve the empire through reforms, turned to extreme measures as a response to perceived threats from Armenians and other minorities [^2].

2. **Causes and Motivations**: The genocide was not premeditated before World War I but evolved due to a mix of long-term structural issues and wartime contingencies. "Most historians agree that the genocide was not premeditated before World War I, but the role of contingency, ideology, and long-term structural factors in causing the genocide continues to be discussed" [^3]. Nationalism and the desire to create a homogeneous Turkish state were significant driving forces [^4].

3. **Scholarly Interpretations**: Historians have debated the causes, with some attributing it to nationalism and others to wartime radicalization. "The genocide emerged from a process of cumulative radicalization during the war" [^5]. The CUP's policies were influenced by a mix of demographic strategies and paranoia about Armenian separatism [^6].

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this report is the reliance on secondary sources, which may reflect the biases of their authors. Additionally, the lack of access to certain archives, particularly Turkish military archives, limits the ability to fully understand the motivations and decisions of the Ottoman leadership. The ongoing political sensitivities surrounding the genocide also mean that interpretations can vary significantly depending on the source.
