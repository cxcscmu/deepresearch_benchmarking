The Armenian Genocide occurred during World War I, primarily between 1915 and 1916, when the Ottoman government systematically deported and massacred its Armenian population. The genocide began with the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in April 1915, followed by mass deportations and killings. Factors contributing to the genocide include nationalism, religious differences, and wartime radicalization. An estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed during this period.
