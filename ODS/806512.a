Increasing the minimum wage can have several effects on the economy. It can raise the earnings and family income of most low-wage workers, potentially lifting some families out of poverty. Additionally, it can stimulate consumer spending and boost the overall economy by putting more money in the hands of low-wage workers. However, setting a minimum wage above the market rate for specific jobs can create a price floor that may lead to labor surpluses, commonly referred to as unemployment.
