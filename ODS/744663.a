# Report: How Culture Influences Health

## Executive Summary

Culture plays a pivotal role in shaping health beliefs, practices, and outcomes. It influences how individuals perceive health, illness, and death, as well as their approaches to health promotion and disease prevention. Cultural factors can affect health literacy, diagnosis, treatment options, and mental health. Understanding these cultural influences is crucial for healthcare providers to deliver effective and culturally sensitive care.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search focused on identifying credible sources that discuss the influence of culture on health. Tools such as Google Search and academic databases like NCBI Bookshelf and OpenStax were utilized to gather relevant information. The search strategy included keywords like "culture influences health," "cultural health beliefs," and "health literacy."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Perceptions of Health and Illness**: Culture significantly affects how health, illness, and death are perceived. Different cultures have unique systems of health beliefs that explain the causes of illness and the appropriate treatments. For instance, "All cultures have systems of health beliefs to explain what causes illness, how it can be cured or treated, and who should be involved in the process" [^1].

2. **Health Literacy and Social Determinants**: Cultural, social, and family influences shape attitudes and beliefs, thereby impacting health literacy. The social determinants of health, which include cultural factors, are well-documented as influencing health outcomes. "Cultural, social, and family influences shape attitudes and beliefs and therefore influence health literacy" [^2].

3. **Diagnosis and Treatment**: Culture impacts both the diagnosis and treatment options available to individuals. This is due to varying social beliefs and biological factors across different cultures. "Culture has a significant impact on both diagnoses and treatment options, primarily because of different social beliefs, but also because of biological factors" [^3].
