Culture influences health in various ways, including shaping perceptions of health, illness, and death, as well as beliefs about the causes of disease and approaches to health promotion. It affects health literacy, diagnoses, treatment options, and coping mechanisms, and plays a role in the experience and expression of illness and pain. Cultural beliefs also determine who should be involved in the healthcare process.
