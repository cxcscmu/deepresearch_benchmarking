## Detailed Findings

1. **Early Struggles and Legal Recognition**: Prior to the 1800s, women in most countries had limited rights, unable to vote, own property, or have a say over their children. "Prior to 1800, women in most countries were unable to vote, had no say over their own children or property, and could not obtain a divorce" [^1]. This period marked the beginning of organized efforts to challenge these restrictions.

2. **Suffrage and Political Participation**: The suffrage movement was a pivotal phase in the women's rights movement, culminating in the right to vote for women in many countries by the early 20th century. "From a plea to a founding father, to the suffragists to Title IX, to the first female political figures, women have blazed a steady trail" [^2]. This era laid the groundwork for further political and social advancements.

3. **Post-World War II Developments**: The aftermath of World War II saw significant changes in women's roles, particularly in developed countries. Technological advancements and societal shifts contributed to easing domestic burdens and expanding opportunities for women. "In the aftermath of World War II, the lives of women in developed countries changed dramatically. Household technology eased the burdens of homemaking" [^3].

4. **Recent Progress and Ongoing Challenges**: In recent decades, legal reforms have focused on protecting women against discrimination and harassment. "These reforms focused on introducing legislation on protections against sexual harassment, as well as preventing discrimination in employment" [^4]. Despite these advancements, a significant portion of the population believes more work is needed to achieve true gender equality.
