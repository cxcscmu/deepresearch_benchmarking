Women's rights have evolved significantly over time. Initially, women had limited rights, such as being unable to vote, own property, or obtain a divorce. Over the decades, the women's rights movement has achieved substantial progress, including the right to vote, legal reforms against discrimination and sexual harassment, and increased representation in political and social spheres. Despite these advancements, there is still ongoing work to achieve full gender equality.
