A constitution can be changed through an amendment process. For the U.S. Constitution, an amendment can be proposed either by a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Once proposed, the amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by conventions in three-fourths of the states.
