The factors that contribute to making a terrorist are complex and multifaceted. According to Alan Krueger's work, "What Makes a Terrorist," many terrorists come from middle-class and often college-educated backgrounds, suggesting that economic status and education alone do not predict terrorist behavior. The motivations behind terrorism can be influenced by a variety of factors, including ideology, political grievances, and social dynamics, rather than just economic conditions or personal hardships.
