Culture and diversity impact gender differences across cultures both directly and indirectly. Directly, cultural beliefs and attitudes shape gender roles and expectations, influencing professional opportunities and societal roles for men and women. Indirectly, cultural stereotypes and biases can shape perceptions and attitudes, which may lead to barriers in advancement and differences in opportunities available to different genders.
