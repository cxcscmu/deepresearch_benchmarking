# Report on Political Corruption in the United States

## Executive Summary

Political corruption in the United States has been a persistent issue throughout its history, manifesting in various forms such as bribery, embezzlement, and quid pro quo arrangements. Despite being one of the least politically corrupt countries globally, recent trends indicate a decline in the perceived integrity of the U.S. political system. This report explores the historical context, current state, and contributing factors to political corruption in the United States.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a combination of search strategies, including keyword searches on platforms like Google and academic databases. I focused on credible sources such as Transparency International, academic publications, and reputable news outlets. The search terms included "political corruption in the United States," "Transparency International corruption index," and "historical corruption in the U.S."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Historical Context**: Corruption in the United States has deep historical roots, with significant peaks during the Jacksonian era and the Gilded Age. During these periods, political machines manipulated voters, and public offices were often sold for money or political support. However, the U.S. benefited from a free press and an honest judiciary, which helped combat corruption [^1].

2. **Current State**: As of 2025, the United States scores 65 on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking 28th among 180 countries. This score reflects a decline from its highest score of 76 in 2015, indicating a growing concern about corruption levels [^2]. Factors contributing to this decline include threats to the system of checks and balances, erosion of ethical norms, and political polarization [^3].

3. **Recent Examples and Concerns**: Recent instances of corruption include the Trump administration's scandals, the Boeing 737 MAX failure, and the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. These events highlight the increasing perception of corruption and its potential impact on the U.S.'s soft power [^4]. Additionally, the U.S. has been criticized as a tax haven, with significant offshore wealth estimated to be held within the country [^5].

## Limitations

This report is limited by the availability of up-to-date data and the inherent bias in sources that may have political leanings. Additionally, the complexity of measuring corruption means that indices like Transparency International's may not capture all nuances of the issue. Further research could benefit from more recent data and a broader range of perspectives.
