World War I significantly altered the political and geographical landscape of Europe by leading to the collapse of major empires such as the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, German, and Russian Empires. This resulted in the creation of new nation-states, including Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The victorious Allies redrew the maps, establishing new borders and fostering independence movements, which reshaped the continent's political geography.
