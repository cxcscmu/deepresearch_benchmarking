## Detailed Findings

1. **Collapse of Empires and Creation of New States**: The First World War led to the disintegration of major empires such as the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, German, and Russian Empires. This collapse paved the way for the emergence of new nation-states. "Poland was reconstituted in the East; the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are established" [^1]. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire was divided into several separate nations [^2].

2. **Redrawing of Borders**: The victorious Allies redrew the maps of Europe, significantly altering its political geography. "After the armistice of Nov. 11, 1918, the victorious Allies redrew the maps of Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East to replace these fallen empires" [^3]. This redrawing of borders was a direct consequence of the treaties that concluded the war.

3. **Rise of Nationalism and Democratic Movements**: The war fostered nationalism and democratic movements across Europe. The collapse of empires and the creation of new states encouraged independence movements and the establishment of democratic governments. "World War I caused the collapse of major empires and the rise of new nation-states in Europe, fostering nationalism and democratic movements" [^4].
