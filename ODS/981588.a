Globalization has both positive and negative effects. Positively, it leads to economic growth, increased global cooperation, higher incomes, better healthcare, and improved education. It also boosts trade by allowing countries to sell and buy more goods and services. On the negative side, globalization can result in increased competition, exploitation of labor and resources, imbalanced trade, and domestic job loss. Additionally, while it raises living standards globally, not all effects are beneficial for everyone.
