# Report: Reasons for Keeping Marijuana Illegal

## Executive Summary
The debate over marijuana legalization is multifaceted, involving health, social, and legal considerations. While some advocate for its economic benefits and personal freedom, there are compelling arguments for maintaining its illegal status. These arguments primarily focus on the potential negative impacts on health, mental well-being, and societal safety. This report synthesizes findings from various sources to outline the reasons why marijuana should remain illegal.

## Methodology
To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and reputable websites. The search focused on articles and studies discussing the negative implications of marijuana legalization. Tools such as Google Scholar and PubMed Central were utilized to access peer-reviewed articles and expert opinions.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Health Implications**: Marijuana use has been linked to several adverse health effects. According to a study, "Marijuana impairs the ability to judge time, distance, and speed; it slows reaction time and reduces the ability to track moving objects" [^1]. This impairment can have serious consequences, particularly in activities such as driving.

2. **Mental Health Concerns**: The use of marijuana is associated with mental health issues. The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation notes that "Marijuana use can harm learning, thinking, and memory development, and use of the drug has been linked to mental health issues, including psychosis" [^2]. These cognitive impairments can have long-term effects on individuals, particularly young users.

3. **Addiction and Social Issues**: Marijuana is addictive for a significant portion of users. As reported by Drug Rehab, "Marijuana is a drug that changes brain chemistry, alters mood, causes side effects, and leads to addiction in at least a tenth of users" [^3]. This addiction can lead to broader social issues, including increased crime and violence.

## Limitations
This report is limited by the availability of recent data and the potential bias in sources advocating against marijuana legalization. Additionally, the rapidly changing legal landscape and emerging research may alter the current understanding of marijuana's impacts. Further studies are needed to provide a more comprehensive view of the long-term effects of marijuana use and legalization.
