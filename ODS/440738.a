The legality of euthanasia is a complex and debated issue. In the United States, euthanasia is not legal, but doctor-assisted suicide is permitted in 11 jurisdictions under strict conditions. Arguments for legalizing euthanasia often focus on the right to die with dignity and relief from unbearable pain, while arguments against it raise concerns about potential abuses and the devaluation of human life. The debate involves ethical, legal, and societal considerations, and opinions vary widely.
