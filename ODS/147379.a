European colonization had a profound impact on Native Americans, leading to significant loss of land, culture, and population. Native Americans faced starvation, were forced to abandon their spiritual beliefs and traditions, and suffered from diseases brought by Europeans to which they had no immunity. The colonization also introduced new trade patterns and economic pressures, dramatically altering their economic systems. Additionally, millions of Native Americans were killed either in conflicts or due to outbreaks of European diseases.
