The relationship between external validity and the college sophomore problem lies in the concept of generalizability. The college sophomore problem refers to the limitation in research generalizability when studies predominantly use college sophomores as subjects. This can constrain external validity because the findings may not be applicable to a broader population beyond the specific demographic of college students.
