World hunger is primarily caused by a combination of factors including poverty, conflict, climate change, gender inequality, food waste, and the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. These elements contribute to the lack of access to nutritious food and resources, particularly in developing countries. Additionally, issues such as unstable markets, poor infrastructure, and unequal distribution of income exacerbate the crisis.
