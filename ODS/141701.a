Local governments typically operate within the powers and functions assigned to them by higher levels of government. They manage local affairs such as public schools, fire departments, and trash collection. Local governments often include two tiers: counties (or boroughs/parishes) and municipalities (cities/towns), with responsibilities varying based on the legal framework of the state or country.
