"Immigrants played a vital role in the new market society by providing a cheap labor force that fueled industrialization and economic growth" [^1].

2. **Economic Expansion**: The influx of immigrants, particularly from Ireland and Germany, met the growing demand for labor in northern states, facilitating economic expansion. This demographic shift was crucial in sustaining the labor-intensive industries that characterized the market revolution. "Economic expansion fueled a demand for labor.

## Limitations

The report is limited by the availability of sources primarily focused on the U.S. context, potentially overlooking the roles of immigrants in other regions during the same period. Additionally, the reliance on secondary sources may introduce biases inherent in the original analyses. Further research could benefit from primary historical documents and a broader geographical scope.
