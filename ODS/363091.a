The Vietnam War originated from the broader Indochina wars of the 1940s and '50s, with roots tracing back to the colonization of Vietnam by France in the late 19th century. The conflict was part of the Cold War tensions, serving as a proxy war between the Soviet Union and the United States. The U.S. became involved due to fears of the spread of communism, while political instability in Vietnam and resistance to negotiations also contributed to the escalation.
