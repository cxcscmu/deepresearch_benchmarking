# Ending Sexual Violence in the Military

## Executive Summary

Sexual violence in the military is a pervasive issue that affects service members across all branches. Efforts to address and prevent sexual violence have been ongoing, with various strategies being implemented to create a safer environment for military personnel. This report explores current initiatives, challenges, and recommendations for ending sexual violence in the military.

## Methodology

To gather information on this topic, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources, including government archives, military benefit libraries, and reputable research organizations. The search focused on recent articles, reports, and official statements related to sexual violence prevention in the military. Key search terms included "military sexual violence prevention," "DoD sexual assault," and "military sexual assault response."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Prevalence and Target Groups**: Research by RAND highlights that "almost half of military sexual assaults target lesbian, gay, or bisexual service members"[^1]. This indicates a need for targeted interventions that address the vulnerabilities of specific groups within the military.

2. **Policy and Structural Changes**: An executive order signed in August 2023 aims to change how the military handles sexual assault cases. This order includes reforms in the judicial process for crimes such as sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse[^2]. These changes are intended to improve accountability and support for victims.

3. **Prevention and Response Programs**: The Sexual Harassment Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program defines sexual assault as "intentional sexual contact characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority"[^3]. Programs like SHARP are crucial in educating service members and providing resources for prevention and response.
