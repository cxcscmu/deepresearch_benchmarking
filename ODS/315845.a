Ending sexual violence in the military involves a multifaceted approach, including implementing comprehensive prevention programs, increasing awareness, and changing social norms that condone violence. Efforts include hiring mental health professionals, such as psychologists, to support prevention efforts, and implementing policies like the Sexual Harassment Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program. Additionally, executive orders have been signed to change how the military handles sexual assault cases, aiming to improve accountability and support for victims.
