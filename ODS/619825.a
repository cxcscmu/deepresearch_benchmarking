Apartheid in South Africa severely disadvantaged the majority of the population, particularly Black South Africans, by enforcing racial segregation and discrimination. It forced millions into poverty, segregated neighborhoods, and limited their social, economic, and political mobility. The policy also had profound psychological effects, contributing to ongoing inequality and social challenges in the country.
