Sociology can be applied to everyday life in various ways, such as understanding social roles and interactions, analyzing class or social inequalities through conflict theory, and examining cultural norms and behaviors. It can also be used to understand and address issues in healthcare, education, and community development, as well as to view personal actions and decisions through a broader societal lens.
