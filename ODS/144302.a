Being vaccinated protects others by reducing the likelihood of becoming infected and spreading the virus to others. When enough people are vaccinated, it becomes harder for germs to travel from person to person, providing community protection known as herd immunity. This helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated or are more vulnerable to diseases.
