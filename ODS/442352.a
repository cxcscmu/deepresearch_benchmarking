The ethics of using animals for medical and cosmetic testing is a subject of debate. Some sources argue that animal testing is justifiable only when there are no alternatives and the tests have significant benefits, while others highlight that it is cruel, inhumane, and not always reliable for predicting human outcomes. Ethical considerations emphasize the importance of following high standards and using alternatives when possible. Overall, opinions vary, with some advocating for the necessity of animal testing in certain contexts and others opposing it on ethical grounds.
