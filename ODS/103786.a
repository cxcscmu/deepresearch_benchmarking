Some argue that government regulation is necessary to manage issues like cybersecurity and misinformation, while others believe that government control could lead to censorship and stifle freedom of expression. The U.S. Constitution suggests that the government does not have the legal right to censor the internet, highlighting the complexity of this issue.
