When the rule of law is eradicated, it can lead to social unrest, protests, and conflicts as citizens lose trust in the legal system. Society may become chaotic, with increased violence, theft, and other crimes, as people are able to act without legal constraints. The absence of law can result in a "survival of the fittest" scenario, where the strongest prevail, often leading to inequality and injustice.
