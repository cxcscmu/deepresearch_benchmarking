Changes to NHS funding have led to various impacts, including increased funding pressures and political challenges, as highlighted by the British Medical Association. Despite funding increases, such as a 3% rise in NHS England's budget between 2023/24 and 2025/26, there are ongoing issues with underfunding affecting patient safety and the NHS's ability to reduce waiting lists and meet performance targets. Additionally, new funding initiatives aim to reduce waiting times by supporting more elective appointments.
