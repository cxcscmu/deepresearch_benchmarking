# Impact of Funding Changes on the NHS

## Executive Summary

The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK has experienced significant changes in funding over recent years, which have had profound impacts on its operations and service delivery. The funding adjustments have been influenced by various factors, including political decisions, economic pressures, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This report explores how these changes have affected the NHS, focusing on budget allocations, service delivery, and future implications.

## Methodology

To gather information on the impact of funding changes on the NHS, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources. The search strategy included reviewing articles from reputable sources such as The King's Fund, British Medical Association, and government publications. The search tools used included Google and academic databases, focusing on recent publications to ensure up-to-date information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Budget Allocation and Spending**: The NHS budget has seen fluctuations, with significant portions allocated to NHS England. For instance, in the 2023/24 fiscal year, Â£171 billion was designated for NHS England to spend on health services[^1]. This allocation reflects the ongoing need to support the core functions of the NHS amidst rising demand.

2. **Impact of Political and Economic Pressures**: Political decisions have fragmented the NHS's component parts, leading to funding pressures and operational challenges. The British Medical Association highlights that these pressures have been exacerbated by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated adjustments in funding priorities[^2].

3. **Service Delivery and Public Perception**: Despite funding increases, there is a public expectation that these should translate into visible improvements in service delivery. The Health Foundation notes that NHS England's funding is set to increase by 3% between 2023/24 and 2025/26, after adjusting for inflation. However, this increase is perceived differently from the headline rate of 4%, indicating a gap between financial inputs and public expectations[^3].
