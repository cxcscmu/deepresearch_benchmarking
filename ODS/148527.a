# Report: Why Single People Get Taxed More

## Executive Summary

Single individuals often face higher tax burdens compared to their married counterparts. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as the "singles tax," arises from various structural and policy-related factors within the tax system. These include differences in tax brackets, the inability to share living expenses, and societal norms that favor married couples. This report explores the reasons behind this disparity and its implications for single taxpayers.

## Methodology

To address the query, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on identifying credible sources that discuss the taxation of single individuals. The search included articles, blogs, and expert opinions from financial and tax-related websites. Key search terms included "singles tax," "taxation of single people," and "single vs. married tax rates."

## Detailed Findings

1. **Tax Brackets and Rates**: Single individuals often face higher tax rates compared to married couples filing jointly. This is because the tax brackets for singles are narrower, leading to higher marginal tax rates for similar income levels. "Income earned by single people is taxed at a higher percentage than married people filing jointly with a similar tax table" [^2].

2. **Inability to Split Costs**: Single individuals cannot benefit from shared expenses, which can lead to higher overall costs. For instance, housing is a significant expense where singles bear the full cost, unlike married couples who can split it. "The biggest factor is housing. Single people often have to choose between getting a roommate or covering the entire cost of a house or apartment on their own" [^5].

3. **Policy and Social Norms**: The tax system is structured in a way that often provides benefits to married couples, which can be seen as a form of subsidy. "When single people pay more than married people do, either financially or emotionally, they are subsidizing married people" [^6].
