Single people often pay more in taxes because their income is taxed at a higher percentage compared to married couples filing jointly. This is due to the tax advantages available to married couples, such as the ability to combine incomes and potentially fall into a lower tax bracket. Additionally, single individuals cannot split everyday costs like rent, which can contribute to a higher financial burden.
