Humans contribute to climate change primarily through activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. These activities include burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity generation, and industry, as well as deforestation and agriculture practices that release carbon dioxide and methane. These actions amplify the Earth's natural greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.
