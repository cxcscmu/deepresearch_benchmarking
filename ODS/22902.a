# Report: Human Contributions to Climate Change

## Executive Summary

Human activities have been identified as the primary drivers of climate change, primarily through the emission of greenhouse gases. These activities include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This report synthesizes information from various authoritative sources to outline the key ways in which humans contribute to climate change.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and search engines. The focus was on reputable sources such as government agencies, scientific organizations, and educational institutions. The search terms included "human causes of climate change," "greenhouse gas emissions," and "anthropogenic climate change." The selected sources were analyzed for relevant information and direct quotes were extracted to support the findings.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Human activities have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. According to NASA, "Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)"[^1]. This increase in CO2 and other greenhouse gases is a major factor in global warming.

2. **Deforestation and Land Use**: The European Commission highlights that "Burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature"[^2]. Deforestation reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO2, exacerbating the greenhouse effect.

3. **Industrial Activities**: The United Nations notes that "Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions"[^3]. Industrial processes not only emit CO2 but also other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide, contributing to climate change.

## Limitations

This report is based on the most recent data available up to October 2023. Some sources may have more recent updates that were not included. Additionally, while the report focuses on human contributions, it does not extensively cover natural factors influencing climate change. The findings are based on the selected sources and may not encompass all perspectives or emerging research in the field.
