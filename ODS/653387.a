Socioeconomic status (SES) significantly impacts learning outcomes. Students from lower-income backgrounds often face challenges such as slow academic skills development, low literacy, and increased dropout rates. Poverty can affect brain development, inhibiting a child's ability to learn and understand. Additionally, low-income students are more likely to enter the labor market early due to poor academic achievements. Conversely, students from higher SES backgrounds tend to have stronger motivations related to learning and better educational outcomes.
