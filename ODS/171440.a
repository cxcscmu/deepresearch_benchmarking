Happiness can impact biological factors and health across different cultures by enhancing immune system functioning and providing health benefits such as lower blood pressure, reduced heart disease, and better weight management. Cultural differences influence how happiness is perceived and pursued, which can affect how these health benefits manifest. For example, European Americans may seek happiness through excitement and cheerfulness, which can lead to different health outcomes compared to cultures that value other emotional states.
