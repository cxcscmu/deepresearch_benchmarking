Human trafficking can be alleviated through various actions, such as raising awareness, supporting anti-trafficking NGOs, and encouraging policy change. It is also important to monitor supply chains, offer support to those at risk, and contact authorities if suspicious activities are observed. Additionally, creating safe environments, increasing training, and building partnerships within communities can help prevent trafficking.
