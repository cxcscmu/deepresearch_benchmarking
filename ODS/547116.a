A community might not be involved in the research process due to misunderstandings about the goals, benefits, or process of research, which can strain relationships between communities and researchers. Additionally, community members are often not meaningfully engaged or considered equal partners in the research, and there may be a lack of study benefits, poor informed consent procedures, or ignorance of health research.
