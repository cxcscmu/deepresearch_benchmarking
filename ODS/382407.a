# Climate Change and Its Impact on Human Health

## Executive Summary

Climate change is increasingly recognized as a significant threat to human health globally. It affects health directly through extreme weather events and indirectly by altering the conditions that support life, such as air quality, water supply, and food security. This report synthesizes findings from various authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive overview of how climate change impacts human health.

## Methodology

To gather information on the health impacts of climate change, a targeted search was conducted using specific keywords such as "climate change health effects," "climate change and human health," and "health impacts of climate change." The search focused on reputable sources, including government agencies and health organizations, to ensure the reliability of the information. The search results were then analyzed to extract relevant data and direct quotes.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Increased Respiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases**: Climate change exacerbates air pollution, which can lead to increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that "the health effects of these disruptions include increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease"[^1].

2. **Extreme Weather Events**: The frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms, and floods, are increasing due to climate change. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that "climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health" by affecting the physical environment and human systems[^2]. Similarly, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highlights that climate change "includes increasing the risk of extreme heat events and heavy storms"[^3].

3. **Spread of Infectious Diseases**: Changes in climate can alter the distribution of vector-borne diseases. The Better Health Channel explains that climate change may affect health through "changes in the spread of infectious diseases"[^4].

## Limitations

This report is based on available data up to October 2023, and some sources may have more recent updates that are not included. Additionally, the search was limited to English-language sources, which may exclude relevant findings from non-English publications. The complexity of climate change impacts means that this report provides a general overview rather than an exhaustive analysis of all potential health effects.
