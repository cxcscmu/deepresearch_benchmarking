Reality is socially constructed through the interactions and shared understandings among people. This process involves the use of symbols, language, and institutions, which help shape individuals' experiences and perceptions of reality. According to the Thomas theorem, people's behavior is influenced by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality.
