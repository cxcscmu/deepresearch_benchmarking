After the Holocaust, many senior Nazi leaders were brought to trial, most notably during the Nuremberg Trials. Some top Nazis, such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler, committed suicide and thus avoided trial. Others were executed or imprisoned, while many lower-ranking Nazis managed to escape justice or reintegrated into society. Some Nazi scientists and engineers surrendered to the Allies and were recruited for their expertise.
