# Report on How Humans Are Causing Climate Change

## Executive Summary

Human activities have been identified as the primary drivers of climate change, primarily through the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These activities include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.

## Methodology

To compile this report, a comprehensive search was conducted using various online resources and databases. The search focused on reputable sources such as government agencies, scientific organizations, and educational institutions. The primary tools used included Google Search and academic databases to ensure the information was accurate and up-to-date.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Burning of Fossil Fuels**: The combustion of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is a major source of CO2 emissions. According to NASA, "Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric CO2" [^1].

2. **Deforestation and Land Use Changes**: The removal of forests for agriculture and urban development reduces the earth's capacity to absorb CO2. The European Commission notes that "cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature" [^2].

3. **Industrial Activities**: Manufacturing and industrial processes release significant amounts of greenhouse gases. The United Nations highlights that "generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions" [^3].

4. **Agriculture**: Agricultural practices, including livestock production, contribute to methane emissions. The Environmental Defense Fund states, "Humans are the main cause of climate change â€” burning fossil fuels, producing livestock, clearing trees and otherwise increasing the amount of greenhouse gases" [^4].

## Limitations

This report is based on available data up to October 2023, and some sources may have more recent updates that are not included. Additionally, while the report focuses on human causes of climate change, it does not extensively cover natural factors that may also contribute to climate variability. The findings are based on the interpretation of available literature and may not encompass all perspectives on the issue.
