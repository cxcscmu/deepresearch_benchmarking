Humans are causing climate change primarily by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is mainly due to activities such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, industrial processes, agriculture, deforestation, and oil and gas development. These activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.
