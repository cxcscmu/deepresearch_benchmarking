Stereotyping can have several negative effects, including perpetuating inequality, creating divides among people, and placing significant burdens on those affected. It can lead to harmful consequences for individuals' quality of life, such as inducing anxiety and impairing cognitive performance. Stereotypes can also result in a toxic work environment and negatively impact individuals' performance, even when the stereotypes are seemingly positive.
