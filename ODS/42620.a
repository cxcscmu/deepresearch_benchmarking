Women played a crucial role in the struggle against apartheid by actively participating in demonstrations, leading opposition movements, and using their platforms, such as music, to voice resistance. They faced multiple forms of oppression—racial, social, and sexual—which fueled their involvement in the anti-apartheid movement. Women trade unionists were also prominent in opposing Afrikaner nationalism and apartheid, and figures like Miriam Makeba used their art to articulate the struggle.
