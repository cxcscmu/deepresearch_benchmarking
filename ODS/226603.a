# Factors Determining Organizational Disaster Risks

## Executive Summary
Understanding the factors that determine the types of disasters an organization may encounter is crucial for effective disaster preparedness and response. These factors can be broadly categorized into structural, demographic, and environmental elements. By identifying and analyzing these factors, organizations can better prepare for potential disasters, thereby minimizing their impact.

## Methodology
To gather information on the factors determining organizational disaster risks, a comprehensive search was conducted using online databases and resources. The search focused on scholarly articles, government publications, and industry reports. Key search terms included "disaster risk factors," "organizational disaster preparedness," and "emergency response factors." The search yielded several relevant sources, which were analyzed to extract pertinent information.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Structural Factors**: The structure of an organization and its disaster response teams can significantly influence disaster risk. According to a study on emergency and disaster medical response teams, "the model and structure of EDMRTs have a direct relationship with such elements as the structure of the disaster risk" [^1]. This suggests that how an organization is structured can affect its vulnerability to disasters.

2. **Demographic and Disaster-Related Characteristics**: A study on disaster response competency highlights the importance of demographic factors, stating that "demographic and disaster-related characteristics" play a crucial role in influencing disaster response competency [^2]. This implies that the characteristics of the workforce, such as age, health, and experience, can impact how an organization responds to disasters.

3. **Environmental and Event-Specific Factors**: The nature of the disaster itself, including the time of day or year it occurs, can affect its impact on an organization. As noted in a chapter on disaster planning, "factors that influence the impact of a disaster on a community include the nature of the event, time of day or year, health and age characteristics of the population" [^3]. This highlights the importance of considering environmental and temporal factors in disaster preparedness.

## Limitations
The findings are based on available literature and may not cover all possible factors influencing disaster risks. The search was limited to English-language sources and may not include insights from non-English publications. Additionally, the dynamic nature of disasters means that new factors may emerge over time, necessitating ongoing research and adaptation of disaster preparedness strategies.
