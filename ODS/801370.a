# Report: How Hitler Addressed the German Economy

## Executive Summary

Adolf Hitler's approach to reviving the German economy was multifaceted, involving a combination of public works, military rearmament, and strategic economic policies. Upon becoming Chancellor in 1933, Hitler inherited an economy devastated by the Great Depression, with unemployment rates nearing 30%. His administration implemented measures that significantly reduced unemployment and stimulated economic growth, albeit with a focus on preparing for war. These efforts included large-scale public works projects, deficit financing, and the promotion of autarky. However, these policies also led to increased state control over the economy and were underpinned by militaristic and expansionist objectives.

## Methodology

To compile this report, I utilized a variety of online resources, including Wikipedia, educational websites, and historical analysis platforms. The search strategy involved using keywords such as "Hitler economic recovery," "Nazi economic policies," and "German economy under Hitler." The tools used included search engines and academic databases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Public Works and Employment**: Hitler's government continued and expanded upon the public works programs initiated by the Weimar Republic. These projects, such as the construction of the Autobahn, were supported by deficit spending and aimed at reducing unemployment. "The policies he inherited included large public works programs supported by deficit spending—such as the construction of the Autobahn network—to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment" [^1].

2. **Military Rearmament**: A significant portion of economic recovery was driven by military rearmament. The Nazi regime prioritized military spending, which eventually dominated the economy. "Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, and the military eventually came to represent the majority of the German economy in the 1940s" [^1].

3. **Economic Self-Sufficiency and Trade Policies**: The Nazis pursued autarky to reduce reliance on foreign imports, although full self-sufficiency was unattainable due to resource limitations. "Germany began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency... A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European Countries" [^1].

4. **Privatization and State Control**: While privatization was pursued to raise funds, the state maintained significant control over the economy through regulation and political interference. "Industries were privatized en masse... However, the privatization was 'applied within a framework of increasing control of the state over the whole economy through regulation and political interference'" [^1].

## Limitations

The report is based on secondary sources, which may contain biases or incomplete information. The complexity of economic policies and their impacts can be difficult to fully capture in a brief report. Additionally, the focus on military and autarkic policies may overshadow other economic aspects that contributed to the recovery. Further research into primary sources and economic data from the period would provide a more nuanced understanding.
