Adolf Hitler implemented several measures to address Germany's economic issues during his regime. These included large-scale public works projects like the construction of the Autobahn, rearmament which boosted industrial production, and policies aimed at achieving full employment. Additionally, he implemented strict controls on wages and prices and promoted autarky to reduce reliance on foreign imports. These actions temporarily improved the economy and reduced unemployment, but they were unsustainable and heavily reliant on military expansion and preparation for war.
