The debate over whether schools should be allowed to ban books is contentious. According to a national poll, more than 67% oppose efforts to remove books from schools, indicating significant public opposition to book bans in educational settings. However, some parents and advocates argue for restrictions, with 60% of parents believing that school libraries should limit access to certain books by age or require parental permission. The discussion involves balancing concerns about protecting children from potentially harmful content and the importance of providing access to diverse perspectives for intellectual growth.
