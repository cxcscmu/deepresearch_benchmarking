The two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are very safe and very good at preventing serious or fatal cases of COVID-19. The risk of serious side effects associated with these vaccines is very small.\nLisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention, and Gabor Kelen, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response, answer questions about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Safety \u2014 What We Know\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are strongly recommended as safe and effective at preventing serious illness or death from COVID-19.\nFrom December 2020 to December 2021, about 470 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the U.S.\nRoughly 12 months of data, including data from tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials, show that the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious disease or death due to COVID-19.\nAdditional shots and boosters are also authorized for those who meet the guidelines.\nmRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has been in development for over 15 years.\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines received full FDA approval, which means more data show how well that particular vaccine works.\nDue to potential blood clots following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC updated its recommendations in December 2021. The CDC noted that the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which remains available for those who prefer it and for use in certain circumstances.\nAre there risks or safety concerns regarding the COVID vaccines?\nTo help catch risks or safety concerns, the CDC and FDA monitor possible safety issues with the COVID-19 vaccines. This ongoing work has led to revised recommendations for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and information about rare side effects tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\nJohnson & Johnson/Janssen. In December 2021, the CDC updated its recommendations and stated that either of the two mRNA vaccines is preferred over the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC explained that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are preferred due to a greater risk for developing rare but severe blood clots, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), following administration of the J&J vaccine. The CDC noted that there are some situations when a J&J vaccine may still be used, if the recipient understands the risks and benefits of the J&J vaccine. Read about side effects related to the rare blood clot.\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we offer Pfizer and Moderna vaccines throughout our vaccine clinics. We have a limited supply of J&J vaccine and only offer it by request and if the recipient clearly understands the risks and benefits.\nPfizer and Moderna. After observing rare occurrences of myocarditis following the second injection of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC released information for the public. Most of these myocarditis events happened in teens and young adults, and the majority of the cases were mild and cleared up on their own. Read about side effects related to myocarditis.\nThis review process continues to monitor vaccine safety. Potential risks of COVID-19 vaccines are reviewed and weighed against the benefits of protection that the vaccines offer as well as the known, serious risk of harm due to COVID-19.\nWhat if I got a J&J vaccine? Should I worry about blood clots?\nIf you received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than three weeks ago, you do not need to watch for side effects related to blood clots.\nIf you received the J&J vaccine within the last three weeks, you should watch for possible symptoms of TTS and get medical help immediately if you have any of the following:\nSevere or persistent headaches or blurred vision\nShortness of breath\nChest pain\nLeg swelling\nPersistent abdominal pain\nEasy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin near the injection site\nIs there a risk of an allergic reaction to a COVID vaccine?\nAccording to the CDC, anyone who has a severe allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of the mRNA vaccine ingredients should not receive this vaccine. The CDC says people with allergies to certain foods, insects, latex and other common allergens can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Those with a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to injectables or other vaccines should discuss the vaccination with their doctor, who can evaluate and assess their risk.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know | Las vacunas anticovid-19: informaci\u00f3n imprescindible\nLet's Talk Health (Hablemos de Sauld) | The COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know\nWatch on\nHow was the COVID-19 vaccine developed so quickly?\nThe relatively quick development of these vaccines does not mean safety measures were skipped. There are several reasons why the COVID-19 vaccines were developed faster than other vaccines:\nThe technologies used to develop the COVID-19 vaccines have been in development for years to prepare for outbreaks of infectious viruses. The manufacturing processes were ready very early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCountries shared genetic information when it was available about SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which gave vaccine developers an early start at finding a vaccine.\nThe testing processes for the vaccines didn\u2019t skip any steps, but the vaccine developers conducted some stages of the process simultaneously to gather as much data as quickly as possible.\nGovernments gave money to vaccine developers in advance, so the companies had resources they needed.\nSome types of COVID-19 vaccines were created using messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that allows a faster approach than the traditional way vaccines are made.\nSocial media enabled companies to reach out to and enroll study volunteers, and plenty of people wanted to help, so there were enough research participants to test the COVID-19 vaccines.\nBecause SARS-CoV-2 is so contagious and widespread, many volunteers who got the vaccines were exposed to the virus, and with so many exposures, it took a shorter time to see if the vaccines worked.\nCompanies began manufacturing vaccines ahead of their authorization or approval so some supplies would be ready if authorization occurred.\nWhat steps are taken to help make sure the COVID-19 vaccines are safe?\nSafety is always a top priority as federal agencies work with vaccine manufacturers and independent scientific organizations to develop, study, authorize and approve new vaccines. Here are some of the steps taken for COVID-19 vaccines, as well as other vaccines:\nCareful testing. All vaccines go through clinical trials to test safety and effectiveness. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA set high safety standards for vaccine developers to meet. This graphic from the National Institutes of Health shows the four phases a vaccine goes through before it is released to the public.\nAuthorization for emergency use. If a vaccine or medicine is needed to address an emergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, once it is shown to be safe and effective, the FDA can grant it an emergency use authorization (EUA). An EUA allows a vaccine, treatment or medication to be used before the formal FDA approval.\nContinuous monitoring for problems and side effects. Once a vaccine gets an EUA and is being given to people, the FDA and the CDC continue to watch carefully in case problems arise. Data on the vaccine\u2019s safety record accumulates over time, as more and more people who receive it report on their experience and any side effects. One important way to report adverse events after vaccination is through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\nLearn more from the CDC about the safety steps for the COVID-19 vaccine.\nDemographics of the COVID-19 Vaccine Trials\nDemographics of the COVID-19 Vaccine Trials\nWatch on\nDo I still have to wear a mask if I get a vaccine?\nThe CDC continues to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and makes recommendations for wearing face masks, both for those who are fully vaccinated as well as people who are not fully vaccinated.\nThe CDC also recommends that masks and physical distancing be required when going to a doctor\u2019s office, hospital or long-term care facility, including all Johns Hopkins hospitals, care centers and offices.\nJohns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s mask safety guidelines have not changed, and we still require everyone to wear masks inside all of our facilities.\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\nYou cannot and will not get COVID-19 from any of the vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines do not have any virus or other infectious material in them.\nWhat about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for diverse groups of people?\nThe FDA and other reviewers closely consider diverse populations and include them in the trials. The clinical trials for the first two COVID-19 vaccines included members of underrepresented minorities and older age groups, and people with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart and respiratory conditions.\nDoes Johns Hopkins Medicine recommend that I get a COVID-19 vaccine?\nYes, we recommend that everyone who is eligible get vaccinated with one of the currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer or Moderna. We view both as highly effective in preventing serious disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (including disease caused by the very contagious delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus), and we believe that their benefits outweigh their risks.\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we offer Pfizer and Moderna vaccines throughout our vaccine clinics. We have a limited supply of J&J vaccine and only offer it by request and if the recipient clearly understands the risks and benefits.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Email Alerts\nSign up to receive coronavirus (COVID-19) email updates from Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nSign up now"}, {"Url": "https://hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-myth-versus-fact", "CluewebURLHash": "793B9D358835B445DCEB083F9976EFB4", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "COVID-19 Vaccines: Myth Versus Fact | Johns Hopkins Medicine", "Snippet": "The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain the SARS-Co-2 virus, so you cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine.

The truth is that the COVID-19 vaccine encourages the body to create copies of the spike protein found on the coronavirus\u2019s surface. This \u201cteaches\u201d the body\u2019s immune system to fight the virus that has that specific spike protein on it.\nConfusion arose when a false report surfaced on social media, saying that the spike protein on this coronavirus was the same as another spike protein called syncitin-1 that is involved in the growth and attachment of the placenta during pregnancy. The false report said that getting the COVID-19 vaccine would cause a woman\u2019s body to fight this different spike protein and affect her fertility. The two spike proteins are completely different and distinct, and getting the COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the fertility of women who are seeking to become pregnant, including through in vitro fertilization methods. During the Pfizer vaccine tests, 23 women volunteers involved in the study became pregnant, and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss had not received the actual vaccine, but a placebo.\nGetting COVID-19, on the other hand, can have potentially serious impact on pregnancy and the mother\u2019s health. Learn more about coronavirus and pregnancy. Johns Hopkins Medicine encourages women to reach out to their medical providers to discuss other questions they have about COVID-19 as it relates to fertility or pregnancy.\nMYTH: If I\u2019ve already had COVID-19, I don\u2019t need a vaccine.\nFACT: Evidence continues to indicate that getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the best protection against getting COVID-19, whether you have already had COVID-19 or not.\nA study published in August 2021 indicates that if you had COVID-19 before and are not vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected is more than two times higher than for those who were infected and got vaccinated.\nWhile evidence suggests there is some level of immunity for those who previously had COVID, it is not known how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again. Plus, the level of immunity provided by the vaccines after having COVID-19 is higher than the level of immunity for those who had COVID but were not subsequently vaccinated.\nGetting vaccinated provides greater protection to others since the vaccine helps reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nAt the time of vaccination, be sure to tell your care provider about your history of COVID-19 illness, including the kind of treatment, if any, you received and when you recovered. Wait until your isolation period ends before making an appointment to get the vaccination.\nMYTH: Researchers rushed the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, so its effectiveness and safety cannot be trusted.\nFACT: Studies found that the two initial vaccines are both about 95% effective \u2014 and reported no serious or life-threatening side effects. There are many reasons why the COVID-19 vaccines could be developed so quickly. Here are just a few:\nThe COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were created with a method that has been in development for years, so the companies could start the vaccine development process early in the pandemic.\nChina isolated and shared genetic information about COVID-19 promptly, so scientists could start working on vaccines.\nThe vaccine developers didn\u2019t skip any testing steps, but conducted some of the steps on an overlapping schedule to gather data faster.\nVaccine projects had plenty of resources, as governments invested in research and/or paid for vaccines in advance.\nSome types of COVID-19 vaccines were created using messenger RNA (mRNA), which allows a faster approach than the traditional way that vaccines are made.\nSocial media helped companies find and engage study volunteers, and many were willing to help with COVID-19 vaccine research.\nBecause COVID-19 is so contagious and widespread, it did not take long to see if the vaccine worked for the study volunteers who were vaccinated.\nCompanies began making vaccines early in the process \u2014 even before FDA authorization \u2014 so some supplies were ready when authorization occurred.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know | Las vacunas anticovid-19: informaci\u00f3n imprescindible\nLet's Talk Health (Hablemos de Sauld) | The COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know\nWatch on\nMYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine means I can stop wearing my mask and taking coronavirus precautions.\nFACT: The CDC continues to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and makes recommendations for wearing face masks, both for those who are fully vaccinated as well as those who are not fully vaccinated.\nThe CDC also recommends that masks and physical distancing are required when going to the doctor\u2019s office, hospitals or long-term care facilities, including all Johns Hopkins hospitals, care centers and offices.\nJohns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s current mask safety guidelines have not changed, and we still require all individuals to wear masks inside all of our facilities.\nMYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine gives you COVID-19.\nFACT: The vaccine for COVID-19 cannot and will not give you COVID-19. The two authorized mRNA vaccines instruct your cells to reproduce a protein that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which helps your body recognize and fight the virus, if it comes along.  The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain the SARS-Co-2 virus, so you cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. The protein that helps your immune system recognize and fight the virus does not cause infection of any sort.\nMYTH: The side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are dangerous.\nFACT: The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines can have side effects, but the vast majority are very short term \u2014not serious or dangerous. The vaccine developers report that some people experience pain where they were injected; body aches; headaches or fever, lasting for a day or two. These are signs that the vaccine is working to stimulate your immune system. If symptoms persist beyond two days, you should call your doctor.\nAlthough very low risk, due to potential blood clots following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC updated its recommendations in December 2021. The CDC noted that the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which remains available for those who prefer it and for use in certain circumstances.\nIf you have allergies \u2014 especially severe ones that require you to carry an EpiPen \u2014 discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with your doctor, who can assess your risk and provide more information about if and how you can get vaccinated safely.\nRead more about vaccine safety.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Email Alerts\nSign up to receive coronavirus (COVID-19) email updates from Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nSign up now\nMYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine enters your cells and changes your DNA.\nFACT: The COVID-19 vaccines are designed to\u00a0help your body\u2019s immune system fight the coronavirus. The messenger RNA from two of the first types of COVID-19 vaccines does enter cells, but not the nucleus of the cells where DNA resides. The mRNA does its job to cause the cell to make protein to stimulate the immune system, and then it quickly breaks down \u2014 without affecting your DNA.\nMYTH: The messenger RNA technology used to make the COVID-19 vaccine is brand new.\nFACT: The mRNA technology behind the new coronavirus vaccines has been in development for almost two decades. Vaccine makers created the technology to help them respond quickly to a new pandemic illness, such as COVID-19.\nMYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine was developed with or contains controversial substances.\nFACT: The first two COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized by the FDA contain mRNA and other, normal vaccine ingredients, such as fats (which protect the mRNA), salts, as well as a small amount of sugar. These COVID-19 vaccines were not developed using fetal tissue, and they do not contain any material, such as implants, microchips or tracking devices.\nMYTH: Now that we have a vaccine for COVID-19, we can make vaccines for the common cold, HIV and other diseases.\nFACT: The thousands of viruses that cause various diseases are very different. Many change (mutate) year by year, making it difficult to develop one vaccine that works for a long period of time.\nDeveloping vaccines for some disease-causing viruses is tough. For example, the virus that causes HIV can hide and make itself undetectable by the human immune system, which makes creating a vaccine for it extremely difficult.\nThe common cold can be caused by any one of hundreds of different viruses, so a vaccine for just one of them would not be very effective.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nWhat you need to know from Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nLearn More"}, {"Url": "https://uab.edu/news/health/item/12143-three-things-to-know-about-the-long-term-side-effects-of-covid-vaccines", "CluewebURLHash": "17B4B02543A2D9D44FEA57EDBB8B5C98", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Three things to know about the long-term side effects of ...", "Snippet": "\ue000COVID\ue001 \ue000vaccine\ue001 experience over the past six months \u201cBy the time the Pfizer and Moderna \ue000COVID\ue001 \ue000vaccines\ue001 were approved for emergency use in the United States in December 2020, we already knew the short-term side effects very well from the efficacy studies,\u201d Goepfert said.", "Click_Cnt": 0.047, "CluewebID": null, "CluewebDocument": null}, {"Url": "https://theburningplatform.com/2021/11/04/the-covid-vaccines-are-the-most-dangerous-vaccines-in-human-history-by-a-long-shot", "CluewebURLHash": "75CC92FFFC025BE2A54CDB5228EE3E36", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "The COVID vaccines are the most dangerous vaccines in ...", "Snippet": "Guest Post by Steve Kirsch.

The COVID vaccines are over 800 times more deadly.\nAlmost 20 years ago, 60 Minutes ran a story \u201c The Most Dangerous Vaccine \u201d which quoted Paul Offit:\n\u201cWe know if we immunize a million people, that there will be 15 people that will suffer severe, permanent adverse outcomes and one person who may die from the vaccine,\u201d says Dr. Paul Offit, one of the country\u2019s top infectious disease specialists, and he knows all about vaccines that prevent those diseases. In his lab at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, he studies and creates new vaccines. There\u2019s nothing new about the smallpox vaccine.\nThe vaccine was created in 1796. The vaccine used today is essentially the same, Offit says. \u201cWe tend to think of vaccines as being very safe and every effective, which they are. But all the vaccines that we use today are the result of modern technology. That\u2019s not true of the smallpox vaccine. It has a side effect profile that we, we would not accept for vaccines today ,\u201d he says.\nAccording to multiple independent analyses summarized here, the death rate from the COVID vaccines used in the US is at least 400 deaths per million doses. That\u2019s 800 deaths per million fully vaccinated.\nThat makes the COVID vaccines the new leader by a long shot: the most dangerous vaccine ever created in history. They are 800X more dangerous than the smallpox vaccine with respect to death, and over 25X worse with respect to permanent disability (since the permanent disability rates are 10% higher than the death rate as you can see from the OpenVAERS redbox summary for US reports ).\nAccording to Offit, this rate of death and disability is unacceptable. I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve been calling for a halt to these vaccines since May 25, 2021 when I wrote this very long article for TrialSiteNews summarizing what I found after 3 weeks of intensive research.\nnative advertising\nFast forward to the present. Offit voted to approve these same vaccines for kids at the October 26 VRBPAC meeting because he refuses to look at the safety analysis (done using 8 different data sources). Offit thinks nobody has died or been permanently disabled by these vaccines. What does he think caused all those VAERS reports? I wish I could ask him that question. He doesn\u2019t think there is a single death caused by the vaccine. That\u2019s impossible. The VAERS data shows that virtually all the deaths in VAERS are excess deaths. If the vaccine didn\u2019t cause those deaths, what did?\nNobody at the FDA, CDC, or on the committees has figured out that the COVID vaccines are 800X more deadly than the former record holder. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first one to figure this out.\nWhy won\u2019t Offit debate my team of vaccine experts?\nDr. Offit: my team of experts are the biggest and most prominent misinformation spreaders on the planet.

His name is Dr. Brindle and he says they injected a spike protein into people thinking it was an antigen when it was the exact opposite, \u201cThe short answer\u2014.\u00a0The spike protein gets into the blood, circulates through the blood in individuals over several days post-vaccination. Once it gets in the blood, it accumulates in a number of tissues such as the spleen, the bone marrow, the liver, the adrenal glands. And of particular concern for me is it accumulates in the ovaries, in quite high concentrations.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve Made a Big Mistake.\u201d COVID-19 Vaccine Spike Protein is a TOXIN Injected into the Bloodstream.\nDr, Brindle continues \u201cWe made a big mistake; we didn\u2019t realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So, by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. Some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens, in some people, they can cause damage, especially to the cardiovascular system.\u201d\nAccording to the CDC so far there have been 4000 deaths in this country attributed ot he vaccine and another 4000 have come down with e virus after getting both shots. Many people are having blood clots from them and other ailments such as Bell\u2019s palsy and partial paralysis. Another 52,000 in Europe have died from these shots. Famed guitarist Eric Clapton\u2019s hands were paralyzed for a week following his shot.\nRecently, images of red blood cells under the microscope have appeared, showing some shocking revelations of what the vaccine does to the body.\nAfter the mRNA vaccine, the images of the red blood cells have an abnormal membrane and start to clump together.\nAnd that\u2019s only the beginning.\nActivated white blood cells were seen everywhere on a single drop of blood. This means either the white cells were stimulated by the vaccine OR more likely activated by the toxins in the vaccine.\nOther appalling findings include seeing nanoparticles viewed which are possibly the result of the vaccine. And not surprisingly, thrombosis, or the clumping of cells together, was viewed under the microscope.\nProfessor Montagnier, who has a Nobel Prize in Science and is one of the best virologists in the world, says any foreign substance injected into the body induces oxidative stress.\nAll signs pointing to negative health outcomes for those receiving the mRNA vaccine.\nDr. joseph Mercola explains what Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology, says about the dangers of the Covid jab:\nAs explained by Malone, many months ago he warned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that the spike protein \u2014 which the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d instruct your cells to make \u2014 could be dangerous. The FDA dismissed his concerns, saying they did not believe the spike protein was biologically active. Besides, the vaccine makers specifically designed the injections so that the spike protein would stick and not float about freely.\nWell, they were wrong on both accounts. It\u2019s since been well-established that, indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gets free, and that it is biologically active and causes severe problems. It is responsible for the most severe effects seen in COVID-19, such as bleeding disorders, blood clots throughout the body and heart problems.\nThese are the same problems we now see in a staggering number of people having received one or two shots of COVID-19 \u201cvaccine.\u201d For more in-depth information about how the spike protein causes these problems,\nUsing the word vaccine isn\u2019t really appropriate here, and I don\u2019t want to contribute to the misuse of that word. These injections are clearly not vaccines. They don\u2019t work like any previous conventional vaccines. As the actual inventor of the mRNA vaccines clearly says in the interview, they are gene therapy. So, please understand that when I say vaccine or vaccination, I\u2019m really talking about gene therapy.\nDr. Malone also goes on to say that the CDC panel says heart inflammation cases likely linked to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\nIn a recent interview with Alex Pierson, Canadian immunologist and vaccine researcher Byram Bridle, Ph.D.who I mentioned above,, discussed previously unseen research obtained from the Japanese regulatory agency through a freedom of information act request.\n\u201cThe study was a biodistribution study done by Pfizer, which showed that the mRNA in the vaccine does not stay in and around the vaccination site but is widely distributed in the body, as is the spike protein.\nThis is a serious problem, as the spike protein is a toxin shown to cause cardiovascular and neurological damage. Once in your blood circulation, the spike protein binds to platelet receptors and the cells that line your blood vessels. When that happens, it can cause platelets to clump together, resulting in blood clots, and/or cause abnormal bleeding. I detailed these and other findings in \u201cResearcher: \u2018We Made a Big Mistake\u2019 on COVID-19 Vaccine.\nDisturbingly, the Pfizer biodistribution data package reveals that corners were cut in the interest of speed, and one of the research facets that were skipped was reproductive toxicology. Yet, despite the lack of an initial reproductive toxicology investigation and a rapidly growing number of reports of miscarriages (which is likely to be a significant undercount), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still urging pregnant women to get vaccinated. Why is that?\u201d\nA new study has confirmed that people who have been vaccinated against COVID produce excessive spike proteins that are capable of passing the Blood Brain Barrier causing irreparable damage to the brain \u2014 and Pfizer\u2019s own documents warn that vaccinated people actually shed these excessive spike proteins putting the unvaccinated at risk for harm:\nIn their latest issue brief, America\u2019s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) warned how\u00a0spike proteins resulting from experimental COVID-19 gene therapy vaccines have the capacity to 1.) pass through the \u201cblood-brain barrier\u201d causing neurological damage, 2.) be \u201cshed\u201d by the vaccinated, bringing about sickness in unvaccinated children and adults, and 3.) cause irregular vaginal bleeding in women.\nThe Former Vice President of Pfizer, Dr. Michael Yeadon has warned against these vaccines and wanted to stop using them and warned other companies \u00a0to stop using them. He has said that there is \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d propaganda coming from governments in response to COVID-19, including the \u201clie\u201d of dangerous variants and the totalitarian potential for \u201cvaccine passports. Dr  Yeadon said recently : \u201cBeyond reasonable doubt vaccination of entire population is predictably leading to substantial loss of life\u2019\nIn an exclusive interview with LifeSite News, Dr. Yeadon, who was the Chief Scientist for Allergy & Respiratory and spent 32 years in the industry leading new medicines research, said that there is a strong possibility of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that would lead to carnage far worse than the horror witnessed in the 20th Century.\nLifeSite News listed Dr. Yeadon\u2019s seven main points from their interview as follows:\nThere is \u201cno possibility\u201d current variants of COVID-19 will escape immunity. It is \u201cjust a lie.\u201d\n2. Yet, governments around the world are repeating this lie, indicating that we are witnessing not just \u201cconvergent opportunism,\u201d but a \u201cconspiracy.\u201d Meanwhile media outlets and Big Tech platforms are committed to the same propaganda and the censorship of the truth.\n3. Pharmaceutical companies have already begun to develop unneeded \u201ctop-up\u201d (\u201cbooster\u201d) vaccines for the \u201cvariants.\u201d The companies are planning to manufacture billions of vials, in addition to the current experimental COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d campaign.\n4. Regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, have announced that since these \u201ctop-up\u201d vaccines will be so similar to the prior injections which were approved for emergency use authorization, drug companies will not be required to \u201cperform any clinical safety studies.\u201d\n5. Thus, this virtually means that design and implementation of repeated and coerced mRNA vaccines \u201cgo from the computer screen of a pharmaceutical company into the arms of hundreds of millions of people, [injecting] some superfluous genetic sequence for which there is absolutely no need or justification.\u201d\n6. Why are they doing this? Since no benign reason is apparent, the use of vaccine passports along with a \u201cbanking reset\u201d could issue in a totalitarianism unlike the world has ever seen. Recalling the evil of Stalin, Mao, and Hitler, \u201cmass depopulation\u201d remains a logical outcome.\n7. The fact that this at least could be true means everyone must \u201cfight like crazy to make sure that system never forms.\u201d\nMany other scientists who have spoken out are censored.\u00a0 Nobody is allowed\u00a0to know the true purpose of the vaccine, and they will ridicule any facts about it, like they shut off Dr. Yeaddon, who was CEO from Pfizer.\u00a0 He sent out a full review on the vaccine to all the media, thousands of outlets, especially MSM.\u00a0 Only one small outlet responded, whose video was posted online and only a few saw.\u00a0 He is being shunned by all his colleagues, whom he describes as being in a deep trance.\nSecond they came up with a name for people who oppose the vaccine as \u00a0\u201canti vaxxers\u201d like they are a problem.\nThirdly, they set out to debunk and ridicule anyone who speaks against vaccine.\u00a0 They\u2019ve engaged the FBI to raid the homes at 3 am of the outspoken doctors.\nI thought it highly suspicious when the government was forcing these shots on everyone. They\u2019re not concerned about our health. These shots are toxic and no good. These vaccines were never to help us.\u00a0 Governments\u00a0don\u2019t do that anymore.\u00a0 Those vaccines were meant to severely hurt us or kill us.\u00a0 No other reason.\nAs soon as I read that Dr. Fauci has the patent on this vaccine as he does with over 100 other vaccines many who have killed people throughout the world as Bill Gates has also with vaccines in India and Africa where he is no longer allowed, I\u2019m believing more and more these vaccines are for depopulation which Faui and Gates both believe in for their New World Order or great reset for 2030.\nBill Gates has publicly stated there should only be 500 million people in the world and there are currently seven billion and we need to eliminate at least six billion to save the planet from too much carbon dioxide breathed into the air. Gates has said the only way to do that is through vaccinations.\nAnd they say these vaccines are safe????\nNew reports highlight exactly what we have suspected for a while; namely, that people who got the Covid-19 jab will probably need a booster shot. When, and how often they will need boosters remains to be seen.\nAs sources point out, scientists need more data before they can make an accurate forecast on how often people will need booster shots.\nThis lack of data is EXACTLY why people are hesitant to take the first round of the Covid-19 vaccine altogether. The very fact that scientists need to wait to figure out what is going on should excuse people altogether.\nAlthough many scientists estimate that the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines authorized in the United States will last at least a year, no one knows for sure. It is also unclear whether emerging variants of the coronavirus will change our vaccination needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters here in terms of boosters,\u201d said Dr. Edward Belongia, a physician and public health researcher at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Marshfield, Wisconsin.\nPfizer and Moderna have fueled booster questions by estimating that people might need yearly shots, just like with flu vaccinations, and the companies are working to have some candidates ready this fall. But companies will not decide when boosters get used. That will be up to health authorities in each country.\nAnd they say these vaccines are safe???\nI report, you decide.\nLoading...\nRelated\nThe Vaccines Are Not Safe, Not Effective,Not A Vaccine And People Are Dying And Permanently Injured From\u00a0Them!!!March 28, 2022With 3 comments\nAgenda 21,Vaccines And\u00a0Depopulation!!!

What is wrong with booster shots?\nImplications for doctors and patients.\nSummary: Are COVID Booster Shots and Vaccines Safe and Necessary? New Discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Vaccine-Immune Interactions\nBy now, most people have heard that COVID-19 vaccines can cause blood clotting and bleeding. Some readers may even be aware that reports of death following COVID-19 vaccination outnumber those for all vaccines combined since records began, 31 years ago, in the official US database VAERS [1,2].\nWith many patients now having received their first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines, additional booster shots are being rolled out in many countries. Given that no clinical trials have been performed on more than two injections of any vaccine, it is important that doctors and patients understand how the vaccines interact with the immune system, and the implications for booster shots.\nSo far, doctors and patients confronted with information on COVID vaccine side effects are typically reassured that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks. Governments, the pharmaceutical industry, regulators and the media advise populations that the majority of adverse events are mild and transient, with serious complications in only a small minority of vaccine recipients.\nMost patients, however, are unaware that among relevant scientific experts such a view is not so readily shared. Eminent independent scientists and researchers in the fields of immunology and microbiology have been writing to medical regulators since early 2021 [3], warning of vaccine-related blood clotting and bleeding, including that the official data on blood abnormalities post-vaccination likely represent \u201cjust the tip of a huge iceberg\u201d [4]. Those scientists\u2019 warnings pre-dated vaccine suspensions around the world due to acute disease from aberrant blood clotting post-vaccination. The warnings were based on established immunological science, applied to the novel mechanism of action of the gene-based COVID- 19 vaccines.\nNow, more than six months later, new discoveries in the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 [5] have caught up with the rushed vaccination schedule, confirming and extending the experts\u2019 prior warnings. The good news is that we are more comprehensively protected against COVID-19 by our own pre-existing immunity than was previously understood. On the other hand, this pre-existing immunity aggravates the risk that COVID-19 vaccines will induce blood clotting and/or leaky blood vessels. This risk must be expected to escalate with each revaccination. Vaccine-induced harm to our blood vessels is unlikely to be rare.\nPerhaps the most pertinent finding is that, due to the discovery of a widespread memory-type antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, the antibodies induced by the COVID-19 vaccines can be expected to activate the so-called complement system. This can bring about the destruction of any cell that manufactures the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, particularly in the circulation. If that happens to the endothelia, that is, the cell layer that lines the inner surfaces of our blood vessels, then those vessels may begin to leak [6] and clots will form. Given that 2021 research showed the spike protein to enter the bloodstream shortly after vaccination [5], this dangerous endothelial involvement in spike-production is highly likely, and should be expected to occur.\nAs stark as these medical realities may be, the silver lining is that the same antibody profile, along with previously documented T-cell immunity [7\u201311], protects around 99% of the population against life- threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. This ties in with the known fact that over 99% of people are safe from death with COVID-19 [12\u201314]. The implications for doctors and patients are that:\nVaccination against COVID-19 is unnecessary. Populations are protected by their immune systems against COVID-19. This applies to SARS-CoV-2 in all its variants.\nBooster shots are uniquely dangerous, in a way that is unprecedented in the history of vaccines. This is because repeatedly boosting the immune response will repeatedly boost the intensity of self-to-self attack.\nAn important consideration for patients is that those who have already been vaccinated against COVID- 19, and whose health remains intact, can protect themselves against serious harm by stopping now.\nFor a detailed explanation of the science behind these vaccine-immune interactions, please read Part II. Implications for doctors and patients are considered in Part III.\nIn Full: Explanation of New Findings on the Immunology of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Vaccines\n2.1. How and why COVID-19 vaccines incite immunological attack on blood vessel walls. What is wrong with booster shots?\nUntil recently, the immune profile of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines was not fully characterised. While we have known since mid-2020 that robust and lasting memory T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exists [7\u201311], the antibody picture has been less clear. Now, however, a convergence of evidence from peer reviewed studies published in 2021 reveals that pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 involves not only T-cells but also memory antibodies, in 99% of people studied. Two publications from 2020 alert to the probability that the immune response to the vaccine will also involve an important and powerful component called the complement system. This has profound consequences for the risk-benefit analysis of the vaccines.\nKey papers behind these recent developments are:\nOgata et al. [15] showing that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein circulates in the bloodstream shortly after vaccination with mRNA vaccine. This constitutes compelling evidence that spike protein molecules are produced by cells that are in contact with the bloodstream. The endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls naturally represent prime candidates.\nAmanat et al. [16], Ogata et al. [15], and Wisnewski et al. [17], who found that circulating SARS- CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies became detectable within 1-2 weeks after mRNA vaccination. This early response indicates immunological memory\u2014it can only be elicited through re-stimulation of pre-existing immune cells.\nGallais et al. [18], who provided data consistent with a memory-type antibody response in over 99% of people studied following first contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nWisnewski et al. [17], who reported a very rapid increase of spike protein antibodies after the second injection of mRNA vaccines. This finding underscores the immediate dangers of revaccination.\nMagro et al. [19,20] showing that following entry into the bloodstream, spike protein directs complement attack to the inner vessel lining, causing damage and leakiness of the blood vessels\nAn explanation of the underlying immunology for laypeople follows.\n2.2. Updated Immune Profile of COVID-19 and its Vaccines\nImportantly for COVID-19 vaccination, the 2021 discoveries reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 is not truly new to our immune systems. The finding that the overwhelming majority of people show a memory-type antibody profile to COVID-19 vaccines proves that our immune systems have seen viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 before. As a result, our bodies have stored an immune memory of that family of viruses, equipping us to fight back more rapidly and powerfully the next time we encounter a similar virus again. As SARS-Cov-2 is of the coronavirus family, this indicates that we possess lasting cross-immunity from previous exposure to other coronaviruses, such as common cold coronaviruses, which are in wide circulation globally. Simply put, almost anyone who is fundamentally healthy\u2014or \u2018immunocompetent\u2019\u2014is naturally sufficiently protected against COVID-19.\nThis immunological status accords with the well-documented reality that the infection fatality rate for COVID-19 is 0.15-0.2% worldwide [12\u201314]. As is well known, COVID-19 infection runs a fatal course only in those who are weakened by age and significant comorbidity. Put differently, once infected, COVID-19 is non-lethal to >99.8% of the world\u2019s population. This same figure is upwards of 99.9% in the young and middle-aged. These statistics reflect the fact that protective cross-immunity is the global norm.\n2.3. A Word on \u201cCases\u201d\nBut what about the second and third waves of \u201ccases\u201d, including from Delta and other variants, around the world?\nIt is important to understand that a COVID-19 \u201ccase\u201d, as currently defined, does not correspond to being ill. To an unprecedented extent in medical history, rather than referring to actual disease, the term \u201ccase\u201d has become conflated with nothing more than a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result. While PCR tests are useful in laboratory research and as diagnostic tools when carefully performed, they are not reliable or appropriate when used in isolation, nor set at extremely high sensitivities, nor in poorly trained hands, as has been the case overwhelmingly for COVID-19.\nIt has long been known that reliance on PCR tests alone to define medical \u201ccases\u201d and causes of death results in \u201coverdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased health care costs\u201d [21]. If PCR alone were used to diagnose an infection with the diarrhoeal pathogen Clostridium difficile (CD), for instance, an epidemic of CD would immediately appear. We would find, based on PCR results, that 50% of people in long term care, and 15% of those hospitalised for any reason, are CD \u201ccases\u201d [22]. Should they die of any cause\nfollowing a positive PCR test for CD, they would be recorded as \u201cdying with\u201d CD. That figure could conceivably approach 100% if PCR tests were performed at the high sensitivities, or cycle thresholds, routinely employed when testing for COVID-19, in which the sensitivity of the test has been dialled up to meaningless extremes [23].\nMoreover, even if we accepted PCR alone as a diagnostically appropriate tool\u2014and therefore the high number of \u201ccases\u201d that it generates\u2014we would still necessarily infer a very low infection fatality rate for COVID-19. This supports rather than contradicts the reality that SARS-CoV-2 poses no significant threat to the immunocompetent. In short, thanks to population immunity, for the vast majority of us, a \u201ccase\u201d does not equate to severe disease.\n2.4. Four Immunological Problems with COVID-19 Vaccines\nWhile the now clearly established widespread cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 implies that most of us are safe from severe COVID-19 disease, it also means that we are vulnerable to the harms of gene- based vaccines. Due to recall immunity against the virus, vaccination will cause our immune systems to fight aggressively against not only the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but against ourselves. This deleterious autoimmune attack must be expected to intensify with each repeated injection.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine technology\u2019s interaction with the immune system creates the following four specific problems:\nFlying under the immune system\u2019s radar with the vaccine\u2019s genetic code 2. Delivering the spike protein into the bloodstream\nInducing immune attack on the blood vessel lining\nEnhancing the severity of natural infection\n2.4.1. Flying Under the Immune System\u2019s Radar with the Vaccine\u2019s Genetic Code\nTo understand why COVID-19 vaccine technology is dangerous, it is necessary to first understand how\nthe gene-based vaccines differ from traditional vaccination methods.\nA conventional viral vaccine can be a live virus strain derived from the pathogenic virus that has been attenuated through one or more genetic mutations, or it can consist of chemically inactivated virus particles that are no longer able to infect any cells. In both cases, protein antigens will be exposed on the surface of the vaccine particles, which can be recognized by antibodies once these have been formed.\nCOVID-19 vaccines, on the other hand, are not protein antigens but the genetic blueprint for the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein antigen. That blueprint comes in the form of mRNA or DNA, which, after vaccination, enters our body\u2019s cells and instructs those cells to manufacture the spike protein. The spike protein then protrudes from the cell and induces antibody formation. In response, the immune system will react not only with the spike protein, but will attack and try to destroy the entire cell.\nIf we are injected with a traditional live virus vaccine to which we have no immunity, then these vaccine virus particles will also infect some of our body cells and propagate within them. Two kinds of immune reactions will then occur:\nCytotoxic T-lymphocytes (killer T-cells) (see section 2.4.3.1) that recognize viral protein fragments associated with the infected cells will proliferate, attack, and destroy the infected cells.\nB-lymphocytes that recognize viral proteins (see section 2.4.3.2) will proliferate and start producing antibodies\u2014soluble protein molecules that can recognize and neutralize virus particles.\nThis immune reaction will in principle resemble that to an infection with the corresponding wild-type virus. It will be milder, since the vaccine strain of the virus has been attenuated; however, some cells will get destroyed in the process, which may sometimes cause functional organ damage. Live virus vaccines therefore tend to be more prone to adverse reactions than are inactivated virus vaccines.\nNow, a key point to note is that if we inject a live traditional vaccine into a person who is already immune \u2014due to either a previous vaccination, or to prior infection with the corresponding wild-type virus\u2014the extent of cell destruction will be much reduced. Such a person will already have antibodies to the virus; these will recognize the viral protein antigens and will bind and inactivate most of the vaccine virus particles before they manage to infect a cell. Therefore, even though the killer T-cells may be all riled up, they will not find very many infected cells to pounce on.\nThe crucial difference between a conventional live virus vaccine and a gene-based COVID vaccine\u2014and in particular an mRNA vaccine\u2014is that the latter contains no protein antigens whatsoever; instead, it only contains the blueprint for their synthesis inside the infected cells. Therefore, if such a vaccine is injected into a person with antibodies and existing T-cell immunity, the vaccine particles will \u201cfly under the radar\u201d of the antibody defence and reach our body cells unimpeded. The cells will then produce the spike protein, and subsequently be destroyed and attacked by the killer T-cells. The antibodies, rather than preventing the carnage, will join in by also binding to the cell-associated spike protein and directing the complement system (see later) and other immune effector mechanisms against these cells. In a nutshell, pre-existing immunity mitigates the risk of conventional vaccines, but it amplifies the risk of gene-based vaccines.\nImportantly, before COVID, this risky gene-based vaccine technology had never before been used on a wide scale against infectious disease and is inherently experimental. The COVID-19 vaccination program is thus the largest human experiment ever performed in history.\n2.4.2. Delivering the Spike Protein into the Bloodstream\nA dire danger of COVID-19 vaccines is that spike proteins produced by myriad endothelial cells, i.e. the innermost cells lining blood vessel walls, will be exported to the cell surface and protrude directly into the bloodstream. Moreover, a fraction of these spikes will be cleaved during their passage to the outside world. They will fall off the cells into the bloodstream and then bind to their receptors on other endothelial cells at distant sites.\nWhile at the outset of the vaccination campaign in 2020 it was unknown to what extent COVID vaccines entered the bloodstream, human data from 2021 reveal that the spike protein shows up within the circulation on the very day of the injection [15]. Similarly, animal studies submitted by Pfizer to the Japanese government [24] found that the vaccine appears in the circulation within 15 minutes of intramuscular injection, reaching maximum plasma concentration within just two hours. Very high levels have subsequently been recorded in the liver, the spleen, the adrenal glands, and the ovaries. Vaccine components have also been observed in the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord), albeit at lower concentrations. Such widespread distribution throughout the body via the bloodstream is a feat that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not usually achieve.\n2.4.2.1. Open Questions in the Ongoing Experiment\nBut how do COVID-19 vaccine particles enter the circulation in the first place? The vaccine is injected intramuscularly, and the vaccine particles are too large to passively diffuse across blood vessel walls. Most obviously, the vaccines will follow the conventional, relatively time-consuming path which takes them via the draining lymph nodes to the blood circulation. But additionally, two possibilities for very rapid entry\ninto the bloodstream should be heeded. The first is via direct uptake by vessels that are damaged during insertion of the needle. Secondly, it is possible that the vaccine particles undergo \u2018transcytosis\u2019, a process that enables large molecules to be transported across intact cell layers. Whatever the case may be, although Pfizer knew before the onset of clinical trials that their vaccine reached the bloodstream rapidly, either they failed to file these findings with medical regulators in Europe, the US and other Western countries, or the regulators failed to act upon the findings [25].\nThis is a critical oversight where patient safety is concerned. Given that the gene-based vaccines induce the body\u2019s cells to become immune targets, where in the body this takes place is of critical concern. While immune-mediated cell death is never favourable, it is particularly detrimental and dangerous if it afflicts the blood vessel walls.\n2.4.3. Attacking the Vessel Walls: Clotting and Leaky Vessels\nWhile all vaccines seek to stimulate an immune response, not all immune responses are created equal. Some are safe and well-modulated whereas others can be misdirected and out of control. Immune responses are problematic when they attack the self, as in autoimmune conditions, and/or when they are excessively intense and severe.\nCOVID-19 vaccines incur problematic immunity in both key ways. First, they can be expected mobilise a self-to-self immune response against the endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls. Second, by boosting SARS-CoV-2 immunity, they can be expected to incite an increasingly aggressive response with each administration of the vaccine.\nTo understand the realities of these processes it is necessary to first understand the basics of the underlying immune response. There are three key components of the immune system relevant to risks from COVID- 19 vaccines: T-cells, antibodies and the complement cascade.\n2.4.3.1. T-cells\nOnce the body\u2019s cells have been infected with a virus, immune cells known as cytotoxic T-cells or T-killer cells attack and destroy the infected cells. This prevents infected cells from replicating the virus and spreading the infection throughout the body. After the initial battle with a certain pathogen is over, some of the specifically adapted T-cells enter a state of dormancy to become memory T-cells. In case the same virus is encountered again, these dormant T-cells can be swiftly reawakened and propagated to mount a faster and more vigorous response next time. Known as a secondary or memory-type response, it will also occur with viruses that are not exactly the same as the one initially encountered but sufficiently similar to be recognised. This latter phenomenon is referred to as cross-immunity.\nIt has been known since mid 2020 that we are protected against SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive memory T-cells [7\u201311]. As with antibodies, this is based on previous encounters with common cold coronaviruses, and with the SARS virus in a small number of people. Such prior experience has been found to confer \u201crobust\u201d [7] and lasting T-cell cross-immunity to COVID-19. T-cell memory for the SARS virus is known to last at least 17 years [7], but it likely lasts a lifetime.\n2.4.3.2. Antibodies\nBefore the new discoveries of 2021, scientists\u2019 concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial cells, causing lesions on\nvessel linings and promoting blood clots. While this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well.\nWhereas killer T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen\u2019s surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by \u201ccalling out the cavalry\u201d on infected cells.\nThis leads to the second process by which cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune attack. \u201cCalling out the cavalry\u201d means that the antibodies attached to the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial cells.\nImportantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen, new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen\u2019s epitopes must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks. This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen before.\nAnother defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new, IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its relatives, have invaded before.\nImportantly, this is precisely what we see with COVID-19.\nSeveral research groups found in 2021 that upon first exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even \u201con the slightest viral challenge\u201d [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel coronavirus after all.\nWith respect to variants and the need for booster shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody response. The rising \u201ccases\u201d, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26].\nBut why haven\u2019t circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before? The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement cascade.\n2.4.3.3. Complement\nRecent findings indicate that complement activation is a serious concern with respect to COVID-19 vaccine-immune interactions.\nIn light of the newly characterised antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, when antibodies attach to spike- producing endothelial cells on vessel walls following vaccine administration, activated complement proteins can be expected attach to the endothelial cells, and perforate their cell membranes [27,28]. The ensuing death of the endothelial cells will expose the tissue underneath the epithelium, which will initiate two significant events. It will induce blood clotting, and will cause the vessel walls to leak [6]. This pathogenic mechanism has been documented in biopsies taken from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [19,29]. Those studies have described a \u201ccatastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement\u201d [29] as part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immune response. It is precisely this immune response that COVID-19 vaccines seek to induce.\nSuch vaccine-immune interactions are consistent with adverse events involving visible capillary rupture under the skin that have been documented and reported following COVID-19 vaccination [30\u201333].\n2.4.3.4. Leaky Vessels\u2014The Promise of Booster Shots\nGiven that booster shots repeatedly boost the immune response to the spike protein, they will progressively boost self-to-self immune attack, including boosting complement-mediated damage to vessel walls.\nClinically speaking, the greater the vessel leakage and clotting that subsequently occurs, the more likely that organs supplied by the affected blood flow will sustain damage. From stroke to heart attack to brain vein thrombosis, the symptoms can range from death to headaches, nausea and vomiting, all of which heavily populate adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines [2].\nAs well as damage from leakage and clotting alone, it is additionally possible that the vaccine itself may leak into surrounding organs and tissues. Should this take place, the cells of those organs will themselves begin to produce spike protein, and will come under attack in the same way as the vessel walls. Damage to major organs such as the lungs, ovaries, placenta and heart can be expected ensue, with increasing severity and frequency as booster shots are rolled out.\n2.4.4. Enhancing the Severity of Wild Coronavirus Infection\nFinally, as with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the net effects are severely detrimental.\nAttempts to develop vaccines to the original SARS virus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35\u201337]. The vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were subsequently infected with the wild-type virus, they became more ill than the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38].\nImplications for Doctors and Patients\nAlthough vaccine manufacturers and regulators are aware of the risks of antibody enhancement of disease, this possibility was not adequately addressed in the clinical trials on any of the COVID-19 vaccines. The\nFDA noted that Pfizer, \u201cidentified vaccine-associated enhanced disease, including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, as an important potential risk\u201d [23]. The EMA similarly acknowledged that \u201cvaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease\u201d was \u201can important potential risk\u2026 that may be specific to vaccination for COVID- 19\u201d.\nWhy neither regulator sought to exclude such dangers prior to emergency use authorisation is an open question that all doctors and patients are entitled to ask. Why medical regulators failed to investigate the finding that large vaccine particles cross blood vessel walls, entering the bloodstream and posing risks of blood clotting and leaky vessels is yet another open question again.\nThe fact that vaccine rollout began before the immune profile of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines had been adequately delineated is symptomatic of a rushed and highly politicised approach to the approval and regulation of COVID-19 vaccines. As is the lack of clinical trials investigating the safety of COVID- 19 booster shots.\nIn this context, it is up to doctors and patients to uphold the social contract of the doctor-patient relationship, and take medical prudence and patient safety into their own hands.\nThe World Medical Association, Declaration of Geneva, Physician\u2019s Pledge states [39]:\n\u201cThe health and wellbeing of my patient will be my first consideration. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will practise my profession with conscience and dignity and in accordance with good medical practice. I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my patient. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat.\u201d\nReferences\nOpen VAERS, (2021) VAERS COVID vaccine data.\nOpen VAERS, (2021) All deaths reported to VAERS by year\nDoctors for Covid Ethics, (2021) Doctors for COVID Ethics: letters.\nDoctors for Covid Ethics, (2021) Rebuttal letter to European Medicines Agency from Doctors for\nCovid Ethics, April 1, 2021.\nBhakdi, S. et al.

Immunologist Dr. Bart Classen writes: 4\n\u201cDevelopment of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long-term safety testing. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations.\nThe enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks lead the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.\u201d\nAmid the challenges of physical adverse effects from the vaccines, the lack of adequate testing and the underhanded methods in which vaccination may ultimately be made mandatory, many are now faced with the moral dilemma of being injected with genetic material that was grown in aborted fetal cell cultures. 5\nAborted Fetal Cell Cultures Used in Vaccine Production\nFebruary 27, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration 6 announced the authorization of emergency use for the Johnson & Johnson single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. At the same time, the Archdiocese of New Orleans announced that the vaccine is \u201cmorally compromised as it uses the abortion-derived cell line in development and production of the vaccine as well as the testing.\u201d 7\nIn addition to their warning that Catholics avoid the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because of its \u201cextensive use of abortion-derived cell lines,\u201d 8 the Archdiocese acknowledged that while there: 9\n\u201c \u2026 was some lab testing that utilized the abortion-derived cell line, the two vaccines currently available from Pfizer and Moderna do not rely on cell lines from abortions in the manufacturing process and therefore can be morally acceptable for Catholics as the connection to abortion is extremely remote.\u201d\nThere are other clergy members that disagree with using any of the vaccines available for COVID-19 since, as the statement above indicates, abortion-derived cell lines were used in the lab testing. 10 However, the Vatican has been aggressively pro-vaccine and approved the use, writing: 11\n\u201cIn this sense, when ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines are not available \u2026 it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.\u201d\nThe debate within the Catholic Church has a long history, which centers on using HEK293 cells that were harvested from an aborted fetus in the early 1970s. 12 The disagreement leaves many within the church without clear guidance from religious leaders.\nSemantics and Technicalities Used to \u2018Debunk\u2019 the Truth\nMuch of the confusion about using aborted fetal tissue in testing and production can be summed up in the statement from The Washington Post, which said in an archived version of a March 2, 2021, article, \u201cThe cells used now, such as those used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, are not from the original fetal tissue.\u201d 13 It should also be noted that an updated version 14 of the same article deletes this quote without mentioning that the article has been changed.\nThis is a common mistake that has been perpetuated in the media using general language to describe the process, which is precisely what self-declared fact-checkers use when they rate something false or misleading. As detailed in \u201d Several COVID-19 Vaccines Are Made Using Aborted Fetal Cells ,\u201d the answer lies in the technicalities and not in the general terms.\nThere have been several cell lines commonly used in vaccine development that originated from aborted fetuses.15 Six vaccine makers are using at least one of these cell lines in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, including AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.\nFact-checkers label \u201cfalse\u201d the claims that cell lines from an aborted fetus have been used in the testing and development of the vaccine for several reasons. Some critics of abortion-derived cell lines have claimed that the vaccines contain the cells, and since the vaccines literally do not contain abortion-derived cells, the entire claim is labeled as false.\nIn other instances, fact-checkers claim the cell lines are not original, as in the statement from The Washington Post, but rather a clone. While there may indeed be some who are concerned that the cells could be in the vaccine, typically, the moral objection is to the use of aborted fetal cells in medical research and development.\nWhatever the concern, it has become apparent that fact-checkers are trying to dissuade people from having a public conversation about the ethics of using abortion-derived cell lines to produce and test vaccines.\nIn fact, fetal cell lines are used during the production of certain vaccines and the claim that the cells are clones of the original is like saying your 20-year-old or 40-year-old body is no longer your body since all the cells are copies of those when you were a baby.\nThey are, in essence, a clone of the original. However, there is virtually no difference between cells that grow and multiply in a petri dish and those that grow and multiply in your body during your lifetime. If the cells in your body are still you, then the cells in the petri dish are still those of the original aborted fetus.\nReports of Side Effects Are Rising Rapidly\nSide effects from the mRNA genetic therapies used to create novel \u201cvaccines\u201d are inevitable. The genetic material effectively turns your cells into bioreactors 16 that turn out viral proteins to incite an immune response. Historical and preliminary evidence shows there are short and long-term side effects.\nAs Judy Mikovits, Ph.D., explains in her interview featured in \u201c How COVID-19 \u2018Vaccines\u2019 May Destroy the Lives of Millions ,\u201d the mRNA is synthetic, which the body sees as \u201cnon-self.\u201d This can trigger the production of autoantibodies to attack your own tissues.\nCommonly reported side effects in those who have received the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines have included symptoms that are suggestive of neurological damage.\nSince the vaccines began being distributed some of the side effects have included severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, 17, 18, 19 seizures and convulsions, 20, 21 persistent headache and migraine, 22 paralysis 23 and sudden death within hours or days. 24, 25, 26, 27\nAs detailed in \u201c Why COVID Vaccine Testing Is a Farce ,\u201d Mikovits predicts a long-term significant uptick in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as psychosis, Parkinson\u2019s, migraines, ALS and sleep disorders. She also believes there will also be a rise in pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, as well as cancers, kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few.\nAdditionally, Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, a pediatric rheumatologist specializing in multisystem inflammatory syndrome, submitted a public comment 28 to the FDA in December 2020, in which he expressed concern that mRNA vaccines have \u201cthe potential to cause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in ways that were not assessed in safety trials.\u201d\nHe cited research showing that \u201cthe spike protein in brain endothelial cells is associated with formation of microthrombi (clots).\u201d It seems that since no viral RNA has been found in brain endothelium, \u201cviral proteins appear to cause tissue damage without actively replicating virus.\u201d\nGovernments \u2018Held to Ransom\u2019 to Secure Vaccine Deals\nWithin the U.S., vaccine makers enjoy full indemnity against injuries that happen from the COVID-19 vaccine, or any other pandemic vaccine, under the PREP Act. If you\u2019re injured, you must file a compensation claim with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). 29 This is funded by taxpayers through the Congressional appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\nAlthough similar to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), the CICP is even less generous than the NVICP when it comes to compensation. You will be responsible for any attorney fees and expert witness fees.\nAnother problem is that, like the NVICP, the CICP is administered within the DHHS, which also operates and promotes the COVID-19 vaccination program. This is a significant conflict of interest that makes it less likely the CICP will acknowledge that a COVID-19 vaccine harmed someone. 30\nHowever, in many countries outside the U.S., drug manufacturers are not afforded such liability protection. While most governments are offering indemnity to the vaccine manufacturers, there are a fair few who have not. According to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 31 Pfizer has asked for sovereign assets in Argentina and Brazil to be put up against any future legal costs.\nOfficials from Argentina and an unnamed Latin American country, which cannot be revealed as it signed a confidentiality agreement with Pfizer, told a journalist from The Bureau of Investigative Journalism they felt: 32\n\u201cPfizer\u2019s demands went beyond those of other vaccine companies, and beyond those of Covax, an organization created to ensure low-income countries can access vaccines, which is also requiring its members to indemnify manufacturers.\u201d\nDo Your Own Risk-Benefit Analysis Before Deciding\nBefore taking the vaccine it\u2019s important to do your own risk-benefit analysis based on your moral beliefs and science. It is crucial to be careful about making up your mind before using experimental gene therapy.\nIt is also important to remember that the lethality of COVID-19 is surprisingly low, lower than the flu for those under the age of 60. 33 If you\u2019re under the age of 40, your risk of dying is just 0.01%. This means you have a 99.99% chance of surviving the infection, which can improve to 99.999% if you\u2019re metabolically flexible, insulin sensitive and vitamin D replete.\nThe mRNA vaccines are not designed to prevent infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, only to reduce the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 disease. In the meantime, you also have the potential of becoming sicker once exposed to the virus, or it may trigger persistent serious side effects such as those reviewed above.\nI urge you to take the time to weigh the potential risks and benefits based on your situation before making a decision you could regret for the rest of your life. Undoubtedly, Pfizer and other vaccine makers suspect this as well, which is why they are asking for indemnification from all governments and are working hard to quash any public debate about the morality or science behind the vaccine. https://articles.mercola.com/sites/mercola/special-content/nvic-conference.aspx?cid_medium=email\nhttps://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/03/25/covid-vaccine-morally-compromised.aspx?ui=a468010ffca324df72434fc1695dac5999dd01a6bba7897c6a8cbd3afbd3d619&sd=20210122&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20210325_HL2&mid=DM839649&rid=1116118935\nLike\n7 bloggers like this.\nIn \"Covid-19\"\nCovid-19\nVaccines\nklevon\nMarch 25, 2021\nLockdowns: The Biggest Public Health Mistake Ever\u00a0Made\nBaltimore Health Dept.\u00a0Statistics"}, {"Url": "https://mediamatters.org/laura-ingraham/fox-guest-says-covid-vaccine-downright-dangerous-and-will-send-you-your-doom", "CluewebURLHash": "E55F2ADC582B8CB063388B75262A4F0B", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Fox guest says COVID vaccine is \"downright dangerous\" and ...", "Snippet": "Fox guest says\ue000 COVID vaccine\ue001 is \u201cdownright\ue000 dangerous\u201d\ue001 and will send you \u201cto your doom\u201d Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi: \u201cI think it\u2019s\ue000 downright dangerous\u201d\ue001 Written by Media Matters Staff", "Click_Cnt": 0.03, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0019-60-13130", "CluewebDocument": "Fox guest says COVID vaccine is \"downright dangerous\" and will send you \u201cto your doom\u201d | Media Matters for America\nFox guest says COVID vaccine is \u201cdownright dangerous\u201d and will send you \u201cto your doom\u201d\nDr. Sucharit Bhakdi: \u201cI think it\u2019s downright dangerous\u201d\nWritten by Media Matters Staff\nPublished 12/02/20 11:35 PM EST\nMedia error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found\nDownload File: https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/D8Video/2020/12/02/FNCHD_The%20Ingraham%20Angle_2020-12-02-10_00_00-PM.mp4?VersionId=scyx7NT60ORAsX_VzCOegTsJgJLZTHjc\nFrom the December 2, 2020, edition of Fox News' The Ingraham Angle\nLAURA INGRAHAM (HOST): Doctor, on the issue\u00a0of the vaccine, tonight, Anthony Fauci, on this network, actually\u00a0said that 75% of Americans are\u00a0going to have to get vaccinated\u00a0to reach what they call\u00a0\u201cherd\u00a0immunity\".\u00a0Do you -- do you buy that?\nDR.

Photo: AFP\nIn ground-breaking news, Spanish medical researchers in two separate studies have analyzed the contents of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine vials and found a toxic blood-clotting substance or poison that may be responsible for adverse effects and deaths in recipients.\nThe toxic substance graphene oxide was found in the Pfizer vials by Spanish researchers has now been confirmed to also be the main ingredient in the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to another scientific research group.\nThe news first came out on June 25 on a Spanish television show. El Gato al Agua, a current affairs show hosted by Jos\u00e9 Javier Esparza broke the news that toxic nanoparticulates of graphene oxide have been found in massive quantities in the Pfizer vaccine analyzed by Dr. Pablo Campra Madrid and other biochemists and academics at the University of Almeria, on the initiative of La Quinta Columna, a small group of Spanish researchers headed by Dr. Ricardo Delgado and Dr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Sevillano.\nDr. Delgado states that the nanographene oxide creates thrombogenicity or blood-clotting in the veins, compromises the immune system, causes bilateral pneumonia, causes loss of smell and taste, causes multi-organ inflammation and essentially creates all the symptoms attributed early in the pandemic rollout to COVID-19.\nThe researchers note that graphene oxide has been used before in small quantities as an adjuvant in vaccines, and may be found at low levels in flu shots.\nThe surprise here in the vials tested was the high quantity of graphene oxide, with Dr Delgado claiming it made up close to 98 percent to 99 percent of the contents.\nThese findings add to the alarm bells being rung by health professionals around the world over the alleged dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines, including the problems allegedly associated with the experimental mRNA contents in the vaccines.\nHowever, this graphene oxide finding is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the dangers and complexity of this unprecedented worldwide vaccine experiment.\nHard evidence \u2013 most available in the public domain \u2013 is now being brought forward to try to explain how this came about.\nAnd here we are caught up with an inconvenient truth \u2013 allegations that the COVID-19 pandemic was man-made and planned.\nSo, how did we get into this situation?\nSEEKING A RETURN TO \u2018NORMAL\u2019\nControversy continues to grow over the unprecedented push to vaccinate billions of people around the world to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and health authorities are claiming receiving the vaccine \u2013 typically administered in two doses \u2013 will allow people to return to their normal lives and help prevent the spread of the virus that according to official figures has infected 189 million and killed over 4 million worldwide as of mid-July 2021.\nMany people appear to be rushing to get the shot so that they can be free to travel or free to enter pubs, restaurants or entertainment venues, as governments edge towards mandatory vaccines and the restrictions of vaccine passports.\nHowever, a growing body of medical experts and researchers are raising the alarm over these unprecedented moves built on what they claim are, firstly, questionable COVID-19 virus case numbers, secondly, the potential dangers posed by the vaccines, and, thirdly, fraud.\nWorryingly, evidence is emerging through the examination of publicly released plans, patents and dossiers compiled by researchers going back as far as 1999 that the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic was planned, was man-made and was released to funnel people towards taking the vaccine.\nIt raises the question - Why do the authorities want the world\u2019s population inoculated with a largely untested, experimental vaccine, one that they admit does not stop the recipient catching or passing on the COVID-19 virus?\nREDUCING THE FIGURES\nGetting a grip on the complexities and figures involved with the pandemic will help in understanding why the world sleepwalked into this unprecedented crisis.\nAt face value, the official figures of 189 million infected and over 4 million killed worldwide sound frightening and there is no reason to make light of the fact that people have suffered and died from what is labelled COVID-19.\nBut the pandemic \u201cnarrative\u201d is beginning to collapse as health authorities start to roll back the numbers \u2013 as seen in the recent announcements of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and what are now recognized as heavily overinflated RT-PCR testing cases and COVID-19 death figures.\nGovernments and health authorities are beginning to admit that they got it wrong both in terms of the COVID-19 numbers \u2013 but also in terms of the potential dangers posed by the vaccines.\nGround zero in the COVID-19 monitoring process is the test to assess whether people have caught the virus. A growing body of medical professionals claim the RT-PCR test is not fit for purpose, with as much as 90 percent of the tests producing \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2013 meaning the actual total case numbers and death numbers could be a fraction of the stated official figures.\nIt is alleged that the core problems with the tests is, firstly, they don\u2019t test for what is said to be COVID-19 \u2013 a virus that has yet to be isolated \u2013 and, secondly, the RT-PCR cycle threshold used in most of the tests around the world was far too high, leading to a misleading number of \u201cfalse positives\u201d.\nA growing number of health officials around the world from the United States to Myanmar admit that the number of people who have died directly and solely of COVID-19 is far less than the published figures. For example, the Minister of Health and Sports in Myanmar stated in 2020 that possibly 90 percent of the COVID-19 death figures in his country should be attributed to other conditions and diseases, not COVID-19.\nLack of clarity with this case toll and death toll has led to a situation where it is becoming clearer that the COVID-19 toll may be exaggerated. Naturally, nobody wants to make light of the deaths of people from COVID-19. And with the media making a fuss about problems of disposing of bodies in India and Myanmar, there is need for caution. But what may be true according to health professionals and researchers is that a sizeable number of people dying are actually dying from other conditions and diseases \u2013 the reason for death put down as COVID-19.\nIn addition, there is a question of perception. The official world death toll of 4 million, even if it is correct, may not be considered to be so sizeable compared to the world death figures for an 18-month period. Approximately 59 million people died in 2020 of various conditions including heart disease, cancer, accidents and old age.\nWhat is clear is how the pandemic has been mismanaged by medical authorities around the world, with a core issue failing to be addressed, namely that traditional medical practice focuses on the ill and those with symptoms \u2013 it does not lockdown healthy individuals or label people COVID-19 positive when they evidently do not have the virus or do not have signs of the virus.\nSuch is the level of deception, hyped up by the media, that a growing number of doctors and lawyers around the world are working on legal cases to take government and health authority figures to court over what they claim is the \u201cbiggest public health scandal in world history\u201d and \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d.\nBut while they may get their day in court, such a process takes time and it can be argued that there is no time to be lost as people continue to line up for the shot.\nPOLITICIZED HEALTH POLICY\nAs reported in previous coverage of the pandemic in Mizzima Weekly, the \u201cCOVID-19 story\u201d or official narrative began falling apart following the release of America\u2019s health expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s private emails in March 2021 and the efforts of doctors, immunologists and researchers that provide a growing body of evidence that not only was the COVID-19 pandemic long in the planning but that the end game was to lock people in to a vaccine regimen rolled out by the vaccine manufacturers that will continue year after year.\nIf the recent findings of the Spanish researchers are an indication, such a regimen could well kill and injure millions of people around the world, given what is in the vaccine vials that they examined.\nNaturally, the idea that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned is hard to stomach and runs counter to the original story promoted by governments and the media in early 2020 that COVID-19 likely had natural origins in a bat or another animal in a wet market in Wuhan, China.\nThe mainstream media and social media have worked hard to try to counter and censor claims that the pandemic was actually planned \u2013 arguably the most prominent \u201cblackout\u201d focused on the documentary\n\u201cPlandemic\u201d in 2020 and the testimony of Dr Judy Mikovits who worked closely with Dr Fauci. Dr Mikovits\u2019 claims and her character have been trashed.\nSuch is the level of censorship that anybody questioning the original \u201cnatural origin\u201d story and why people should take a vaccine tend to be blocked, censored and written off in the media or social media as a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d.\nBut as more research is revealed, with the exposure of patents and publicly available records, serious cracks are appearing in the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d.\nSince the Dr Fauci emails debacle, the idea that COVID-19 may have leaked from a lab has gained more traction, a notion summarily dismissed by the media a year ago. However, care needs to be taken with the claim \u2013 highlighted in Dr Fauci\u2019s attempts to cover up \u2013 that COVID-19 was made in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China as part of \u201cgain of function\u201d virus development.\nChina clearly bears some level of responsibility for allowing the virus to escape and spread around the world if only because it is generally thought that the first cases cropped up in Wuhan and that Beijing should have been quicker to close the city down and close the border.\nHowever, the finger-pointing also involves scientists in the West. What is now evident is that over the last two decades dangerous \u201cgain of function\u201d virus development has been carried out by American, British and Chinese scientists, often with US taxpayers\u2019 dollars, to develop potentially deadly viruses.\nResearchers claim Dr Fauci, Dr Ralph Baric and the CDC are at the hub of the whole COVID-19 story. What appears clear is that between 2002 and 2017, Dr Fauci, Dr Baric and the CDC controlled the cash flow around what could be called the \u201cindustrial complex of the coronavirus\u201d.\nInterestingly, such research and development was outlawed in the USA due to its dangers under the Barack Obama administration in 2015, but then was shifted to China.\nDr Fauci may have been in the cross-hairs of examination last month as he perjured himself by lying in testimony to the US Senate \u2013 yet his emails reveal a different story, one in which he was allegedly one of the leading players in a nefarious and deadly virus and vaccine development scheme worth billions that included virus development in the Wuhan lab.\nTry as he may, it is hard for Dr Fauci to challenge the growing paper trail, interviews, statements and his own emails that indicate his involvement. Yet, despite his grilling in the Senate, he remains America\u2019s health czar.\nVACCINE \u2018FALSE NARRATIVE\u2019\nDeveloping a potentially deadly virus is one thing; pushing a questionable and potentially deadly cure is another.\nA growing body of medical opinion is now questioning the COVID-19 story and the rush to push out a vaccine, now just over six months into rollout.\nAfter all, vaccines typically take years to develop and test.\nDr. Peter McCullough, a highly cited physician who runs two peer-reviewed medical journals and has promoted and had success with the early treatment of COVID-19, has come out with an explosive claim\nthat the medical establishment is complicit in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans through the vaccine.\nHe says the COVID-19 deaths have been facilitated by a false narrative bent on pushing an all-new, unproven vaccine for a disease that was highly treatable.\nDr McCullough says as many as 50,000 Americans may have died due to the vaccine so far in the first six months of 2021, based on the extrapolation of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), noting the claim resulting from a MIT study that the VAERS system, operated by the CDC, typically only represents 1 percent to 10 percent of adverse vaccine effects.\nHe claims whistleblowers within America\u2019s CDC back up this claim.\nLatest VAERS figures for the USA, over the last six months up until July 9, provide the following statistics for people who have received the COVID-19 vaccine: 463,456 Adverse Events, 30,781 Hospitalizations, 9,274 Disabled, 3,906 Heart Attacks, 2,466 Myocarditis Reactions, 1,073 Miscarriages and 10,991 Deaths.\nThe MIT study indicates that these figures could be multiplied 10 to 100-fold \u2013 hence the 50,000 deaths claim, possibly more.\nOhio-based Attorney Thomas Renz recently announced that with the help of America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, he was filing a federal lawsuit in Alabama based on a \u201csworn declaration, under threat of perjury,\u201d from an alleged whistleblower who claims to have inside knowledge of a cover-up of reported deaths filed with VAERS. According to media, this whistleblower has allegedly claimed, under oath, that there are at least 45,000 reported deaths that have occurred within three days of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Renz states that this report of 45,000 deaths is just from \u201cone system\u201d that reports to VAERS.\nA tally of 45,000 would be notably greater than what the CDC is currently reporting, which is 10,991 deaths, and many of those are beyond three days following the shots.\nGovernments, health authorities and the media appear to be trying to cover up the deadly and damaging fall-out from the vaccine drive, though more and more accounts of unusual deaths and suffering are now being published.\nAnybody who reads through the accounts in the USA VAERs system or the UK Yellow Card system \u2013 or visits a multitude of private groups on Facebook or Telegram solely devoted to vaccine effects - will find harrowing accounts of injury and death, many indicating the person was healthy before they had the shot.\nOne Canadian doctor says 62 percent of his patients that he injected with vaccine have now got permanent heart damage.\nDr. Charles Hoffe has been practicing medicine for 28 years in the small, rural town of Lytton in British Columbia, Canada. After he had administered about 900 doses of the Moderna experimental mRNA COVID-19 injections, he sounded the alarm over the severe reactions he was observing in his patients who chose to get the shot, which included death. He chose not to get the shot himself.\nHis claim of 62 percent relates to tests he carried out a sample of the hundreds he has provided the shots for.\nThe result of Dr Hoffe sounding the alarm was a gag order issued against him by the medical authorities in his community and he has lost half his income because he was banned from his work at a local hospital. He continues to speak out.\nTWIST IN THE STORY\nSadly, there appears to be a further twist in the story of the vaccine rollout. Now there are indications that many of the new COVID-19 \u201cvariant\u201d cases are in people who are fully vaccinated according to reports from health professionals.\nDr. Robert Malone, a pioneer in the field of mRNA vaccines, shared a viral Twitter thread recently which lays out a disturbing trend - the most-vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, while the least-vaccinated countries are not.\nAround 85 percent of new COVID-19 \u201cDelta\u201d infections in Israel are reportedly in those who are fully vaccinated.\nWhile full investigations have yet to be carried out into this anomaly, a growing number of media reports appear to indicate that the vaccinated are not protected from the virus.\nBIOWEAPON PHASES?\nResearch and the revelations in public records including the patenting of coronaviruses reveal a frightening reality.\nSpeaking with German attorney Reiner Fuellmich and several other doctors on a video call in June, Dr McCullough outlined in some depth the claim that COVID-19 was a bioweapon and the vaccines represent \u201cphase two\u201d of that bioweapon.\n\u201cAs this, in a sense, bioterrorism phase one was rolled out, it was really all about keeping the population in fear and in isolation and preparing them to accept the vaccine, which appears to be phase two of a bioterrorism operation,\u201d he said.\nDr McCullough\u2019s claim, and the work of attorney Fuellmich, bolster the view that the COVID-19 outbreak was planned and the virus was man-made, as alluded to in the controversy that has blown up over Dr Fauci, his \u201cgain of function\u201d research, the patent paper trail, publications and meetings.\nDr McCullough is not alone in claiming the virus and the rollout of the vaccines are part of a bioterrorism programme that has been years in the making and involves patents, lucrative contracts, and the involvement of health organizations including America\u2019s CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the media and social media hyping up the fear and attempting to suppress any challenge to the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d.\nWhat appears to be emerging is that Dr Fauci was involved in the building of a coronavirus as early as 1999 that was patented in 2002. It was reportedly patented in April 2002 before the outbreak in Asia.\nSome in these scientific development programmes have been surprisingly open in their designs.\nAccording to a statement made by Peter Daszak, head of EcoHealth Alliance in 2015, published in February 2016: \u201cWe need to increase public understanding of the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media and economics will follow the hype. We\nneed to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process.\u201d\nDaszak was one of the members of the WHO investigation team that earlier this year visited China and the Wuhan laboratory, a position indicating a clear conflict of interest, given his involvement in \u201cgain of function\u201d development and his ties to the lab and the overall programme.\nWhat is unclear is how a pathogen identified as COVID-19 was leaked or spread. Did it leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China? Or was it deliberately spread around the world in certain key spots at around the same time?\nThe verdict could well be that this was not an accident, it was intentional. And shockingly it was the result of efforts of scientists and players from the USA, Canada and the UK, and pharmaceutical players, not just Chinese lab technicians.\nThe vaccine manufacturers appear to have been lining up for a slice of the action. Moderna, which was new to vaccine manufacturing, is said to have begun the sequencing of their vaccine in November 2019, a month before the coronavirus outbreak actually happened. The company reportedly knew that is would be placed in the front of the line as early as March 2019.\nVaccine makers and various players linked to the commercial exploitation of a pandemic, including Dr Fauci, spent years working towards a vaccination programme, involving patents, lucrative contracts and funding. Even the \u201clanguage of a pandemic\u201d was being developed during this time.\nThat language was already underway as early as 2004, with Merck coining the term, \u201cthe new normal\u201d, Dr Fauci warning in 2017 of a possible \u201csurprise outbreak,\u201d medical war games being played in October 2019 at the Event 201 in the USA in which hyping up the message in the media was stressed, and the WHO helping to set the stage.\nIn September 2019, Moderna's amended patent filings mentioned \"an accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen\", which is a direct quote that was later used in the WHO's \"A World At Risk\" book, resulting from their pandemic scenario simulation used in Event 201, just weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak started.\nThe WHO book stated the need to have a \"co-ordinated global experience of a respiratory pathogen release, which by September 2020, must put in place a universal capacity for public relations management, crowd control and the acceptance of a universal vaccine mandate.\"\nAll this was said and published \u2013 including WHO\u2019s emphasis on forcing through what they called a \u201cuniversal vaccine mandate\u201d - before the world had even heard of COVID-19.\nWhat all this suggests is that this was not a public health crisis, rather it was an opportunistic marketing campaign to get the public to accept a pan-corona vaccine countermeasure. And they needed the media to create the hype, and investors would follow where they see profit.\nThe release of COVID-19 was the vehicle \u2013 as WHO stressed before the outbreak \u2013 to start a programme to inject every man, woman and child on the planet.\nInterestingly, Dr Fauci had lamented year after year at medical conferences that few were taking the flu shot. Now he has billions of eager citizens around the world lining up for the COVID-19 shot.\nAs doctors and lawyers following these developments closely note, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout campaign ties in with the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGreat Reset\u201d which WEF director Klaus Schwab says seeks to \u201cuse the virus as an opportunity\u201d to dramatically restructure economies, food supply and politics around the world. That process is already underway and stepping up a pace.\n\u2018NOT VACCINES\u2019\nAccording to Dr McCullough, and thousands of other health professionals, including the World Doctors Alliance, the COVID-19 pandemic aim was to cause fear and push forward with a vaccine that would be falsely promoted as protecting people from the virus.\nBut governments, medical authorities and health professionals are failing in their duty of care.\nAccording to a growing body of health professionals, the COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccines.\nThe only way to allow the release of these products was to label them vaccines and claim an emergency to avoid the typical years of testing needed for a vaccine product in order to protect the public.\nInstead, a massive trial is underway, with the vaccine makers admitting that everybody who accepts the vaccine is in an experiment, one due to finish in 2023.\nActual patents for Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s injections more truthfully describe them as \u201cgene therapy,\u201d not vaccines.\nWhat has to be noted is if vaccination is a public health measure that is supposed to protect and benefit the collective, then it would need to, firstly, ensure that the individual who is vaccinated is rendered immune from the disease in question, and, secondly, that the vaccine inhibits transmission of the disease.\nOnly if these two outcomes can be scientifically proven can you say that vaccination protects and benefits the collective \u2014 the population as a whole. But here we run into problems with the mRNA vaccines. The vaccines being used do neither \u2013 neither protect the recipient from the virus or prevent them from passing it on.\nInstead, both COVID-19 and the vaccines have a different purpose. As Dr McCullough points out, speaking with attorney Fuellmich: \u201cBoth the respiratory virus and the vaccine deliver to the human body the spike protein, the gain of function target of this bioterrorism research.\u201d\nA careful examination of the process being pursued showed Dr Fauci reportedly having his efforts to patent vaccines turned down by the US Patent Office, as they did not fit the bill as vaccines in that they did not prevent infection.\nNow we appear to have hundreds of millions of people who are being injected with a pathogen stimulating computer sequence which is being sold under what the patent office, the medical profession and what the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its own clinical standards would not suggest is a vaccine, yet by using the term \u201cvaccine\u201d they are being subjected to what is alleged to be a biological weapon.\nDr Fauci had struggled without success to push flu vaccines to the point where everybody was injected. Now he has a new pathogen threat \u2013 COVID-19 - to encourage everybody to take the shot.\nFAILURE OF CARE\nIf both COVID-19 and the vaccine regimen were planned, this is shocking. But what is equally shocking is the failure of the medical profession to stick to their vows.\nHealth authorities and professionals encouraging people to take the vaccine including those who directly administer it are by and large sidestepping the normal protocol of providing people the opportunity for informed consent. They are failing to provide a duty of care.\nFrom the research and monitoring of the vaccination process, the vaccine recipients are not fully informed about, firstly, what is in the vaccine, secondly, the potential side effects, and, thirdly, the fact that they are taking part in an experimental trial due to end in 2023. Many of the vaccine vials reportedly come with blank pieces of paper, rather than a detailed rundown on contents and advice. Seldom are the contents and status of the trial explained to recipients.\nIn fact, the opposite approach appears to be being taken. Anecdotal evidence and videos of the behaviour of health professionals in the USA, UK and Australia show the health professionals, when challenged, claiming the vaccine is \u201csafe\u201d and encouraging the recipient to accept it.\nWhat is clear is that you cannot have a vaccine that does not meet a single definition of a vaccine.\nWhich begs the question, what would motivate these health officials, health agencies and companies and Dr. Fauci himself to lie and claim that these gene therapies are in fact vaccines when they are not?\nAs has been pointed out by one researcher, if they actually called it what it is, namely \u201cgene therapy chemotherapy,\u201d most people would \u2014 wisely \u2014 refuse to take it. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason for their false categorization as vaccines. But there may be other reasons as well, yet to be investigated.\nAs for the adverse effects of the vaccines, the numbers are growing rapidly with a major cover-up underway.\nINSIDE THE VIAL\nThe Spanish research into the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vials offers a worrying insight into what might be in the shots being given out in their millions around the world.\nBut there is a caveat.\nThe COVID-19 plan may actually be more sophisticated than it appears on the surface. Some doctors and researchers who have been investigating the vaccine roll out have raised the question as to whether different vaccine batches may have different contents.\nDr Richard Fleming, another doctor who is speaking out, says a number of pharmacists have noted privately to him that each COVID-19 vaccine lot has contents that vary from vial to vial, suggesting inconsistencies, with one commentator questioning whether some of them are placebos, some saline, all of which raises the question as to whether people are getting the same shot.\nThe two Spanish research teams are reportedly continuing their investigations into the contents of the vials to check other lots.\nVAX CONUNDRUM\nGiven the atmosphere of fear that has built up around the world, the warnings of researchers, doctors and lawyers that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous are being blanketed out by a billion-dollar push by governments, pharmaceutical companies and the media saying \u201ctake the jab,\u201d even to the point where it has been made mandatory amongst certain workers.\nThe cry of warning is also being censored by the media and social media in an unprecedented push that in itself ought to set off alarm bells, and could get worse as Joe Biden\u2019s administration in the USA colludes with Facebook to block out unwanted information and opinion on this platform.\nMost people are not in a position to understand what is happening and fear prevails.\nOne of the major difficulties can be seen in such countries as Myanmar and India where the impression is that many people are catching COVID-19 and that the only real option is to get vaccinated. However, the medical response to the COVID-19 threat in these countries may be being mismanaged, with an atmosphere of fear and poor health, contributing to the death figures. The current rush for oxygen cylinders indicates that while some may be in need of oxygen, other forms of suitable COVID-19 treatment may not be being provided. On average, COVID-19 has a 99.96 percent survival rate, judging from the admittedly compromised statistics over the last 18 months.\nThe findings of the Spanish researchers present merely the tip of the iceberg of the potential dangers presented by rushing for the vaccine under a programme that clearly is not a vaccine and appears to have other aims \u2013 aims yet to be fully examined.\nWAY FORWARD\nGiven the heavy government and media propaganda used around the world to encourage people to \u201ctake the shot\u201d the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues at a pace, with over a billion people already jabbed.\nHowever, there is growing pushback and questions being asked about the vaccination programme. Opposition is building and growing shriller. Many health professionals are calling for an immediate halt to the vaccine rollout \u2013 often putting their own jobs at risk for speaking out.\nLegal cases are being drawn up. An \u201curgent preliminary report of Yellow Card data\u201d issued by the UK-based Evidence-Based Medicine Consultancy Ltd submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) states that \u201cthe MHRA now has more than enough evidence on the UK\u2019s Yellow Card system to declare the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans.\u201d\nThis is just one of the legal challenges being put forward by lawyers and health professionals in attempts to stop the jab rollout in its tracks, call for an investigation, and bring what they claim are the culprits to justice.\nJan Raphael is the pseudonym for a writer who covers Asian and world affairs.\nSources: CDC, NHS, patents, vaccine manufacturers, VAERS, Yellow Card, Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s emails, US Senate hearings.\nThe views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of Mizzima Media Group."}, {"Url": "https://steverotter.com/side-effects-of-covid-shot", "CluewebURLHash": "B32C8AC56C0D23E2B391A4AF5A6AE7C7", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Side Effects of Covid Shot - VERY DANGEROUS - ROTTER News", "Snippet": "Side Effects of\ue000 Covid Shot\ue001 \u2013 VERY\ue000 DANGEROUS\ue001 Side effects of the\ue000 Covid shot\ue001 are more\ue000 dangerous\ue001 than reported.\ue000 Covid Vaccine\ue001 deaths are on the rise and have serious side effects for those who survive.

No one will be allowed to go anywhere unless proof of vaccination is provided; digital passport.\nFor some vaccinated people, the only place they\u2019re traveling to is the grave.\nThe government continues to peddle the fraudulent, unproved claim that covid vaccines are safe and effective. Nothing could be further from the truth. According to the European Database of Adverse Drug Reactions for\u00a0COVID-19 \u201cVaccines,\u201d 3,964 people have died and 162,610 have been injured, and these are only the ones reported which are a very small percentage of the total.\nWhy are governments relentlessly pushing the covid \u201cvaccine?\u201d If you haven\u2019t figured out by now, it\u2019s all about money and control.\nPeople lining up to get Covid Vaccines are listening to complete strangers (lying news media, Fauci, Bill Gates and government) to allow unknown chemicals to be injected into their bodies. This is not a vaccine, it\u2019s a gene therapy, DNA-altering experiment on the public.\nCovid was Never a killer virus; it was simply the flu, renamed; a scare tactic to enforce a vaccine that kills people.\nNurses Expose Empty Covid Wards.

In a CDC report on the Moderna vaccine, the agency said that\u00a0swelling of lymph nodes, also known as lymphadenopathy, can occur in either the arm or the neck, and is normal.\nThe CDC says swelling of lymph nodes in the neck and armpit is a normal side effect for the covid shot?\nThere are many reports from people saying the covid vaccine is linked to deaths that occurred after\u00a0covid shots were administered, leading many to wonder whether inoculation\u00a0is safe.\nCovid shot side effects also include rash and lumps\nIn January,\u00a02021, Dr. Gregory Michael, a Florida obstetrician and gynecologist, died 16 days after receiving Pfizer\u2019s covid vaccine.\nThe 56-year-old doctor\u00a0developed acute immune thrombocytopenia \u2014 a disorder that prevents the blood from clotting properly.\n\u201cHe was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine at MSMC on December 18, 2020. Three days later, Dr. Gregory Michael saw a strong set of petechiae on his feet and hands, which made him seek attention at the emergency room at MSMC,\u201d Heidi Neckelmann, Michael\u2019s wife said.\n\u201cThe CBC that was done at his arrival showed his platelet count to be 0 (normal platelet counts\u00a0range\u00a0from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.) Dr. Gregory Michael was admitted in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute ITP caused by a reaction to the COVID vaccine,\u201d she continued.\nMany people who died after receiving the Covid \u201cvaccine\u201d had a platelet count of 150 or below \u2013 this is critical.\nPeople WILL NOT take the \u201cvaccine\u201d\nWhat some doctors say about Covid Vaccine Side Effects\nDr. Gregory Michael\u2019s death spurred fears that the vaccine may be directly related to the doctor\u2019s death. However, scientists warned that his death is an isolated case and said the vaccine\u00a0is not related (lies to protect Big Pharma profits.)\n\u201cThese vaccines have had incredible safety profiles in the trials and post-authorization. So far, there has been nothing to confirm these awful events,\u201d Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital,\u00a0said (there were no trials or tests; they are testing on people.)\n\u201cThere are going to be spurious relationships, especially as the vaccine is targeting elderly or those with chronic conditions. Just because these events happen in proximity to the vaccine does not mean the vaccine caused these events,\u201d he added (more lies\u2026you will see the truth below.)\nMany Doctors sell the agenda for kickbacks\nWhere are these \u201cdoctors\u201d getting their Covid Vaccine side effects info and stats?

auto-immune disease.\u00a0 I think we will see massive injuries and a lot more deaths starting somewhere between 4 and 18 months from now.\u00a0 \u00a0This Vaccine will permanently alter your immune system.\n*\u00a0 new type of shot that does not meet any of the criteria of a vaccine.\ndoes not keep you from getting sick, does not change the death rate.\nIt is NOT like getting another flu shot, still have to wear a mask and social distance.\n*\u00a0 When you get this spike antibody in your system it will permanently and irreversibly change your immune system.\u00a0 The messenger RNA is the spike protein to develop an antibody against that spike protein.\u00a0 It means next time you come in contact with a virus the antibody should block you from getting sick.\u00a0 However, not only does it not stop you from getting sick, the antibody itself is going to turn on your body and create havoc and massive auto-immune disease.\n* It attacks your organs by molecular mimicry.\nIt is a genetic modification technology.\n*\u00a0 10 ways it hurts you:\nToo complicated for me so I did not take notes.\u00a0\u00a0see 7M.\n*\u00a0 Governments around the world are saying NO to MRnA vaccines.\n*\u00a0 It is a well designed killing tool.\u00a0 It is a genetic modification technology.\nShe explains how messenger RNA works.\u00a0 The messenger creates a protein and indirectly changes your DNA.\u00a0 Makes a spike protein.\n*\u00a0 There are 35 to 40 corona viruses.\u00a0 The process allows the virus to replicate.\nThe antibody does not behave like a normal antibody. . ..\nThe antibody can bind to tissue in your lungs . . . and cause anaphylactic shock\nand other things.\n*\u00a0 The antibody process will be there forever because of . . .\nand we have no idea how long the mrna messenger will continue to be translated and create the proteins, etc. and there are no long term studies.\u00a0 For the rest of your life you may be susceptible to auto-immune disease, shock, allergies and death.\n*\u00a0 It is wrapped in a bubble of polyethylene glycol allows the virus to replicate.\nPolyethylene glycol (wiki)\u00a0That is what leads to anaphylactic shock and death.\n* Rashes as things like that are an allergic reaction.\u00a0 People who had the shot and say, I am fine are okay, until they get re-exposed to a CV.\nShe explains how the virus starts to replicate and you get an infection worse than if you had not had the shot.\n* They did not do animal studies because they knew the animals would get sick or die.\n*\u00a0 The antibody can cross the blood-brain barrier and make 2 proteins in the brain malfunction.\u00a0 You can get ALS or frontal lobe degeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia).\n* cytochrome storm goes on and the firemen never show up because there is NO off switch.\u00a0 Because the protectors are killed off.\n* The new J&J shot takes the spike protein and puts it inside an Adenovirus (common cold virus) that combines to your cell and opens up and deposits the spike protein antibody inside your cell.\nEnd result is that all 3 of them make these antibodies that are going to be so destructive.\u00a0 Study indicates there are 28 organs in your body that can be attacked by that antibody.\u00a0 You can have 100 different symptoms (so it is hard to diagnose).\u00a0 It van cause cancer.\nIt\u2019s mass murder.\nThe survival rate on the virus without the vaccine is 99.91%\nTimeframe on deaths:\u00a0 It takes at least 6 weeks from the time you get the injection for the spike antibody to start to develop, so somewhere between 3 months and 20 years.\u00a0 See above.\nend of notes\nNEW:\nMD does full notes:\nDr. Tenpenny Expains In Simple Terms Some Of The Dangers of The Covid-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d\nDr. Tenpenny is an integrative medicine physician in Cleveland, OH who has studied the vaccine problems for over 20 years \u2013 read 1000s of mainstream medical scientific papers and has put in over 40,000 hours of study on these issues\nCertificate of Vaccine Identification Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 is an acronym for Certificate of Vaccine Identification 19 (19 ==> 1 for A and 9 for I, thus AI)\nThis \u201cvaccine\u201d is not a vaccine, but an exceptionally well-designed genetic modification killing tool\nIt can cause full blown autoimmune disease anywhere from 2 years and up to 20 years after injection !!!\nThis \u201cvaccine \u201c permanently alters host immune system\nNot only does shot NOT stop host from getting sick, the antibody (AB) itself turns on host\u2019s body creating havoc & massive auto-immune disease\nGovernments around the world are saying NO to mRNA vaccines because they are a form of MASS MURDER = GENOCIDE\nRemember that genocide is absolutely a key part of the Deep State Plan\nSpike protein AG presented to host immune system in 1 of 2 ways\nPathway 1 \u2013 CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY\nSpike protein fragment antigen (AG) binds MHC-1 receptor in ER & then MCH-1 Protein Complex leaves ER as vesicle to be exocytosed at plasma membrane\nThis MCH-1 Protein Complex then binds to and activates cytotoxic T-cells\nPathway 2 \u2013 Antibody-Mediatedy IMMUNITY\nRemainder of article discusses this pathway\nHow Shot Works\nSpike protein mRNA created from viral DNA spike protein sequence via revverse transcriptase\nSpike protein mRNA transcribed by ribosomes to create spike protein\nmRNA codes for the spike protein on corona viruses (37 corona viruses out there for at least 60 years, but only 7 infect humans)\nWHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT TRANSFECTION DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME, AS TRANSFECTION IS INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN DNA OR RNA ????\nHost DNA is indirectly, not directly, affected\nSpike protein binds to ACE receptor to gain entry into host cell to begin to replicate\nIt takes up to six weeks for this spike protein to be fully expressed & for re-exposure problems to surface\nThen, host immune system generates AB against spike protein\nThe problem is that the AB against spike protein is a non-neutralizing AB, that it, it is NOT made against the entire virus, but only the spike protein\nSpike protein antibody (AB) is a non-neutralizing antibody (unlike measles, mumps, chickenpox, shingles, etc. antibodies)\nAn antibody (AB) has 2 Fab fragments and 1 Fac fragment in the shape of a \u201cY\u201d (which is creepy in an of itself ==> Family Y)\nFab fragments bind to antigen to neutralize it and make it go away\nWith this shot, the Fac fragment causes alot of problems\nFAc fragment can bind to tissue in the lungs, Eosinoophils, Basophilss, other receptors that can cause anaphalatic shock, can cause direct modification of macrophages, can cross react with human tissues to cause autoimmune disease via molecular mimicry\nA key problem is B cell sensitization \u2013 the AB generating B cells retain memory of the AB forever (Memory B cells\nWe have no idea how long the spike protein will last in host\nWe have no idea how long the AB will last in host\nWe have no idea how long the B cells will continue to be active\nFor the rest of host\u2019s life, host may be suseptible to autoimmune disease, shock, allergies & death from this injection\n10 Mechanisms by which this Injection Can Cause Harm (Dr. Tenpenny can only cover a few in this video)\nPEG \u2013 Polyethelene Glycol\nThe coding around the mRNA is unstable, so they had to encase it in a lipid bubble (liposome)\nThe lipid bubble contains PEG\nHumans have been sensitized (i.e. primed or made allergic to) to PEG via many, many products over the decades\nIn 1960, about 2% of population was sensitized to PEG\nIn 2021, about 70-72% of population is now sensitized to PEG\nPEG reaction can cause an acute allergic reaction and/or anaphalactic shock & death\nPEG is in Moderna & Pfizer shots\nConcept of \u201cRe-Exposure\u201d or Antibody Dependent Enhancement\nThere are many folks who have taken the shot and say \u201cLook at me, I\u2019ve had no problems !!!\u201d\nWell, the problem comes when that person is re-exposed to any of the corona viruses\nThe anti-spike AB can then set up autoimmune disease\nAnti-spike AB can bind to spike protein, AG-AB complex internalized in macrophages (MP), RNA of virus released inside MP then causes\nOVERWHELMING infection (MUCH WORSE than had you never had the shot)\nThey have been trying to develop ABs against corona virus since 2005 because the flu, a corona virus, has a large burden of disease WW and there are corona viruses other than flu that also have a large burden of illness (so getting a corona virus vaccine is desireable)\nScientists have NEVER been able to get their studies (ABs against the full virus) past the safety studies on rats, rabbits, ferrets, hamsters & monkeys). These animals all got extremely sick or died on re-exposure to corona virus. Failure on both safety & efficacy.\nThese evil, Cabal, DS scientists are very smart & have almost unlimited money to spend on their genocidal projects\nWith COVID vaccine, they did not even bother with animal studies, and went straight to humans\nAG-AB complex Can Cross BBB\nCan converts two proteins in the brain and cause them to malfunction\nWhen these two proteins are corrupted, one can lead to ALS and one to Frontal Temporal Lobe Degeneration (Alzheimers Dementia)\nCovid Vaccine linked to infertility (placental protein deviously & malevolently contained in shot causes generation of Anti-placenta AB)\nMechanism of Cytokine Storm\nMacrophages (MPs) are the little garbage eaters of the immune system\nTwo types of macrophages (MP): MP1 & MP2\nMP1 is active on initial infection\nWhen MP1 attacks pathogen, cytokines are released\nCytokines are proinflammatory & cause fever & call in NK cells\nAs infection begins to resovle, MP2 come in like fire fighters to quell & calm the hot inflammatory soup & then begin to clean up debris\nMP1 ==> increased cytokines (what you want in initial infection)\nMP2 ==> decreased cytokines (also what you want to resolve initial infection)\nThe Anti-spike AB inactivates MP2s by binding by the FAc fragment to the MP2 cells ==> fire fighters CANNOT show up because they are inactivated\nSo the cytokine storm goes on and on and on\nThe OFF SWITCH has been deactivated \u2013 \u201cThere is an ON SWITCH, but NO OFF SWITCH\u201d\nNew J&J Shot\nWe have very little information on this shot\nSpike protein is inserted into an adenovirus (> 100 different strains for adenovirus) to gain entry into host\nSome adenoviruses turn on ONOCGENES that can cause cancer\nAutoimmune Disease & the \u201cVaccine\u201d\nA well-know immunologist tested the Anti-spike AB on 55 tissue types to determine cross reactivity\nThe Anti-spike AB cross reacted with 28 of the tissue antigens\nThus, you can see how a plethora of autoimmune diseases can take hold.\nHundreds of Sx can look different, but underlying pathology is that the Anti-spike AB, via molecular mimicry, interacts with up to 28 different tissue AGs in multiple organ systems\nVAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)\nAs of 2/18/21 VAERS has over 1000 reported deaths\nThis is about 10% of what is out there, so 10,000 \u2013 100,000 deaths are possible just SO FAR\n> 19,0000 adverse events reported\nThis is about 10% of what is out there, so 190,000 to 1,000,000 adverse events are possible just SO FAR\nIn the next 4-18 months, we can expect to see massive injury & major death from these shots\nFDA & CDC have violated 3 areas of Federal Law to allow the Emergency Use Authorization for the \u201cVaccine\u201d\nGiven a 99.91 % Survivability of COVID , \u201cVaccine\u201d is much less \u201ceffective\u201d & this is part of Emergency Use Authorization criteria being violated\nOther Effective Treatments that can also PREVENT infection\nHCQ, Zinc, Ivermectin, High Dose Vitamin C & High Dose Vitamin D\nADDITIONAL LINKS\nVaxx causes Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease! 25 min. video by Jana Ben Nun.

QUIJANO, M.D.\nProfessor (Ret.)\nDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology\nCollege of Medicine, University of the Philippines Manila\nThe COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2) vaccine is fraught with hazards. This should be the obvious, rational conclusion of anyone who cares to objectively study the available scientific and other relevant information about it. There are many factual danger signals that are easily discernible.\nDuring the 2002-2003 SARS-1 outbreak, it took about 20 months before a vaccine was made ready for human testing in clinical trials despite the fact that concerns about safety were still unresolved. This was already way too fast compared to the usual time necessary for pre-clinical trials or animal studies to be satisfactorily completed before any ethical experimentation on human beings or clinical trials can be started. Yet for Covid-19 candidate vaccines, clinical trials were started barely five months after SARS-Cov-2 emerged, bypassing the necessary pre-clinical studies normally required and ignoring the serious safety concerns in the previous attempt to rush a SARS-1 vaccine (which was eventually scrapped).\nOne major safety concern in developing a vaccine is how to get around the danger that the vaccine might actually \u201cenhance\u201d the pathogenicity of the virus, or make it more aggressive possibly due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), as what happened with previous studies on test vaccines in animals. If that should happen in a major human trial the outcome could be disastrous. (1,2,3,4) This serious adverse effect may not even be detected by a clinical trial especially in highly biased clinical trials laden with conflicts of interest involving vaccine companies. Even when a serious adverse event is detected, this is usually swept under the rug.\nFor example, initial clinical trial results for the COVID-19 vaccine of Moderna reportedly showed that three of the 15 human experimental subjects in the high dose group suffered serious and medically significant symptoms. Moderna, however, concluded that the vaccine was \u201cgenerally safe and well tolerated,\u201d which the corporate-dominated media dutifully reported, covering-up the real danger from the vaccine.(5,6,7,8) In a brazen act of unethical behaviour, Moderna even used a volunteer vaccine recipient, Ian Haydon, to appear in many appearances on media promoting Moderna\u2019s experimental COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna encouraged Haydon to appear on TV to deceive the public and its shareholders. Less than 12 hours after vaccination, Haydon suffered muscle aches, vomiting, spiked a 103.2 degree fever and had lost consciousness.(9) The vaccine, pushed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental mRNA technology that supposedly would allow rapid deployment, waiving the usual pre-clinical and animal studies.\nThe fact that an entirely new RNA vaccine technology which has never been used before in humans is a danger signal that should not be ignored. Several of the US candidates (Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Arcturus Therapeutics) are using this never-before-approved technology. Exogenous mRNA is inherently immunostimulatory, and this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It may provide adjuvant activity and it may inhibit antigen expression and negatively affect the immune response. The paradoxical effects of innate immune sensing on different formats of mRNA vaccines are incompletely understood. Potential safety concerns include local and systemic inflammation, biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies, and potential toxic effects of non-native nucleotides and delivery system components. A mRNA-based vaccine could also induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Another potential safety issue could derive from the extracellular RNA which has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may promote blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation. (10)\nAnother danger of mRNA vaccines is the use of biotech \u201ccarrier systems\u201d involving lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs \u201cencapsulate the mRNA constructs to protect them from degradation and promote cellular uptake,\u201d and additionally, rev up the immune system. The LNP formulations in the three mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are also \u201cPEGylated,\u201d meaning that the vaccine nanoparticles are\ncoated with a synthetic, non-biodegradable and increasingly controversial polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG). LNPs could contribute to one or more of the following: immune reactions, infusion reactions, complement reactions, opsonation reactions, antibody reactions or reactions to the PEG from some lipids or PEG otherwise associated with the LNP, as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mRNA or the LNP, any of which could lead to significant adverse events. Furthermore, PEG can also provoke severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in offsprings, including mood swings, rage, phobias and paranoia. Investigators who once assumed that the polymer was largely \u201cinert\u201d are now questioning its biocompatibility and warning about PEGylated particles\u2019 promotion of tumor growth and adverse immune responses that include \u201cprobably underdiagnosed\u201d life-threatening anaphylaxis. This is a significant concern since a 2016 US study reported detectable and sometimes high levels of anti-PEG antibodies (including first-line-of-defense IgM antibodies and later-stage IgG antibodies) in approximately 72% of contemporary human samples and about 56% of historical specimens from the 1970s through the 1990s. The manufacturers of genetically engineered adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines undergoing clinical trials (Johnson & Johnson, Oxford, and CanSino) also use PEG as an inexpensive additive for vaccine storage. If one of the PEGylated mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 gains approval, the increased exposure to PEG will be unprecedented and potentially disastrous. (11,12)\nLike the mRNA vaccines, the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines are still experimental and have not been used before in mass vaccination for infectious diseases. Given the history of poor safety record of many vaccines, the risk of unpredictable and potentially disastrous adverse effects is of utmost concern.\nFor example, among other dangers, the virus-vectored vaccines could undergo recombination with naturally occurring viruses and produce hybrid viruses that could have undesirable properties affecting transmission or virulence. The numerous variables affecting the probability that recombination will take place and the possible outcomes of recombination are practically impossible to quantify accurately given existing tools and knowledge. The risks, however, are real, as exemplified by the emergence of mutant types of viruses, enhanced pathogenicity and unexpected serious adverse events (including death) following haphazard mass vaccination campaigns and previous failed attempts to develop chimeric vaccines using genetic engineering technology.\nGenetically engineered vaccines carry significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards, including unintended and unwanted side effects with regard to the targeted or non-targeted individuals. Potential undesirable immunological effects include unexpected immunopathological reaction, autoimmune reaction, long-term tolerance, persistent infection and latent infections. There is also the potential to transfer or recombine genetic material from genetically engineered viruses or GE virus-vector vaccines to the targeted individual germ line cells. It can also undergo chromosomal integration or insertional mutagenesis, leading to random insertions of vaccine constructs into host cellular genomes, resulting in alterations of gene expression or activation of cellular oncogenes, thus raising the possibility of inducing tumors. Even minor genetic changes in, or differences between, viruses can result in dramatic changes in transmission abilities, host preferences, and virulence. The new, hybrid virus progenies resulting from such events may have completely unpredictable characteristics. Virulence reversion, for example, was documented when a live recombinant vaccinia\u2013rabies glycoprotein virus vaccine prepared for wild raccoons and foxes infected a 28-yr-old pregnant woman. (13) Virulence reversion was also documented when recombination between commercial infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) vaccines in poultry has resulted in virulent recombinant viruses that caused severe disease and that have emerged as the dominant field strains in important poultry producing regions in Australia. (14)\nThe risks of recombination was actually raised earlier in a meeting convened by the World Health Organization in 2003, wherein regulators representing the European Union, the US, China, and Canada raised the specific issue on recombination: \u201cRecombination of a live virus-vectored vaccine with a circulating or reactivated latent virus could theoretically generate a more pathogenic strain\u2026The risk of recombination should be studied if possible in a non-clinical model system, but should also be considered in clinical study designs.\u201d This was listed among the \u201crecommendations to WHO and priorities for future work\u201d as one of several \u201cissues of critical importance to be investigated further.\u201d (15) Apparently, however, the WHO, governments and the vaccine industry never took this recommendation seriously. This comes as no surprise, given the history of WHO\u2019s rapid approval and endorsement of several such live virus-vectored vaccines without the necessary and thorough safety studies, made especially concerning during the current mad scramble for a COVID-19 vaccine.\nThere\u2019s also a concern that some people may already be immune to the adenovirus carrying the coronavirus gene into the body since adenoviruses circulate through the human population making the vaccine ineffective. (16) Data on the initial clinical trial of the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine made by CanSino Biologics of China that was published in the Lancet showed that in the highest of the three doses used in the study, the number of side effects was high \u2014 75% of the people in the highest dose group reported at least one side effect. Side effects included fever \u2014 pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, among others. Ten volunteers (9% of the overall study group) had Grade 3 side effects, defined as \u201cserious and medically significant symptoms,\u201d six (17%) in the highest dose group and two (6%) each in the low and middle dose groups. The study also found that one dose of the vaccine, tested at three different levels, appeared to induce a good immune response in some subjects. But about half of the volunteers \u2014 people who already had immunity to the backbone of the vaccine \u2014 had a dampened immune response. (17)\nThe Dengvaxia vaccine fiasco in the Philippines also illustrates the danger of rushing a vaccine and allowing corporate interests driven by market forces to address people\u2019s health needs. As a result, many of the vaccinated suffered or died after a botched mass vaccination program.(18) According to the Chief Pathologist of the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, 153 of those vaccinated with Dengvaxia had died as of February 18, 2020. (19)\nAnother example of the danger of corporate fast-tracking of vaccine clinical safety trials is the case of the HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) vaccine. Two of the biggest vaccine manufacturers spiked their placebos with a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant and cut observation periods. Numerous adverse events, including life-threatening injuries, permanent disabilities, hospitalizations and deaths, were later reported after vaccination with bivalent, quadrivalent or nine-valent HPV vaccines. The company scientists routinely dismissed, minimized or concealed those injuries using statistical gimmicks and invalid comparisons designed to diminish their relative significance. Some regulatory agencies were complicit in covering up increased incidence of adverse effects in post-marketing surveillance studies.(20, 21)\nAnother concern is that vaccines produced with cell cultures are often contaminated with naked nucleic acids, genomic fragments, retroviruses and other foreign materials that carry uncertain but potentially serious hazards. This contamination may be present in the source material, e.g. human blood, human or animal tissues, cell banks, or introduced in the manufacturing process through the use of animal sera. Many candidate COVID-19 vaccines are produced on what is called \u201cimmortal\u201d cell lines or cancerous types of cells (e.g. Vero cells derived from the African green monkey) that could spread cancer-promoting material into the human recipient. Manufacturers and authorities assure us that these do not cause tumors per se. However, scientific studies tell us that after these cells have been repeatedly cultured a certain number of times, they can convert to a cancerous state. Immortal cell lines show 100-times greater number of DNA recombination events compared to normal cells. This could result in viral-viral or viral-cellular interactions that can generate new viruses and result to pathological consequences, including autoimmunity and cancer. (22) Even the US FDA recognized this danger. In a paper published in its website, it stated: \u201cIn some cases the cell lines that are used might be tumorigenic, that is, they form tumors when injected into rodents. Some of these tumor-forming cell lines may contain cancer-causing viruses that are not actively reproducing. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods. These latent, or \u2018quiet,\u2019 viruses pose a potential threat, since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions.\u201d (23)\nStill another concern, not only in terms of safety issues but also on moral grounds, is the use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacture. Vaccines produced from human fetal cells contain cell debris and contaminating fetal DNA (together with its epigenetic modification) which cannot be fully eliminated during downstream purification. This could cause insertional mutagenesis (potentially causing cancer) and autoimmunity in the vaccinated. At least six of the COVID-19 candidate vaccines (Cansino, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, ImmunityBio/NantKwest, University of Pittsburgh and Altimmune) use one of two human fetal cell lines: HEK-293, a kidney cell line that comes from a fetus aborted in about 1972; and PER. C6, a proprietary cell line owned by Janssen, developed from retinal cells from an 18-week-old fetus aborted in 1985. (24)\nThere are many plausible biological mechanisms for potential adverse effects of all the vaccines in the pipeline for COVID-19. The history of vaccination is replete with scientific evidence of adverse effects through enhanced pathogenicity, mutation, recombination, induced immune system dysfunction, and various non-specific effects following vaccination despite regulatory approval and prior clinical trials and other corporate sponsored studies that were claimed to be proof of safety. The inherent danger of injecting microbial protein fragments, contaminants, DNA and other foreign materials into the human body is well documented in the scientific literature. Practically all vaccines contain such hazardous foreign fragments and materials and are unavoidably unsafe. Furthermore, exposure of the vaccinee to other environmental hazards (pesticides, air pollutants, 5G radiation, ionizing radiation, etc.) resulting to synergistic adverse effects not captured by corporate sponsored \u201csafety\u201d studies is also another plausible mechanism that may result in acute or long-term injury, including death.\nSafety assessments under the corporate dominated scientific milieu are grossly inadequate and oftentimes erroneous. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are done or sponsored by the very corporations who sell the vaccines and they do not adequately address the plausible adverse effects that cannot be detected by the corporate sponsored studies. There are no independent studies that could validate the claims of the vaccine manufacturers. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the potential benefits from an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine would outweigh the potential adverse effects, despite assurances of safety by the vaccine industry, international institutions, governments and the mainstream medical science groups.\nReferences:\n(1).

But the fact remains that if Pfizer succeeds \u2013 or Moderna, with whom Israel also has a contract \u2013 these will be the first-ever messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines brought to market for human patients. In order to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, the companies will have to prove there are no immediate or short-term negative health effects from taking the vaccines. But when the world begins inoculating itself with these completely new and revolutionary vaccines, it will know virtually nothing about their long-term effects. \u201cThere is a race to get the public vaccinated, so we are willing to take more risks,\u201d Tal Brosh, head of the Infectious Disease Unit at Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital, told The Jerusalem Post. When Moderna was just finishing its Phase I trial, The Independent wrote about the vaccine and described it this way: \u201cIt uses a sequence of genetic RNA material produced in a lab that, when injected into your body, must invade your cells and hijack your cells\u2019 protein-making machinery called ribosomes to produce the viral components that subsequently train your immune system to fight the virus.\u201d \u201cIn this case, Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 is programmed to make your cells produce the coronavirus\u2019 infamous coronavirus spike protein that gives the virus its crown-like appearance (corona is crown in Latin) for which it is named,\u201d wrote The Independent. Brosh said that this does not mean the vaccine changes people\u2019s genetic code. Rather, he said it is more like a USB device (the mRNA) that is inserted into a computer (your body). It does not impact the hard drive of the computer but runs a certain program. But he acknowledged that there are unique and unknown risks to messenger RNA vaccines, including local and systemic inflammatory responses that could lead to autoimmune conditions. An article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, a division of the National Institutes of Health, said other risks include the bio-distribution and persistence of the induced immunogen expression; possible development of auto-reactive antibodies; and toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components. Brosh compared the mRNA vaccine to traditional vaccines, such as those for influenza, which use an inactivated virus that was destroyed by heat or chemicals to elicit an immune response without infecting the recipient. Others, such as for measles or mumps, use a weakened virus that is unable to hurt you but can still train your immune system to fight it. Oxford University\u2019s AstraZeneca, the Russian\u2019s Sputnik V and the Israel Institute for Biological Research\u2019s Brilife are all based on more traditional technologies. BUT MICHAL LINIAL, a professor of biological chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told the Post that she believes there is no cause for concern. Linial explained that \u201cmRNA is a very fragile molecule, meaning it can be destroyed very easily... If you put mRNA on the table, for example, in a minute there will not be any mRNA leftover. This is as opposed to DNA, which is as stable as you get.\u201d She said that this fragility is true of the mRNA of any living thing, whether it belongs to a plant, bacteria, virus or human. As such, she said the worry should not be that the mRNA won\u2019t get into the cells and instead will stay outside, floating in the body and causing some kind of reaction. Rather the concern should be that if it doesn\u2019t enter the cells, it will disintegrate and therefore be ineffective. She said that while Moderna and Pfizer are based on new vaccine technologies, they are asking our bodies to do something they do every day: protein synthesis, the process where cells make proteins. Moderna and Pfizer are simply delivering a specific mRNA sequence to our cells. Once the mRNA is in the cell, human biology takes over. Ribosomes read the code and build the protein, and the cells express the protein in the body. Linial said she believes that the reason no mRNA vaccine has been developed yet is because there was just no need to move this fast on a vaccine until COVID-19 came along. She noted that most of the vaccines people take today were developed decades ago. She said her concerns have less to do with the use of mRNA and more to do with the long-term efficacy of the vaccine, as well as other challenges that could cause something to go wrong and lead people to believe they are vaccinated when they are not. For example, she said that because mRNA is so fragile, the Pfizer vaccine must be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius. If the ideal environment is not maintained, the vaccine could \u201cspoil\u201d and become ineffective. In addition, she said several questions remain, such as whether these vaccines will really be able to mount a sufficiently protective immune response and how long that immunity would last. \u201cIt would be the worst [scenario] if people behave like they are immune but can still become infected,\u201d Linial said. Brosh added that the country and the world should be cautious about any of the vaccine candidates until the final results of their Phase III trials are peer-reviewed and published. But he said that once those studies are published and the vaccines approved, it will be OK to take them. \u201cWe will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,\u201d Brosh said, adding that we could wait two years to discover them, \u201cbut then we would have the coronavirus for two more years.\u201d Linial expressed similar sentiments: \u201cClassical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop. I don\u2019t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.\u201d But when asked if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: \u201cI won\u2019t be taking it immediately \u2013 probably not for at least the coming year,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cWe have to wait and see whether it really works.\u201d\nSign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >>\nSign up for The Jerusalem Post Premium Plus for just $5\nUpgrade your reading experience with an ad-free environment and exclusive content\nJoin Now >"}, {"Url": "https://paulcraigroberts.org/2021/09/12/the-vaccine-is-more-dangerous-than-covid", "CluewebURLHash": "FE1A64EF314CF4329D7E12B21A1F2802", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "The \ue000Vaccine\ue001 Is More \ue000Dangerous\ue001 Than \ue000Covid\ue001 ...", "Snippet": "Dr. Michael Yeadon former VP and chief science officer for Pfizer explains the \ue000dangers\ue001 of the \ue000Covid\ue001 \ue000Vaccine\ue001 and the irresponsibility of its emergency use authorization.

A new study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the risk of illness, hospitalization and death following the shots is far lower than the danger from becoming infected with the highly contagious and often deadly virus. Three health threats have surfaced among some vaccinated people: Blood clots and the Guillain-Barre Syndrome neurologic disorder after the Johnson & Johnson shot, and heart inflammation after the Pfizer or Moderna shots, which use a messenger-RNA technology. But the CDC analysis found that the risk in adults from the vaccines to be minimal compared to the virus that causes COVID-19, which has infected 35 million Americans and killed more than 614,000.

In the largest study of its kind, researchers found the risk of very preterm birth, which occurs at less than 32 weeks of gestation, was 60% higher for people infected with the coronavirus during their pregnancy. The risk of giving birth at less than 37 weeks \u2014 which is any preterm birth \u2014 was 40% higher.

These \"correlates of protection\" could speed the development of new vaccines or boosters without requiring the enormous clinical trials used to create the first COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0Instead, researchers could vaccinate people with a new vaccine or booster, measure their antibodies over the course of several months, and know if it worked.\u00a0This is \"the Holy Grail\" in terms of vaccines, and one that hasn't yet been set for the virus that causes COVID-19, said Peter Gilbert, co-author of the study\u00a0posted Tuesday to medRxiv, a preprint site where scientific articles can be published\u00a0prior to being accepted by peer-reviewed journals.\u00a0(Weise, 8/10)\nReuters:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tModerna May Be Superior To Pfizer Against Delta; Breakthrough Odds Rise With Time\nThe mRNA vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech may be less effective than Moderna's against the Delta variant of the coronavirus, according to two reports posted on medRxiv on Sunday ahead of peer review. In a study of more than 50,000 patients in the Mayo Clinic Health System, researchers found the effectiveness of Moderna's vaccine against infection had dropped to 76% in July - when the Delta variant was predominant - from 86% in early 2021. Over the same period, the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had fallen to 42% from 76%, researchers said. While both vaccines remain effective at preventing COVID hospitalization, a Moderna booster shot may be necessary soon for anyone who got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines earlier this year, said Dr. Venky Soundararajan of Massachusetts data analytics company nference, who led the Mayo study.

However, there are still lingering questions about booster shots. Earlier clinical trials showed the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 66 percent effective overall in preventing moderate to severe disease four weeks after the shot, with effectiveness varying depending on location. Its competitors from Pfizer and Moderna, on the other hand, recorded 90 percent-plus effectiveness against the coronavirus. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, has said all three vaccines are effective.

The researchers had 22 COVID-19 patients at Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases breathe for 30 minutes, talk for 15 minutes, or sing for 15 minutes into a G-II exhaled breath collector. Thirteen patients (59%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 levels, of whom three were asymptomatic and one was presymptomatic. Variables such as age, sex, virus variant, and clinical symptoms were not significantly associated with detectable viral RNA in aerosols, but median day of illness was, with a higher likelihood earlier on in a patient\u2019s illness (median, 3 vs 5 days after illness onset).

Click HERE to sign up to receive emails when we add to our video library.\nJuly 30, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013\u202fTop vaccine scientist Dr. Robert Malone warned that vaccines could be making COVID-19 more dangerous and said the vaccination push may need to be halted altogether in an interview Wednesday on Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room.\nDr. Malone notably claims to have been the chief inventor of mRNA technology and mRNA and DNA innovations while working with the Salk Institute in the 1980s. Both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines rely on mRNA technology. Malone is also a licensed physician who received his\u00a0medical training at Northwestern University, Harvard University medical school, and UC Davis.\nIn his interview with Bannon, Malone responded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) recent reversal on face masks, noting what he called \u201cincreasingly desperate and abrupt rollouts of information.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the CDC updated guidance to state that Americans should once again mask up indoors if they are in areas of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d virus transmission, even after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. \u201cEmerging evidence suggests that fully vaccinated persons who do become infected with the Delta variant are at risk for transmitting it to others,\u201d the agency\u2019s guidelines now say, citing \u201cunpublished data,\u201d some of which was released Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a progression of increasingly desperate and abrupt rollouts of information, beginning with Pfizer\u2019s alert a couple of weeks ago that they think we were going to need to have a booster after six months, and Fauci reprimanding them, and then the government flip-flopping and saying that we were going to have to have boosters for Pfizer recipients after six months in elderly and immunocompromised, and then the bomb dropped last night,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s precisely what I have been concerned about.\u201d\nHe noted a report by NBC News on Tuesday that claimed that the CDC\u2019s backtrack on masks reflected data showing that vaccinated people \u201ccould be carrying higher levels of virus than previously understood\u201d and possibly infecting others, according to \u201cmultiple sources\u201d close to the Biden administration. The NBC article has been heavily edited since publication.\nBased on statements in the report, Malone inferred that viral levels were higher in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people. As he later explained on Twitter, this has not been resolved.\nA CDC report published today said that viral loads between the vaccinated and unvaccinated are likely \u201csimilar,\u201d though \u201cmicrobiological studies are required to confirm these findings.\u201d\n\u201cThis is precisely what one would see if antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) was happening,\u201d Malone said regarding higher virus levels among the vaccinated. \u201cWhat is antibody dependent enhancement? Briefly, it\u2019s that the vaccine causes the virus to become more infectious than would happen in the absence of vaccination, would cause the virus to replicate at higher levels than in the absence of infection.\u201d (See further ADE explanation here)\n\u201cThis is the vaccinologist\u2019s worst nightmare. It happened with the respiratory syncytial virus and in the \u201860s and caused more child deaths in vaccine recipients than unvaccinated. It happened with Dengvaxia, the dengue vaccine,\u201d Malone continued.\nsubscribe to our daily headlines\nUS Canada Catholic\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s happened with virtually every other coronavirus vaccine development program, certainly in humans, known in history, and it\u2019s what the vaccinologists like myself have been warning about since the outset, is the risk of antibody dependent enhancement.\u201d\nMalone said that antibody dependent enhancement seems most apparent in people injected with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. \u201cSo, we now know that the Pfizer protection is waning at six months,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what the data seem to suggest is those who have received Pfizer, which is probably the least immunogenic of the three in terms of durability, length of protection, people that are now in the waning phase of the immune response to the Pfizer vaccine seem to be getting infected.\u201d\n\u201cNotice they keep talking about Pfizer and not about the other two. So, this suggests this is exactly what you would anticipate, is the window of greatest susceptibility to antibody dependent enhancement is in this long tapering phase as the vaccine response declines.\u201d\nThe top mRNA vaccine expert also criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci, who stated in an appearance on MSNBC this week that levels of virus in the noses of vaccinated people who contract COVID-19 are \u201cexactly the same as the level of virus in an unvaccinated person who\u2019s infected.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I think Dr. Fauci is being very disingenuous,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI\u2019m accused of being now an anti-vaxxer and promoting disinformation. But to my eyes, the government is obfuscating what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean to sound alarmist, but what seems to be rolling out is the worst-case scenario, where the vaccine in the waning phase is causing the virus to replicate more efficiently than it would otherwise, which is what is we call antibody dependent enhancement is what the word is. And people have been warning about this since the outset of this rushed vaccine campaign.\u201d\nDr. Malone also criticized Fauci, who recently blamed unvaccinated people for variants, for a \u201cmisleading set of statements\u201d about the mutations. Malone said \u201cthe escape mutants that are escaping vaccine selective pressure are most likely developing in the people that have been vaccinated, not in the unvaccinated.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s just another convenient lie,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cantibody dependent enhancement can be influenced by escaped mutants.\u201d\n\u201cIf the data are consistent with [antibody dependent enhancement], we have to stop the vaccine campaign,\u201d Malone stressed. \u201cWe have to pivot to expediting as much as possible drug treatments, which have been largely blocked and suppressed at the FDA level, particularly for repurposed drugs.\u201d\nVaccine \u2018groupthink\u2019\nCommenting on the Biden administration\u2019s move to impose new COVID-19 vaccines requirements for all federal employees, Malone said he is witnessing \u201cthe most florid example, to my eye, of groupthink that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d\n\u201cI think that they are all in on the logic that we need universal vaccination to open up the economy. We don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think that vaccines are the pathway to getting to herd immunity. They\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they think the vaccines are perfectly safe. And not only they\u2019re not perfectly safe, if this is true, that NBC reports, and the titers are higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated, that means we got the worst case type of adverse event that scares vaccinologists, all vaccinologists, which is antibody dependent enhancement.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all in, and they seem to be unable to process this new information, and it seems to be causing cognitive dissonance and causing these people to be increasingly frantic and transparent in their chaotic messaging,\u201d Dr. Malone continued.\nIn an previous episode of Bannon\u2019s War Room last week, Dr. Malone emphasized the risk of complications from COVID-19 vaccines, pointing to \u201cpretty clear evidence that the spike protein expressed from vaccines is caused from toxicity in a small subset of patients.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is, how big is that subset and how bad and broad are those toxicities? The honest truth is we don\u2019t know, and furthermore there [are] a lot of signs that that information is being withheld from us.\u201d\nMultiple sources told him, he said, that the CDC has been \u201cgrossly underreporting\u201d adverse events like cardio toxicity. \u201cMy senior colleagues at the FDA have known that this was the case for months and are very frustrated,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe have multiple examples where the CDC appears to be editing data in the support of the \u2018noble lie.\u2019\u201d\nHundreds of thousands of complications after coronavirus vaccination have been reported by federal authorities, including more than 6,300 deaths, though research has shown that the vaccine injury tracking system led by the CDC and FDA significantly undercounts adverse events.\nExperts, like Dr. Peter McCullough, a renowned cardiologist and editor of two medical journals, have estimated that the total deaths attributable to the vaccines could be higher than 50,000.\nTopics\nFreedom\nPolitics - U.S.\nTagged as\nAnthony Fauci\nBiden Administration\nCdc\nCenters For Disease Control\nCovid-19\nModerna\nMrna\nPfizer\nRobert Malone\nSteve Bannon\nVaccines"}, {"Url": "https://townhall.com/columnists/wayneallynroot/2022/01/09/my-debate-with-an-icu-doctor-about-the-possible-dangers-of-the-covid19-vaccine-n2601582", "CluewebURLHash": "E3854139FF138491AD51D144CABEE1A1", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "My Debate with an ICU Doctor About the Possible Dangers of ...", "Snippet": "Below is my reply filled with common sense, logic, facts and most importantly, SCIENCE about the \ue000dangers\ue001 of the \ue000COVID\ue001-19 \ue000vaccine\ue001.

Bukaty\nIt's so easy to win a debate with an ignorant liberal. They have no facts. They have no brilliant oratory. Just name-calling. After my national TV interviews last week explaining why I believe the COVID-19 vaccine is killing and injuring thousands of Americans, I received an email from an intensive care unit doctor. He called me a \"moron.\" Below is my reply filled with common sense, logic, facts and most importantly, SCIENCE about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccine. Needless to say, the doctor never replied.\nDear David,\nFirst, I read and answer all my own emails. I'm answering you personally. I don't engage in ignorant terms like \"moron\" toward people that disagree with me.\nSecond, this country (and world) is filled with both unvaccinated and vaccinated who are sick with COVID-19. It's a nasty and contagious flu. At this moment almost every vaccinated person I know is sick with COVID-19. A report released by the Robert Koch Institute stated that in Germany over 96% of those with COVID-19 are vaccinated.\nThird, some studies show that the COVID-19 vaccine damages the immune system, thereby making it more likely that the vaccinated will get sick with each successive variant.\nFourth, if the vaccine is so great, why do the deep blue states like New York have massive COVID-19 outbreaks? New York City just set the all-time record for COVID-19 infections in a day. New York right now has almost 30% of all the COVID-19 cases nationwide. How could this happen if vaccines, masks and lockdowns worked?\nCARTOONS | AF Branco\nView Cartoon\nFifth, if the vaccine is so great, why are there far more COVID-19 deaths in 2021 with the vaccine than there were in 2020 -- without it?\nSixth, as a M.D., why don't you pay attention to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System? It's been the gold standard for decades to identify if any vaccine is causing more harm than good.\nThis COVID-19 jab may have killed over 21,000 Americans. That's separate from the cardiac arrests, strokes, blood clots and permanent disabilities that could be associated with the vaccine. And this jab has potentially caused a staggering 1 million \"adverse effects.\" These numbers are from VAERS -- user-reported data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSeventh, are you aware Columbia University researchers found that adverse events associated with vaccines could be vastly underreported? They suggest you must multiply by 20 to approximate the accurate number of deaths and injuries. So according to the math of Columbia researchers, there are actually over 400,000 deaths and millions of injuries that could be tied to the vaccine.\nHow could you doubt VAERS? Pfizer's own research showed that there were 1,200 deaths during the initial first few weeks of their vaccine rollout. That's Pfizer's reporting.\nAnyone who wants the vaccine should get it. It's called choice. They should thank former President Donald Trump for the availability of this vaccine.\nThe rest of us who are relatively healthy and/or relatively young have a 99.9% recovery rate from COVID-19. No one should be FORCED to vaccinate, mask, endure lockdowns, lose their job or close their business in America. We have choices. We take risks every day.\nCertainly, people should agree that no baby, toddler, child or teen should ever be forced to take this jab. As a John Hopkins study proved, the risk of a child dying is basically zero. Out of 48,000 childhood cases of COVID-19 they studied, no healthy child died.\nI've had COVID-19. It was gone in 48 hours after I took ivermectin, plus antibiotic (Z Pak), plus megadoses of vitamins C, D3, zinc and quercetin. Plus, I received intravenous vitamin C. Worked like a charm. Gone in 48 hours. Mild.\nRecommended\nLiberal Corporations Are Confused and Scared Because Conservatives Now Fight Back\nKurt Schlichter\nI now have immunity. No one with immunity needs to vaccinate. I believe the risks far outweigh the benefits. I make healthy lifestyle choices. I'm not anti-vaccine. I'm pro-immune system.\nJustus R. Hope, M.D., and others report that in India, the government ended the worst COVID-19 outbreak anywhere in the world by handing out free packets of ivermectin plus vitamins. They report that COVID-19 went away literally overnight, and deaths dropped to virtually zero. That's exactly what America should have done and should be doing right now.\nThere are dozens of studies around the world that demonstrate the efficacy of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as antivirals versus COVID-19.\nI wish you well. I hope I've opened your eyes to the alternatives out there. I know what you see each day in your ICU: the sickest of the sick. It's tragic they have no access to ivermectin or HCQ, plus vitamins like C, D3 and zinc. Early treatment (in the first three to five days) with this combination would almost guarantee few ever wind up at the ICU -- where you see them and where it may already be too late.\nIt's important to allow different opinions and questions. If \"science\" won't respect or allow discussion or debate, it's no longer science; it's just propaganda.\nI'm doing my best to keep America healthy.

What We Know. | Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\nFeature Article: Long-term Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine? What We Know.\nPublished on Feb 04, 2021 in Parents PACK\nSince COVID-19 vaccines are new, some people have asked about their effects on those who take them. Short-term side effects (i.e., those that happen in the days after a vaccine has been given) are readily apparent because of clinical trial reports and personal experiences, but people also wonder about possible long-term effects of these vaccines. To answer this question, scientists study the available evidence, and while the rules of science do not allow scientists to say that long-term effects can never happen, the evidence is strong that these vaccines will not cause long-term harm.\nThe evidence\nVaccine history\nThe history of vaccines shows that severe effects following vaccination can occur. But when they do, these effects tend to happen within two months of vaccination:\nOral polio vaccine \u2014 About 1 in 2.4 million recipients of the oral polio vaccine, which is no longer used in the U.S., were paralyzed following vaccination when the vaccine virus reverted to \u201cwild type\u201d poliovirus. This happened when genetic changes to weaken the virus in the lab were lost during viral replication in the vaccine recipient. Paralysis occurred about seven to 30 days (one to four weeks) after vaccination. Because vaccine recipients \u201cshed\u201d the virus in their stools, on occasion, contacts of these people would be paralyzed when they were infected, and the genetic reversion occurred in them. This secondary event could happen up to 60 days (eight to nine weeks) after the first person was vaccinated (because it took time for the virus to spread to the next person).\nYellow fever vaccine \u2014 The yellow fever vaccine is not routinely recommended in the U.S., but it is required for travel to certain countries. Two delayed negative effects have been detected after receipt of this vaccine:\nNervous system involvement \u2014 This effect causes swelling of the brain or spinal cord. It occurred most often when infants younger than 6 months of age received this vaccine, which is why this group is not recommended to get the vaccine. It can also happen, albeit less frequently, in those older than 6 months of age who receive the vaccine. When this happens, the average time between receipt of the vaccine and symptom onset is two weeks, with the range up to three weeks.\nViscerotropic disease \u2014 This condition is characterized by multisystem organ failure. Yellow fever infection can also cause multisystem organ failure. This adverse event happened so infrequently that it was not described until the early 2000s. In this situation, vaccine virus replicates and spreads throughout the body; onset occurs less than one week after vaccination, most often, occurring about three days after receipt of the vaccine.\nInfluenza vaccine \u2014 Two severe adverse events associated with influenza vaccine are also instructive:\nA 1976 swine influenza vaccine was identified as a rare cause of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an ascending paralysis that can involve the muscles of breathing. Subsequent studies have found flu vaccines to be a cause of GBS in about 1 person per 1 million doses of vaccine. In contrast, influenza infection, which is also a cause of GBS, causes this condition in about 17 people per 1 million infections \u2014 17 times more frequently than following vaccination. Almost all cases following vaccination occurred in the eight weeks after receipt of the vaccine.\nIn 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, one influenza vaccine used in Europe was found to cause narcolepsy in about 1 in 55,000 vaccine recipients. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive fatigue and periods of sleep throughout the day. Despite various influenza vaccines used during the pandemic, only one caused this issue, which was believed to have resulted from a confluence of conditions presented by that vaccine compared with all other vaccines used. The average onset of symptoms occurred within seven weeks of vaccination.\nMMR vaccine \u2014 About 1 of 30,000 recipients of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine can experience a temporary decrease in platelets; a condition called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are the cells responsible for clotting of blood. Both measles and mumps infections can cause thrombocytopenia. This condition is most often found between one and three weeks after vaccination, but in a few cases, it occurred up to eight weeks after vaccination.\nThese experiences demonstrate two important findings. First, when these events occurred, the onset was within eight weeks of receipt of the vaccine. Second, in all of these cases, except narcolepsy following H1N1 vaccine, the side effect of the vaccine was something that could be caused by the infection, meaning that getting infected with the virus also carried a risk of experiencing these outcomes. In the narcolepsy experience, the cause was determined to be related to the adjuvant used in that preparation of vaccine.\nRegardless, this history humbles vaccine scientists. They know that they hold people\u2019s lives in their hands. As stated by Dr. Maurice Hilleman, perhaps the most prolific vaccine scientist in history, \u201cI never breathe a sigh of relief until the first few million doses are out there,\u201d (Personal communication, Paul Offit, 2004). For this reason, scientists and public health officials carefully analyze and continually monitor the data related to every vaccine before, during and after it becomes available.\nCOVID-19 vaccines\nEven with this history in mind, some reasonably wonder about the COVID-19 vaccines because they have not previously been approved for use in people. Now that millions of doses have been administered, we have learned about a few rare but severe side effects. They all occur shortly after vaccination:\nThrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) \u2014 TTS is a condition in which a person experiences blood clotting as well as low platelet count, called thrombocytopenia. The clots can occur in vessels in various organs or in the legs. TTS occurs in about 1-2 of every 1 million people who receive an adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine, like the J&J/Janssen vaccine. TTS develops up to three weeks after getting vaccinated. While anyone between 18 and 64 years of age can experience this side effect, it occurs most commonly among women between 30 and 49 years of age.\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) \u2014 GBS is a condition in which the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, meaning the nerves that are not part of the brain or spinal cord, but which are located throughout the rest of the body. GBS has been found to occur in about 1 of every 100,000 people who receive an adenovirus-based vaccine (e.g., J&J/Janssen). It typically occurs during the first three weeks after getting vaccinated. The condition has most often been identified in males between 50 and 64 years of age, but it can occur in females and those 65 years and older on occasion.\nMyocarditis \u2014 Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart. About 1 of every 50,000 mRNA-vaccine recipients experience this condition, but it is most likely in adults 29 years and younger, and more often occurs in males. This condition typically occurs within four days of vaccination. It is more likely after receipt of the second dose but can occur following any dose.\nIn each of these cases, the side effect occurred within a few days up to a few weeks of vaccination, but all occurred well before two months after vaccination. Likewise, COVID-19 infection also causes myocarditis and GBS and is associated with a variety of blood clotting issues, and the risk of experiencing them is greater following infection than following vaccination.\nSome still wonder what might happen months or years after receipt of these vaccines, but we can also be reassured by what we know about how these vaccines are processed:\nmRNA vaccine\nAlthough COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are new, this type of vaccine has been studied in people before. mRNA vaccines against HIV, rabies, Zika and flu have been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 trials in people. The technology has also been used in clinical trials as a way to treat some cancers. Even though these products have not been licensed for use in people, the reasons have not related to safety. In fact, these efforts allowed us to accumulate important preliminary information about mRNA technology and its safety, which was useful when considering it for COVID-19 vaccines.\nmRNA is made and used in protein production in all cells of our bodies every day. As such, cells have mechanisms in place to ensure that no protein is made in quantities greater than needed. One way this happens is that mRNA has a \u201cpoly(A) tail.\u201d In the cytoplasm, this tail ensures mRNA decay. As the mRNA is used to make proteins in the cell, the length of the poly(A) tail decreases, until it is too short for the mRNA to continue being used as a protein blueprint. Once this happens, the mRNA breaks down and is removed as cellular debris. This process limits how long mRNA remains in the cytoplasm \u2014 and, therefore, how much protein is produced.\nAs such, poly(A) tails ensure that the cell breaks down the vaccine mRNA in a timely manner. Likewise, this understanding allows scientists to design vaccine-delivered mRNA in a way that ensures it does not stay in the cell longer than needed to generate immunity.\nAdenovirus-based vaccine\nAlthough COVID-19 adenovirus vaccines are new, this type of vaccine has been studied in people before, and another adenovirus-based vaccine was approved for use in Europe in those 1 year of age and older starting in the summer of 2020. That vaccine is one of two doses of an Ebola vaccine, and it uses the same type of adenovirus as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\nAdenovirus-based vaccines deliver DNA to the nucleus of the cell, which is used to make mRNA that serves as a blueprint for making the protein. DNA is more stable and lasts longer than mRNA, which is evidenced by strengthening of the immune response for one to two months after vaccination. However, studies of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have shown that if people get a second dose six weeks after the first dose, they have lower immune responses than if they get the second dose 12 weeks after the first dose. Because the second dose generates memory responses, it is better to administer after the primary immune response is fully developed. As such, the improved responses after 12 weeks instead of six weeks suggests that the vaccine is done being processed between six and 12 weeks after a dose is given.\nThis timing agrees with studies in mice, which suggested that protein was no longer being produced three weeks after inoculation, but that specialized cells of the immune system, called antigen-presenting cells, containing pieces of protein from the antigen, could be found in lymph nodes for about four to six weeks after inoculation.\nBecause of the knowledge gained with other vaccines, the FDA required companies making COVID-19 vaccines to follow trial participants for a minimum of eight weeks before they could submit their data for approval. Likewise, the participants in the vaccine trials continue to be followed even though the vaccines have been approved for use.\nThe misinformation\nWhile concerns about long-term effects of vaccines are legitimate, it is important to be aware that the organized anti-vaccine industry has targeted this issue as a way to sow doubt and confusion about COVID-19 vaccines. According to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, professional anti-vaccine activists organized a meeting in the fall of 2020 to create messaging that would decrease acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines once available. These organized efforts aim to move people to extreme positions about vaccines \u2014 that is to say, from having legitimate questions about vaccines to becoming \u201canti-vaccine,\u201d refusing all vaccines and believing conspiracy theories and false narratives. In some cases, individuals in these groups do not believe the science, and in other cases, they are seeking to profit from this hesitancy by encouraging the use of other products to \u201cprotect\u201d against COVID-19.\nWith this in mind, we recommend carefully vetting sources of information, and the statements they are making, to ensure that you are getting answers from reliable sources.

He posted the figures at Foxgrams:\nHere\u2019s some raw data I dug up this evening. I will present it in a better way in the future, and offer some interpretation, but for now here\u2019s just the numbers (at least, the official ones):\n25,687,041 Total population of Australia as at 30th June, 2020\nCOVID & VACCINE STATS AS AT AUGUST 18th FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES:\n40,774 total Covid cases\n970 total Covid deaths\n(2.38% of cases resulted in death)\n(0.0037% of population of Australia died of Covid)\n10,195,842 individuals with at least one dose of vaccine.\nADVERSE REACTION REPORTING UP TO AUGUST 4th (~90 day delay on reporting)\n*note: the database itself states that these numbers are under-reported because they are voluntarily provided.\n28,487 Astrazeneca Adverse Reactions\n254 Astrazeneca Deaths\n16,816 Comirnaty Adverse Reactions\n166 Comirnaty Deaths\n45,303 Total Reported Vaccine Adverse Reactions (for the two types)\n420 Total Reported Deaths from Vaccine Adverse Reactions\n(0.44% of vaccinated had an adverse reaction of some kind)\n(0.93% of Adverse Reactions resulted in death)\n(0.004% of all Vaccine recipients dying from Adverse Reactions)\nDatabase link: https://apps.tga.gov.au/PROD/DAEN/daen-entry.aspx\nVaccine Rollout link: https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2021/08/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-update-18-august-2021.pdf\nVox Day has analysed these figures to reach the following conclusions:\nThe first thing that leaps out is 420 reported vaccine deaths compared to 970 total Covid deaths. Even if we leave out the assumption that adverse reactions are under-reported, assume that all of the Covid deaths are actually OF Covid rather than WITH Covid and are of the unvaccinated, and ignore the natural mutation of the virus to more contagious, less lethal variants, the relative risk factors make it clear that it is riskier for the average Australian to become a vaccine recipient than to remain unvaccinated.\nChance of unvaccinated individual contracting and dying of Covid = one in 26,481\nChance of vaccinated individual dying of an adverse vaccine reaction = one in 24,275\nSo, even in the most favorable possible case for the vaccines, the average individual\u2019s risk of death is essentially the same. And once you begin factoring in comorbidities, age, the decreased lethality of the Delta variant, the number of vaccinated deaths, the possibility that the patient died of something else while Covid-positive, and the mounting evidence that the ADE scenario is in effect, it is clear that the vaccines pose a greater threat to human life than does the virus.\nNow, to consider the non-lethal aspects of the situation.\nChance of unvaccinated individual contracting Covid = one in 630\nChance of vaccinated individual experiencing an adverse reaction = one in 225\nErgo, the chance of experiencing an adverse reaction to the vaccine is nearly 3x greater than the chance of catching Covid. Since the chance of dying of the vaccine is at least as good as the chance of dying of the disease, it makes absolutely no sense for the average individual to get vaccinated even before we have a good idea of what the negative long term effects of the vaccines are. And since Covid is less harmful to the young while the vaccines are more harmful to them, it is completely unconscionable, and should be illegal, to advocate or administer Covid vaccines to young adults and children.\nIf the official figures are to be trusted, the chance of dying from both the coronavirus and the vaccine are small and roughly equal. However, it is likely that numbers of the former are exaggerated and the latter are underreported, which could mean the vaccine poses a significantly higher risk than Covid itself.\nThe \u201cADE scenario\u201d is one I don\u2019t fully understand, but I do know it is bad. Really, really bad.\nRegarding pushing the vaccine on children, as Vox Day states:\n\u201cIt is completely unconscionable, and should be illegal, to advocate or administer Covid vaccines to young adults and children.\u201d\nFootage from two days ago of a schoolboy collapsing at Olympic Stadium after having had the vaccine, the fact that parents were not allowed in, and the fact that they want to do this to 24,000 schoolchildren over the next few weeks is serious cause for alarm.\nThis boy was one of at least three children who collapsed on the first day, two of whom are or were in comas. Vox Day has commented on this too:\n\u201cAt this point, I think we can safely assume that China will annex Australia any time it wants. If Australians won\u2019t even defend their children from being injected with an experimental gene therapy from which they can\u2019t possibly benefit, they certainly aren\u2019t going to offer even a modicum of resistance to the Red Army.\u201d\nHere is further footage demonstrating our complete inability to protect our children.

YOU shall love, honour, cherish and obey the Lord your God (love, good and truth) with ALL your heart, with ALL your mind, with ALL your soul and with ALL your strength and Him ONLY shall you serve and OBEY, forsaking ALL others.\n2. YOU shall NOT create an image or likeness of ANYTHING that is IN HEAVEN, or on earth, or under the sea and YOU shall NOT worship or BUY such things. YOU shall NOT bow down to them or serve them for I the \"I AM\" your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate (or disobey) Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love (and obey) Me, and KEEP My COMMANDMENTS.\n3. Honour your Father in Heaven and KEEP His COMMANDMENTS; LAWS; Statutes; Judgements; Economic Policy; Agricultural Policy and Diet that He gave to YOU and your Mother, the British Nation Israel, His wife (metaphorically), at Mt. Sinai and make Him proud of YOU.\n4. YOU shall NOT commit adultery, either physically, individually, or spiritually, nationally or individually but shall be FAITHFUL to God, your word and your spouse, also NOT committing adultery nationally by following the wrong examples of other nations.\n5. YOU shall NOT use the Lord's name, unless you are speaking to Him, or about Him, then you will not waste His time or insult Him.\n6. Love your neighbour (not physically) as much as, or more than, you love your \"Self\". Then you will not do wrong, or lie, to anyone - John 15 v 13.\nDo NOT desire eagerly, or touch, anything that does not belong to you. It belongs to your neighbour, not you, and YOU must respect HIS property. Your neighbour is the person next to you and the person on the far side of the planet and everyone in between.\n7. YOU shall NOT lie, even to your \"Self\".\n8. Remember the Sabbath and KEEP it Holy. It is NOT wrong to do GOOD deeds on the Sabbath. The Sabbath was made for man. Man was not made for the Sabbath.\n9. YOU shall NOT steal. Neither shall you make up your own laws to enable you to do so by deceiving people.\n10. YOU shall NOT murder - kill unlawfully.\n11. YOU shall love one another as much as I love you and in the same way - spiritually not physically - John 15 v 13. IF you DO this, ALL men will KNOW that you ARE my disciples and are exercising and learning \"Self\" discipline - Discipleship.\n12. Judge no-one, so that you will not be judged, by God, for by whatever judgement you judge another, unjustly, you condemn yourself to the same punishment. Judging is God's job exclusively, as He is always unbiased, impartial, uncorruptible and just. He has given His judgements, in His Law Books given to you at Mt. Sinai, by which He judges those who break His Laws. There are NO other laws on this planet that are LEGAL. God has strictly FORBIDDEN man from making up laws (Deuteronomy 4:2). God's Laws are the same for everyone. God does NOT have separate Laws - one for the rich and another one for the poor.\nH.M.

Everything a human+Being needs to be able to live and co-exist with other human+Beings, in a caring society, in harmony with the natural environment, where everyone puts others before themselves.\nSo what went wrong? Why are we living now, in a society in which most people are afraid to walk down the street at night, where we have to lock everything in the fear of others stealing from us.\nIt seems that fear is the root of all evil in this world. Our fear of poverty; loneliness; ridicule; war. Where do these fears come from? Why do they control us and make us do the 'Self'-ish things that we do.\nIt seems that the leaders of the world use fear to control us and manipulate us into conforming to their \"System\" of control. They have made up fraudulent legislation that has made us, the majority of people, slaves to them. We spend our whole lives working, often doing jobs which are destructive to the environment, only to pay excessive taxes to these people, being left with only just enough money over to survive and perhaps have a family of our own, so our children can grow up to become slaves to this evil \"System\"; just as we are.\nSo what do we do about it? We can't just refuse to work under their \"System\" because they control the legislation and simply have anyone who refuses to conform either thrown in jail or put in an institution, and labeled insane. The truth is, they are the insane ones who are destroying the planet by having all the trees cut down and are destroying the environment, that we live in, for money for themselves.\nThere is ONLY One Way to stop these people, and that is to prove their evil \"System\" wrong (which they are already doing by themselves by destroying the planet) and show them The Real Law which is perfectly fair and unbiased; is friendly to the environment and has been there for thousands of years.\nThe Torah is the name given to The Laws; Statutes; Judgments; Agricultural and Economic Policies that were handed to Moses on top of Mt. Horeb in Sinai by The Ruler of The Universe and is The Perfect System for the world to use, as it was given by a totally independent body (God); so is perfectly fair and un-biased. These Laws are contained in The First Five Books of The Old Testament of The Bible; the originals of which are kept in The Ark of The Covenant, which is buried in a hidden subterranean tomb at The Hill of Tara (Torah) in Co. Meath, Ireland.\nWhen The Ark is recovered The Laws that it contains can then be reinstituted into society. This will prove that the people currently in positions of authority, running the \"System\" we are forced to live under, were never allowed to make up their own legislation and they will be forced to go back to God's Laws and redistribute all of the wealth that they have defrauded from the people and hoarded away. That money should then be redistributed evenly and fairly back to the people that it was taken from in the first place - the lower and middle classes.\nThe Ark of The Covenant needs to be recovered immediately, before the people who are currently running (ruining) the world totally destroy the planet we are living on in the name of \"economic growth\". Please help us stop the destruction of the planet, by supporting us in our endeavor to excavate a small section of grass (2m. x 2m.) at The Hill of Tara (Torah), Co. Meath, Ireland; to expose the entrance to the hidden subterranean tomb that The Ark of The Covenant is buried in. The recovery of The Ark is the ONLY WAY that we can prove that the evil \"System\" that we are forced to live under is unlawful and wrong, and in so doing we can permanently put a stop to all corruption and oppression now happening on Planet Earth.\nFor more details about The Ark of The Covenant; what it contains; how it will put the world right and how it came to be in Ireland please CLICK HERE.\nclemilf \u2022 8 months ago\nThe Clemilf sports a 33 year old medical degree... and concurs with the analysis.

Wells\nJuly 5, 2021\nThe whole premise of getting a vaccine is based on the supposed science that proves there is more of a threat from the disease than the vaccine itself. Yet, three months after getting vaccinated with the Moderna Covid-19 jab, six of this doctor\u2019s patients are STILL experiencing severe neurological side effects, and they only got the first shot. Was it worth it?\nThe Chinese Flu is only killing people who are already suffering from cancer, diabetes, heart disease or autoimmune problems, so now why is everybody else told to get jabbed when the risk of vaccine injury FAR OUTWEIGHS the risk of dying from Covid-19, or Delta Variant, or Beta, or Gamma or whatever else Fauci and Gates release next.\nA family doctor in\u00a0British Columbia\u00a0can\u2019t stay silent about the dangers of these Covid-19 vaccines anymore\nHe\u2019s had enough. His patients that he\u2019s seen for 10, 20, 25 years are suddenly suffering severe neurological damage and allergic reactions like he\u2019s never seen before, and right after they got their China Flu jabs made by Moderna. Dr. Charles Hoffe is on the record now describing his First Nations patients\u2019 life-threatening \u201cside effects\u201d as he shares this whistle-blowing information with other medical professionals and journalists alike so the word can get out. The vaccine is MORE dangerous than Covid-19. Period.\nIn his open letter to B.C. Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Hoffe describes the mild effects coronavirus has had in his community, and how they haven\u2019t had to give medical care to the people who catch it, because they just have mild symptoms and it goes away.\nNow the vaccine is quite clearly more dangerous than Covid-19, as people are suffering severe nervous system disorders that, months later, are showing signs of being permanent, while previously perfectly healthy other patients (around the world) are suffering blood clots in rare places, like the lungs and brain, just three or four days after vaccination.\nWhy should any young person or healthy adult risk life-threatening blood clots to get inoculated \u201cprotection\u201d when they\u2019re not even at risk from natural infection?\nGerman scientists have discovered the Covid-19 vaccines cause blood clots, and so have thousands of \u201cpatients\u201d who\u2019s cells now produce unlimited sticky \u201cprotein\u201d prions that travel throughout the blood vessels, causing \u201croad blocks,\u201d and this is why we\u2019re seeing the huge up-tick (pardon the pun) of heart inflammation cases right after vaccination.\nThese injected patients now have cells that have instructions to clog the blood using a genetically modified adenovirus taken from monkeys (J&J and AstraZeneca use this kind of adenovirus-vector jab). There you go all you vaccinated folks. You\u2019ve got monkey-blood-clot disease now, and your cells have a new code for it that can\u2019t be undone. Enjoy. Right after being injected with monkey-blood-clot-disease, new genetically-coded SARS-CoV-2 virus information sneaks into your cells like a bio-weapon terrorist, forcing your cells to produce clones of inflammation-causing \u201cspike proteins.\u201d\nYour entire body believes it\u2019s under attack, because it is. And now, that attack is relentless. Just wait until the next shot, for Delta or as a \u201cbooster,\u201d that instructs your cells to produce billions more of these protein prions. That\u2019s when all the vaccinated lose their minds, not just their central nervous systems and swollen, over-worked hearts.\nOnce you\u2019re injected with foreign particles, they come into contact with platelets from your blood, and that\u2019s when the real problems begin. The body tries to stop the bleeding, but it\u2019s fooled by clones. The platelets surround the adenovirus \u201cshells\u201d and the foreign \u201cproteins\u201d and all of a sudden the human body has an ABNORMAL number of platelets. The medical doctors in America are completely and utterly \u201cpuzzled\u201d and \u201cbaffled\u201d by this. So much for those eight years of medical school. What a waste.\nNext comes the blood clotting on top of blood clots. Yes, that happens. Your blood flowing over and around these clots starts clotting more, adding to the chaos. For some, death follows, like those four airline pilots that died just days after vaccination.\nFinally, the antibodies attack your own platelets, recruiting white blood cells, and the whole inflammatory response is so overblown it causes blood clots to form. Now the vaccine manufacturers are being required, one by one, to label the Covid toxic jabs with a blood clot warning. It\u2019s a little late, and just wait until the real carnage comes. All vaccine injuries and deaths will now be labeled as caused by the \u201c Delta Variant .\u201d Get ready for the big lie.\nVisit CovidVaccineReactions.com if you already got a toxic Covid jab or two and you are experiencing side effects, blood clots or other adverse events.

We\u2019re trying to go big and bring the patriotic truth the the nation, but we need help.\nReaders may or may not realize that over the past year, we\u2019ve been bringing more conservative news and opinion outlets under our wing. Don\u2019t take our expansion as a sign of riches; all of the \u201cacquisitions\u201d have been through sweat and promises of greater things to come for all involved. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to bring together several independent media sites under a unified vision of preventing America from succumbing to the progressive, \u201cwoke,\u201d Neo-Marxist ideologies that are spreading like wildfire across America.\nThe slow and steady reopening of America is revealing there was a lot more economic hardship brought about from the Covd-19 lockdowns than most realize. While we continue to hope advertising dollars on the sites go up, it\u2019s simply not enough to do things the right way. We are currently experiencing a gap between revenue and expenses that cannot be overcome by click-ads and MyPillow promos alone (promo code \u201cNOQ\u201d by the way).\nTo overcome our revenue gap and keep these sites running, our needs fluctuate between $3000-$7000 per month. In other words, we\u2019re in the red and hemorrhaging.\nThe best way you can help us grow and continue to bring the truth to the people is by donating. We appreciate everything, whether a dollar or $10,000. Anything brings us closer to a point of stability when we can hire writers, editors, and support staff to make the America First message louder. Our Giving Fuel page makes it easy to donate one-time or monthly. Alternatively, you can donate through PayPal as well.\nAs the world spirals towards radical progressivism, the need for truthful journalism has never been greater. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible. Please help keep NOQ Report and the other sites in the network going.\nThank you and God Bless,\nJD Rucker\nBitcoin: 32SeW2Ajn86g4dATWtWreABhEkiqxsKUGn\nToo Few Are Telling the Truth\nNot long ago, conservative media was not beholden to anyone. Today, most sites are stuck on the Big Tech gravy train.\nI\u2019ll keep this short. The rise of Pandemic Panic Theater, massive voter fraud, and other \u201ctaboo\u201d topics have neutered a majority of conservative news sites. You\u2019ll notice they are very careful about what topics they tackle. Sure, they\u2019ll attack Critical Race Theory, Antifa, and the Biden-Harris regime, but you won\u2019t see them going after George Soros, Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, or the Deep State, among others.\nThe reason is simple. They are beholden to Big Tech, and Big Tech doesn\u2019t allow certain topics to be discussed or they\u2019ll cut you off. Far too many conservative news outlets rely on Google, Facebook, and Twitter for the bulk of their traffic. They depend on big checks from Google ads to keep the sites running. I don\u2019t necessarily hold it against them. We all do what we need to do to survive. I just wish more would do like we have, which is to cut out Big Tech altogether.\nWe don\u2019t get Google checks. We don\u2019t have Facebook or Twitter buttons on our stories. We don\u2019t have a YouTube Channel (banned), and Instagram profile (never made one), or a TikTok (no thanks, CCO). We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re doing everything we can to not owe anything to anyone\u2026 other than our readers. We owe YOU the truth. We owe YOU the facts that others won\u2019t reveal about topics that others won\u2019t tackle. And we owe America, this great land that allows us to take hold of these opportunities.\nLike I said, I don\u2019t hold other conservative sites under too much scrutiny over their choices. It\u2019s easy for people to point fingers when we\u2019re not the ones paying their bills or supporting their families. I just wish there were more who would break away. Today, only a handful of other major conservative news outlets have broken away from the Big Tech teat. Of course, we need help.\nThe best way you can help us grow and continue to bring proper news and opinions to the people is by donating. We appreciate everything, whether a dollar or $10,000. Anything brings us closer to a point of stability when we can hire writers, editors, and support staff to make the America First message louder. Our Giving Fuel page makes it easy to donate one-time or monthly. Alternatively, you can donate through PayPal or Bitcoin as well.

Media.\nFreedom First Network\nBased Underground\nUncanceled News\nAmerican Conservative Movement\nConservative Playbook\nOur Gold Guy\nWe are also building partnerships with great conservative sites like The Liberty Daily and The Epoch Times to advance the message as loudly as possible, and we\u2019re always looking for others with which to partner.\nAlso, we could use contributions of content. If you write or want to start writing and you share our patriotic, conservative, America First ideology, contact us. The contact form on this and all pages on the site goes directly to me.\nSome of our content is spread across multiple sites. Other pieces of content are unique. We write most of what we post but we also draw from those willing to allow us to share their quality articles, videos, and podcasts. We collect the best content from fellow conservative sites that give us permission to republish them. We\u2019re not ego-driven; I\u2019d much rather post a properly attributed story written by experts like Dr. Joseph Mercola or Natural News than rewrite it like so many outlets like to do. We\u2019re not here to take credit. We\u2019re here to spread the truth.\nWhile donations are the best way to help, you can also support us by buying through our sponsors:\nMyPillow: Use promo code \u201cNOQ\u201d to get up to 66% off AND you\u2019ll be helping a patriotic, America First company.\nFreedom Phone: Use promo code \u201cMAGA\u201d and get $50 off AND you\u2019ll be helping a patriotic, America First company.\nOurGoldGuy: Tell them we sent you in your request to buy gold and it will help us\u2026 AND (wait for it) you\u2019ll be helping a patriotic, America First company.\nWe know we could make a lot more money if we sold out like so many \u201cconservative\u201d publications out there. You won\u2019t find Google ads on our site for a reason. Yes, they\u2019re lucrative, but I don\u2019t like getting paid by minions of Satan (I don\u2019t like Google very much if you couldn\u2019t tell).\nTime is short. As the world spirals towards The Great Reset, the need for truthful journalism has never been greater. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible. Please help keep NOQ Report and the other sites in the network going. Our promise is this: We will never sell out America. If that means we\u2019re going to struggle for a while or even indefinitely, so be it. Integrity first. Truth first.

He referenced\u00a0the hard evidence proving that Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) knew that COVID vaccines could kill thousands of healthy people.\nThis information, which had been kept secret until recently, showed data that Pfizer submitted to the FDA as part of its post-authorization adverse event reports.\nDue to a\u00a0Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the FDA was forced to reveal the first 91 pages of the report that included adverse events reported by people following the Pfizer COVID injections through February 28, 2021.\nThe number of adverse events reported was so high, many believe it was nothing less than criminal. Only a few weeks into getting the shots in arms, Pfizer received over 42,000 cases of adverse events. If a Harvard University study is to be believed, this is fewer than one percent of the actual number of cases.\nSince the vaccine rollout in the U.S., Americans have bought into the rhetoric that the injections are safe and effective. Coleman reminded the public that Pfizer is one of the world\u2019s most fined companies, and they made billions of dollars during the pandemic.\nOver the years, the pharmaceutical company paid hefty fines and made false claims in kickbacks and other unlawful acts \u2013 proving that dishonesty is not foreign to its practices. Despite\u00a0Pfizer\u2019s track record, however, governments worked hand in hand with the company to push their agenda. (Related: FDA to authorize Pfizer\u2019s deadly COVID-19 vaccine boosters for all adults, despite accelerating post-vaccine deaths .)\n\u201cGovernments around the globe have systematically created a fear to terrify and manipulate people to accept a vaccine that does not do what most people think it does. The word \u2018genocide\u2019 can no longer be considered hyperbole,\u201d said Coleman.\nMillions of children already injected with Pfizer\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d vaccine\nPfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine also received emergency use authorization (EUA) for children between five to 11 years old. The U.S. reported that about 10 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds have already received their COVID shots as early as mid-November.\nWhile the company said that its smaller dose for kids is more than 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection, the side effects reported are similar to those in the 16 to 25 age bracket.\nChildren are not likely to fall seriously ill with COVID, and there had been few reports of COVID cases in children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said that they expect shots to provide protection \u201csimilar\u201d to that experienced by adolescents and adults.\nThe White House has rapidly rolled out its immunization campaign for\u00a0children after the CDC authorized distribution of the shots early last month. The CDC gave the greenlight just a few days after the FDA granted the EUA for Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine for younger children.\nThe Pfizer vaccine given to younger children is one-third the dose for teens and adults, and is administered with smaller needles. The vaccine for kids is also distributed in different packaging to avoid mix-up with adult doses.\nFollow Pandemic.news for more news and information related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nSources include:\nNaturalHealth365.com\nCNBC.com\nTagged Under: big government, Big Pharma, CDC, conspiracy, covid-19, deception, FDA, medical fascism, Medical Tyranny, pandemic, Pfizer, pharmaceutical fraud, vaccine injury, vaccines\nGet Our Free Email Newsletter\nGet independent news alerts on natural cures, food lab tests, cannabis medicine, science, robotics, drones, privacy and more.\nYour privacy is protected.

In fact, the study concluded that the risk of hospitalization for cardiac adverse events following vaccination is higher than the risk of being hospitalized with COVID for healthy teenage boys.\nAnalysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with Covid over a four-month period.\nMost children who experienced the rare side-effect had symptoms within days of the second shot of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, though a similar side-effect is seen with the Moderna jab. About 86% of the boys affected required some hospital care, the authors said.\nThe report by Tracy H\u00f8eg, MD, PhD, of the University of California Davis, and colleagues found that rates of \u201ccardiac adverse events\u201d after the second dose were higher than previous CDC estimates, at 162 per million among boys ages 12 \u2013 15 and 94 per million among boys ages 16 \u2013 17.\nAt current US infection rates, the risk of a healthy adolescent being taken to hospital with Covid in the next 120 days is about 44 per million, they said. This means that healthy boys are between 214% and 369% MORE LIKELY to be hospitalized because of the vaccine than from the virus .\nThe study relied heavily on data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. As of September 10th, there were 14,925 reported deaths associated with the COVID vaccines (63% of all vaccine-related death s reported since 1990). There were 60,741 hospitalizations associated with the COVID jab (44% of all vaccine-related hospitalizations since 1990). There were 701,559 adverse events associated with the COVID shot (46% of all vaccine-related adverse events since 1990).\nThe study has caused an uproar on social media, with many physicians, politicians, and pundits citing the VAERS data as unreliable source due to its limitations. And they\u2019re right\u2026 sort of.\nThe Lazarus Report estimates that only 1% of vaccine-related adverse events are reported.\nThis means that the actual number of hospitalizations and deaths related to the vaccines may be closer to 6 million and 1.5 million, respectively. But the study has not slowed efforts to vaccinate children as young as 5 years old.\nOn Monday, Pfizer announced that it\u2019s new lower dose COVID vaccine was \u201c safe and effective \u201d for children ages 5 \u2013 11, a demographic that has not been eligible for the vaccine (or associated mandates) so far.\nBut that might soon change.\n\u201c These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency ,\u201d said Albert Bourla, the chairman and CEO for Pfizer.\nThe long-term health effects of the mRNA vaccines on teenage boys (or any demographic, for that matter) are unknown. VAERS is limited because it relies on voluntary reporting. It was designed as a sort of early warning system to track potential problems with vaccines.\nBy any metric, the significant increase in reported events associated with the COVID shots is alarming. Remember, there have been more reported deaths associated with the COVID shots over the past 9 months than from all other vaccines combined over the last 30 years!\nSome so-called \u201cexperts\u201d have complained that H\u00f8eg et al. misinterpreted the data and should trust the CDC\u2019s own research, which shows a much lower incidence of heart problems associated with the jab.\nH\u00f8eg said the group used the same definition of myocarditis that the CDC did for its previous estimates using VAERS data, and that cardiologist and co-author John Mandrola, MD was key in vetting reports. She also pointed to the established fact that VAERS often provides an underestimate of the true prevalence of an adverse event.\nSeveral physicians, however, have asked why this group would bother repeating the CDC\u2019s own analysis, especially if they are using the same definition of myocarditis \u2014 and working without CDC\u2019s adjudicated data.\n\u201c We repeated the project because we were concerned about the symptom search criteria the CDC used being too narrow ,\u201d H\u00f8eg told reporters. \u201c We found around 40% of our cases simply using expanded symptom search criteria from theirs but requiring the same objective evidence they did of myocarditis (which we called in our paper \u2018cardiac adverse event\u2019) .\u201d\nShe said they also wanted to stratify risk by age groups 12-15 and 16-17, which CDC hadn\u2019t done:\n\u201c As a mom of 10- and 13-year-old boys, this was important information for me to see and I know many other parents feel the same way. The benefit of using the VAERS first was this is a rare event, which we were just beginning to track in the U.S., and VAERS gave us quick access to the largest number of reported cases ,\u201d H\u00f8eg said. \u201c We could also easily identify instances of post-vaccination cardiac injury in terms of troponin levels, along with case descriptions (which we have made publicly available) and directly compare our rates with those that the CDC found, demonstrating that there may be a significant amount of missed post-vaccination cardiac damage in this age group, specifically in the youngest group, compared to what the CDC had initially reported .\u201d\nUnfortunately, this kind of bad science is par for the course when it comes to the CDC. And if you\u2019re wondering why the CDC would be motivated to spin the narrative, you don\u2019t need to look much further than their bank accounts.\nMembers of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), who actually decide which vaccines are recommended to be added to the CDC vaccine schedules, are often financially involved with vaccine manufacturers.\nACIP members may own stock in Big Pharma companies that are responsible for producing the vaccines that the ACIP committee recommends! In fact, the law firm Weltchek Mallahan & Weltchek found over 50 patents connected to vaccines owned or shared by one or more members of ACIP or other committees within the CDC.\nWillingly placing children in harm\u2019s way is arguably the most despicable sin of all. The available data tells us that these \u201cvaccines\u201d are putting our kids in even more danger than the disease it\u2019s supposed to treat.\nWith billions in annual vaccine revenue, it seems our children are just another way for Pfizer\u2019s cronies to make money\u2026 no matter the cost.\nThe system is broken. Our healthcare systems, the pharmaceutical industry, our government and its regulatory bodies, our media, and even the technology sector have all been corrupted.

However, a respected cardiologist has warned that a study has illustrated the fact that the vaccines are in fact more dangerous than the virus they are supposed to protect people from.\nDr Peter McCullough is a top cardiologist who has had his works published more than 650 times in a variety of medical journals. Additionally, he has authored a cardiology textbook, is an editor of a cardiology journal and has served past experience on teams that review and examine new vaccines.\nDuring his years in the medical field, he has chaired data safety monitoring boards on a multitude of occasions and has stated that he was incredibly surprised by what occurred when the Covid-19 vaccines were first rolled out earlier last year. He said that in normal circumstances, what happened in January this year when officials learned of 182 deaths following 278 million jabs should have been enough to end the Covid vaccine program.\n\u201cOur [COVID] vaccine program would have been shut down in February for excess mortality in America,\u201d he said.\nThe cardiologist added that the vaccines are especially dangerous for the elderly and also other people from vulnerable groups, including those who are immunocompromised. He said that studies carried out in care homes in Europe revealed that at least 40 percent of deaths were linked to the jabs.\nMcCullough said: \u201cWe now know it\u2019s the seniors who die with the vaccine \u2026 50 percent of these deaths occur within 48 hours, 80 percent within a week.\u201d\nHe added that some vaccine recipients suffered from serious adverse reactions, which often were followed by death within a day or two. According to the doctor, many people are dying from cardiopulmonary collapse due to their body\u2019s overwhelming production of the spike protein, whilst others are dying from a thromboembolic or blood clot-related death within a few weeks of getting vaccinated. He said in these cases it\u2019s very clear that the jabs are responsible for the deaths.\nThe cardiologist warned that young people should steer clear of the vaccines as the jabs can cause serious heart problems such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart sac), which the mainstream media have repeatedly attempted to downplay.\nWhilst he understands that many people want to do what\u2019s best to stop the virus, he also understands there are those who do not wish to lose their life as a result.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what they\u2019re being asked for; they\u2019re being asked to \u2026 take a vaccine, and even though it\u2019s rare, you could lose your life and then people are saying, \u2018Well, how rare is rare?\u2019 and I can just tell you, the mortality rate by all expert analyses is unacceptably high,\u201d McCullough said.\n0\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nWith 4 comments\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized by permalink .\nAbout multidimensionalocean\nI have always known that I am a starseed, however I only consider myself as a lightworker for the past few years.

Although a vaccine with the purpose of defeating this virus could be a good thing moving forward, the public has the right to be reluctant and seek information out before taking it.\nSome who are highly at-risk for COVID-19 have no other choice than take the vaccine. Others who are not at high risk, however, are somewhat concerned about the vaccine becoming more dangerous than the virus itself. Roughly 4,230,000 people in-between ages 18-29 in the United States have\u00a0 had\u00a0 coronavirus, but only 1,500 of these cases died. The mortality rate for that age group is 00.00035%.\nSome leading voices started a movement to oppose the shot, and they are generally not online conspiracy theorists or political extremists. Ironically, large numbers of healthcare workers, among those first designated access to receive the vaccine, are refusing to take the vaccine. Twenty-nine percent of health care workers \u201cprobably or definitely would not get a COVID-19 vaccine\u201d according to Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit that focuses on national health issues. This prominent reluctance by those on the front lines and with experience in health care services should set off some semblance of an alarm for the general public, as 27% of people\u00a0 not take the vaccine. If our health care workers are not unified on the use of the coronavirus vaccine, why should the general public buy the idea that the vaccine is completely safe?\nThe potential side effects and rushed process for the vaccine create two major concerns for those already in opposition . These vaccines were approved for emergency use by the FDA, receiving fast-track approval, but have not gained formal approval. The fast-track approval means a lack of long-term studies on the effects caused from the new drug, and the side effects of this vaccine are still unknown.\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a legal wing within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that provides alternative legal protection for vaccine companies. If a shot creates a problem serious enough to cause damage to health of a user, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for financial compensation for damages. These companies do not have to worry about long term effects because of the emergency approval, neglecting to consider long-term safety.\nFinancial damages, however, do not compare to the damages on\u00a0 individual freedom if mandatory vaccinations were put in place. Under precedent of a Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v. Massachusetts of 1905, states have \u201cpolice power\u201d to enforce a variety of reasonable public health precautions, which includes mandatory vaccines. Although mandatory vaccines in the past have been successful in eradicating diseases, long-term research shows effects  of various vaccines we overlooked for the sake of temporary relief. State governments should not force the public to take a vaccine so early in the development process. Although states do technically have the authority to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, enforcing a vaccine that a relatively large percentage of people who are skeptical of would be a step beyond what is reasonable.\nEmployers are forced with a similar question of whether to mandate the vaccine. Up to this point in the pandemic, many businesses have enforced mask use and other sanitary precautions. They should maintain their rights as private businesses to require certain precautions from workers. A mandatory vaccine, unlike external masks or sanitizing, would be overreaching into their workers\u2019 internal health with a vaccine still in the early stages. Employees should not be fired for refusing to take the vaccine if they comply with other external preventions because the vaccine is a large request for employers to ask.\nIn conclusion, reluctancy to receive COVID-19 vaccine is valid and understandable, as many health care workers are doing the same. Those that are young and healthy already have a low chance of dying from the virus, and a rushed vaccine with unknown long-term side effects for this demographic can cause more harm than it prevents.\nKeaton Browder is an Opinion Writer."}, {"Url": "https://foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-covid-vaccine-dangerous-kids-big-tech", "CluewebURLHash": "1C43FEA2B7294DB1E3D0712B52B6B5D1", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Tucker Carlson: The \ue000COVID\ue001 \ue000vaccine\ue001 is \ue000dangerous\ue001 for kids ...", "Snippet": "\"The implication,\" they concluded, \"is that the risks of a \ue000COVID\ue001 -19 \ue000vaccine\ue001 may outweigh the benefits for certain low-risk populations, such as children, young adults and people who have ...", "Click_Cnt": 0.006, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0029-56-08887", "CluewebDocument": "Tucker Carlson: The COVID vaccine is dangerous for kids, Big Tech doesn't want you to know that | Fox News\nOPINION\nPublished June 23, 2021 11:33pm EDT\nTucker Carlson: The COVID vaccine is dangerous for kids, Big Tech doesn't want you to know that\nEven posting WHO guidance could get you censored\nBy Tucker Carlson | Fox News\nTucker: People continue to ignore the science\n'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host discusses new data showing potential vaccine risks\nNEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, key pieces of medical guidance from the World Health Organization have proven to be disastrously false \u2014 false enough to cost lives. It was the WHO, you\u2019ll remember, that told us COVID couldn\u2019t be transmitted between people, even as the virus was spreading into the United States. It was the WHO that worked in stealth with the Chinese government to obscure the source of the outbreak at the beginning, and then hide its origins from the world. We\u2019re not attacking the WHO. Those are statements of fact. You\u2019d think. they\u2019d be disqualifying. Just the opposite. For more than a year, the tech monopolies of Silicon Valley have used the World Health Organization\u2019s official statements to determine what American news consumers are allowed to know \u2014 and what they should be prohibited from knowing \u2014 about COVID. Facebook even announced a formal partnership with the WHO to \"bring up to date and accurate information to billions of people.\"\nThat partnership \u2014 between a China -controlled NGO, and the China-beholden tech platforms \u2014 continued smoothly until just a few days ago. That\u2019s when bureaucrats at the WHO published new vaccine guidance. Here\u2019s what it says: children should not take the coronavirus vaccine. Why? The drugs are too dangerous. There's not nearly enough data to understand the long-term effects or to show that the benefits are worth the risk that they bring. This is terrible news, of course, for the pharmaceutical industry. Big Pharma has been planning to test the vaccine on six-month-olds. It\u2019s deeply embarrassing for much of the news media, which have taken a break from ginning up hysteria about Russian spies to sell vaccines to their viewers. And above all, it is a shocking repudiation of the American health establishment, which has been relentlessly pushing universal vaccination, including for children. Biden's top coronavirus adviser, Zeke Emanuel, declared that young people should be required to get the shot.\nEMANUEL:\u00a0 There are clearly places where you\u2019re congregating people that we should have mandates: students in universities \u2013 my university for example, faculty and staff.\u00a0 Health care facilities. Every health care worker ought to be vaccinated. I shouldn\u2019t have to worry whether my doctor or nurse has been vaccinated. \u2026 And I think employers ought to take this very seriously and consider mandating and requiring their workers to get vaccinated \u2013 especially if they\u2019re coming back to the office.\nWait a second, Zeke Emanual, if you\u2019ve been vaccinated, why would you worry about why the people around you have been vaccinated if vaccines work? Kind of an obvious question, no one has ever asked it. Someone should.\nDATA SUGGESTS \u2018LIKELY\u2019 LINK BETWEEN COVID-19 MRNA VACCINES, RARE HEART ISSUES IN TEENS, CDC PANEL SAYS\nBut they may not have a chance, because the WHO's latest finding -- that the vaccine is not safe for children -- threatens everything that reckless creeps like Zeke Emanuel and the pharmaceutical industry have been working for. More vaccines, no matter what the human cost. That is their position. In the end, the forces of recklessness appear to have more power even than the WHO. Here\u2019s how we know: In a remarkable about-face, Silicon Valley has decided that the World Health Organization is, in fact, not reliable, it\u2019s a disseminator of disinformation.\nFacebook has just censored a woman called Michelle Coriaty-Herbst for sharing the WHO's bulletin on vaccines word-for-word. She just posted it. Facebook deleted it. \"Your comment goes against our community standards on spam,\" Facebook wrote. So, this is Silicon Valley\u2019s new policy: everything about vaccines is good. Period. You are not allowed to suggest otherwise. No matter what data you might have. No matter what data you might have, no matter what a health organization might tell you.\nVideo\nAn epidemiology Ph.D. called Tracey Hoeg learned this recently. She posted slides from the CDC's own website showing that rates of myocarditis -- a potentially fatal heart inflammation -- are extremely high in young people who have taken the vaccine. That's not in dispute anymore; the CDC's preliminary investigation has just confirmed a link between the vaccine and myocarditis.\nAs Hoeg put it, \"We are standing on shaky ground if we say the risk to otherwise healthy kids from COVID-19 is higher than it is from the vaccine.\" She wrote that on Twitter. That\u2019s true. Twitter censored her.\u00a0 But why? It makes you wonder: why is that the one forbidden thing?\nTUCKER CARLSON: SCIENTISTS WANT TO USE HUMAN ENGINEERING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE\nAnd, while we\u2019re at it, what are the risks from the vaccines? All medicines come with risks, so what\u2019s the real answer? Two medical school professors -- UCLA's Joseph Ladapo and Yale's Harvey Risch -- recently tried to find out. They outlined what they found in The Wall Street Journal. They discovered that the VAERS system, the biggest database of self-reported vaccine harm we have, isn't just showing elevated rates of myocarditis. It's also showing much higher rates of other, very serious complications -- low platelets, deep-vein thrombosis, and death.\u00a0Many deaths.\n\"The implication,\" they concluded, \"is that the risks of a COVID -19 vaccine may outweigh the benefits for certain low-risk populations, such as children, young adults and people who have recovered from COVID-19.\"\nHOUSTON HOSPITAL WORKERS FIRED, RESIGN OVER COVID-19 VACCINE\nThat's what the data show. Clearly. But instead of listening to the data, many schools and countless employers are mandating that everyone take the shot -- even if they've already had COVID and recovered. People who do not need the shot. Why are they doing this? It\u2019s lunacy. Well, presumably because people like Tony Fauci told them the vaccine is more effective than natural immunity. Is that true? No. It is not true. There are no data to support that claim. But Fauci says it anyway.\nFAUCI: We know that reinfections with a homologous strain, namely the same strain as initial infection, remain rare. They occur, but they\u2019re rare. Vaccination in people previously infected significantly boosts the immune response and likely, as I\u2019m going to show you in a moment, providing better protection against certain variants. And then the issue of vaccines actually, at least with regard to SARS-CoV-2, can do better than nature.\nCollege students, young adults in the prime of their life, are being forced to take the vaccine because Tony Fauci said that, even though they don't need it, and in some cases, don\u2019t want it. What will the effects on them be? Well, judging by the VAERS reporting system, we can be certain that some will be harmed. Beyond that, we can't be sure. We aren't even sure what effects this vaccine will have on the elderly -- the one group we were told from day one should take the vaccine as quickly as possible. \u00a0And most of us believed that.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut new numbers are coming. The Norwegian Medicines Agency has found that the vaccine may increase the risk of death in the elderly, as well. The Norwegian study conducted a study of 100 nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer's coronavirus shot. They found that at least 10 of the deaths were \"likely caused\" by the vaccine. 10%. And in 26 other cases, they were \"possibly caused\" by the vaccine.\nWhat explains those numbers? Doctor Robert Malone tried to address that question recently in a podcast broadcast on YouTube .\u00a0 YouTube took it down. They did that even though Doctor Robert Malone may be the most qualified person on the planet to discuss the subject. He helped create the mRNA technology behind the COVID vaccines.\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the June 23, 2021, edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""}, {"Url": "https://mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859", "CluewebURLHash": "A4D5D8397FFDE9FBE93A1D853955F27B", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Get the facts about COVID-19 vaccines - Mayo Clinic", "Snippet": "Use of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine might increase the risk of a rare and serious blood clotting disorder.

REUTERS Illustration/via YouTube\nMichael Yeadon was a scientific researcher and vice president at drugs giant Pfizer Inc. He co-founded a successful biotech. Then his career took an unexpected turn.\nBy STEVE STECKLOW and ANDREW MACASKILL in LONDON\nFiled March 18, 2021, 11 a.m. GMT\nLate last year, a semi-retired British scientist co-authored a petition to Europe\u2019s medicines regulator. The petitioners made a bold demand: Halt COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.\nEven bolder was their argument for doing so: They speculated, without providing evidence, that the vaccines could cause infertility in women.\nThe document appeared on a German website on Dec.1. Scientists denounced the theory. Regulators weren\u2019t swayed, either: Weeks later, the European Medicines Agency approved the European Union\u2019s first COVID-19 shot, co-developed by Pfizer Inc. But damage was already done.\nSocial media quickly spread exaggerated claims that COVID-19 jabs cause female infertility. Within weeks, doctors and nurses in Britain began reporting that concerned women were asking them whether it was true, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists. In January, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation\u00a0(KFF), a non-profit organization, found that 13% of unvaccinated people in the United States had heard that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines have been shown to cause infertility.\u201d\nWhat gave the debunked claim credibility was that one of the petition\u2019s co-authors, Michael Yeadon, wasn\u2019t just any scientist. The 60-year-old is a former vice president of Pfizer, where he spent 16 years as an allergy and respiratory researcher. He later co-founded a biotech firm that the Swiss drugmaker Novartis purchased for at least $325 million.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first COVID-19 shot to be authorized for use in the European Union. REUTERS/Marko Djurica\n\u201cThese claims are false, dangerous and deeply irresponsible.\u201d\nA spokesman for Britain\u2019s Department of Health & Social Care\nIn recent months, Yeadon (pronounced Yee-don) has emerged as an unlikely hero of the so-called anti-vaxxers, whose adherents question the safety of many vaccines, including for the coronavirus. The anti-vaxxer movement has amplified Yeadon\u2019s skeptical views about COVID-19 vaccines and tests, government-mandated lockdowns and the arc of the pandemic. Yeadon has said he personally doesn\u2019t oppose the use of all vaccines. But many health experts and government officials worry that opinions like his fuel vaccine hesitancy \u2013 a reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated \u2013 that could prolong the pandemic. COVID-19 has already killed more than 2.6 million people worldwide.\n\u201cThese claims are false, dangerous and deeply irresponsible,\u201d said a spokesman for Britain\u2019s Department of Health & Social Care, when asked about Yeadon\u2019s views. \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines are the best way to protect people from coronavirus and will save thousands of lives.\u201d\nRecent reports of blood clots and abnormal bleeding in a small number of recipients of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine have cast doubt on that shot\u2019s safety, leading several European countries to suspend its use. The developments are likely to\u00a0fuel\u00a0vaccine hesitancy further, although there is no evidence of a causative link between the AstraZeneca product and the affected patients\u2019 conditions.\nYeadon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment for this article. In reporting this story, Reuters reviewed thousands of his tweets over the past two years, along with other writings and statements. It also interviewed five people who know him, including four of his former colleagues at Pfizer.\nA Pfizer spokesman declined to comment on Yeadon and his stint with the company, beyond emphasizing\u00a0that there is no evidence that its vaccine, which it developed with its German partner BioNTech, causes infertility in women.\nReferences to Yeadon\u2019s petition appear on the website of a group founded by influential vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy\u00a0Jr., scion of the American political dynasty, who recently was banned on Instagram because of his COVID-19 vaccine posts. Syndicated writer and vaccine skeptic Michelle Malkin reported Yeadon\u2019s concern about fertility in a column last month under the headline, \u201cPregnant Women: Beware of COVID Shots.\u201d And a blog with an alarmist headline \u2013 \u201cHead of Pfizer Research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization\u201d \u2013 was shared thousands of times on Facebook.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0pictured in 2016, was recently banned on Instagram because of his COVID-19 vaccine posts. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith\nThe visage and views of Yeadon, widely identified as an \u201cEx-VP of Pfizer,\u2019\u2019 can be seen on social media in languages including German, Portuguese, Danish and Czech. A Facebook post carries a video from November in which Yeadon claimed that the pandemic \u201cfundamentally\u2026 is over.\u201d The post has been viewed more than a million times.\nIn October, Yeadon wrote a column for the United Kingdom\u2019s Daily Mail newspaper that also appeared on MailOnline, one of the world\u2019s most-visited news websites. It declared that deaths caused by COVID-19, which then totaled about 45,000 in Britain, will soon \u201cfizzle out\u201d and Britons \u201cshould immediately be allowed to resume normal life.\u201d Since then, the disease has killed about another 80,000 people in the UK.\nYeadon isn\u2019t the only respected scientist to have challenged the scientific consensus on COVID-19 and expressed controversial views.\nMichael Levitt, a winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry, told the Stanford Daily last summer that he expected the pandemic would end in the United States in 2020 and kill no more than 175,000 Americans \u2013 a third of the current total \u2013 and \u201cwhen we come to look back, we\u2019re going to say that wasn\u2019t such a terrible disease.\u201d And Luc Montagnier, another Nobel Prize winner, said last year that he believed the coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab. Many experts doubt that, but so far there is no way to prove or disprove it.\nLevitt\u00a0told Reuters that his projections about the pandemic in the United States were wrong, but he still believes COVID-19 eventually won\u2019t be seen as \u201ca terrible disease\u201d and that lockdowns \u201ccaused a great deal of collateral damage and may not have been needed.\u201d Montagnier didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nWhat gives Yeadon particular credibility is the fact that he worked at Pfizer, says Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an organization that combats online misinformation. \u201cYeadon\u2019s background gives his dangerous and harmful messages false credibility.\u201d\nMichael Levitt, a winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry, believes COVID-19 eventually won\u2019t be seen as a terrible disease and that lockdowns \u201cmay not have been needed.\u201d REUTERS/Stephen Lam\nDr. Luc Montagnier, who won a Nobel Prize\u00a0for his part in discovering HIV, said last year he believes the coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\nIn a debate last fall in Britain\u2019s House of Commons about the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, parliamentarian Richard Drax called Yeadon an \u201ceminent\u201d scientist, and cited his view \u201cthat the virus is both manageable and nearing its end.\u201d Drax didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMore recently, David Kurten, a member of the London Assembly \u2013 an elected body \u2013 tweeted there is a \u201creal danger\u201d that COVID-19 vaccines could leave women infertile. \u201cThe \u2018cure\u2019 must not be worse than the \u2018disease\u2019,\u201d Kurten wrote. He, too, didn\u2019t\u00a0respond to a request for comment.\nWhy Yeadon transformed from mainstream scientist to COVID-19 vaccine skeptic remains a mystery. Thousands of his tweets stretching back to the start of the pandemic document a dramatic shift in his views \u2013 early on, he supported a vaccine strategy. But they offer few clues to explain his radical turnabout.\nSome former colleagues at Pfizer say they no longer recognize the Mike Yeadon they once knew. They described him as a knowledgeable and intelligent man who always insisted on seeing evidence and generally avoided publicity.\nOne of those ex-colleagues is Sterghios A. Moschos, who holds degrees in molecular biology and pharmaceutics. In December, Yeadon posted on Twitter a spoof sign that said, \u201cDITCH THE MASK.\u201d Moschos tweeted back: \u201cMike what hell\u00a0?! Are you out to actively kill people? You do realize\u00a0that if you are wrong, your suggestions will result in deaths ??\u201d\nA Twitter exchange between Michael Yeadon and a former Pfizer colleague from December 2020. Twitter/Screenshot\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all fade away\u201d\nYeadon joined Twitter in October 2018 and soon became a prolific user of the platform. The thousands of his tweets reviewed by Reuters were provided by archive.org, which stores web pages, and FollowersAnalysis, a social media analytics company.\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic reached the UK in March 2020, Yeadon initially expressed support for developing a vaccine. He tweeted: \u201cCovid 19 is not going away. Until we have a vaccine or herd immunity\u201d \u2013 natural resistance resulting from prior exposure to the virus \u2013 \u201call that can be done is to slow its spread.\u201d A week later he tweeted: \u201cA vaccine might be along towards the end of 2021, if we\u2019re really lucky.\u201d\nWhen a fellow Twitter user said vaccines \u201charm many, many people,\u201d Yeadon replied: \u201cOk, please refuse it, but do not impede its flow to neutrals or those keen to get it, thanks.\u201d\nAfter\u00a0Mathai Mammen, the global head of research & development for Janssen, the pharmaceutical division of Johnson & Johnson, posted on LinkedIn last summer that his company had started clinical trials of a vaccine, Yeadon responded: \u201cLovely to see this milestone, Mathai!\u201d Mammen didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nBut as early as April, Yeadon had begun voicing unorthodox views.\nWhile Britain was still in its first lockdown last spring, he declared: \u201cthere is nothing especially virulent or frightening about covid 19 \u2026 it\u2019ll all fade away \u2026 Just a common\u00a0& garden virus, to which the world overreacted.\u201d And he predicted in a subsequent tweet that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d the death toll in the UK would reach 40,000.\nBy September 2020, Yeadon\u2019s statements were attracting attention beyond Twitter. At the time, a movement had emerged in Britain against lockdowns and other restrictions meant to curb the disease. He co-authored a lengthy article on a website called Lockdown Sceptics. It declared that the \u201cpandemic as an event in the UK is essentially complete.\u201d And, \u201cThere is no biological principle that leads us to expect a second wave.\u201d Britain soon entered a much more deadly second wave.\nOn Oct. 16, he wrote another lengthy article for the same website: \u201cThere is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I\u2019ve never heard such nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccinate people who aren\u2019t at risk from a disease.\u201d\nIn November, Yeadon appeared in a 32-minute video for the anti-lockdown group, Unlocked, sitting in a shed with a motorbike behind him. A shorter version appeared on Facebook titled, \u201cThe pandemic is over.\u201d\nYeadon called for an end to mass testing and claimed that 30% of the population was already immune\u00a0to COVID-19 even before the pandemic started. By the time of the recording, he said, there was little scope for the virus to spread further in the UK because most people had already been infected or were immune.\nThose views ran counter to the findings of the World Health Organization. In December \u2013 nine months after declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic \u2013 the agency said testing suggested that less than 10% of the world\u2019s population had shown evidence of infection.\nYeadon\u2019s petition to the European Medicines Agency\u00a0to halt vaccine trials followed on Dec. 1. The agency didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment for this article.\nIn late 2020, Michael Yeadon co-authored a petition to the European Medicines Agency, a regulator, to halt COVID-19 vaccine trials. Above, the agency\u2019s headquarters in Amsterdam. REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\u201cThis does not sound like the guy I knew 20 years ago.\u201d\nMark Treherne, who worked with Michael Yeadon at Pfizer\nIt\u2019s impossible to measure the impact of Yeadon\u2019s claim that COVID-19 vaccines could cause female infertility. Anecdotally, though, many women have bought into it.\nBonnie Jacobson, a waitress in Brooklyn, New York, can\u2019t recall where she first heard about the fertility issue. But she told Reuters that it has made her hesitant to take a vaccine, as she\u2019d like to have children \u201csooner than later.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my main concern,\u201d she said. \u201cLet more research come out.\u201d After recently declining to get vaccinated, she said, the tavern where she worked fired her. Jacobson\u2019s employer didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nA good scientist\nAccording to Yeadon\u2019s LinkedIn profile, he joined Pfizer in 1995; \u00a0the company had a large operation then in Sandwich in southern England.\u00a0He rose to become a vice president and head of allergy and respiratory research.\nMany former colleagues say they are baffled by his transformation.\nMark Treherne, chairman of Talisman Therapeutics in Cambridge, England, said he overlapped with Yeadon at Pfizer for about two years and sometimes had coffee with him. \u201cHe always seemed knowledgeable, intelligible, a good scientist. We were both trained as pharmacologists \u2026 so we had something in common.\u201d\n\u201cI obviously disagree with Mike and his recent views,\u201d he said. Treherne\u2019s company is researching brain inflammation, which he said could be triggered by coronaviruses. \u201cThis does not sound like the guy I knew 20 years ago.\u201d\nMoschos, the ex-colleague who took issue with one of Yeadon\u2019s tweets, said he considered him a mentor when they worked together at the drugmaker from 2008 to 2011. More recently, Moschos has been researching whether it\u2019s possible to test for COVID-19 with breath samples. He said Yeadon\u2019s views are \u201ca huge disappointment.\u201d He recounted hearing Yeadon in a radio interview last year.\n\u201cThere was a tone in his voice that was nothing like I ever remembered of Mike,\u201d Moschos said. \u201cIt was very angry, very bitter.\u201d\nJohn LaMattina, a former president of Pfizer Global Research and Development, also knew Yeadon. \u201cHis group was very successful and discovered a number of compounds that entered early clinical development,\u201d LaMattina told Reuters in an email. He said Yeadon and his team were let go by Pfizer, however, when the company made the strategic decision to exit the therapeutic area they were researching.\nLaMattina said he had lost touch with Yeadon in recent years. Shown links to Yeadon\u2019s video declaring the pandemic over and a copy of his petition to halt COVID-19 clinical trials, LaMattina replied: \u201cThis is all news to me and a bit of a shock. This seems out of character for the person I knew.\u201d\nA Tweet posted by Michael Yeadon in May 2020. A second deadly wave of COVID-19 hit\u00a0the UK a few months later. Twitter/Screenshot\n\u201cChutzpah\u201d\nAfter losing his job at Pfizer in 2011, Yeadon set up a biotech company called Ziarco with three\u00a0Pfizer\u00a0colleagues. They wanted to continue researching promising therapies that targeted allergies and inflammatory diseases, ideas Pfizer had been developing but were at risk of being abandoned. Yeadon served as Ziarco\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cI simply showed chutzpah and asked the senior-most people up the research line\u201d at Pfizer to support the venture, Yeadon later recalled in an interview with Forbes. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018OK, assuming you raise private capital.\u2019\u201d\nIn 2012, Ziarco announced it had initially secured funding from several investors, including Pfizer\u2019s venture capital arm. Other investors later joined, including an Amgen Inc corporate venture capital fund. Amgen didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThe intensity of effort took me away almost completely from my family and other interests for almost five years and you get only one life,\u201d Yeadon told Forbes.\nOn Twitter, Yeadon said he is married and has two adult daughters, and described a tough childhood \u2013 he said his mother committed suicide when he was 18 months old and his father, a doctor, abandoned him when he was 16. He said he was saved by a local social worker and adopted by a Jewish family whose \u201copen handed love turned my life around.\u201d\nWhile at Ziarco, Yeadon also worked as a consultant for several years at two Boston-area biotech companies, Apellis Pharmaceuticals and Pulmatrix Inc. Both firms said he no longer advises them. A spokeswoman for Apellis said, \u201cHis views do not reflect those of Apellis.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate.\nAfter losing his job at Pfizer in 2011, Yeadon set up a biotech company called Ziarco. It was later bought by Swiss drugmaker Novartis. REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nThe hard work at Ziarco paid off. In January 2017, Novartis\u00a0acquired the company for an upfront payment of $325 million, with the promise of $95 million more if certain milestones were met, according to Novartis\u2019 2017 annual report. Novartis was betting on the promise of a Ziarco drug, known as ZPL389, that had the potential to be a \u201cfirst-in-class oral treatment for moderate-to-severe eczema,\u201d a common and sometimes debilitating rash.\nReuters wasn\u2019t able to determine how much money Yeadon made from Novartis\u2019 purchase of Ziarco. But in January 2020 he tweeted: \u201cOddly enough, I made millions from founding & growing a biotech company, creating many highly paid jobs, using my PhD & persuasion around the world.\u201d\nLast July, Novartis disclosed it had discontinued the ZPL389 clinical development program and had taken a $485 million write down. A Novartis spokesman said the company decided to terminate the program after disappointing efficacy data in an early-stage clinical trial.\n\u201cI\u2019ll soon be gone\u201d\nEarlier this year, a group of Yeadon\u2019s former Pfizer colleagues expressed their concern in a private letter, according to a draft reviewed by Reuters.\n\u201cWe have become acutely aware of your views on COVID-19\u00a0over the last few months \u2026 the single mindedness, lack of scientific rigour and one sided interpretation of often poor quality data is far removed from the Mike Yeadon we so respected and enjoyed working with.\u201d\nNoting his \u201cvast following on social media\u201d and that his claim about infertility \u201chas spread globally,\u201d the group wrote, \u201cWe are very worried that you are putting people\u2019s health at risk.\u201d\nReuters couldn\u2019t determine whether Yeadon received the letter.\nOn Feb. 3, Yeadon\u2019s Twitter account had a message for his 91,000 followers: \u201cA tweet recently appeared under my ID, which was horribly offensive. As a result my account was locked. I of course deleted it. I want you to know of course that I didn\u2019t write it.\u201d A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.\nYeadon didn\u2019t make clear what tweet he was referring to. But shortly after, several Twitter users and a blog called Zelo Street posted screenshots of numerous offensive anti-Muslim tweets from Yeadon\u2019s account from about a year ago. Many were captured at the time by archive.org.\nThe next day, on Feb. 4, Yeadon cryptically mentioned in a tweet, \u201cI\u2019ll soon be gone.\u201d\nTwo days later, he was off Twitter. His followers were greeted with this message: \u201cThis account doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d His LinkedIn profile also soon changed, now stating that he is\u00a0\u201cFully retired.\u201d\nClare Craig, a British pathologist, compared Yeadon\u2019s treatment on Twitter \u2013 where some users derided his views as nonsense and dangerous \u2013 to medieval societies burning heretics at the stake.\n\u201cThere is no other way to see it than the burning of the witches,\u201d said Craig, who has criticized lockdowns and COVID-19 tests. \u201cScience is always a series of questions and the testing of those questions and when we are not allowed to ask those questions, then science is lost.\u201d\nShe said she spoke to Yeadon after he closed his Twitter account. \u201cHe will have a think about how he will contribute in the future,\u201d she said.\nGraffiti on a shop in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Despite progress on early multidrug therapy for COVID-19 patients, the current mandate is to immunize the world population as quickly as possible. The lack of thorough testing in animals prior to clinical trials, and authorization based on safety data generated during trials that lasted less than 3.5 months, raise questions regarding the safety of these vaccines. The recently identified role of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein Spike for inducing endothelial damage characteristic of COVID-19, even in absence of infection, is extremely relevant given that most of the authorized vaccines induce the production of Spike glycoprotein in the recipients. Given the high rate of occurrence of adverse effects, and the wide range of types of adverse effects that have been reported to date, as well as the potential for vaccine-driven disease enhancement, Th2-immunopathology, autoimmunity, and immune evasion, there is a need for a better understanding of the benefits and risks of mass vaccination, particularly in the groups that were excluded in the clinical trials. Despite calls for caution, the risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been minimized or ignored by health organizations and government authorities. We appeal to the need for a pluralistic dialogue in the context of health policies, emphasizing critical questions that require urgent answers if we wish to avoid a global erosion of public confidence in science and public health.\nIntroduction\nSince COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, over 150 million cases and 3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Despite progress on early ambulatory, multidrug-therapy for high-risk patients, resulting in 85% reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization and death [1], the current paradigm for control is mass-vaccination. While we recognize the effort involved in development, production and emergency authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we are concerned that risks have been minimized or ignored by health organizations and government authorities, despite calls for caution [2-8].\nVaccines for other coronaviruses have never been approved for humans, and data generated in the development of coronavirus vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies show that they may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th2 immunopathology, regardless of the vaccine platform and delivery method [9-11]. Vaccine-driven disease enhancement in animals vaccinated against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is known to occur following viral challenge, and has been attributed to immune complexes and Fc-mediated viral capture by macrophages, which augment T-cell activation and inflammation [11-13].\nIn March 2020, vaccine immunologists and coronavirus experts assessed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine risks based on SARS-CoV-vaccine trials in animal models. The expert group concluded that ADE and immunopathology were a real concern, but stated that their risk was insufficient to delay clinical trials, although continued monitoring would be necessary [14]. While there is no clear evidence of the occurrence of ADE and vaccine-related immunopathology in volunteers immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [15], safety trials to date have not specifically addressed these serious adverse effects (SAE). Given that the follow-up of volunteers did not exceed 2-3.5 months after the second dose [16-19], it is unlikely such SAE would have been observed. Despite92 errors in reporting, it cannot be ignored that even accounting for the number of vaccines administered, according to the US Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System (VAERS), the number of deaths per million vaccine doses administered has increased more than 10-fold. We believe there is an urgent need for open scientific dialogue on vaccine safety in the context of large-scale immunization. In this paper, we describe some of the risks of mass vaccination in the context of phase 3 trial exclusion criteria and discuss the SAE reported in national and regional adverse effect registration systems. We highlight unanswered questions and draw attention to the need for a more cautious approach to mass vaccination.\nSARS-CoV-2 phase 3 trial exclusion criteria\nWith few exceptions, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials excluded the elderly [16-19], making it impossible to identify the occurrence of post-vaccination eosinophilia and enhanced inflammation in elderly people. Studies of SARS-CoV vaccines showed that immunized elderly mice were at particularly high risk of life-threatening Th2 immunopathology [9,20]. Despite this evidence and the extremely limited data on safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the elderly, mass-vaccination campaigns have focused on this age group from the start. Most trials also excluded pregnant and lactating volunteers, as well as those with chronic and serious conditions such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, autoimmunity, coagulopathies, cancer, and immune suppression [16-29], although these recipients are now being offered the vaccine under the premise of safety.\nAnother criterion for exclusion from nearly all trials was prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This is unfortunate as it denied the opportunity of obtaining extremely relevant information concerning post-vaccination ADE in people that already have anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies. To the best of our knowledge, ADE is not being monitored systematically for any age or medical condition group currently being administered the vaccine. Moreover, despite a substantial proportion of the population already having antibodies [21], tests to determine SARS-CoV-2-antibody status prior to administration of the vaccine are not conducted routinely.\nWill serious adverse effects from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines go unnoticed?\nCOVID-19 encompasses a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from very mild to severe pulmonary pathology and fatal multi-organ disease with inflammatory, cardiovascular, and blood coagulation dysregulation [22-24]. In this sense, cases of vaccine-related ADE or immunopathology would be clinically-indistinguishable from severe COVID-19 [25]. Furthermore, even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, Spike glycoprotein alone causes endothelial damage and hypertension in vitro and in vivo in Syrian hamsters by down-regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and impairing mitochondrial function [26]. Although these findings need to be confirmed in humans, the implications of this finding are staggering, as all vaccines authorized for emergency use are based on the delivery or induction of Spike glycoprotein synthesis. In the case of mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectorized vaccines, not a single study has examined the duration of Spike production in humans following vaccination. Under the cautionary principle, it is parsimonious to consider vaccine-induced Spike synthesis could cause clinical signs of severe COVID-19, and erroneously be counted as new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. If so, the true adverse effects of the current global vaccination strategy may never be recognized unless studies specifically examine this question. There is already non-causal evidence of temporary or sustained increases138 in COVID-19 deaths following vaccination in some countries (Fig. 1) and in light of Spike\u2019s pathogenicity, these deaths must be studied in depth to determine whether they are related to vaccination.\nUnanticipated adverse reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines\nAnother critical issue to consider given the global scale of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is autoimmunity. SARS-CoV-2 has numerous immunogenic proteins, and all but one of its immunogenic epitopes have similarities to human proteins [27]. These may act as a source of antigens, leading to autoimmunity [28]. While it is true that the same effects could be observed during natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, vaccination is intended for most of the world population, while it is estimated that only 10% of the world population has been infected by SARS-CoV-2, according to Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergencies at the World Health Organization. We have been unable to find evidence that any of the currently authorized vaccines screened and excluded homologous immunogenic epitopes to avoid potential autoimmunity due to pathogenic priming.\nSome adverse reactions, including blood-clotting disorders, have already been reported in healthy and young vaccinated people. These cases led to the suspension or cancellation of the use of adenoviral vectorized ChAdOx1-nCov-19 and Janssen vaccinesin some countries. It has now been proposed that vaccination with ChAdOx1-nCov-19 can result in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against Platelet factor-4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [29]. Unfortunately, the risk was overlooked when authorizing these vaccines, although adenovirus-induced thrombocytopenia has been known for more than a decade, and has been a consistent event with adenoviral vectors [30]. The risk of VITT would presumably be higher in those already at risk of blood clots, including women who use oral contraceptives [31], making it imperative for clinicians to advise their patients accordingly.\nAt the population level, there could also be vaccine-related impacts. SARS-CoV-2 is a fast-evolving RNA virus that has so far produced more than 40,000 variants [32,33] some of which affect the antigenic domain of Spike glycoprotein [34,35]. Given the high mutation rates, vaccine-induced synthesis of high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies could theoretically lead to suboptimal responses against subsequent infections by other variants in vaccinated individuals [36], a phenomenon known as \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d [37] or antigenic priming [38]. It is unknown to what extent mutations that affect SARS-CoV-2 antigenicity will become fixed during viral evolution [39], but vaccines could plausibly act as selective forces driving variants with higher infectivity or transmissibility. Considering the high similarity between known SARS-CoV-2 variants, this scenario is unlikely [32,34] but if future variants were to differ more in key epitopes, the global vaccination strategy might have helped shape an even more dangerous virus. This risk has recently been brought to the attention of the WHO as an open letter [40].\nDiscussion\nThe risks outlined here are a major obstacle to continuing global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Evidence on the safety of all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is needed before exposing more people to the184 risk of these experiments, since releasing a candidate vaccine without time to fully understand the resulting impact on health could lead to an exacerbation of the current global crisis [41]. Risk-stratification of vaccine recipients is essential. According to the UK government, people below 60 years of age have an extremely low risk of dying from COVID-191 187 . However, according to Eudravigillance, most of the serious adverse effects following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination occur in people aged 18-64. Of particular concern is the planned vaccination schedule for children aged 6 years and older in the United States and the UK. Dr. Anthony Fauci recently anticipated that teenagers across the country will be vaccinated in the autumn and younger children in early 2022, and the UK is awaiting trial results to commence vaccination of 11 million children under 18. There is a lack of scientific justification for subjecting healthy children to experimental vaccines, given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that they have a 99.997% survival rate if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Not only is COVID-19 irrelevant as a threat to this age group, but there is no reliable evidence to support vaccine efficacy or effectiveness in this population or to rule out harmful side effects of these experimental vaccines. In this sense, when physicians advise patients on the elective administration of COVID-19 vaccination, there is a great need to better understand the benefits and risk of administration, particularly in understudied groups.\nIn conclusion, in the context of the rushed emergency-use-authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and the current gaps in our understanding of their safety, the following questions must be raised:\nIs it known whether cross-reactive antibodies from previous coronavirus infections or vaccine206 induced antibodies may influence the risk of unintended pathogenesis following vaccination with COVID-19?\nHas the specific risk of ADE, immunopathology, autoimmunity, and serious adverse reactions been clearly disclosed to vaccine recipients to meet the medical ethics standard of patient understanding for informed consent? If not, what are the reasons, and how could it be implemented?\nWhat is the rationale for administering the vaccine to every individual when the risk of dying from COVID-19 is not equal across age groups and clinical conditions and when the phase 3 trials excluded the elderly, children and frequent specific conditions?\nWhat are the legal rights of patients if they are harmed by a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? Who will cover the costs of medical treatment? If claims were to be settled with public money, has the public been made aware that the vaccine manufacturers have been granted immunity, and their responsibility to compensate those harmed by the vaccine has been transferred to the tax-payers?\nIn the context of these concerns, we propose halting mass-vaccination and opening an urgent pluralistic, critical, and scientifically-based dialogue on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among scientists, medical doctors, international health agencies, regulatory authorities, governments, and vaccine developers. This is the only way to bridge the current gap between scientific evidence and public health policy regarding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We are convinced that humanity deserves a deeper understanding of the risks than what is currently touted as the official position. An open scientific dialogue is urgent and indispensable to avoid erosion of public confidence in science and public health and to ensure that the WHO and national health authorities protect the interests of humanity during the current pandemic. Returning public health policy to evidence-based medicine, relying on a careful evaluation of the relevant scientific research, is urgent. It is imperative to follow the science.\n1 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-reported-sars-cov-2-deaths-in-england/covid-19-confirmed-deaths-in-england-report\nConflict of Interest Statement\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\nReferences\nRead more \u2026.\nhttps://newsvoice.se/2021/05/57-scientists-study-covid-vaccinations/\nIf you like our work, please consider to donate:\nDonate Crypto\n_______________________________\nIf you are looking for solutions (lawyer, form, gathering, action, antidote, treatments, maybe this could help you:\nHERE\nIf you want to fight back better:\nhttps://childrenshealthdefense.org/child-health-topics/health-freedom/defender-days-sticker-gallery/\nFind the others: www.freedomcells.org\nwww.thegreaterreset.org\nShare this:\nLoading...\nRelated\nrightsfreedoms May 11, 2021 Uncategorized coronavirus, covid, doctors, global distribution, medicos por la verdad, sars, scientist, stop vaccinations, vaccination, vaccine\nPrevious Post\nNext Post\nJABBED \u2013 The Covid-19 Vaccine \u2013 Your questions\u00a0answered!\nThanks for they research, and whilling for more good and real informaci\u00f3n.\nb\nLiked by\nWe are being forced at mercy to take the vaccine  or we will be fired II go against the vaccine the vaccine what is there that we can do\nAnonymous\nLawsuits.

Examples:  Vitamin D, get your blood serum vitamin d level to 50 ng/ml.  Nobody is in the ICU at this lever.  80% vitamin D deficient in ICU.  An ivermectin protocol right after testing positive for Covid-19 helped clear out hospitals in Mexico in Jan 2021.  Then same thing happened in states in India that chose to use it.this summer.  US government and big pharma have to make sure no early treatments are known to protect their emergency Use authorization for vaccines.  It is illegal if a safe effective alternative exists.

How to rationally accommodate both sources of variation into properly exhaustive scientific studies that accurately convey the uncertainties of the ITC and can be applied in a robust policy framework tied explicitly to risk and safety metrics is well known from other regulated scientific fields (e.g., design of nuclear facilities for natural hazards considering the considerable randomness in hazardous events and uncertainties among the earth scientists and engineers).\nUnfortunately, the process of pursuing multiple expert inputs needed to reasonably anticipate all possible COVID vaccine failure modes (side effects, inefficacies, etc.) has apparently been (and is yet being) thrown out the window in the case of governmental/political/social entities exercising their power (and views in favor of what I\u2019ll call \u201cpower/forced-consensus  science\u201d) in imposing COVID-19 mandates, their risk-mitigation measures and their related (and consequentially flawed) policies.\nWhat we have seen occur in relationship to many COVID policies looks to definitely not be the rational pursuit of science and the proper application of science in policy making.\nThe proper analysis, using many experts to develop the epistemic uncertainties, can certainly be done \u2026 and the article above suggests it should/must be done to truly manage public risk and safety properly and rationally.  The key questions are: when will it be done?; and how severe will the societal cost become? \u2026from application of (faux/forced) science and policy and power versus true science, which has to involve the freedom of exchange of informed views among the relevant ITCs in order to accurately assess uncertainties and account for these in truly rational and beneficial policy.\nLiked by 1 person\nPeter A.

Then inject the same healthy cell with a covid-19 vaccine shot. After watch what happens to the shape an color of the once healthy Cell. Obviously, after giving it some time an understanding what a sick cell looks like . Then draw your own conclusions. This is considered a experimental drug an we are the test rats .After looking under the microscope you will see why the trademark secret ingredients.  Are not required to be listed because ,it\u2019s not healthy for the white blood cells. Trust your eyes an common sense.  Then ask why is there a need to hide ingredients of a experimental covid vaccine. By simply calling it a trademark secret. For me common since is you should know everything you\u2019re putting in your body. Unfortunately, not to many people have any an only do as there told . Without reading an researching anything . So, they can come to there own educated conclusions . Maybe, try something like Vitamin D , Zinc, Quercetin, Vitamin C , Ivermecton . Why not try something natural at a high safe dose. Especially, if there\u2019s plenty of research an information to show its a healthier option . For me my common since, wisdom, an strength comes from all types of research. This for me starts with my personal faith in my Lord an Savior Jesus Christ. Everyone, has there own opinions an I respect there choice to choose. Even though it\u2019s not mine do my personal research into my faith in Jesus Christ . I\u2019ve always found it strange how people believe in air that they can\u2019t see. And won\u2019t believe in Jesus who died on the cross for there sins. Then rose from the dead to save us. If we only believe an ask for forgiveness of our sins. As we also forgive others of there sins, against us. It may sound strange but, believe or not your free choice. I know JESUS is real for me. Just like I know air is real. Even though I haven\u2019t seen the breath of life. I know that without it.

Writing for Science Magazine, Meredith Wadman summarized a massive research study 1 in Israel that proves natural immunity is superior to immunity from vaccines.\nThe new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which\nenrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at\nKSM, the system\u2019s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that\npeople who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the\nfirst half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated\npeople who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis,\ncomparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing\nsymptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk\nof hospitalization eight times higher. 2\n2. Indeed, studies have shown that \u201c\u2018[i]ndividuals who have recovered from COVID-19\nhave a substantially lower risk of reinfection with SARS-Cov-2.\u201d 3 The NIH confirms this. In a\nstudy funded by NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and\nNational Cancer Institute (NCI), Daniela Weiskopf analyzed immune cells and antibodies from\nalmost 200 people exposed SARS-CoV-2 and recovered. She said \u201cour studies showed that\nnatural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses last.\u201d 4\n3. The natural immunity from COVID-19 is robust and long-lasting. Researchers opine that\nthe natural immunity from COVID-19 should last a lifetime.\nFor SARS-CoV, a coronavirus very like SARS-CoV-2 that was originally\nidentified in 2003 and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the\ncontinued presence of high concentrations of neutralizing antibodies in blood\nserum for more than 17 years was reported in 2020. Wang and colleagues\u2019 results\nsuggest that long-term immunity might also be expected for SARS-CoV-2. 5\n4. A recent Emory University study debunked the common myth that natural immunity to\nCOVID-19 (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) wanes quickly, leaving the person subject to reinfection.\nLast fall, there were reports that antibodies wane quickly after infection with the\nvirus that causes COVID-19, and mainstream media interpreted that to mean that\nimmunity was not long-lived,\u201d said senior author Ali Ellebedy, PhD, an associate\nprofessor of pathology & immunology, of medicine and of molecular\nmicrobiology. \u201cBut that\u2019s a misinterpretation of the data. It\u2019s normal for antibody\nlevels to go down after acute infection, but they don\u2019t go down to zero; they\nplateau. Here, we found antibody-producing cells in people 11 months after first\nsymptoms. These cells will live and produce antibodies for the rest of people\u2019s\nlives. That\u2019s strong evidence for long-lasting immunity.\u201d 6\n5. A study conducted at the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis found that even\n\u201cmild cases of COVID-19 leave those infected with lasting antibody protection and that repeated\nbouts of illness are likely to be uncommon.\u201d 7 Another study concluded that substantial immune\nmemory is generated after natural infection with COVID-19. 8\n6. The CDC and the Pharmaceutical companies have a problem because there are increasing\nnumbers of vaccinated persons suffering what the CDC calls breakthrough COVID-19 infections\n(which are actually ADE). So the CDC has announced a booster shot program. The CDC states\nthat \u201cwith the Delta variant, public health experts are starting to see reduced protection against\nmild and moderate disease. For that reason, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n(HHS) is planning for a booster shot so vaccinated people maintain protection over the coming\nmonths.\u201d 9 In reality, it is the COVID-19 that is causing hospitalizations and deaths from ADE.\nThe booster shots will continue the deadly cycle.\n7. It would seem, therefore, common sense that there would be no need for a person to be\nvaccinated if he has been infected with COVID-19 and already has a robust natural immunity to\nthe virus.  It is especially nonsensical for such persons to be vaccinated in light of the fact that the\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be ineffective. But that is not the guidance being given\nby Dr. Fauci and the CDC. The CDC provides the following advice on its website:\nIf I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated\nwith a COVID-19 vaccine?\nYes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had\nCOVID-19. 10\n8. The CDC relied on a single research study 11 in giving that advice. That research study is\nfull of holes. The CDC represents the study as meaning \u201cthat people get better protection by\nbeing fully vaccinated compared with having had COVID-19.\u201d 12 But the study is a retrospective\nstudy that relies on the accuracy of the records in databases. There was no validation of the data.\nOne significant problem with the survey goes to the heart of its conclusions regarding the\ninfection rate. The study states that \u201creinfection was not confirmed through whole genome\nsequencing, which would be necessary to definitively prove that the reinfection was caused from\na distinct virus relative to the first infection.\u201d 13 Without that confirmation, the study scientists are\nleft to merely guess that \u201creinfection is the most likely explanation.\u201d 14 Guessing is not science.\nAnd it seems that they guessed wrong because the study from Israel impeaches their results.\n9. It is pointless to vaccinate someone who has already been infected with COVID-19 (a.k.a.\nSARS-CoV-2) and has developed a natural immune response. It is also dangerous. Dr. Hooman\nNoorchashm, is an accomplished surgeon and staunch supporter of the new COVID vaccines,\nstates that vaccinating persons with COVID-19 is dangerous if that person has already contracted\nCOVID-19 and has the antibodies for the virus. 15 He has written to the FDA and advised that\nthere should be screening to prevent those who have already contracted COVID-19 from being\nvaccinated. He stated that such persons are in danger of injury or death from the vaccine. Megan\nRedshaw, reporting for The Defender, reveals:\nAccording to Noorchashm, it is scientifically established that once a person is\nnaturally infected by a virus, antigens from that virus persist in the body for a long\ntime after viral replication has stopped and clinical signs of infection have\nresolved. When a vaccine reactivates an immune response in a recently infected\nperson, the tissues harboring the persisting viral antigen are targeted, inflamed and\ndamaged by the immune response. 16\n10. Dr. Noorchashm explains:\n\u201cIn the case of SARS-CoV-2, we know that the virus naturally infects the heart,\nthe inner lining of blood vessels, the lungs and the brain,\u201d explained Noorchasm.\n\u201cSo, these are likely to be some of the critical organs that will contain persistent\nviral antigens in the recently infected \u2014 and, following reactivation of the\nimmune system by a vaccine, these tissues can be expected to be targeted and\ndamaged.\u201d 17\n11. Dr. Noorchashm states: \u201cIt is my professional opinion as an immunologist and\nphysician that this indiscriminate vaccination is a clear and present danger to a subset of\nthe already infected.\u201d 18 That opinion is coming from a doctor who is an advocate in favor of the\nCOVID-19 vaccines.\n12. The CDC recommends vaccinations of persons who already have natural immunity to\nCOVID-19. But both Moderna 19 and Pfizer-BiNTech 20 performed Serological tests on all trial\nparticipants to specifically screen out those with COVID-19 natural immunity. Those persons\nnecessarily had been infected previously with COVID-19 and had thus developed natural\nimmunity. They were excluded from particpating in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. If the\nargument is that the COVID-19 vaccine enhances natural immunity, that group would be the\nideal group with which to test that hypothesis. The CDC knew that group was not tested and yet\nstill recommends the vaccination of that same group. But if persons with natural immunity are\nsusceptible to a cytokine storm caused by an immediate ADE reaction, as Dr. Hooman\nNoorchashm has opined, such a group would reveal the danger posed to the naturally immune\npopulation. Arguably, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech ensured that would not happen by\ndisqualifying all persons with serological tests that showed that the persons already had natural\nimmunity.\n13. Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), an award-winning scientist, said that the CDC is\nproviding misinformation to the public by recommending that those who have already recovered\nfrom COVID-19 should still be vaccinated. Massie told the CDC that their report alleging the\nefficacy of vaccinating those who already had COVID-19 immunity was flat wrong. How did the\nCDC respond to Massie\u2019s objection? Megan Redshaw reports:\nMassie contacted officials at the CDC about the misinformation. They\nacknowledged it was false, but instead of correcting it, tried to rephrase their\nmistake. Massie and other scientists said the new wording still wrongly implies\nvaccines work in people who previously had COVID.\n\u201cAnd instead of fixing it, they proposed repeating it and just phrasing their\nmistake differently. So, at that point, right now I consider it a lie. I think the\nCDC is lying about the efficacy of the vaccine based on the Pfizer trials, for\nthose who have already had the coronavirus,\u201d 21 Massie said. (emphasis added)\n14. The CDC is knowingly and intentionally lying to the American people and advising those\nwho already have a natural immunity to COVID-19 to nonetheless be vaccinated. It is ineffective\nand dangerous for a person who has natural immunity to COVID-19 to be vaccinated against it.\nThe CDC acknowledges that their advice is wrong, but they are continuing with it.\n15. Why is the CDC recommending COVID-19 vaccinations that have now been proven to\nbe ineffective? Whatever immunity they offer is temporary. Because of their short-lived\neffectiveness, the CDC is starting a booster shot program. With that in mind, the CDC advises\nthose who have a natural immunity that is robust and long-lasting to receive a COVID-19\nvaccine. It makes no sense to advise the injection of a vaccine that has been proven to offer only\nshort-duration benefit (if any) to a person who already has lifelong immunity. There is something\nelse at play here other than the health of the citizens. It is like handing an umbrella to a skydiver\nwith a parachute strapped to his back and telling him the umbrella will slow his descent.  The\nCOVID-19 vaccines (like the umbrella) do more harm than good for someone with natural\nimmunity.  The primary agenda of the CDC seems to be the vaccination of American citizens and\nnot their good health.\n16. The Israeli COVID-19 study was published on August 26, 2021. 22 The study was\nworldwide news among epidemiologists. But, on September 9, 2021, when he was asked about\nthe study, Dr. Anthony Fauci feigned ignorance of its implications. Dr. Fauci is the Director of\nthe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Dr. Fauci is alleged to be \u201cthe\nnation\u2019s top infectious disease expert\u201d 23 and \u201cone of the world\u2019s leading clinicians and\nresearchers on the pathogenesis and treatment of immune-mediated diseases.\u201d 24 Dr. Fauci is also\na member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. But he did not have an answer to the\nstudy that made worldwide news in the scientific community proving that natural immunity to\nCOVID-19 was superior to vaccinated immunity. Let us read the exchange between Dr. Sanjay\nGupta, the CNN Chief Medical Correspondent and Dr. Fauci:\nGUPTA: And just real quickly, there was a study that came out of Israel about\nnatural immunity, and basically, the headline was that natural immunity provides\na lot of protection, even better than the vaccines alone. What do people make of\nthat? So as we talk about vaccine mandates, I get calls all the time, people say,\nI\u2019ve already had COVID, I\u2019m protected. And now the study says maybe even more\nprotected than the vaccine alone. Should they also get the vaccine? How do you\nmake the case to them?\nFAUCI: You know, that\u2019s a really good point, Sanjay. I don\u2019t have a really firm\nanswer for you on that. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to discuss\nregarding the durability of the response. The one thing that paper from Israel\ndidn\u2019t tell you is whether or not as high as the protection is with natural infection,\nwhat\u2019s the durability compared to the durability of a vaccine? So it is conceivable\nthat you got infected, you\u2019re protected, but you may not be protected for an\nindefinite period of time. So, I think that is something that we need to sit down\nand discuss seriously, because you very appropriately pointed out, it is an issue,\nand there could be an argument for saying what you said. 25\n17. Dr. Fauci, \u201cthe nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert,\u201d 26 does not know what to say about\na study that confirms the well-known fact that natural immunity is superior to vaccinated\nimmunity. All of the questions he raised about the study are answered in numerous other studies\nand research proving robust and long-lasting protection from natural immunity. Juxtaposing that\nresearch against the data showing the short-lived COVID-19 vaccine immunity that requires\nbooster shots and the answers to his questions are ineluctable. He is an epidemiological expert.\nHe must already have known the answers to his own questions. His questions were a\nsmokescreen. Dr. Fauci is feigning ignorance of the Israeli study\u2019s implications because the study\nimpeaches the CDC protocol calling for the vaccination of those with natural immunity.\n18. Compare Dr. Fauci\u2019s response to the Israeli study to that of Former FDA Commissioner\nScott Gottlieb, a Pfizer board member. Although Gottlieb\u2019s opinion is decidedly against the\npecuniary interests of Pfizer, Gottlieb had little trouble acknowledging that the Israeli study\nshowed that natural immunity confers durable protection from COVID-19.\n\u201cThe balance of the evidence demonstrates that natural immunity confers a\ndurable protection,\u201d Gottlieb said during an Aug. 30 interview, referring to a\nlandmark new preprint Israeli study that found that prior COVID-19 infection\nconfers more protection against the virus than any of the vaccines. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to\nconclude that.\u201d 27\n19. In September 2021, a New York attorney, Elizabeth Brehm from the law firm Siri &\nGlimstead, sent a Freedom of Information request to the CDC asking for \u201c[d]ocuments reflecting\nany documented case of an individual who: (1) never received a COVID-19 vaccine; (2) was\ninfected with COVID-19 once, recovered, and then later became infected again; and (3)\ntransmitted SARS-CoV-2 to another person when reinfected.\u201d 28\n20. The CDC responded to that request by revealing that \u201c[a] search of our records failed to\nreveal any documents pertaining to your request. The CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC)\nconveyed that this information is not collected.\u201d 29\n21. The CDC makes two revealing admissions. They acknowledge that they do not have any\ndata indicating that natural immunity is inadequate protection. And, more revealing, they\ndivulged that they don\u2019t collect that information. Thus, the CDC confessed that they don\u2019t care to\nknow the effectiveness of natural immunity. The CDC simply does not care whether innate\nimmunity to COVID-19 protects the person or others with whom the person comes in contact.\n22. Yet, acting out of willful ignorance, the CDC recommends that a person who has already\nbeen infected by COVID-19, who has recovered and has natural immunity, still needs to be\nvaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. But the CDC does not know if that advice is correct, nor\nit seems does it care. Aaron Siri, the named partner in the law firm that made the FOIA request of\nthe CDC, explained the significance of the CDC\u2019s admissions:\nYou would assume that if the CDC was going to crush the civil and individual\nrights of those with natural immunity by having them expelled from school, fired\nfrom their jobs, separated from the military, and worse, the CDC would have\nproof of at least one instance of an unvaccinated, naturally immune individual\ntransmitting the COVID-19 virus to another individual.  If you thought this, you\nwould be wrong.\nMy firm, on behalf of ICAN, asked the CDC for precisely this proof (see below). \nICAN wanted to see proof of any instance in which someone who previously had\nCOVID-19 became reinfected with and transmitted the virus to someone else. \nThe CDC\u2019s incredible response is that it does not have a single document\nreflecting that this has ever occurred.  Not one.\nIn contrast, there are endless documents reflecting cases of vaccinated individuals\nbecoming infected with and transmitting the virus to others. Such as this study. 30 And this study. 31 And this study. 32 And this study. 33 It goes on and on\u2026\nBut it gets worse.  The CDC\u2019s excuse for not having a shred of evidence of the\nnaturally immune transmitting the virus is that \u201cthis information is not collected.\u201d \nWhat?!  No proof!  But yet the CDC is actively crushing the rights of millions of\nnaturally immune individuals in this country if they do not get the vaccine on the\nassumption they can transmit the virus.  But despite clear proof the vaccinated\nspread the virus, the CDC lifts restrictions on the vaccinated?!  That is dystopian.\nThe facts about natural immunity are simple. Every single peer reviewed study has\nfound that the naturally immune have far greater than 99% protection from having\nCOVID-19, and this immunity does not wane. In contrast, the COVID-19 vaccine\nprovides, at best, 95% protection and this immunity wanes rapidly. I am no\nmathematician, but a constant 99% seems preferable to a 95% that quickly drops. \nAnd, while the vaccinated readily transmit the virus, not so for the naturally\nimmune.\nThe lesson yet again is not that health authorities should never make mistakes. \nThey will. It happens. The lesson is that civil and individual rights should never\nbe contingent upon a medical procedure. Everyone, the naturally immune or\notherwise, who wants to get vaccinated and boosted should be free to do so. But\nnobody should be coerced by the government to partake in any medical procedure.\n23. George Orwell explained: \u201cAll tyrannies rule through fraud and force, but once the fraud\nis exposed, they must rely exclusively on force.\u201d The fraud behind the unsafe and ineffective \nCOVID-19 vaccines is increasingly being exposed. Since so many people are not being tricked\nby the fraud, the government is resorting to its only remaining option, force. And that explains\nPresident Biden\u2019s edict for federal workers to get vaccinated.\nEndnotes\n1\nSivan Gazit, et. al., Comparing SARS-CoV-2 Natural Immunity to Vaccine-Inducted\nImmunity: Reinfections Versus Breakthrough Infections, August 25, 2021,\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/521947447/2021-08-24-21262415v1-full#from_embed.

When you\u2019ve been vaccinated against a specific disease, you can gain protection \u2014 or immunity \u2014 against it.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has, to date, given emergency use authorization to two vaccines against the virus that causes COVID-19. These vaccines are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Johnson & Johnson has also applied for emergency use authorization by the FDA for their single-dose vaccine.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is a vital tool in the effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. But, you may be wondering about the safety of the vaccine as well as its potential short- and long-term side effects.\nIn this article we\u2019ll dig into what\u2019s known about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine, the possible side effects, and how the vaccine works to protect you from becoming ill.\nHow Safe is the COVID-19 Vaccine?\nThe COVID-19 vaccines were developed faster than most. But no corners were cut regarding the science.\n0 seconds of 59 seconds Volume 0%\nHow were the COVID-19 vaccines able to be developed so fast?\nVaccine development typically takes many years. However, COVID-19 vaccines have been developed in a short amount of time.\nIn fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are over 200 potential COVID-19 vaccines in development as of December 2020. At least 52 of these have entered clinical trials in humans.\nHow were these able to be developed so quickly? Below, we\u2019ll take a look at how this was achieved.\nScientific collaboration\nAs soon as the new coronavirus was identified and its genetic material was sequenced, scientists around the world began studying it in earnest. Along the way, they shared important research results with other scientists.\nThis high level of cooperation helped to better distribute valuable knowledge throughout the scientific and medical community about the virus itself, how it causes illness, and potential vaccination and treatment methods.\nExisting research\nThe technology that went into the COVID-19 vaccine may seem new. However, it\u2019s actually been around for some time. Scientists have been studying new ways to make vaccines for many years now.\nThis includes mRNA vaccines like those made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. In fact, prior to the pandemic, scientists had been studying this method as a way to make vaccines for other viruses.\nThis existing research gave scientists an important head start for developing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.\nFunding\nVaccine development is very costly. One of the main reasons for this is that it requires an abundance of testing for both effectiveness and safety. When a vaccine enters human clinical trials, these costs begin to expand rapidly.\nThree different phases of clinical trials must show safety and effectiveness before a vaccine can be authorized or approved. As these trials progress, the number of participants grows and so do the costs.\nEarly in the pandemic, funding was poured into the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This funding, which came from both public and private sources, allowed companies to effectively conduct the necessary vaccine research and clinical trials.\nTimeline acceleration\nNormally, the stages of vaccine development and testing occur one after the other. For example, a phase 2 clinical trial would only proceed after a phase 1 trial had been completed. This can take a lot of time.\nDuring the pandemic, some of these timelines were accelerated in order to shorten development time.\nAdditionally, companies scaled up the manufacturing of their vaccines while they performed clinical trials.\nThis is a large financial risk for these companies, as data could show that their vaccine isn\u2019t effective or safe, leading them to scrap the vaccine altogether. However, if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a ready supply of doses is on hand, as was the case for the current vaccines.\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed is the fact that all COVID-19 vaccines still need to undergo rigorous testing protocols aimed at determining their effectiveness and safety. Although development is sped up, accelerated timelines don\u2019t compromise scientific standards or integrity.\nCompanies must still present solid data from human clinical trials to the FDA that shows a vaccine is both safe and effective. Additionally, vaccine safety continues to be monitored after authorization or approval.\nWhat exactly is an emergency use authorization?\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are currently authorized by the FDA under an emergency use authorization (EUA). This is different from an FDA approval.\nEUA is a way for the FDA to allow unapproved medical products to be used during a public health emergency, such as a pandemic. In reviewing for EUA, the FDA must determine that the benefits of a product outweigh its potential risks.\nWhen a company submits for EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA expects to see safety and effectiveness data from a phase 3 clinical trial. The trial can still be in progress as long as it has met specific milestones determined by the FDA.\nOnce received, FDA scientists as well as an external advisory panel made up of scientists and public health experts, will carefully go over the data. The FDA will take both the internal and advisory panel reviews into consideration when deciding to grant an EUA.\nWhat\u2019s known about the short-term effects of the vaccine?\nThe short-term side effects of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are similar. The side effects typically start within a day or two of getting the vaccine and may include:\npain, redness, or swelling at the injection site\nfatigue\nfever\nchills\nheadache\nbody aches and pains\nnausea\nswollen lymph nodes\nIt\u2019s pretty normal to feel mild symptoms like those described above after getting a vaccine. Although it can be unpleasant, it\u2019s actually a good sign. It means that your body is in the process of generating an immune response.\nWhile these side effects can be unpleasant, they\u2019re typically mild or moderate and go away after a few days.\nSide effects that are felt throughout your body, such as fatigue and fever, are more common after getting the second dose.\nSerious short-term side effects\nAlthough rare, some people have experienced more serious short-term side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. These side effects include immediate allergic reactions and a severe type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.\nImmediate allergic reactions typically occur within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine and can include symptoms like:\nhives\nwheezing\nswelling\nAnaphylaxis typically happens shortly after receiving the vaccine. Symptoms to look out for include:\nhives\nswelling\ntrouble breathing\ntightening of the throat\nfeeling dizzy or faint\nabdominal pain\nnausea or vomiting\ndiarrhea\na rapid heartbeat\nlow blood pressure (hypotension)\na feeling of doom\nAfter getting the COVID-19 vaccine, you will likely be monitored for at least 15 minutes afterwards to make sure you don\u2019t develop any serious side effects.\nHEALTHLINE RESOURCES\nUntil you get through this, count on our support\nIn difficult times, you need to be able to turn to experts who understand and can help strengthen your mental well-being. We\u2019re here for you.\nREAD MORE\nWhat\u2019s known about the long-term effects of the vaccine?\nBecause the COVID-19 vaccines have only been administered in the United States since December 2020, the long-term effects are unknown at this time.\nEven though people have begun to receive these vaccines, studies will continue to evaluate their safety and effectiveness long into the future. These studies will also focus on how long the immunity lasts from the vaccines.\nCan you get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\nYou cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. Neither the Pfizer-BioNTech nor the Moderna vaccine contain the live virus. Because of this, it cannot cause you to become ill with COVID-19.\nBoth vaccines use mRNA technology to generate an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.\nWhat exactly is mRNA?\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines consist of a piece of genetic material called mRNA. Simply put, mRNA provides the cells of your body with instructions on how to make proteins.\nIn fact, mRNA occurs naturally in your body. Your cells use mRNA all the time to produce many types of proteins that are necessary for your health and well-being.\nThe mRNA in the COVID-19 vaccine contains instructions for making a viral protein called the spike protein. This is a protein that\u2019s found on the surface of the novel coronavirus. The virus uses it to attach to and enter a host cell in your body.\nWhen you receive the vaccine, your body will recognize the spike protein as an invader. Because of this, it will produce antibodies to protect you against the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein.\nWhat happens when the vaccine is injected?\nAfter you receive your Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the mRNA can enter the cells in your body. These cells begin to produce the spike protein, displaying it on their surface.\nCells from your immune system will notice these spike proteins and recognize them as foreign. Because of this, your immune system will begin building an immune response to the spike protein, which includes the production of antibodies.\nIf the antibodies produced by your immune system then come across the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, they\u2019ll recognize it as an invader and will be able to destroy it before it causes you to become ill. In other words, your immune system will be primed and ready to fight off and neutralize the actual virus once you get the vaccine.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that it typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for your body to build up immunity. Because of this, you could be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 right before or right after getting the vaccine and still become sick.\nEffectiveness\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that no vaccine is 100 percent effective. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95 percent effective 7 days after the second dose. The Moderna vaccine is 94.1 percent effective 14 days after the second dose. After vaccination, it\u2019s important to continue practicing precautions such as mask wearing, physical distancing, and handwashing.\nCan the vaccine change your DNA?\nYou may have heard concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine affecting your DNA. This isn\u2019t possible.\nYour DNA is contained within a special part of your cells called the nucleus. The nucleus is separated from other areas of the cell.\nThe mRNA that your cells naturally produce every day is made within the nucleus, but is promptly transported outside of the nucleus to be translated into protein. After the protein is made, the mRNA is destroyed.\nLikewise, the mRNA from the COVID-19 vaccine will remain outside of the nucleus. It will also be destroyed after the spike protein has been made.\nWho should avoid getting the vaccine?\nSome people should avoid getting the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. This includes anyone who\u2019s had:\neither a prior severe or immediate allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine\neither a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of the vaccine\na previous allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccine, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna provide full ingredient lists on their fact sheets for recipients and caregivers.\nCan children get the vaccine?\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are currently only authorized for use in people 16 and older, and 18 and older, respectively. More clinical trials are beginning or are planned for younger children.\nShould people with underlying health conditions get the vaccine?\nIf you have underlying health conditions, you can get the vaccine. In fact, this is particularly important because some health conditions can put you at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 complications.\nCurrently, the only exception to this is if you\u2019ve had a serious or immediate allergic reaction to one or more ingredients in the vaccine. In this case, you should avoid getting the vaccine.\nIf you have an underlying health condition and have questions about receiving the vaccine, be sure to speak with your healthcare provider.\nShould you get the vaccine if you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding?\nYou can receive the vaccine if you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding. If you have questions or concerns about getting the vaccine, talk with your healthcare provider.\nShould you still get the vaccine if you\u2019ve had COVID-19 and is it safe?\nYou may be wondering if you still need to get the vaccine if you\u2019ve already had COVID-19. The answer to this question is yes.\nScientists currently don\u2019t know how long natural immunity lasts after having COVID-19. Research on this topic is ongoing. A 2021 study of 188 people who had recovered from COVID-19 found markers of immunity up to 8 months after infection.\nInstances of repeat infection have so far only been documented in casestudies. However, this does mean that it\u2019s possible to contract the virus and become ill a second time. Vaccination can help prevent this from happening.\nCurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that certain people who\u2019ve had COVID-19 wait 90 days before getting the vaccine. This includes those that were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nDo you still need to take precautions after getting the vaccine?\nIf you\u2019ve already received the COVID-19 vaccine, you\u2019ll still need to take precautions, such as:\nwearing a mask when around others outside of your household\npracticing physical distancing\nfrequent handwashing\navoiding crowded areas or indoor spaces that are poorly ventilated\nThese precautions are necessary because scientists don\u2019t yet know if you can still transmit the virus to others after you\u2019ve been vaccinated.\nIt\u2019s possible that this could happen if you\u2019re exposed to the virus following vaccination, even if you don\u2019t actually become sick or have any typical symptoms of COVID-19.\nUsing v-safe after vaccination\nV-safe is a tool that\u2019s been developed by the CDC. It uses text messages and web surveys sent to your phone to help you check in after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\nYou can use v-safe to let the CDC know about any side effects you may be experiencing. Based off of your survey answers, someone from the CDC may contact you to discuss your responses in more detail.\nV-safe can also help remind you of when you\u2019ll need to receive your second dose of the vaccine. However, it doesn\u2019t schedule vaccination appointments, so you\u2019ll still have to do that on your own.\nIf you\u2019re interested in using v-safe after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC has instructions for how to register.\nThe bottom line\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has been developed in a shorter time frame than most vaccines. This was possible due to many factors, including unprecedented scientific collaboration, a large body of previous research, increased funding, and accelerated timelines.\nDespite the quick development of the vaccine, no corners were cut with regard to the science. The current vaccines were still tested rigorously in human clinical trials in order to assess their safety and effectiveness.\nThe most common short-term side effects include discomfort at the injection site and mild flulike symptoms. Allergic reactions to the vaccine can happen, but are rare. The potential long-term effects of the vaccine are currently unknown.\nReceiving the COVID-19 vaccine is important for preventing illness and stopping the spread of COVID-19. If you have questions or concerns about the vaccine, talk with your doctor.\nLast medically reviewed on  February 9, 2021\n23 sources\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical associations.

THE TEXT OF THE VIDEO IS BELOW.\nhttps://vernoncoleman.org/videos/covid-19-vaccines-are-weapons-mass-destruction-and-could-wipe-out-human-race\nBy Dr. Vernon Coleman\nDr Vernon Coleman\u2019s track record of spotting health dangers is second to none. Since the 1970s, when his first two ground breaking books (The Medicine Men and Paper Doctors) were published, Dr. Coleman has been gaining friends among patients and enemies among doctors and drug companies.\nIf you have been reading my articles for a while you will know that I never exaggerate. You will also know that for the last year my predictions, assessments and interpretations have been absolutely accurate.\nNow, more than ever I need your help. Unless we work together we are doomed. I need your help because we need to reach millions with this article. And with the big platforms and the mainstream media having banned me I cannot reach those millions without you.\nI believe this is the most important article you will ever read. You have to share it. You have to do nothing for the next few days but send this article to everyone you know or don\u2019t know who has an email address. And send it to every journalist whose email address you can find. You can send it easily from www.vernoncoleman.org\nDo you remember that video in which Bill and Melinda Gates sat and smirked as they talked about how the next pandemic would make people sit up and take notice?\nWell, I think I know what is going to happen. We all know that the evil elite, the Agenda 21 and Great Reset promoters, have all along intended to kill between 90% and 95% of the world\u2019s population.\nSadly, I fear it is probably too late to save many of those who have had the vaccine. Millions are doomed and I fear that many will die when they next come into contact with the coronavirus.\nBut something has gone seriously wrong with the plans of the elite.\nAnd the result is that now those of us who haven\u2019t had the vaccine also appear to be in serious danger. We need to keep our immune systems in tip top condition by eating wisely and taking vitamin D supplements. And we may at some point need to keep away from those who have had the vaccine. They are, I believe, now a very real danger to the survival of the human species.\nFor longer than I like to think about it, I have been warning about the dangers of the covid-19 vaccines. I know that they should not really be called vaccines (although one official definition has been changed to accommodate them) but if I call them gene therapy then the people who we are trying to reach, who have been told that they are vaccines, won\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.\nAlmost exactly a year ago I warned that the reason that the coronavirus risk was being exaggerated was partly to set up a mandatory vaccination programme.\nThe covid-19 fake pandemic was created, in part, to find an excuse for the vaccines \u2013 rather than the vaccine being created as a solution to the alleged threat posed by covid-19.\nI\u2019ve been warning for months that the experimental vaccines are dangerous and produce many potentially deadly side effects. The celebrities, and many doctors, are wrong in providing reassurance. I was right to suggest that the vaccines could kill more people than covid-19.\nBut it now seems likely that the vaccines may be responsible for the death of hundreds of millions who have not been vaccinated.\nMy long-term thinking has always been that the covid-19 fraud was planned with a purpose: to kill as many of the elderly and the frail as possible and to introduce mandatory vaccinations. That was what I said in my first video in mid-March 2020. There was, of course, also the plan to destroy and then reinvent the economy to satisfy the requirements of Agenda 21 and the Great Reset.\nDays after that video first appeared I was furiously attacked on the internet. My Wikipedia entry was dramatically changed. Details of all my books, TV series and columns were removed. I was described as a discredited conspiracy theorist. I made a video explaining just how the Wikipedia entry was altered to demonise and to discredit. Many others who have questioned the official line on covid-19 have suffered the same way. And, of course, the BBC and the national press have joined in by attacking those daring to question the official line by airing unacceptable truths.\nBut I now fear that the genocidal lunatics, the horsemen of the Apocalypse who planned this fraud are leading us into Armageddon.\nI have long believed that the architects of the fraud expected that millions would die.\nHowever, I now believe that the evil minds who created this fraud dramatically under-estimated the danger of the experimental vaccines which they have been promoting with such vigour. Millions who have received one of the covid-19 vaccines may die as a result of those vaccinations. I\u2019ll explain how and why in a moment.\nThe fraud started, of course, with the wild predictions made by Ferguson of Imperial College. Ferguson is a mathematical modeller with an appalling track record. The people planning the fraud knew that Ferguson\u2019s predictions were absurd. They must have known that Ferguson\u2019s track record was embarrassingly bad. But nevertheless his predictions were used as an excuse for the lockdowns, the social distancing, the masks and the closure of schools and hospital departments. This was all utter madness. The logical thing to do was to isolate individuals who had the infection \u2013 in the same way that people with flu are told to stay at home \u2013 and to protect the most vulnerable people, largely the elderly with heart or chest disorders. But the politicians and the advisors did everything wrong. And those who questioned what was happening were demonised and silenced.\nThe fact is that the immune systems of healthy people are boosted through interactions with others. Healthy children and young adults have very powerful immune systems. It\u2019s really only the elderly who are most likely to be threatened by a new virus.\nAnd yet the world\u2019s politicians and their advisors deliberately led us into a mass vaccination programme.\nThe public were originally assured that only through a huge vaccination programme could they possibly win back some of their lost freedoms. This was always dangerous nonsense.\nHowever, the experimental vaccines which were approved so quickly were never going to do what people were told they would do. They weren\u2019t designed to prevent infection or transmission. The vaccines don\u2019t stop people getting covid-19 and they don\u2019t stop them passing it on if they do get it. The vaccines merely help limit the seriousness of the symptoms for some of those who are injected. That\u2019s not what most people believe, of course. The vast majority of people who have been vaccinated believe that they have been protected against the infection. It was another fraud.\nApart from the rather important fact that they don\u2019t do what people think they do, there are three huge problems with the vaccines.\nThe first problem, of course, is that these experimental vaccines have already proved to be desperately dangerous \u2013 killing many people already and producing serious adverse events in many more. The size of this particular problem can be judged by the fact that even the authorities admit that probably only 1 in 100 vaccine related deaths and serious injuries will be reported. It is impossible to estimate how many will die of allergy problems, heart trouble, strokes, neurological problems or how many will be blinded or paralysed. There is a list on my website of people known to be injured or killed by the vaccine and it is a terrifying list to read. The death toll is terrifying but most authorities keep insisting that these are all coincidences. When someone died within 60 or 28 days of a positive covid-19 test \u2013 even if the test result was false \u2013 they were automatically treated as a covid-19 death to push up the numbers. But when healthy young people die within hours of having a vaccination the deaths are dismissed as just coincidences. What a lot of tragic coincidences there have been.\nThe second problem is the immune system problem known as pathogenic priming or a cytokine storm. What happens is that the immune system of the person who has been vaccinated will be primed to respond in a very dramatic way if that individual comes into contact with the virus in the future. The result can be catastrophic and this is what I fear will happen in the autumn and during next winter. The people who had the vaccine are going to be in real trouble when they next come into contact with a coronavirus. Their immune systems will overreact and that\u2019s likely to be when there will be lots of deaths.\nPatients haven\u2019t been officially warned about this problem although the evidence was published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice for October 2020. The paper is entitled `Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of covid-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease.\u2019\nBut there has been no informed consent for patients and I suspect that most doctors remain ignorant of the risks.\nThe elderly and those with poor immune systems are particularly likely to be killed. And what will give you a poor immune system? Wearing a mask, being isolated from other people and not getting enough sunshine are three obvious causes. Drinking too much alcohol and smoking too much tobacco while under house arrest don\u2019t help.\nThe extra deaths will probably occur in the autumn, when vaccinated individuals are most likely to be exposed to the virus. The coronavirus spreads most rapidly in autumn and winter.\nAs a result of the epidemic of illnesses and deaths that will take place, Governments will start promoting the next round of vaccinations. There will be much talk of mutations, of course, and new hurriedly prepared vaccines will be produced and heavily promoted by celebrities who don\u2019t know anything about medicine or vaccines. Doctors who understand the dangers and who have doubts about the vaccines will, as usual, be silenced.\nAmazingly, I believe that the people behind this fraud were aware that this would happen. It was part of their evil plan.\nThey knew that there would be an increase in deaths in the autumn and next winter. They always planned to blame the deaths on a new version of covid-19 \u2013 one of the many thousands of mutations which will be around by the autumn. I have long suspected that they would eventually be promoting vaccinations every couple of months \u2013 or even more frequently; every month or so. My original use of the word hoax was intended to criticise the response to a flu-like viral infection. The response was wildly exaggerated.\nI suspect that this was what Bill and Melinda Gates were smirking about when they implied that we might not take the first pandemic seriously \u2013 but that we would treat the next pandemic far more seriously.\nAnd I believe that they, and all the others involved in this fraud, assumed that they would be perfectly safe because they wouldn\u2019t actually have the vaccines. I suspect that many of the elite, and the more important celebrities, were given a placebo instead of one of the experimental vaccines.\nThey were never at risk of being killed by the vaccine, being severely injured by it or developing pathogenic priming \u2013 and then being incredibly vulnerable the next time they came into contact with the virus infection.\nI think the elite thought they were safe. I think they devised a plan that would result in millions of deaths but which would not harm them.\nBut I believe they made a huge, crucial mistake.\nAnd this brings us to the third problem \u2013 a problem I don\u2019t think they expected.\nThis problem has just been outlined by Dr Geert Vanden Bossche who is a very eminent vaccine specialist. Indeed, I was originally sceptical about what he said because Dr Bossche has previously worked with GAVI and the Gates Foundation. He is the last person in the world who could be described as being opposed to vaccination.\nDr Bossche has pointed out that the vaccines which are currently being used are the wrong weapons to use for the war against this virus infection.\nDisastrously, by giving vaccines to millions we are teaching the virus how to mutate and to become stronger and more deadly. Trying to devise new vaccines for new mutations simply makes things worse because the scientists cannot possibly get ahead of the mutated viruses. And the people who have been vaccinated are now sharing mutated viruses with those around them. The mutations are becoming stronger and deadlier.\nEnding the lockdowns will be perfectly timed to ensure that new mutations of the covid-19 virus are spread far and wide.\nThere\u2019s another associated problem too.\nNormally our bodies contain white blood cells which help us defeat infections. Cells called NK cells \u2013 the NK stands for natural killers \u2013 help kill off invading bad cells. Once the NK cells have done their work our antibodies appear and clear up the mess.\nHowever, Dr Bossche explains that the covid-19 vaccines are triggering the production of very specific antibodies which compete with the natural defences of the individuals who had the vaccines.\nThe natural defence systems of those who have been vaccinated are being suppressed because the specific antibodies which have been produced by the vaccine just take over.\nAnd these specific antibodies, the ones produced by the vaccines, are permanent. They are there for ever within the bodies of the vaccinated.\nThe disastrous result is that the natural immune systems of the tens or hundreds of millions who are having the vaccines are being effectively destroyed.\nTheir immune systems will not be able to fight any mutated variation of the virus which develops within their bodies. And those mutated viruses can spread out into the community. I believe this is why new virus variations are appearing in areas where the vaccine has been given to lots of people.\nThe bottom line is that giving the vaccines will give the virus an opportunity to become infinitely more dangerous. Every vaccinated individual has the potential to become a mass murderer because their bodies are becoming laboratories making lethal viruses. And worse still, some of the vaccinated individuals may become asymptomatic carriers \u2013 spreading lethal viruses around them.\nAnd the people who have had the vaccine won\u2019t be able to respond to the mutations because their immune systems have been taken over by an artificial defence system, given to them by the vaccine and designed to combat the original form of the covid-19 virus. The vaccinated individuals are going to be very much at risk when the new mutations start to spread. Their bodies are permanently and exclusively geared to defend against a form of the virus which is rapidly becoming out of date.\nGiving new vaccines won\u2019t help because the mutated virus will not be vulnerable. The scientists who are making vaccines won\u2019t be able to get ahead of the mutating virus. This should have been foreseen. It\u2019s why flu vaccines often don\u2019t work.\nThe politicians and their advisors will lie and blame those who haven\u2019t had the vaccine for the development of new mutations and for the rise in deaths that is going to take place.\nBut if Dr Bossche is right, and I believe he is, then it is the vaccinated individuals who are going to threaten mankind. They will be a major threat to anyone who has been vaccinated. But they will also be a major threat to the unvaccinated because the viruses they are shedding are more dangerous than the original one.\nWe are in very dangerous territory.\nIf we don\u2019t stop this vaccination programme now then it is no exaggeration to say that the very future of mankind is at risk.\nIs this what was in the mind of those trying to sell us the Great Reset?\nI don\u2019t know.\nMaybe their aim all along was to kill us all.\nOr maybe their evil plot has just got out of hand. In the UK Ferguson, Hancock, Whitty and Vallance have always seemed to me to be entirely the wrong people to lead the nation\u2019s response. In the US, I believe that Dr Fauci was the wrong person.\nI have feared all along that they were picked because they are the wrong people. Everything they have done has been wrong for us but right for them and the evil cabal promoting Agenda 21 and the Great Reset.\nThe insistence on suppressing free debate has led us directly into this abyss. None of these people should have been allowed such control over our lives but by suppressing all questioning opposition in a way never done before and suppressing the facts the mainstream media and the internet giants have made things infinitely worse. Do they think they are going to be safe?\nThere is a real risk that instead of just killing 90%-95%, as the evil elite originally desired, they could kill everyone by mistake; they could wipe out mankind.\nWe have very little time to save ourselves. We have to boost our immune systems and, ironically, it is possible that we will need to keep away from the people who have been vaccinated. I\u2019ll write an article in the next week or so on how you can boost your immune system.\nNow do you see why this is the most important article I\u2019ve written on covid-19 and the most important you\u2019ve ever seen?\nI cannot reach the mainstream media which simply suppresses the truth and refuses any debate or discussion. YouTube, for example, won\u2019t take videos which question anything promoted by the evil establishment.\nSo send this article to doctors and to journalists, to friends and to relatives. Share, share, share. Maybe we can persuade people in power that they are not immune to the disaster which lies ahead. You can share easily from www.vernoncoleman.org\nI hope Dr Bossche is wrong. I hope I\u2019m wrong.\nBut everything in this article needs investigating. And if these fears are not publicised and investigated then we will know for absolute sure that the plan is to kill as many of us as possible. There can be no other conclusion.\nVernon Coleman\u2019s book Superbody is subtitled `The secret of survival in the 21st century\u2019. It contains advice on how to boost your immune system. Superbody is available as a paperback and an eBook.\nShare this:\nMore\nLoading...\nRelated\nVaccination Double Cross On The Greg Anthony Radio\u00a0ShowMarch 27, 2021In \"2021\"\nThe World Ambushed by the Jesuit\u00a0Curse July 16, 2021 In \"2021\"\nWell, Go To Hell, All You NWO Owners On The Greg Anthony Radio\u00a0Show April 10, 2021 In \"2021\"\nPost navigation\n\u2190 It\u2019s All Fake, Fake, Fake\u00a0Fake\nLaughter Best Medicine In America\u2019s Last Days On The Greg Anthony Radio\u00a0Show \u2192"}, {"Url": "https://factcheck.org/2021/07/scicheck-covid-19-vaccine-generated-spike-protein-is-safe-contrary-to-viral-claims", "CluewebURLHash": "0DEBF52B955CCD0A37957AEA70D031FE", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000COVID\ue001-19 \ue000Vaccine\ue001-Generated Spike Protein is Safe, Contrary ...", "Snippet": "Funke, Daniel. \u201c Fact check: \ue000COVID\ue001-19 \ue000vaccines\ue001 don\u2019t produce \ue000dangerous\ue001 toxins.\u201d USA TODAY. 8 June 2021.

There is no evidence to indicate that the spike proteins generated by human cells following vaccination are a toxin or that they circulate in the body and damage tissues, contrary to what a Canadian virus immunologist recently claimed.\nHow do we know vaccines are safe?\nFull Story\nAll of the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States are designed to instruct human cells to make harmless spike proteins \u2014 mimicking a viral protein that\u2019s used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter cells. When the immune system recognizes the proteins, which aren\u2019t normally there, it starts generating antibodies and building an immune response against them. The process prepares the body against future infection.\nThese vaccines have been found to be effective and safe in clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants, and in real world conditions with over 325 million doses administered.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \u201cmost intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history\u201d has found that most of the reported side effects after COVID-19 vaccination are minor, such as pain at the injection site or fever. Severe adverse reactions to the vaccines have been rare .\nYet, a Canadian virus immunologist recently claimed that the vaccine\u2019s spike protein is \u201ca pathogenic protein,\u201d \u201ca toxin\u201d that gets into the bloodstream, then accumulates in breast milk and \u201cin a number of tissues\u201d and could lead to cardiovascular and neurological damage in adults, children and infants.\n\u201cWe made a big mistake,\u201d said Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at the University of Guelph\u2019s Ontario Veterinary College, during an interview with Canadian radio personality Alex Pierson on May 27. \u201cWe thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.\u201d\nAccording to his profile, Bridle\u2019s research focuses on biotherapies for the treatment of cancers and the way organisms respond to viruses. Since the pandemic started, his lab has been trying to develop vaccines against coronaviruses, for which he received a $230,000 grant from the Ontario government.\nBridle\u2019s interview was reposted by several publications, including one owned by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s anti-vaccination organization. Segments of the interview were widely spread in social media platforms in English and Spanish .\nBut researchers and health officials told FactCheck.org there is no \u201cmistake\u201d and that there is no evidence to support Bridle\u2019s claims.\nThere is no evidence that the spike protein in vaccines \u201cis toxic or that it lingers at any toxic level in the body after vaccination,\u201d an FDA spokesperson told us in an email.\nJason McLellan, a structural biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who has been studying spike proteins in other coronaviruses for years and whose work was fundamental for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, said Bridle\u2019s statements are not correct.\n\u201cThe spike protein is not pathogenic. It is not a toxin,\u201d McLellan told us in an email. \u201cI have not seen any data to support what Bridle claims.\u201d\nNo Evidence Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein Lingers in Bloodstream\nBridle, who in the radio show said he\u2019s \u201cvery much pro-vaccine,\u201d says his claims are \u201ccompletely backed up by peer-reviewed scientific publications in well-known and well-respected scientific journals.\u201d\nBut authors of two of the studies he cites told us their findings don\u2019t back Bridle\u2019s statements.\n\u201cBridle is taking our results and completely misinterpreting them,\u201d said David R. Walt, a member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School and of Harvard\u2019s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, who co-authored a study that found circulating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen in the plasma of vaccine recipients.\nThe study, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in May, collected plasma from 13 health care workers at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine. Researchers detected levels of SARS-CoV-2 protein as early as one day after the first injection in 11 of the 13 participants.\nBridle presents the study as evidence that the spike protein gets into blood circulation.\nCOVID-19 vaccination doses available at a Walgreens mobile bus clinic in Los Angeles. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\nWalt told us in an email that the aim of the study was to see if an ultrasensitive detection technology, a single-molecule array, could detect circulating antigen produced by the mRNA vaccine to demonstrate the vaccine is working as designed.\n\u201cWe found we could detect extremely low concentrations of S1 (a subunit of spike) in 11 of 13 healthy vaccinated individuals and the full spike in 3 of 13,\u201d he said in an email, noting that the technology they used is 1,000 times more sensitive than a typical antigen test, \u201cso we are really detecting minute quantities of the spike and S1 proteins.\u201d (Emphasis is his).\n\u201cWe found that within a few days of the antigen appearing, the individuals developed antibodies that removed the antigen from the bloodstream,\u201d he added. \u201cOur conclusion was that the vaccine is working as intended.\u201d\nWalt, a pathology professor, added there is no evidence that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein that causes damage in several tissues.\n\u201cCOVID, on the other hand, is known to have significant effects on many tissues and organs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important message is that over 400 million doses of the mRNA vaccine have been administered with negligible serious consequences. It is incredibly safe.\u201d\nA second study Bridle uses to support his claims is one by Pfizer. In the radio interview with Pierson, Bridle says he and \u201cother international collaborators\u201d obtained the document through a request for information to a Japanese regulatory agency, claiming that it shows for the \u201cfirst time ever\u201d where the mRNA vaccines \u201cgo after vaccination.\u201d\n\u201cIs it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is absolutely not,\u201d Bridle says in the radio show. \u201cThe spike protein gets into the blood, circulates through the blood in individuals over several days post vaccination, it accumulates \u2026 in a number of tissues such as the spleen, the bone marrow, the liver, the adrenal glands \u2026\u00a0 and in quite high concentrations, in the ovaries,\u201d he said.\nKeanna Ghazvini, a Pfizer spokesperson, told us in an email that the document referred to by Bridle, which is mostly in Japanese, is a pharmacokinetics overview of the company\u2019s vaccine. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how a drug moves through the body, including how quickly drugs are absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. The document was \u201cpart of the submission data applied by Pfizer to PMDA (Japan\u2019s version of FDA) for its review,\u201d and it is publicly available online, Ghazvini said.\n\u201cThe document is about the pharmacokinetics overview seen from lab studies and we can confirm it\u2019s not about spike proteins from the vaccine resulting in dangerous toxins that linger in the body,\u201d Ghazvini said.\nAccording to a statement sent to FactCheck.org by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the vaccine-generated spike protein \u201cis not secreted into circulation in the bloodstream.\u201d\nVirus Spike Protein vs. Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein\nThe spike proteins from the virus and the ones generated by the vaccines are \u201cessentially the same,\u201d McLellan, the spike protein researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, told us, noting that they have the same function, structure and way of processing.\nBut, he said, there is \u201cone key difference,\u201d in that the spikes encoded by the vaccines \u201ccontain 2 amino acid changes that help stabilize the spike in its initial conformation and help prevent the spike from undergoing a conformational change that is required to facilitate membrane fusion.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a shape-shifter. To fuse its viral membrane with the host cell membrane it substantially changes its shape from an unstable pre-fusion state to a stable post-fusion state. While previously working on a vaccine for MERS, a disease caused by another coronavirus, McLellan and others discovered that by adding two proline molecules to the spike protein, they could lock it into its pre-fusion state, triggering a more effective immune response and preventing cell entry. The same harmless mutation, called 2P, as in two proline molecules, is used in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\nDuring a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the NIAID told us, the virus spike proteins can latch onto human cells, allowing the virus to infect them. With the live virus, the protein \u201cattaches to receptors on the surface of cells and fuses the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane,\u201d McLellan said.\nHowever, vaccine-generated spike proteins can\u2019t do that fusion because they are locked in the pre-fusion shape.\n\u201cThe spike protein encoded by the mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech) and the J&J vaccine instruct the cells in our arm (where the injection is given) to produce spike protein that is tethered to the surface of the cell. It is not secreted and thus does not float through the body,\u201d McLellan said.\nAccording to the NIAID statement, \u201cthe spike protein is only detectable for a few days after immunization\u201d in tests conducted in animals.\nNo Evidence Vaccine-Generated Spike Protein Is Harmful\nFactCheck.org reached out to Bridle for comment. In response we got an automatic email reply saying he \u201ccannot respond\u201d because \u201chis workload has become challenging to manage\u201d after the radio interview, which led to \u201cvicious attacks by some.\u201d\nIn two documents prepared in response to the attention brought by the interview, Bridle says the Canadian government \u201cshould be called upon to immediately halt the mass vaccination program of children and adolescents.\u201d He says \u201cthere is no immediate threat of severe COVID-19 in the majority of Canadian children and adolescents,\u201d and that more safety and efficacy data is needed for the \u201cuse of experimental vaccines.\u201d\nIn May, Canada authorized the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 12 to 15, following authorization of the vaccine in youth 16 years old and older in December. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends offering the vaccine \u201cto all children and adolescents 12 years of age and older as soon as vaccine supply permits.\u201d\nIn a document published in June, Bridle says severe SARS-CoV-2 infections \u201ccan cause damage to the cardiovascular system\u201d and \u201cneurological problems.\u201d\n\u201c[T]he spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 might be responsible for at least some of the damage that occurs in severe cases of COVID-19,\u201d he says, citing a study published in March in Circulation Research.\nThe study, in which researchers administered a pseudovirus to hamsters, found the spike protein \u201calone can damage vascular endothelial cells.\u201d But as the authors mention, the use of a pseudovirus is a limitation and \u201cfindings need to be confirmed with the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u201d in the future.\nFurthermore, the study concludes that vaccines not only protect people from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also from damage to the endothelium, a thin membrane that lines the inside of the heart and blood vessels.\nAccording to a statement sent to FactCheck.org by NIAID, if \u201cenough excess spike proteins are shed into the bloodstream and bind to human cells expressing the ACE2 receptor, an infected person could theoretically experience additional symptoms. However, this is theoretical; the exact mechanism by which COVID-19 infection leads to cardiovascular symptoms is still unclear.\u201d\nSusan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher and professor of microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, says there is \u201cnot much virus in the blood following infection with SARS2.\u201d\n\u201cI am quite confident that the spike protein is not a toxin,\u201d she told FactCheck.org in an email. \u201cFurthermore if vaccine induced spike were pathogenic wouldn\u2019t we see a lot of illness following vaccination?\u201d\nStudy on Vaccine Transfer into Breast Milk Distorted\nFinally, Bridle says there is evidence that the mRNA vaccines get transferred through breast milk, citing a preprint from Singapore that tested milk samples from 10 lactating health care workers after they were immunized with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The unpublished study found antibodies in the breast milk from all of the workers and\u00a0\u201cminimal amounts of vaccine mRNA.\u201d\n\u201c36 out of 40 (90%) samples did not show detectable levels of vaccine mRNA. The highest concentration of BNT162b2 mRNA in the tested samples was 2 ng/mL \u2026 a hypothetical 0.667% of the original vaccine dose being transferred in 100 mL of human milk,\u201d the study says. \u201cThis miniscule amount of mRNA is expected to be readily destroyed by enzymes in the infant\u2019s gut,\u201d the authors say in the discussion.\nThe study concluded \u201clactating individuals should continue breastfeeding\u201d after being vaccinated.\nBridle omits this information in his 37-page document, instead saying that detection of the mRNA \u201cwas downplayed.\u201d\n\u201cNow we know the spike protein gets into circulation. Any protein in the blood will get concentrated in breast milk,\u201d he said on the radio show. \u201cLooking into the adverse event database in the United States, we have found evidence of suckling infants experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract.\u201d\nAs we\u2019ve reported, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is designed to detect potential problems \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s there \u2014 but it does not show whether the vaccines caused any of the reported issues. Anyone can submit a report of an event to VAERS, even if it\u2019s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem, and all of the notifications are accepted without determining if the event was caused by a vaccine.\n\u201cIt is unlikely that enough of the spike protein could accumulate in breast milk to have any impact on infants that consume it,\u201d NIAID told us in a statement.\nDr. Jeannie Kelly, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and lead author of a study on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk following vaccination, told us there is no evidence to support Bridle\u2019s claims.\n\u201cWe did not measure spike protein levels in our study. However, there is no evidence that the spike protein is in breast milk,\u201d Kelly said in an email. \u201cMuch like any other vaccination in a breast feeding person, even if the spike protein makes it into the milk, the protein would be degraded by the stomach acid. Even if the spike protein was absorbed into the blood stream, it has no mechanism of action to cause any issues such as bleeding disorders.\u201d\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s website there is limited data available on the safety and the effects of vaccination in lactating people or breastfed babies because the clinical trials didn\u2019t include people who were breastfeeding. However, it says, based on available data \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines are thought not to be a risk.\u201d\nIn fact, recent studies show breastfeeding after vaccinations may provide babies with protection.\nBoth the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the World Health Organization encourage women who are breastfeeding to take the vaccine.\n\u201cThere is no risk at all because all the vaccines that are being used presently, none of them have the live virus in it. And so there\u2019s no risk of transmission through the breast milk. In fact, the antibodies that the mother has can go through the breast milk to the baby and may only serve maybe to protect the baby a little bit. But there\u2019s absolutely no harm. It\u2019s very safe,\u201d says WHO\u2019s Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan on a podcast produced by the organization.\nEditor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But what do we know about Omicron and how does it compare to Delta?\nDelta: It was first discovered in India last December before rapidly spreading to the UK. The variant is still the main dominant strain as it is in many countries.\nLast week the ONS said 99 per cent of sequenced cases in the UK were Delta ending the week November 27.\nOmicron: UK scientists became aware of Omicron on November 2 after samples were uploaded to a coronavirus variant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.\nHowever, it is likely the variant was in circulation earlier than that date but was not sequenced.\nMutations\nDelta: Delta has 13 mutations, of which nine are in the \u2018spike protein\u2019. According to the ONS, scientists can differentiate Delta from Omicron by identifying patterns among three genes in positive results - the S gene, the ORF1ab gene and the N gene.\nDelta infections usually test positive for all three genes, whereas the Omicron variant tests negative for the S gene.\nOmicron: Omicron has the most mutations of any variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It caused alarm among scientists because at least 32 of its mutations are in the spike protein.\nThe spike protein is part of the virus which helps it latch onto our cells, fitting cellular receptors \u201clike a lock and key,\u201d say Yale University researchers.\nWhile Omicron has more mutations in total, Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University, told CNN that the number of mutations don\u2019t automatically translate to a more dangerous virus.\nHow contagious are they?\nDelta: The Delta variant was more than 2x as contagious as variants that came before it, according to the Centre for Disease Control in the United States.\nThe incubation period was also shorter than previous iterations of SARS-CoV-2, with a mean time of 4 days, meaning people became infectious sooner.\nAFP via Getty Images\nOmicron: Omicron\u2019s transmissiblity compared with other variants, including Delta, according to the World Health Organisation.\nHowever, Boris Johnson told Cabinet ministers on Tuesday \u201cearly indications were that it was more transmissible than Delta\u201d which was later repeated by his official spokesperson publicly.\nAnthony Fauci, the top US medical adviser, also said on Tuesday the variant was \u201cclearly highly transmissible.\u201d\nHow severe is illness?\nDelta: According to a study published earlier this year, those who got the Delta variant were twice as likely to be hospitalised as a result of their illness than if they had the earlier Alpha variant.\nHowever, the vast majority of those in the study, 70 per cent, were unvaccinated as the cases occurred very early on into the vaccine rollout.\nOmicron: A full picture is yet to emerge, according to the WHO. But a study from South Africa suggests it may well be a milder illness than Delta. Dr Fauci has also spoken of \u201cencouraging signals\u201d about the severity of disease.\nThe study showed at the Steve Biko and Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria on December 2 only nine of the 42 patients on the Covid ward were being treated for the virus and were in need of oxygen.\nHowever, scientists have warned that very high levels of even a mild illness could be challenging for the NHS if it results in enough hospitalisations.\nFor this reason, Dr Simon Clarke - a microbiologist at the University of Reading - told the Mail Online it was \u201centirely possible\u201d Omicron could trigger a wave of hospital admissions on par with the peak in January 2021.\n(PA)\n/ PA Wire\nVaccine escape\nDelta: Two doses of either Oxford or Pfizer jabs provides at least the same level of protection as having had Covid-19 before, according to a study earlier this year.\nTwo doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine were estimated to be 95 per cent and 92 per cent effective against hospitalisation with the Delta variant, respectively, according to the ONS.\nOmicron: The World Health Organisation\u2019s Dr Mike Ryan has said he expects that vaccinations should continue to work to protect against severe illness as a result of the variant.\nThere is some early data in a study of people who were double jabbed that Pfizer\u2019s jab is much less effective against Omicron than earlier variants.\nStudies on other vaccines\u2019 effectiveness against Omicron have yet to report.\nHowever, researcher Alex Sigal said Omicron\u2019s ability to escape vaccine antibodies is \u201cincomplete\u201d and that the results were \u201cbetter than I expected of Omicron\u201d - meaning boosters could play a key role in keeping us safe.\nAnd a team studying the effects of third doses said the body\u2019s T cell immune response after a booster shot is such that it may still provide good protection.\nMORE ABOUT Vaccines Delta Omicron Coronavirus covid\nHave your say...

However, a top cardiologist is warning that a game-changing study illustrates how the vaccines are actually more dangerous than the virus they are supposed to protect people from.\nDr. Peter McCulloch is a respected cardiologist whose works have been published more than 650 times in medical journals. He is also the author of a cardiology textbook, the editor of a cardiology journal and an internist whose past experience includes serving on the teams that review new vaccines.\nAs someone who has chaired data safety monitoring boards on several occasions, Dr. McCulloch said that he was very surprised by what happened when the vaccines were first rolled out earlier in the year. Speaking on scientist Bret Weinstein\u2019s DarkHorse podcast, McCulloch said that in normal circumstances, what happened this January when officials learned of 182 deaths following 278 million shots should have been enough to put an end to the COVID vaccine program. He cited a similar example in the suspension of a vaccination campaign for the swine flu in 1976 following just three deaths and 94 cases of paralysis.\nHe said: \u201cOur [COVID] vaccine program would have been shut down in February for excess mortality in America.\u201d\nAccording to Dr. McCulloch, these vaccines are especially dangerous for the elderly. He said that studies carried out in nursing homes in Europe showed that at least 40 percent of deaths were directly from the vaccines.\n\u201cWe now know it\u2019s the seniors who die with the vaccine \u2026 50 percent of these deaths occur within 48 hours, 80 percent within a week,\u201d he said.\nSome of the patients, he added, suffered from severe reactions followed by death within just a day or two. Many are dying from cardiopulmonary collapse because of their body\u2019s overwhelming production of the spike protein, while others are dying from a thromboembolic or bleeding death within a few weeks of getting the vaccine.\nHe said that it\u2019s clear that the deaths are biologically related to the vaccines.\nElderly, young people at risk from vaccines\nUnfortunately, it is not just the elderly who need to worry about the vaccines. McCulloch also noted the high risk to young people. Although some in the media have tried to downplay the heart problems such as myocarditis that many young people are experiencing after the vaccine, McCulloch says that the problem is quite serious and has sent many young people to the hospital.\nIn June, the CDC and the FDA recognized 200 cases of myocarditis. Since then, the total has climbed to 11,000 certified cases in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). It is affecting boys at a greater rate than girls, and the real rate has been at least 50 percent higher than the CDC\u2019s projections. He added that children between the ages of 12 and 17 are more likely to be hospitalized due to myocarditis than COVID.\nAlthough he said he understands that people want to do what they can to stop this virus, many don\u2019t want to sacrifice their life for it.\nHe added: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what they\u2019re being asked for; they\u2019re being asked to \u2026 take a vaccine, and even though it\u2019s rare, you could lose your life and then people are saying, \u2018Well, how rare is rare?\u2019 and I can just tell you, the mortality rate by all expert analyses is unacceptably high.\u201d\nWith 18,000 deaths in VAERS, half of which are Americans, and an under-reporting factor believed to be around 5, a conservative estimate would be that 45,000 to 50,000 Americans have died from the vaccine, and that is one reason many people would rather walk away from their job than get the jab.\nSources for this article include:\nWesternJournal.com\nUSCJournal.com\nTagged Under: Big Pharma, biological weapon, covid-19 vaccines, heart inflammation, myocarditis, pandemic, Peter McCulloch, pharmaceutical fraud, spike protein, Vaccine deaths, Vaccine injuries, VAERS\nGet Our Free Email Newsletter\nGet independent news alerts on natural cures, food lab tests, cannabis medicine, science, robotics, drones, privacy and more.\nYour privacy is protected.

This is a scandal.\"\nWhile the highly infectious Delta strain remains the dominant mutation around the world, the Jerusalem Post reported over the weekend that a variant known as B.1.640 has drawn the attention of experts \"because there are changes to the coronavirus spike protein that have never been seen before.\"\nThe strain has thus far been detected in several European countries as well as on the largely unvaccinated African continent, where scientists say the strain may have originated.\n\"This lineage has a large number of recent sequences in France and the Congo with additional sequences in Switzerland, Italy, the U.K., and the USA,\" virologist Tom Peacock noted on Twitter.\nSpeaking to the Jerusalem Post, Bar-Ilan University Professor Cyrille Cohen warned that \"this variant exemplifies that if you leave some of the world's population without access to vaccines, then the virus will continue to multiply and it will lead to more variants.\"\n\"Not giving vaccines to these countries may seem OK in the short term, but in the long term we might have new variants that are problematic that developed in unvaccinated countries,\" said Cohen. \"I don't want to frighten people. There are just a few cases of B.1.640 now and it could very well be that in a month we could all forget about this variant.\"\n\"But it is an example of what could happen if there isn't access to vaccines for everyone,\" he added.\nThe World Health Organization is currently monitoring six coronavirus mutations that have been detected around the world, often emanating from countries\u2014including India, Brazil, and South Africa\u2014that have struggled to vaccinate their populations due to artificial shortages of doses or key materials.\nWhile some middle- and low-income countries have ramped up their vaccination campaigns in recent months, much of Africa and other developing regions across the globe remain almost entirely without access to lifesaving shots.\n\"Less than 6% of the population in African states is vaccinated against coronavirus,\" notes a report published last week by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). \"In many countries, including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Nigeria, and Tanzania, vaccination rates are even lower (at only around 1%), with little prospect of these picking up any time soon.\"\nThe report continues:\nThe cause of such low vaccination rates is well-known: despite recent improvements, global production continues to lag behind demand, with developing countries facing long delays in accessing vaccines. Meanwhile, global solidarity is ineffective; so far, COVAX has shipped only around 400 million doses of vaccines globally (compared with an initial target of delivering 1.9 billion doses in 2021). Donations from richer countries are also failing to materialize; as [of] late October, developed countries had delivered only 43 million doses of vaccines (out of pledges totaling about 400 million\u2014which is still far below needs).\nIn a speech last week, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that \"nearly 80 countries, half of them in Africa, will not reach our 40% vaccination target\" by the end of the year.\n\"Countries with the highest vaccine coverage continue to stockpile more vaccines, while low-income countries continue to wait,\" Tedros said. \"Every day, there are six times more boosters administered globally than primary doses in low-income countries. This is a scandal that must stop now.\"\nDeeply unequal access to vaccines\u2014often dubbed \"vaccine apartheid\" by public health campaigners and the leaders of vulnerable countries \u2014is a major reason the coronavirus is still killing an average of 7,000 people each day. Our World in Data estimates that 7.5 billion coronavirus vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, but just 4.5% of people in low-income countries have received at least one shot.\nIn the face of such persistent inequities, the leaders of rich countries are facing growing pressure to force pharmaceutical companies to share vaccine recipes with manufacturers around the world, a move proponents say is necessary to quickly increase regional production and distribution.\nThus far, pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna and Pfizer\u2014 profiting immensely from their government-granted monopolies\u2014have refused to voluntarily share their technology with developing countries.\nVox 's Umair Irfan argued last week that the massive and persistent vaccination gap \"isn't just a humanitarian crisis, it's a global threat to the fragile progress already made in the pandemic.\"\n\"The longer the pandemic rages,\" Irfan wrote, \"the greater the chances of a dangerous mutation in the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, which could then spread around the world.\"\nOur work is licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0).

Gelles\nWASHINGTON-(MaraviPost)- In a shocking announcement, Bill Gates, billionaire Microsoft co-founder and the major force behind the COVID-19 vaccines, called for all the COVID-19 genetic-based vaccines to be taken off the market immediately.\nIn an often anguished 19-minute televised speech, Gates said: \u201cWe made a terrible mistake. We wanted to protect people against a dangerous virus. But it turns out the virus is much less dangerous than we thought. And the vaccine is far more dangerous than anyone imagined.\u201d\nBy W. Gelles\n\u201cThese vaccines\u2014Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca\u2014they\u2019re killing people left and right\u2014and they\u2019re injuring some people very badly,\u201d Gates continued, waving his hands in the air at times for dramatic effect.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s own data shows us this is what\u2019s happening. The CDC\u2019s reporting system is showing, what?\u2026around 13,000 deaths so far in the U.S. and over half a million adverse events. Well, we all know the reporting system is a sham.\n\u201cWe know that VAERS [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System] captures only around one percent of what\u2019s going on. So we\u2019re talking over a million deaths from these Covid vaccines, and more than 60 million people with bad side effects.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not what we wanted. This is not acceptable,\u201d Mr. Gates asserted.\nWall Street shares of all the major Covid vaccine companies plummeted by 20% to 30% as Mr. Gates announced that he was joining the urgent Citizen Petition filed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense organization calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to immediately withdraw all the COVID vaccines from the market.\nGates continued: \u201cToo many people who take these vaccines drop dead\u2026one day, two days, five days after getting the shot. Other people suffer paralysis, blindness, convulsions, heart attacks, immune system collapse, blood clots, brain inflammation, lung or kidney damage, miscarriages, autoimmune disease, multiple organ system failure, permanent profound fatigue, and many other horrible problems.\n\u201cOf course, our Media Mouthpieces\u2014I mean the mainstream news media, dismiss all these tragedies as \u2018just a coincidence.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe reason they say that,\u201d Gates explained, \u201cis because of what I did at Event 201, a Coronavirus Pandemic Simulation held in New York in October 2019 just a few weeks before we announced the actual pandemic. I got all the major newspapers, TV channels, and radio stations to agree to stick with the Official Narrative\u2014\u2018the vaccines are safe and effective\u2019\u2014and to censor anybody who questions this line of BS.\n\u201cSo the public never got to hear the evidence from hundreds of distinguished doctors and medical researchers who warned that the vaccines are dangerous and often lethal.\u201d\n\u201cThat was a huge mistake on my part,\u201d Gates maintained, looking weary and at times teary-eyed. \u201cWe never should have done that. People have every right to be well-informed, to get all the facts so they can make a rational decision.\u201d\nChanging the topic as if to elicit sympathy, Mr. Gates confided: \u201cI\u2019ve been going through a rough time and doing a lot of soul-searching since Melinda dumped me. This divorce has caused me to take a good hard look at myself. I don\u2019t want to be remembered as a monster who killed millions of people through deadly vaccines. I am not a monster. I am not a mass murderer. I don\u2019t want to be remembered as a mass murderer by my family, my friends, and my company.\n\u201cSome people have called me a sociopath or even a psychopath because of my visionary schemes to help humanity\u2014like reducing global warming by spraying dust into the upper atmosphere, or releasing millions of genetically-modified mosquitoes to combat dengue and Zika virus.\u201d\nSource: https://dailyexpose.co.uk\nThe Maravi Post has over one billion views since its inception in December of 2009.

The evidence is clear that the Biden-Harris Administration is not following the science. They are using the disease to grow their power and shrink our civil liberties.\nFor the past several months, the CDC inexplicably stopped updating the figures of how many people have had the virus and recovered. There\u2019s no explanation for that except one: If we know the figure, it will become obvious that their narrative that the virus has a mortality rate of nearly 2% would be completely wrong.\nUnder pressure, the CDC quietly updated the figures last week. They now estimate that 146 million people in the U.S. have had the virus and recovered. The latest death toll is about 750,000. That means the mortality rate is nowhere near 2%. It\u2019s not even 1%. It\u2019s about 0.5%.\nBut the propaganda pushed by the Biden Administration, Big Media, and social media has been so effective that 36% of the country believes the mortality rate is 5% or more.\nIt\u2019s not just that. The \u201cfollow the science\u201d crowd completely ignored a major part of the scientific handling of a disease \u2014 how many people have effective immunity because they got it and recovered. We now know that\u2019s at least 146 million people. But the CDC refuses to say that these people have immunity.\nIn fact, the CDC was recently forced to admit that it has no evidence of any cases of unvaccinated individuals with natural immunity transmitting COVID to another individual after they were reinfected. What? The CDC is supposed to be the gold standard of research on questions like that.\nFortunately, we do have that research from Israel, and it shows that people who have had COVID and recovered have levels of immunity 27 times greater than people who only got the vaccines. Not just 27% greater, but 27 times greater!\nIt all begs the question, why are those 146 million people being told they can\u2019t go to work, go to school, or go to a restaurant unless they get vaccinated? The science suggests they\u2019re better protected than the vaccinated are.\nA third example of how the country is off the rails is the all-out push to vaccinate children. Many countries around the world are not doing that. Taiwan just suspended its program of vaccinating children for COVID.\nFourth, the FDA is reportedly getting ready to recommend booster shots for everyone. But they\u2019re not going to reconvene the advisory committee to evaluate the order, they\u2019re just going to do it. That sounds like someone is playing politics with the science.\nThe advisory committee embraced boosters for the elderly and those with compromised immune systems but refused to universally recommend them. Why is Joe Biden so hellbent on getting everyone jabbed again and again and again?\nIn related news, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals gave the Biden-Harris Administration a withering rebuke Friday. The court\u2019s unanimous decision dismantled Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate on constitutional, statutory, and procedural grounds. Here\u2019s how the Wall Street Journal editorial board described the decision:\n\u201cThis judicial smackdown is so overwhelming that it\u2019s fair to conclude the Administration gave only passing thought to the law. It acted for political reasons, but even that has proven to be a mistake. The White House panicked amid the Afghanistan fiasco and Delta variant breakout, but it missed how resistant millions of people are to government orders regarding their health.\u201d\nIn other words, Biden did what the progressive left always does: He employed coercion to take away our rights.\nIn October 2021, Global Research published an interview with Dr. Peter McCullough, in which he reviews and explains the findings of a September 2021 study published in the journal Toxicology Reports, which states:\n\u201cA novel best-case scenario cost-benefit analysis showed very conservatively that there are five times the number of deaths attributable to each inoculation as those attributable to COVID-19 in the most vulnerable 65+ demographic.\nThe risk of death from COVID-19 decreases drastically as age decreases, and the longer-term effects of the inoculations on lower age groups will increase their risk-benefit ratio, perhaps substantially.\u201d\nMcCullough has impeccable academic credentials. He\u2019s an internist, cardiologist, epidemiologist, and a full professor of medicine at Texas A&M College of Medicine in Dallas. He also has a master\u2019s degree in public health and is known for being one of the \u00a0\u00a0top five most-published medical researchers in the United States, in addition to being the editor of two medical journals.\nAuthors Defend Their Paper\nNot surprisingly, the Toxicology Reports paper has received scathing critique from certain quarters. Still, corresponding author Ronald Kostoff told Retraction Watch that the criticism has actually been \u201can extremely small fraction\u201d of the overall response, which by and large has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive. Kostoff went on to say:\n\u201cGiven the blatant censorship of the mainstream media and social media, only \u00a0one side of the COVID-19 \u2018vaccine\u2019 narrative is reaching the public. Any questioning of the narrative is met with the harshest response \u2026\nI went into this with my eyes wide open, determined to identify the truth, irrespective of where it fell. I could not stand idly by while the least vulnerable to serious COVID-19 consequences were injected with substances of unknown mid and long-term safety.\nWe published a best-case scenario. The real-world situation is far worse than our best-case scenario and could be the subject of a future paper.\nWhat these results show is that we 1) instituted mass inoculations of an inadequately-tested toxic substance with 2) non-negligible attendant crippling and lethal results to 3) potentially prevent a relatively small number of true COVID-19 deaths. In other words, we used a howitzer where an accurate rifle would have sufficed!\u201d\nCOVID Vaccine Campaign Has Had No Discernible Impact\nCertainly, data very clearly show the mass \u201cvaccination\u201d campaign has not had a discernible impact on global death rates. On the contrary, in some cases the death toll shot up after the COVID shots became widely available. You can browse through covid19.healthdata.org to see this for yourself. Several examples are also included at the very beginning of the video.\nThis trend has also been confirmed in a September 2021 study published in the European Journal of Epidemiology. It found COVID-19 case rates are completely unrelated to vaccination rates.\nUsing data available as of September 3, 2021, from Our World in Data for cross-country analysis, and the White House COVID-19 Team data for U.S. counties, the researchers investigated the relationship between new COVID-19 cases and the percentage of the population that had been fully vaccinated.\nSixty-eight countries were included. Inclusion criteria included second dose vaccine data, COVID-19 case data and population data as of September 3, 2021. They then computed the COVID-19 cases per 1 million people for each country and calculated the percentage of population that was fully vaccinated.\nAccording to the authors, there was \u201cno discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last seven days.\u201d If anything, higher vaccination rates were associated with a slight increase in cases. According to the authors:\n\u201cThe trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.\u201d\nThe Kostoff Analysis\nGetting back to the Toxicology Reports paper, which is being referred to as \u201cthe Kostoff analysis,\u201d McCullough says the analysis is definitely making news in clinical medicine. The paper focuses on two factors: assumptions and determinism.\nDeterminism describes how likely something is. For example, if a person takes a COVID \u00a0\u00a0shot, it\u2019s 100% certain they got the injection. It\u2019s not 50% or 75%. It\u2019s an absolute certainty. As a result, that person has a 100% chance of being exposed to whatever risk is associated with that shot.\nOn the other hand, if a person says no to the injection, it\u2019s not 100% chance they\u2019ll get COVID-19, let alone die from it. You have a less than 1% chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and getting sick. So, it\u2019s 100% deterministic that taking the shot exposes you to the risks of the shot, and less than 1% deterministic that you\u2019ll get COVID if you don\u2019t take the shot.\nThe other part of the equation is the assumptions, which are based on calculations using available data, such as pre-COVID death statistics and death reports filed with the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reports System (VAERS).\nMortality Data\nAs noted by McCullough, two reports have detailed COVID jab death data, showing 50% of deaths occur within 24 hours and 80% occur within the first week. In one of these reports, 86% of deaths were found to have no other explanation aside from a vaccine adverse event. McCullough also cites a Scandinavian study that concluded about 40% of post-jab deaths among seniors in assisted living homes are directly due to the injection. He also cites other eye-opening figures:\nThe U.S. Center for Disease Control. Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports having more than 30,000 spontaneous reports of either hospitalizations and/or deaths among the fully vaccinated.\nData from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services show 300,000 vaccinated \u00a0CMS recipients have been hospitalized with breakthrough infections\n60% of seniors over age 65 hospitalized for COVID-19 have been vaccinated\nCOVID Shots Are \u2018Failing Wholesale\u2019\n\u201cWhen we put all these data together, we have clear-cut science that the vaccines are failing wholesale,\u201d McCullough says. The shots are particularly useless in seniors.\nAgain, based on a best-case conservative scenario, seniors are five times more likely to die from the shot than they are from the natural infection. This scenario includes the assumption that the PCR test is accurate and reported COVID deaths were in fact due to COVID-19, which we know is not the case, and the assumption that the shots actually prevent death, which we have no proof of.\nAll things considered, you are FAR better off taking your chances with the natural infection, as McCullough says. The Kostoff analysis also does not take into account the fact that there are safe and effective treatments.\nIt bases its assumptions on the notion that there aren\u2019t any. It also doesn\u2019t factor in the fact that the COVID shots are utterly ineffective against the Delta and other variants. If you take into account vaccine failure against variants and alternative treatments, it skews the analysis even further toward natural infection being the safest alternative.\nFDA and CDC Should Not Run Vaccine Programs\nWhile the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the CDC claim not a single death \u00a0\u00a0following COVID inoculation was caused by the shot, they should not be the ones making the determination, as they are both sponsoring the vaccination campaign.\nThey have an inherent bias. When you conduct a trial, you would never allow the sponsor to tell you whether the product was the cause of death, because you know they\u2019re biased.\n\u201cWe have actually fulfilled all of the Bradford Hill criteria. I\u2019ll tell you right now that COVID-19 vaccine is, from an epidemiological perspective, causing these deaths or a large fraction.\u201d ~ Dr. Peter McCullough\nWhat we need is an external group, a critical event committee, to analyze the deaths being reported, as well as a data safety monitoring board. These should have been in place from the start but were not.\nHad they been, the program would most likely have been halted in February, as by then the number of reported deaths, 186, already exceeded the tolerable threshold of about 150 (based on the number of injections given). Now, we\u2019re well over 17,000. There\u2019s no normal circumstance under which that would ever be allowed.\n\u201cThe CDC and FDA are running the [vaccination] program. They are NOT the people who typically run vaccine programs,\u201d McCullough says. \u201cThe drug companies run vaccine programs.\n\u201cWhen Pfizer, Moderna, J&J ran their randomized trials, we didn\u2019t have any problems. They had good safety oversight. They had data safety monitoring boards. They did OK.\n\u201cI mean, I have to give the drug companies credit.\n\u201cBut the drug companies are now just the suppliers of the vaccine. Our government agencies are now just running the program. There\u2019s no external advisory committee. There\u2019s no data safety monitoring board. There\u2019s no human ethics committee. \u00a0\u00a0NO one is watching out for this!\n\u201cAnd so, the CDC and FDA pretty clearly have their marching orders: \u2018Execute this program; the vaccine is safe and effective.\u2019 They\u2019re giving no reports to Americans. No safety reports. We needed those once a month. They haven\u2019t told doctors which is the best vaccine, which is the safest vaccine.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t told us what groups are to watch out for. How to mitigate risks. Maybe there are drug interactions. Maybe it\u2019s people with prior blood clotting problems or diabetes. They\u2019re not telling us anything!\n\u201cThey literally are blindsiding us, and with no transparency, and Americans now are scared to death. You can feel the tension in America. People are walking off the job. They don\u2019t want to lose their jobs, but they don\u2019t want to die of the vaccine! It\u2019s very clear. They say, \u2018Listen, I don\u2019t want to die. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019m \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not taking the vaccine.\u2019 It\u2019s just that clear.\u201d\nBradford Hill Criteria Are Met \u2014 COVID Jabs Cause Death\nMcCullough goes on to explain the Bradford Hill criterion for causation, which is one of the ways by which we can actually determine that, yes, the shots are indeed killing people. We\u2019re not dealing with coincidence.\n\u201cThe first question we\u2019d ask is: \u2018Does the vaccine have a mechanism of action, a biological mechanism of action, that can actually kill a human being?\u2019 And the answer is yes! Because the vaccines all use genetic mechanisms to trick the body into making the lethal spike protein of the virus.\n\u201cIt is very conceivable that some people take up too much messenger RNA; they \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0produce a lethal spike protein in sensitive organs like the brain or the heart or elsewhere. The spike protein damages blood vessels, damages organs, causes blood clots. So, it\u2019s well within the mechanism of action that the vaccine could be fatal.\n\u201cSomeone could have a fatal blood clot. They could have fatal myocarditis. The FDA has official warnings of myocarditis. They have warnings on blood clots. They have warnings on a fatal neurologic condition called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. So, the FDA warnings, the mechanism of action, clearly say it\u2019s possible.\n\u201cThe second criteria is: \u2018Is it a large effect?\u2019 And the answer is yes! This is not a subtle thing. It\u2019s not 151 versus 149 deaths. This is 15,000 deaths. So, it\u2019s a very large effect size, a large effect.\n\u201cThe third [criteria] is: \u2018Is it internally consistent?\u2019 Are you seeing other things that could potentially be fatal in VAERS? Yes! We\u2019re seeing heart attacks. We\u2019re seeing strokes. We\u2019re seeing myocarditis. We\u2019re seeing blood clots, and what have you. So, it\u2019s internally consistent.\n\u201c\u2018Is it externally consistent?\u2019 That\u2019s the next criteria. Well, if you look in the MHRA, the yellow card system in England, the exact same thing has been found. In the EudraVigilance system in [Europe] the exact same thing\u2019s been found.\n\u201cSo, we have actually fulfilled all of the Bradford Hill criteria. I\u2019ll tell you right now that COVID-19 vaccine is, from an epidemiological perspective, causing these \u00a0\u00a0deaths or a large fraction.\u201d\nZero Tolerance for Elective Drugs Causing Death\nThere may be cases in which a high risk of death from a drug might be acceptable. If you have a terminal incurable disease, for example, you may be willing to experiment and take your chances. Under normal circumstances however, lethal drugs are not tolerated.\nAfter five suspected deaths, a drug will receive a black box warning. At 50 deaths, it will be removed from the market. Considering COVID-19 has a less than 1% risk of death across age groups, the tolerance for a deadly remedy is infinitesimal. At over 17,000 reported deaths, which in real numbers may exceed 212,000, the COVID shots far surpass any reasonable risk to protect against symptomatic COVID-19. As noted by McCullough: \u201cThere is zero tolerance for electively taking a drug or a new vaccine and then dying! There\u2019s zero tolerance for that. People don\u2019t weigh it out and say, \u2018Oh well, I\u2019ll take my chances and die.\u2019 And I can tell you, the word got out about vaccines causing death in early April [2021], and by mid-April the vaccination rates in the \u00a0United States plummeted.\n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t gotten anywhere near our goals. Remember, President Biden set a goal [of 70% vaccination rate] by July 1. We never got there because Americans were frightened by their relatives, people in their churches and their schools dying after the vaccine.\n\u201cThey had heard about it, they saw it. There was an informal internet survey done several months ago, where 12% of Americans knew somebody who had died after the vaccine.\n\u201cI\u2019m a doctor. I\u2019m an internist and cardiologist. I just came from the hospital \u2026 I had a woman die of the COVID-19 vaccine \u2026 She had shot No. 1. She had shot No. 2. After shot No. 2, she developed blood clots throughout her body. She \u00a0required hospitalization. She required intravenous blood thinners. She was ravaged. She had neurologic damage.\n\u201cAfter that hospitalization, she was in a walker. She came to my office. I checked for more blood clots. I found more blood clots. I put her back on blood thinners. I saw her about a month later. She seemed like she was a little better. Family was really concerned. The next month I got called by the Dallas Coroner office saying she was found dead at home.\n\u201cMost of us don\u2019t have any problem with vaccines; 98% of Americans take all the vaccines. \u00a0I think most people who are still susceptible would take a COVID vaccine if they knew they weren\u2019t going to die of it or be injured. And because of these giant safety concerns, and the lack of transparency, we\u2019re at an impasse.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a very labor-constrained market. We\u2019ve got people walking off the job. We\u2019ve got planes that aren\u2019t going to fly, and it\u2019s all because our agencies are \u00a0not being transparent and honest with America about vaccine safety.\u201d\nEarly Treatment Is Crucial, Vaccinated or Not\nAs noted by McCullough, the vast majority of patients that required hospitalization for COVID- 19 is because they\u2019ve not received any treatment and the infection has been allowed free reign for days on end.\n\u201cTo this day, the patients who get hospitalized are largely those who receive no early care at home,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re either denied care or they don\u2019t know about it, and they end up dying.\n\u201cThe vast majority of people who die, die in the hospital; they don\u2019t die at home. And the reason why they end up in the hospital, it\u2019s typically two weeks of lack of treatment. You can\u2019t let a fatal illness brew for two weeks at home with no treatment, and then start treatment very late in the hospital. It\u2019s not going to work.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a very good set of analyses, one in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases \u2026 that showed, day by day, one loses the opportunity of reducing the hospitalization when monoclonal antibodies are delayed \u2026 No doctor should be considered a renegade when they order FDA [emergency use authorized] monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibodies are just as approved as the vaccines.\n\u201cI just had a patient over the weekend, fully vaccinated, who took the booster. A month after the booster she went on a trip to Dubai. She just came back, and she got COVID-19! \u2026 I got her a monoclonal antibody infusion that day. [The following day] she started the sequence of multidrug therapy for COVID-19. I \u00a0am telling you, she is going to get through this illness in a few days \u2026\n\u201cPodcaster Joe Rogan just went through this. Governor Abbott was also a vaccine failure. He went through it. Former President Trump went through it. Americans should see the use of monoclonal antibodies in high-risk patients, followed by drugs in an oral sequenced approach. This is standard of care!\n\u201cIt is supported by the Association of Physicians and Surgeons, the Truth for Health Foundation, the American Front-Line Doctors, and the Front Line Critical \u00a0\u00a0Care Consortium. This is not renegade medicine. This is what patients should have. This is the correct thing! \u2026\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get the monoclonal antibodies, we can certainly use hydroxychloroquine, supported by over 250 studies, ivermectin, supported by over 60 studies, combined with azithromycin or doxycycline, inhaled budesonide \u2026 full-dose aspirin \u2026 nutraceuticals including zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C, quercetin, NAC \u2026 we do oral and nasal decontamination with povidone-iodine.\n\u201cIn acutely sick patients we do it every four hours, [and it] massively reduces the \u00a0viral load \u2026 Fortunately, we have enough doctors now and enough patient awareness, patients who \u2026 understand that early treatment is viable, is necessary, and it should be executed.\u201d\nSupport Christian Journalism\nFree Speech is Free, but the cost to\u00a0publish Free Speech is not.

(Photo by JACK GUEZ / AFP) (Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images)\nJACK GUEZ | AFP | Getty Images\nAs Covid numbers rise and the more contagious delta variant spreads throughout the United States, people want to know what they can do stay safe.\nWith talk of some vaccines being less effective against infection with delta \u2014 including research released Monday from New York University, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showing that Johnson & Johnson's one shot is likely less effective against delta \u2014 and news of third booster mRNA shot being tested and in some countries selectively administered, many are even wondering if they should try and hack more protection by seeking out a second or third shot or by mixing and matching vaccines.\nSome experts are advising additional shots, like Dr. Vin Gupta, a professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, who told CNBC's \"The News with Shepard Smith\" Tuesday that he is advising patients who got J&J to get a Pfizer or Moderna mRNA dose to combat delta.\nHowever, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, currently advise against mixing and matching doses due to a lack of evidence.\nDr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO's chief scientist, cautioned people who are \"voluntarily thinking about [getting] an additional dose,\" during a press briefing July 12.\nWithout more data on the safety and efficacy, taking additional doses beyond the two-dose regimen or mixing and matching vaccines is \"a little bit of a dangerous trend,\" she said.\nHere's what you need to know.\n'Mixing and matching' vaccines\nIndividuals deciding to mix and match their vaccines \u2014 like someone who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine going in search of a shot of an mRNA vaccine as booster, for example \u2014 is not currently advised by the CDC, due to a lack of evidence that they're needed.\nJohnson & Johnson told CNBC that its own data showed the vaccine \"generated strong, persistent activity against the delta variant and other highly prevalent variants.\"\nHowever, Gupta said he hopes that the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC and The Advisory\u00a0Committee\u00a0on Immunization Practices (ACIP) allow people who received the one-dose J&J vaccine to get Moderna or Pfizer's mRNA vaccines.\nGupta noted that the NYU study was done in a laboratory setting. Also, there is evidence that combining the AstraZeneca vaccine, which utilizes the same technology as J&J's but is not available in the U.S. yet, with a second dose of Pfizer and Moderna \"heightens protection and it's safe,\" he said.\nResearchers from Oxford University recently published findings that combining the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine generates a \"robust\" immune response against the virus. \"Based on those studies we should infer that it's safe and effective for J&J-ers,\" Gupta said. \"We're in an emergency and we need to provide national guidance while we're awaiting our own studies internally.\"\nThe CDC says that Covid vaccines are \"not interchangeable\" because the safety and efficacy of \"a mixed-product series\" hasn't been examined. (The Covid mRNA vaccines are the first of their kind to be approved, so there's no precedent for what effect it could have when mixed with another type of vaccine, according to the global vaccine organization Gavi .)\n\"We're in a data-free, evidence-free zone here as far as mix-and-match,\" Swaminathan said during the WHO briefing.\nThat said, the National Institutes of Health is conducting studies that involve giving people a third dose, either of the same vaccine or booster doses of a different vaccine. Results and safety information from the study should be available in the summer or early fall.\nGetting a third dose when you're fully vaccinated\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the WHO, the CDC and the FDA all agree that Americans who are fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. as currently prescribed are all effective against severe illness and death from Covid.\n\"Virtually all Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in United States are now occurring among unvaccinated individuals,\" White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said at a press briefing July 8.\nFor those who are fully vaccinated, seeking out a third dose or getting more doses than are recommended generally brings up two particularly relevant risks, according to Dr. Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the CDC.\nFirst, since there tend to be stronger side effects after the second dose of a two-dose regimen, there's a chance that a third dose could also be associated with higher risk of adverse reactions, Butler said during an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing July 13. There's just not enough data at this stage to determine if that is the case.\nAdditionally, with other types of vaccines, there can be \"a rare problem whereas you get more and more doses, you actually have a muted immune response,\" Pavia said in the briefing. This may be an issue with some Covid vaccines, but it is not likely to be the case with the mRNA Covid vaccines, he said.\nEthical and logistical implications\nIn the United States, 48% of the total population is fully vaccinated against Covid and 67.7% of people have received at least one dose. With those numbers, it's \"not appropriate\" to assume that everyone needs a booster at this stage, Fauci told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on \"Squawk Box\" July 13.\n\"We still haven't vaccinated enough people in the primary part of this,\" he said.\nButler agreed that the \"top priority\" should be to vaccinate people who have received no doses of the Covid vaccine \"as soon as possible,\" before fully vaccinated people get boosters, he said July 13.\nAnd globally, \"to [give out boosters] prematurely would use up a lot of vaccine that much of the world needs, as well as divert our efforts in getting people their first dose of vaccine,\" Dr. Andrew T. Pavia, IDSA fellow and chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Utah School of Medicine, said in a briefing July 13.\n\"We are talking about the possibility of a third shot boost and a major component of the world has never even received a single shot,\" Fauci told CNBC's Becky Quick on \"Squawk Box\" July 13.\n(The White House announced in June that the U.S. would be purchasing 500 million Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines to donate to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and economies and the African Union that lack access to vaccines.)\nBeyond the ethical complications, there are logistical considerations too. \"It will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and who should be taking a second, or a third or a fourth dose,\" Swaminathan said.\nHow and when boosters could be rolled out\nThe ACIP, which develops vaccine recommendations and standards, meets on Thursday, and is set to discuss the clinical considerations for additional doses in immunocompromised individuals.\nFauci did say that the U.S. is not ruling out the idea of a third booster shot, noting that the situation is fluid and contingent upon data that comes out, during an interview with NPR July 13.\nThe FDA and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will determine if, when and who should receive boosters, according to data, Butler said.\nAccording to Butler, there are two groups that are most concerning with regards to getting boosters: older people over age 75 to 80, because they are at highest risk of getting severe Covid and received their vaccines earliest; and people who are immunocompromised and therefore \"have a more limited immune response to the Covid vaccines that are currently available,\" he said.\nPfizer said that data from its current booster study will be available in August, and the company plans to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA for its booster.\nThis story has been updated to include recent research on the effectiveness of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine against the delta variant and Dr. Vin Gupta's commentary on mixing vaccines.\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter\nDon't miss: How the Moderna Covid-19 mRNA vaccine was made so quickly\n4:46\nWhat we're seeing with Covid is not surprising, says Dr. Vin Gupta"}, {"Url": "https://eatthis.com/doctor-covid-thing-to-avoid", "CluewebURLHash": "6AB9D12EBE3E1297722CDFC185FBB79F", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "I'm a Doctor and This Is the Most Dangerous Thing You ...", "Snippet": "The COVID vaccine does not contain heavy metals.

The same vaccine was authorized by the FDA in the US on Friday night. This monumental event is on a par with other historical developments such as the discovery of penicillin or the first steps on the moon.\nSo after all the heartache this despicable virus has caused, why would anyone not want to get vaccinated? According to a recent poll, only about half of Americans want to get the vaccine. Nearly a quarter remain unsure, and the final quarter plan to refuse.\nI'm incredulous. So I'm writing this to set the record straight.\nHere's the question: Do you want life to return to normal by the spring? Read on to see why refusing to get the COVID vaccine would be your #1 worst mistake, and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had Coronavirus .\n1\nThe Many Benefits of Vaccination\nShutterstock\nVaccines save millions of lives. Across the globe, immunizations that are currently in use protect against 19 different viruses. Every year, these vaccinations save 2 million to 3 million lives. Vaccines are a phenomenal public health success. The new COVID-19 vaccine now becomes number 20 on the list.\nVaccines can eradicate viruses completely. If enough of the population gets vaccinated, it is possible to eradicate an infection completely. However, even if total eradication is never achieved, a virus can still be essentially eliminated because cases of infection become so rare.\nVaccines protect you. For you as an individual, the aim of having the vaccine is to stop you from becoming infected. If, however, you do become infected after being vaccinated, there is every likelihood that the infection will be less severe and less prolonged. Vaccines stop you from becoming severely ill and can save your life.\nVaccines create large healthcare savings. Vaccinations have overall health benefits for every country. Worldwide, vaccinations result in billions of dollars of healthcare savings. They also lead to fewer prescriptions of antibiotics, which will reduce antibiotic resistance.\nVaccinations improve life expectancy from other diseases. In one US study of older people, those who received a flu vaccine had a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks, and a 50% lower chance of dying from them than people who hadn't been vaccinated against the flu.\nHere are more simple facts about vaccines:\nImmunizations\nAllow us to undertake safe international travel\nProtect babies and young children from common childhood infections\nProtect and support primary care health services\nEmpower women to plan their families, continue their education and maintain their options in the workplace\nReduce the threat of bioterrorism\nRedress disparities in health between different communities\nHelp maintain peace and prosperity (WHO 2008)\n2\nVaccine Safety\nShutterstock\nA 2015 study published in the journal Vaccine reviewed the medical evidence on vaccine safety. The authors described the meticulous testing and safety procedures used in vaccine development and declared that vaccines were among the safest medicines in clinical use.\nVaccine development and administration involves a very sophisticated reporting system. Very often, when an adverse outcome is reported about a vaccine, it is not actually caused by the vaccine. For example, the flu vaccine contains dead flu virus and can't give you the flu. If you develop the flu within a few days of being vaccinated, chances are you've probably been infected a few days before you got the vaccine.\n3\nHow Could Vaccines Be Harmful?\nShutterstock\nIn the journal Vaccine, the authors considered the ways in which vaccines can potentially be harmful.\nAnaphylaxis\nAnyone can be allergic to anything. That's serious, because if you're unlucky enough to experience acute anaphylaxis, it can be life-threatening. However, the risk of anaphylaxis from vaccines is low and rarely fatal, because anaphylaxis is treatable.\nIn one 2003 study, 7,644,049 doses of vaccine given to children and adolescents resulted in five possible cases of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis, and there were no deaths. That's a tiny risk for a huge benefit.\nThe risk of anaphylaxis from the flu vaccine is estimated to be 1.31 per 1 million vaccine doses.\nWhat about the new COVID vaccine?\nOn the first day of the COVID-19 UK vaccination program, there were two cases of anaphylactoid reaction. Both people affected were treated and have completely recovered.\nThe UK regulatory agency MHRA has said that anyone who has experienced immediate anaphylaxis\u2014usually requiring them to carry an EpiPen\u2014should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine until more information is known.\nIn terms of common allergens, the vaccine is not grown in hen's eggs and is latex-free. It's possible that the risk of an anaphylactoid reaction is due to the small quantity of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the vaccine. PEG is a common ingredient of cosmetic products and has not been associated with significant safety concerns.\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trials did not include people with severe anaphylaxis, as is normal practice. According to the trial data, possible allergic reactions were reported in 0.63% of those who were vaccinated and 0.51% of those given a placebo. Experts have said this is a very low risk. New medicines are always closely monitored, and the monitoring system is working well.\nWhat about giving vaccines to people who are immunocompromised?\n\"Live attenuated\" vaccines are vaccines that contain living organisms modified so they don't cause an infection if you have a healthy immune system. However, people with a severely weakened immune system should not use them.\nThe COVID-19 vaccines are not live attenuated vaccines, so they could potentially be used in people who are immunocompromised. What is not known is how effective the antibody response is in these patients. Further advice is awaited.\nGuillain-Barr \u00e9 syndrome (GBS)\nGBS is an auto-immune condition triggered by a bacterial or a viral infection, leading to nerve damage.\nIt is not clear from medical studies whether vaccination might increase the risk of GBS. In one 2009 study, those who had received the H1N1 vaccination had a lower rate of GBS than those who did not. In other studies, deaths in people with GBS were not considered to be related to the use of any specific vaccinations.\nCollapse\nAround 3% of the population has a fear of needles. Some people may faint when they have a blood test or a shot. Associated head injuries have been reported. When you're vaccinated, a healthcare professional will ensure you're as safe as possible. A 15-minute observation period is recommended after any injection.\n4\nDebunking Vaccine Myths\nShutterstock\nA host of incorrect facts are circulating about the COVID vaccine. Please rest assured that the following statements are all true:\nThe COVID vaccine will not change your DNA.\nThe COVID vaccine does not contain material from a dead fetus.\nThe COVID vaccine does not contain heavy metals.\nThe COVID vaccine does not contain a microchip.\nVaccines are not a cause of autism.\nJust because the vaccine was produced in record time does not mean it's not safe.\nFor more details about these points, read this extremely eloquent post by Chris York on HuffPost.\n5\nThe Need For Herd Immunity\nShutterstock\nYou might be thinking, \"If everyone else gets vaccinated, I don't need to bother.\" This is not correct. For starters, some people can't have the vaccine for medical reasons (for example, those who have severe allergies or are immunocompromised).\nSecond, by not getting the vaccine, you'll inevitably encourage others to follow that example. To protect the full population, we need to create herd immunity, meaning that large numbers of people need to be vaccinated.\nHerd immunity means that so many people have antibodies to a virus that it has nowhere to go. This high level of immunity stops the virus from spreading. To develop herd immunity to COVID, 80% to 90% of us need to get the vaccine.\nRemember that COVID is much more deadly than the flu\nCOVID-10 is not an infection to be trifled with.\n\"Since December 2019, COVID-19 has killed more people in the USA than influenza has in the past five years,\" writes virologist Andrew Stanley Pekosz, Ph.D. One reason, he explains, is that none of us are immune to COVID-19, whereas we're likely to have encountered the flu virus before. COVID causes much more severe disease than influenza, and it has a higher mortality in all age groups except children younger than 12.\nCOVID infection is particularly risky for older adults, those who are immunocompromised, and people with other comorbidities such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity.\nCOVID affects the body differently than influenza. For example, it stimulates blood-clotting mechanisms and increases the risk of thrombosis (blood clots). The death rate from COVID is at least three times higher than that of the flu. Those who survive severe COVID can have long-lasting symptoms, including chronic lung, heart and kidney disease\u2014a.k.a. Long COVID.\nThe best way to deal with COVID-19 is to prevent it. How? Get the COVID vaccine.\n6\nFinal Thoughts\niStock\nWe are all human, and humans make mistakes. But not getting the COVID vaccine is a mistake you can avoid.\nIf you've read through this post, you should be convinced that COVID-19 is a deadly infection and that the new COVID vaccine is safe and effective. Many of the rumors you've heard about the vaccination are completely untrue.\nGet vaccinated to protect yourself and to help protect everyone you love. This is not someone else's responsibility. It's yours.\nIf you want life to return to normal by spring or summer 2021, it's time to roll up your sleeve.\n7\nHow to Survive This Pandemic\niStock\nAs for yourself, do everything you can to prevent getting\u2014and spreading\u2014COVID-19 in the first place: Wear a face mask, get tested if you think you have coronavirus, avoid crowds (and bars, and house parties), practice social distancing, only run essential errands, wash your hands regularly, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, and to get through this pandemic at your healthiest, don't miss these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.\nDeborah Lee, MD\nDr. Deborah Lee is a health and medical writer with an emphasis on women's health.

Bill Gates calls for the withdrawal of all Covid-19 Vaccines; \u2018The vaccines are far more dangerous than anyone imagined.'\u201d\nSimilar articles, screenshots and memes were shared widely, on Facebook in particular, from late August and onward.\nThose posts were erroneous. Gates had made no such remarks. The fabricated quotations, falsely attributed to him, actually originated in an article that was labelled as \u201csatire\u201d after it was first published, on the U.K. website TheExpose.uk (also known as TheDailyExpose.co.uk), which frequently publishes COVID-19 and vaccine-related conspiracy theories. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cOriginated as satire.\u201d\nWhen it was originally published on Aug. 29, The Daily Expose article reported that:\nIn a shocking announcement, Bill Gates, billionaire Microsoft co-founder and the major force behind the COVID-19 vaccines, called for all the COVID-19 genetic-based vaccines to be taken off the market immediately.\nIn an often anguished 19-minute televised speech, Gates said: \u201cWe made a terrible mistake. We wanted to protect people against a dangerous virus. But it turns out the virus is much less dangerous than we thought. And the vaccine is far more dangerous than anyone imagined.\u201d\nThe Daily Expose subsequently updated its post, adding the word \u201cSATIRE\u201d to the headline, as well as the rather significant qualifier \u201cIn an alternative universe\u201d to the claim \u201cBill Gates has called for the withdrawal of all COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d The piece was also given the following editor\u2019s note:\n\u201c\u2026When we first published this article we should have made it clear at the beginning that it was satire rather than at the end. We did not do this and we apologise\u2026\u201d\nHowever, while The Daily Expose has updated its original piece to include \u201csatire\u201d labels, several other websites, which re-published the bogus story without any indication that it was supposedly intended to be humorous, have not followed suit. This is one of several reasons why we cover satire and humor \u2014 content is routinely stripped from its original content, leaving readers with mistaken impressions about its authenticity and accuracy.\nSources:\n\u201cBill Gates Calls for Withdrawal of All Covid Vaccines, They\u2019ve Killed More People than COVID-19 \u2013 The Informer UG.\u201d UGNEWS24, 2 Sept. 2021, https://ugnews24.info/politics/bill-gates-calls-for-withdrawal-of-all-covid-vaccines-theyve-killed-more-people-than-covid-19-the-informer-ug/.\nExpos\u00e9, The. \u201cSATIRE \u2013 In an Alternative Universe Bill Gates Has Called for the Withdrawal of All Covid-19 Vaccines.\u201d The Expose, 29 Aug. 2021, https://theexpose.uk/2021/08/29/bill-gates-calls-for-the-withdrawal-of-all-covid-19-vaccines/.\n\u201cShocking!

There is also evidence that the spike protein on the actual virus can damage cells that line blood vessels.  However, the two different spike proteins behave very differently in the body, and so the assumption that spike proteins generated by the vaccine could also harm cells in the bloodstream is unevidenced.\nAn article published by website The Conservative Woman reports on an interview with a Canadian scientist who claimed researchers had made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d and were \u201cinadvertently inoculating\u201d people with a \u201ctoxin\u201d via the Covid-19 vaccines.\nIn an interview with a Candian broadcaster on 28 May 2021, Dr Byram Bridle \u2014a viral immunologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada\u2014claimed the spike protein generated by the Covid-19 is capable of damaging the cardiovascular system.\nBut the claim is based on assumptions not supported by evidence.\nWhat is the spike protein and what has it to do with vaccines?\nAs we have written before, there is a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus which causes Covid-19), called a spike protein. This spike protein helps the virus enter cells and is also one of the ways the human body\u2019s immune cells recognise a virus and\u00a0 attack it.\nThe Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK work by giving the body instructions on how to make the spike protein, so that if the person is later infected, their immune system can generate a response that attacks the virus (via the spike protein) faster and more effectively.\nDr Bridle\u2019s claims\nDr Bridle\u2019s concern rests on two claims. Firstly, that the spike proteins generated by the vaccine cause cardiovascular damage if they get into the bloodstream. Secondly, that the spike protein produced by the vaccine does not just act locally, at the site of the jab, but gets into the bloodstream and is carried to many other sites in the body.\nScientists who reviewed Dr Bridle\u2019s claims for fact checker Health Feedback have described these assertions as misleading, as they \u201cmisrepresented the results from scientific studies and [were] based on cherry-picked information\u201d.\nThere have been some studies showing that SARS-CoV-2 can damage endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels. One study found signs of endothelial damage and fragments of SARS-CoV-2, including the spike protein, in the brains of 13 people who had died of Covid-19. Researchers injected the spike protein into mice and found that the animals displayed neurological symptoms similar to those seen in Covid-19 patients.\nBut as the Health Feedback article sets out, Dr Bridle\u2019s claim rests on the assumption that if the viral spike protein can cause damage to the cardiovascular system, then the spike protein generated in vaccinated people should be capable of the same.\nIn actual fact, the two spike proteins behave very differently in the body. According to Health Feedback, the spike proteins generated by Covid-19 vaccines differ in three key ways to those attached to SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, in the case of the vaccines, the cells mostly break down the spike proteins into fragments. Secondly, the spike protein generated by a Covid-19 vaccine doesn\u2019t assemble into new viral particles, unlike the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, the spike protein in Covid-19 vaccines is genetically modified to enhance the immune response and to stop it binding to cell receptors in the same way the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would.\nDr Byram\u2019s claim that the spike protein leaves the site of the Covid-19 injection and enters the bloodstream, accumulating in other parts of the body, is based on a purportedly leaked Pfizer study carried out by Japanese researchers, which Dr Bridle said is backed up by a small study consisting of 13 participants who had received the Moderna vaccine and provided blood samples.\nThe study found that the spike protein was found in the blood samples of 11 out of 13 participants. The study specifically notes that \u201cthe clinical relevance of this finding is unknown and should be further explored\u201d. Julie Bettinger, Associate Professor, University British Columbia told Health Feedback that \u201cnothing about being detrimental is mentioned in the publication\u201d.\nAmerican fact checking organisation PolitiFact contacted Dr Bridle directly to ask for more evidence to back up his claim that the Covid-19 vaccine spike proteins are toxins. In an automated email response he sent a document with further claims and questions about the vaccines, and said he planned to write a \u201ccomprehensive public report\u201d.\nPolitiFact said Dr Bridle had not directly produced any evidence to back up his claim.\nCovid-19 vaccine safety\nAt the time of writing, more than 40 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. To date, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received reports of 406 UK reports of suspected adverse reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in which the patient died shortly after vaccination, 863 reports for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, four for the Moderna vaccine and 22 where the brand of vaccine was unspecified.\nAs we have written before, the Yellow Card system for reporting adverse events is based both on medic reports and patients self-reporting , and an adverse event that occurs after vaccination did not necessarily occur because of it.\nIn April the MHRA said there was a possible link between the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and incidents of rare blood clots with lowered platelets. As of 2 June, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 372 cases of these specific blood clots.\nAs we have recently reported, researchers in Israel have found a possible link between mild myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) in young men and getting the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\nThe Israeli government\u2019s health department said there had been 275 cases of myocarditis reported between December 2020 and May 2021.\nThis article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures, videos and stories on Facebook.

But as conspiracy theories float around, many of us wonder: Are COVID vaccines safe?\nCOVID Vaccine myths busted\u00a0 | \u00a0Photo Credit:\u00a0iStock Images\nKey Highlights\nWhen there was no vaccine for COVID-19, many scientists worked day and night to develop vaccine candidates out of which a few made the mark.\nThe deadly disease now has a preventive vaccine, in fact several vaccines, but some people spread the fear they have against such vaccines.\nYou may have heard some conspiracy theories that the vaccines may cause harm etc. Read on to know the truth.\nAccording to health officials, India has administered 13,23,30,640 (132 million) vaccine doses across the country as of 21 April 2021. After vaccinating its frontline COVID-19 warriors (medical, police, sanitation staff etc), India launched its massive COVID-19 vaccination drive at 10.30 am on January 16 via a video conference at the hands.\nContinuous study and data are proving that vaccination helps people combat a disease better, Yet there are a few people who are themselves deficient in true information about a vaccine but liberally give sermons on it, making the vaccine sound like a dangerous gamble. That scares people away and makes them hesitant to get vaccinated. These conspiracy theories are damaging and need to be busted.\nVideo is not supported\nHere are five COVID-19 vaccination myths you should never believe.\nMyth: I have already had COVID once; why vaccinate now?\nFALSE\nThose who have had COVID-19 in the past have no method to tell if reinfection of the COVID-19 virus will happen or not. The antibodies you developed during the COVID-19 infection are meant to help you fight off future infections brought on by the virus. This is called natural immunity. But that too wanes after a while. Your vaccine gives a programme to your immune system that helps it recognise the virus when and if it enters the body and helps it fight it before it infects the body with its power to duplicate fast.\nMYTH: The vaccines have been developed so quickly; they must be unsafe.\nFALSE\nThe authorized vaccines are proven safe\u202fand\u00a0effective. Yes, as the pandemic swept the world, and many countries faced a far worse fate than others, there was pressure on the scientists and research laboratories to find a vaccine and/or a cure fast. Thankfully, within a year of the pandemic, scientists have developed several vaccines in record time. But every one of the vaccine candidates has gone through the same\u00a0rigorous\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0process as other vaccines, meeting all safety standards. There were no concessions and certainly no steps were skipped. Worldwide collaboration, funding, and progress in science and technology helped shorten the timeframe on the\u00a0development of vaccines. You should be able to take these vaccine shots without any doubts and fear as the\u00a0clinical\u00a0trials\u00a0and\u00a0safety\u00a0reviews actually took about the same amount of time as other vaccines.\nMYTH: I will get COVID-19 if I take a vaccine.\nFALSE.\nNone of the COVID-19 vaccines can give you the COVID-19 infection that you dread. None of these vaccines uses the live virus that causes COVID-19. The immunity-rousing process of the vaccine can cause symptoms, such as a fever. But experts warn that this is a normal sign that the body is building immunity to the virus. It doesn't give you COVID-19. \u00a0It is possible to get infected with the virus before the vaccine has had time to fully protect your body. Although the two illnesses share similar symptoms, they are different viruses and there is no evidence that supports the claim that taking the flu vaccine will serve as protection from COVID-19. Clinical data of recent years shows that every year flu epidemics have resulted in an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and around 290 000 to 650 000 deaths globally.\nMyth: I take the Flu-vaccine; that\u2019s enough to prevent COVID-19 which is another type of flu.\nFALSE:\nWe did not experience a typical flu season last year due to the preventative measures taken against Covid-19, say, experts. But that does not mean either of the vaccines replaces the other. You need your flu shots and your COVID-19 vaccine jabs.\nMYTH: Once I have the vaccine, I am free to discard all precautions against COVID-19.\nFALSE.\n\u200bA vaccine cannot give humankind 100 % protection unless it has covered every human and other possible carrier vector animals/hosts like it was done in the case of smallpox. By 1977, the last shots of the smallpox vaccine were given and in 1980, it was declared eradicated. It exists only in the form of frozen samples in the US and Russian labs. Not so with the COVID-19 virus, not quite yet. As the WHO says, no one is safe until everyone is safe. So you will have to follow the vaccine+precautions policy. You must still:\nContinue to wear good quality masks\nWear the masks properly and not as a formality\nAvoid crowded places\nAvoid badly-ventilated, closed places\nWash hands frequently\nNot touch eyes, mouth, nose with unwashed hands\nUse sanitiser and/or soap and water\nObserve social distancing norms\nDisclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purpose only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Also: that the coronavirus is not a public health emergency. This being the same pandemic that has killed over 600,000 Americans while showing signs of a nationwide resurgence in recent days with the extra-contagious Delta variant, which is almost exclusively harming unvaccinated people.\nBut the crazy doesn\u2019t stop there. The fear is that a motion like this one, which may be legally hopeless but is targeted at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could have a real and pernicious impact as the Biden administration battles vaccine disinformation nationwide.\nDr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician and virologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, believes the distorted claims made in the Monday motion are far more dangerous than a mere \u201canti-vaccine publicity stunt.\u201d Over the last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that daily new cases have increased almost 70 percent nationwide and deaths related to the deadly virus have increased by 26 percent. The overwhelming majority of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are in those who have not been vaccinated.\n\u201cThis will scare people into not getting the vaccine,\u201d Hotez told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis motion is directly contributing to anti-vaccine misinformation. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nThe rhetoric is unsurprising for the group that once earned an audience with former Vice President Mike Pence and went viral last July for promoting hydroxychloroquine as a suitable treatment against COVID-19. The group was founded by Dr. Simone Gold, who is now facing charges for participating in the Capital riot, and at one time highlighted Dr. Stella Immanuel, a woman who believes medical ailments are caused by dream-sex with demons and that alien DNA can be used in actual treatment.\nAs previously reported by The Daily Beast, the group has been targeting COVID-19 vaccines since at least December, when it organized a meeting with several conservative influencers and even protested in front of the CDC in Atlanta. The group and their lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTo combat the misinformation, Hotez\u2014a Daily Beast columnist\u2014helped break down some of the most bizarre (and false) claims in the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u201d motion that he says seeks to \u201ccreate a show trial to promote anti-vaccination.\u201d\nBOGUS CLAIM 1: The Three COVID Vaccines Don\u2019t Prevent The Spread of COVID-19\nIn the motion, the group boldly claims that CDC data shows the two-dose vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer and the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine \u201care not effective in treating or preventing\u201d COVID-19. Hotez, however, notes that the three immunizations \u201cnot only reduce symptomatic illness up to 95 percent and asymptomatic illness in the lower 90 percentile, but they halt virus shedding.\u201d Simply put, even if the vaccines are not 100 percent effective at stopping the spread of the deadly virus, the more people that get vaccinated, the lower the spread will be.\n\u201cIf enough people get vaccinated, you stop transmissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201d\nHotez, who has worked on a separate vaccine with colleagues at Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston, also demolished the group\u2019s false claim that the vaccines were developed in the span of 48 hours and therefore cannot be safe. Highlighting that the current pandemic is the \u201cthird major coronavirus pandemic in the last century,\u201d Hotez noted that development into the current vaccines is \u201cin no way a new concept.\u201d\n\u201cThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are built on research and development that has been in the works for the last decade at least,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cThose two vaccines are also mRNA vaccines, which were first identified in the 1960s. So the concept that these two vaccines were developed in two days is just wrong.\u201d\nBOGUS CLAIM 2: Vaccines Are More Harmful To Minors Than The Virus Itself\nIn the motion, the group falsely claims that minors under the age of 18 face \u201cstatistically zero chance of death from\u201d COVID-19, while the vaccine could make them susceptible to heart inflammation, or myocarditis. The CDC did in fact report about 300 cases of the heart issue in younger people last month, but the number is out of 20 million who have been vaccinated, indicating that the number is statistically \u201cextremely rare,\u201d Hotez noted.\n\u201cThe frequency of myocarditis in young people is about 1 in 70,000. That\u2019s statistically nothing to be worried about,\u201d he said, adding that there are more cases of young people who have gotten myocarditis from COVID-19 itself than the vaccine. \u201cThe risk of you getting myocarditis from COVID-19 is far higher than from you getting it from the vaccine.\u201d\nBOGUS CLAIM 3: Americans Were Brainwashed by Pandemic Fear\u2014And Unfairly Consented to the Vaccine\nIn one of the most bonkers claims in the 67-page memo, the group suggests that the nationwide lockdowns that occurred last year to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus manipulated Americans into getting the lifesaving jab. It\u2019s a move that they claim is similar to \u201cauthoritarian and totalitarian conditions.\u201d\nTrying to prove the point with a chart seemingly taken directly from the Canadian internet, the group also claims that guidelines put in place last year are similar to the brainwashing methods used by Communists in the 1950s. Among the claims in the chart is the idea that the government tried to develop \u201ctotal surveillance with nanochips and 5G\u201d\u2014false conspiracies about the coronavirus that are popular on far-right fringes and have been repeatedly debunked by scientists.\n\u201cAmericans have been brainwashed into not accepting COVID vaccines because they have been brainwashed by anti-vaccine aggression,\u201d Hotez said on Tuesday. \u201cThey are doing the brainwashing with anti-science, anti-vaccine aggression. The disinformation is causing more harm.\u201d\nBOGUS CLAIM 4: Forcing Previously Infected People To Get The Vaccine Will Make Them Sick\nIn the motion, the group expresses grave concern for individuals who have gotten the vaccine after previously testing positive for COVID-19, stating that \u201cthis population has reported seriously medical harm, including death.\u201d Hotez, however, pointed out there is no data supporting that claim. He explained that the group was trying to use vaccine-driven disease enhancement\u2014or the phenomenon that components of the immune system that should protect against COVID-19 will end up making individuals more ill\u2014to justify their claim with proper data.\nThe doctor pointed to a November 2020 \u201cScience Translational Medicine\u201d review, which concluded that data did not support any concern about this enhancement theory anymore \u201cthan is appropriate for the development of any viral vaccine.\u201d\n\u201cThere is not a higher death rate of those receiving the vaccine. There has been no evidence linking that to that vaccine,\u201d he said, stating that while the concept was a concern at the start of vaccine development, there has been no substantial problem since the vaccine rollout in December.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that people who had COVID-19 are in any medical danger after getting the vaccine. Their antibody response can handle it.\u201d\nThe debunked medical claims aside, Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University global-health expert, said that while the motion filed could start a \u201clegal flood against our vaccination system,\u201d it will not stop the vaccination process that has been widely successful in the United States. But like Hotez, he worried about the real-world impact of legal quests like this one.\n\u201cThis kind of [injunction] is a stain on the United States of America. Even launching the [motion], no matter what happens\u2014they will lose it\u2014just underlines to Trump supporters that this vaccine is not to be trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what will cause thousands and thousands of preventable deaths and that\u2019s utterly irresponsible.\u201d\nPilar Melendez\nSenior National Reporter\n@pbmelendez Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com\nGot a tip?

The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias.\nBBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given\nAll of the work and findings are checked and verified independently.\nThe Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside.\nWho approves vaccines or treatments?\nApproval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective.\nChecks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks.\nIn the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.\nWhat is the fast-track approval for vaccines against new variants?\nScientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge.\nThe UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can be fast-tracked for approval if needed.\nNo corners will be cut, with safety paramount.\nBut lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed.\nInstead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used.\nWhat's in the Covid vaccines?\nPfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines.\nThey do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus.\nVaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.\nWill the vaccine give me side effects?\nVaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.\nSome people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.\nCommon reactions that may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles.\nWhat about serious reactions?\nIt is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to very rare cases of blood clots. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too.\nThe chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines.\nWhat about allergies?\nAllergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients are listed.\nThere have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\nAs a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab.\nBe aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation).\nWhat if I've already had Covid?\nPeople will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past.\nThat's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.\nGuidance says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with \"long\" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered.\nHow animal-friendly are vaccines and do they contain alcohol?\nSome vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine.\nThe Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.\nThe British Islamic Medical Association says there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example."}, {"Url": "https://muhealth.org/our-stories/how-do-we-know-covid-19-vaccine-wont-have-long-term-side-effects", "CluewebURLHash": "BB55C1C0772EBE378C61451BD965CB3D", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "How Do We Know the \ue000COVID\ue001-19 \ue000Vaccine\ue001 Won\u2019t Have Long-Term ...", "Snippet": "The \ue000vaccine\ue001 development process, from clinical trials to ongoing monitoring, helps to uncover and understand side effects.

The vaccine was put on pause when health officials learned that a small number of people who received the vaccine experienced a serious blood clotting problem.\nAbout 7.4 million Americans had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when regulators paused its administration to investigate a handful of cases in which people had blood clots. All of the cases emerged within two weeks of vaccination.\nUpon reviewing information about the cases, federal health officials determined that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk, and they approved resumed use of the vaccine.\nThis is how the system is designed to work if unexpected side effects emerge.\nHistory shows this is a common pattern. When new vaccines are released, the unknown side effects, if any, show up within two months of vaccination. This history goes back to at least the 1960s with the oral polio vaccine and examples continue through today.\nBecause of this, scientists and public health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, during and after a vaccine becomes available to the public.\nCOVID-19 vaccine technologies have been studied for years and used in other treatments without issue.\nmRNA vaccines. The vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to deliver a message to your immune system with instructions on how to fight the coronavirus infection.\nResearchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. mRNA vaccines have been studied before for influenza, Zika and rabies. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Learn more about how mRNA vaccines work.\nAdenovector vaccines. Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver instructions that teach cells how to fight the coronavirus infection. In the case of the COVID-19 case, it\u2019s the adenovirus, a common virus that causes colds or flu-like symptoms. However, the adenovirus was modified so it can enter cells but can\u2019t replicate or cause illness.\nScientists began creating viral vectors in the 1970s, and they have been studied for gene therapy and cancer treatment. Some vaccines recently used for Ebola outbreaks have used viral vector technology, and studies have focused on viral vector vaccines against other infectious diseases such as Zika, influenza and HIV. Learn more about how the Johnson & Johnson vaccine works.\nThe vaccine development process, from clinical trials to ongoing monitoring, helps to uncover and understand side effects.\nClinical trials are a key part of vaccine development and involve evaluating use in tens of thousands of study participants. All of the COVID-19 vaccines went through this rigorous process before authorization.\nIn reviewing results from the trials, the federal Food and Drug Administration must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine.\nAfter vaccines are authorized and in use by the public, public health officials continue monitoring the data as an additional safety measure. Manufacturers must have a plan to report follow-up data, including any events such as hospitalizations and deaths, and they must continue research to generate more data on safety and efficacy.

As we also noted: Dr. Malone is not an \u201canti-vaxxer.\u201d He has \u2014 in fact \u2014 consecrated his long career to vaccine development.\nYet, he harbors grave reservations about these particular vaccines. What is his central bogey, his primary hobgoblin? He believes the vaccines may be aiding, abetting and comforting the enemy virus. Vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic is \u201cbad science,\u201d Dr. Malone argues. It is creating an \u201carms race\u201d with the virus.\nFrom his recent Washington Times article, which we here quote, at a length very nearly obscene:\nThe Biden administration\u2019s strategy to universally vaccinate in the middle of the pandemic is bad science and badly needs a reboot.\nThis strategy will likely prolong the most dangerous phase of the worst pandemic since 1918 and almost assuredly cause more harm than good \u2013 even as it undermines faith in the entire public health system.\nFour flawed assumptions drive the Biden strategy. The first is that universal vaccination can eradicate the virus and secure economic recovery by achieving herd immunity throughout the country (and the world).\u00a0 However, the virus is now so deeply embedded in the world population that, unlike polio and smallpox, eradication is unachievable. SARS-CoV-2 and its myriad mutations will likely continually circulate, much like the common cold and influenza.\nThe second assumption is that the vaccines are (near) perfectly effective. However, our currently available vaccines are quite \u201cleaky.\u201d While good at preventing severe disease and death, they only reduce, not eliminate, the risk of infection, replication, and transmission. As a slide deck from the Centers for Disease Control has revealed, even 100% acceptance of the current leaky vaccines combined with strict mask compliance will not stop the highly contagious Delta variant from spreading.\nThe third assumption is that the vaccines are safe.\u00a0 Yet scientists, physicians, and public health officials now recognize risks that are rare but by no means trivial.\u00a0 Known side effects include serious cardiac and thrombotic conditions, menstrual cycle disruptions, Bell\u2019s Palsy, Guillain Barre syndrome, and anaphylaxis.\nUnknown side effects which virologists fear may emerge include existential reproductive risks, additional autoimmune conditions, and various forms of disease enhancement, i.e., the vaccines can make people more vulnerable to reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 or reactivation of latent viral infections and associated diseases such as shingles.\nWith good reason, the FDA has yet to approve the vaccines now administered under Emergency Use Authorization.\nThe failure of the fourth \u201cdurability\u201d assumption is the most alarming and perplexing.\u00a0 It now appears our current vaccines are likely to offer a mere 180-day window of protection \u2013 a decided lack of durability underscored by scientific evidence from Israel and confirmed by Pfizer, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other countries.\nA mere six months of immunity? Will the authorities order us to take vaccination on a rotating six-month merry-go-round? But would not the risk of death or disability rise with each poke?\nHere, we are already being warned of the need for universal \u201cbooster\u201d shots at six-month intervals for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 The obvious broader point that militates for individual vaccine choice is that repeated vaccinations, each with a small risk, can add up to a big risk.\nIt\u2019s an arms race with the virus.\nThe most important reason why a universal vaccination strategy is imprudent tracks to the collective risk associated with how the virus responds when replicating in vaccinated individuals.\nHere, basic virology and evolutionary genetics tell us the goal of any virus is to infect and replicate in as many people as possible.\u00a0 A virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\nThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time. However, a universal vaccination policy deployed in the middle of a pandemic can turn this normal Darwinian taming process into a dangerous vaccine arms race.\nIs Dr. Malone correct? Are the vaccines forcing a spiraling arms race with the virus? But how?\nThe essence of this arms race is this: The more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\nScience tells us here that today\u2019s vaccines, which use novel gene therapy technologies, generate powerful antigens that direct the immune system to attack specific components of the virus. Thus, when the virus infects a person with a \u201cleaky\u201d vaccination, the viral progeny will be selected to escape or resist the effects of the vaccine.\nIf the entire population has been trained via a universal vaccination strategy to have the same basic immune response, then once a viral escape mutant is selected, it will rapidly spread through the entire population \u2013 whether vaccinated or not.\nWhat then is to be done? Are you yelling for a full vaccination halt? What does the good doctor prescribe?\nA far more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable. This will limit the amount of vaccine-resistant mutations and thereby slow, if not halt, the current vaccine arms race\u2026\nThere has been much controversy over ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. Yet, with the emergence of a growing body of scientific evidence, we can be assured these two medicines are safe and effective in prophylaxis and early treatment when administered under a physician\u2019s supervision.\nNumerous other useful treatments range from famotidine/celecoxib, fluvoxamine, and apixaban to various anti-inflammatory steroids, Vitamin D, and zinc.\nThe broader goal when administering these agents is to moderate symptoms and take death off the table, particularly for the unvaccinated. Unlike vaccines, these agents are generally not dependent on specific viral properties or mutations but instead mitigate or treat the inflammatory symptoms of the disease itself\u2026\nThe American people deserve better than a universal vaccination strategy under the flag of bad science and enforced through authoritarian measures.\nEven CNN has conceded that: \u201cVaccination alone won\u2019t stop the rise of variants and in fact could push the evolution of strains that evade their protection, researchers warned.\u201d\nDr. Douglas Corrigan is a Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Here he explains \u2014 from what we can discern \u2014 how vaccination can play the devil with the immune system:\nWill a vaccine to SARS-CoV-2 actually make the problem worse? Although not a certainty, all of the current data says that this prospect is a real possibility that needs to be paid careful attention to\u2026\nIn certain viruses, the binding of a non-neutralizing antibody to the virus can direct the virus to enter and infect your immune cells. This occurs through a receptor called Fc\u03b3RII. Fc\u03b3RII is expressed on the outside of many tissues of our body, and in particular, in monocyte derived macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell.\nIn other words, the presence of the non-neutralizing antibody now directs the virus to infect cells of your immune system, and these viruses are then able to replicate in these cells and wreak havoc on your immune response. One end of the antibody grabs onto the virus, and the other end of the antibody grabs onto an immune cell. Essentially, the non-neutralizing antibody enables the virus to hitch a ride to infect immune cells.\nThis can cause a hyperinflammatory response, a cytokine storm, and a generally dysregulation of the immune system that allows the virus to cause more damage to our lungs and other organs of our body. In addition, new cell types throughout our body are now susceptible to viral infection due to the additional viral entry pathway facilitated by the Fc\u03b3RII receptor, which is expressed on many different cell types.\nWhat this means is that you can be given a vaccine, which causes your immune system to produce an antibody to the vaccine, and then when your body is actually challenged with the real pathogen, the infection is much worse than if you had not been vaccinated.\nMight this explain the surge in cases? We do not know, of course. But it seems a plausible hypothesis. To return to Dr. Malone:\nThe leadership of Pfizer says, we\u2019re going to need a booster in six months because the durability of our vaccines is waning. By the way, that\u2019s exactly the window when Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) becomes the greatest risk, is during the waning phase of a vaccine.\nWhat about Dr. Fauci? Was he aware of the potential vaccination hazards?\nIf yes, should he have hoisted a red flag of warning? Dr. Fauci does boss the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \u2014 a desk within the National Institutes of Health.\nThe same National Institutes of Health has expressed this very concern:\nThe specific and significant COVID-19 risk of ADE should have been and should be prominently and independently disclosed to research subjects currently in vaccine trials, as well as those being recruited for the trials and future patients after vaccine approval, in order to meet the medical ethics standard of patient comprehension for informed consent.\nWe are certainly no physician. Yet if we may depart with a warning for mothers-to-be\u2026\nWe are informed that the miscarriage rate among women receiving the vaccine within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is an atrocious 82%. The normal rate \u2014 we understand \u2014 is 10%.\nHere researcher Steven Kirsch takes to his rooftop\u2026 and shouts:\nIt is baffling that the CDC says the vaccine is safe for pregnant women when it is so clear that this is not the case. For example, one of our family friends is a victim of this. She miscarried at 25 weeks \u2026 She had her first shot 7 weeks ago, and her second shot 4 weeks ago.\nThe baby had severe bleeding of the brain and other disfigurements. Her gynecologist had never seen anything like that before in her life. They called in a specialist who said it was probably a genetic defect (because everyone buys into the narrative that the vaccine is safe it is always ruled out as a possible cause).\nNo VAERS report. No CDC report. Yet the doctors I\u2019ve talked to say that it is over 99% certain it was the vaccine. The family doesn\u2019t want an autopsy for fear that their daughter will find out it was the vaccine. This is a perfect example of how these horrible side effects just never get reported anywhere.\nHow many similar tales already exist \u2014 and will exist yet?\nYou may choose to vaccinate or not to vaccinate. Yet, do you not have a right to know the hazards\u2026 so that you may make an educated decision?\nAnswer please, Dr. Fauci.\nRegards,\nBrian Maher\nManaging Editor, The Daily Reckoning\nYou Can\u2019t Blame the Fed\nThey\u2019ve Secretly Raised Your Taxes"}, {"Url": "https://newsrescue.com/vaccine-researcher-admits-big-mistake-spike-protein-in-cv-jabs-dangerous-toxin", "CluewebURLHash": "7F38312A14613319F93195F276AFB53C", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Vaccine Researcher Admits \u2018Big Mistake,\u2019: Spike Protein in ...", "Snippet": "\u2018Terrifying\u2019 new research finds \ue000vaccine\ue001 spike protein unexpectedly in bloodstream.

The protein is linked to blood clots, heart and brain damage, and potential risks to nursing babies and fertility\nby Celeste McGovern\nMay 31, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) \u2014 New research shows that the coronavirus spike protein from COVID-19 vaccination unexpectedly enters the bloodstream, which is a plausible explanation for thousands of reported side-effects from blood clots and heart disease to brain damage and reproductive issues, a Canadian cancer vaccine researcher said last week.\n\u201cWe made a big mistake. We didn\u2019t realize it until now,\u201d said Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at University of Guelph, Ontario, in an interview with Alex Pierson last Thursday, in which he warned listeners that his message was \u201cscary.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin,\u201d Bridle said on the show, which is not easily found in a Google search but went viral on the internet this weekend.\nBridle, a vaccine researcher who was awarded a $230,000 government grant last year for research on COVID vaccine development, said that he and a group of international scientists filed a request for information from the Japanese regulatory agency to get access to what\u2019s called the \u201c biodistribution study .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever scientists have been privy to seeing where these messenger RNA [mRNA] vaccines go after vaccination,\u201d said Bridle. \u201cIs it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is: absolutely not. It\u2019s very disconcerting.\u201d\nNewsRescue\u2013\nVaccine researchers had assumed that novel mRNA COVID vaccines would behave like \u201ctraditional\u201d vaccines and the vaccine spike protein \u2014 responsible for infection and its most severe symptoms \u2014 would remain mostly in the vaccination site at the shoulder muscle. Instead, the Japanese data showed that the infamous spike protein of the coronavirus gets into the blood where it circulates for several days post-vaccination and then accumulated in organs and tissues including the spleen, bone marrow, the liver, adrenal glands, and in \u201cquite high concentrations\u201d in the ovaries.\n\u201cWe have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin. It can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation,\u201d Bridle said.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is what allows it to infect human cells. Vaccine manufacturers chose to target the unique protein, making cells in the vaccinated person manufacture the protein which would then, in theory, evoke an immune response to the protein, preventing it from infecting cells.\nA large number of studies has shown that the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, such as blood clotting and bleeding, are due to the effects of the spike protein of the virus itself.\n\u201cWhat has been discovered by the scientific community is the spike protein on its own is almost entirely responsible for the damage to the cardiovascular system, if it gets into circulation,\u201d Bridle told listeners.\nLab animals injected with purified spike protein into their bloodstream developed cardiovascular problems, and the spike protein was also demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier and cause damage to the brain.\nA grave mistake, according to Bridle, was the belief that the spike protein would not escape into the blood circulation. \u201cNow, we have clear-cut evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles manufacture this protein \u2014 that the vaccine itself, plus the protein \u2014 gets into blood circulation,\u201d he said.\nBridle cited the recent study which detected SARS-CoV-2 protein in the blood plasma of 11 of 13 young healthcare workers that had received Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, including three with detectable levels of spike protein. A \u2018subunit\u2019 protein called S1, part of the spike protein, was also detected.\u00a0Spike protein was detected an average of 15 days after the first injection. One patient had spike protein detectable on day 29, one day after an injection, which disappeared\u00a0two days later.\nEffects on heart and brain\nOnce in circulation, the spike protein can attach to specific ACE2 receptors that are on blood platelets and the cells that line blood vessels. \u201cWhen that happens it can do one of two things: it can either cause platelets to clump, and that can lead to clotting. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been seeing clotting disorders associated with these vaccines. It can also lead to bleeding.\u201d Bridle also said the spike protein in circulation would explain recently reported heart problems in youths who had received the shots.\n\u201cThe results of this leaked Pfizer study tracing the biodistribution of the vaccine mRNA are not surprising, but the implications are terrifying,\u201d Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told LifeSiteNews. \u201cIt is now clear\u201d that vaccine content is being delivered to the spleen and the glands, including the ovaries and the adrenal glands. \u201cThe released spike protein is being shed into the medium and then eventually reaches the bloodstream causing systemic damage. ACE2 receptors are common in the heart and brain, and this is how the spike protein causes cardiovascular and cognitive problems,\u201d\u00a0Seneff said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced it was studying reports of \u201cmild\u201d heart conditions following COVID-19 vaccination, and last week 18 teenagers in the state of Connecticut alone were hospitalized for heart problems that developed shortly after they took COVID-19 vaccines.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was halted in a number of countries and is no longer recommended for younger people because of its link to life-threatening and fatal blood clots, but mRNA COVID vaccines have been linked to hundreds of reports of blood clotting events as well.\nFDA warned of spike protein danger\nPediatric rheumatologist J. Patrick Whelan had warned a vaccine advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration of the potential for the spike protein in COVID vaccines to cause microvascular damage causing damage to the liver, heart, and brain in \u201cways that were not assessed in the safety trials.\u201d\nNewsRescue\u2013 #LongHaulers: Spike Protein Present on Covid And in Vaccines Dangerously Modifies Genes Even After Exposure \u2013 Texas Tech Uni Study\nWhile Whelan did not dispute the value of a coronavirus vaccine that worked to stop transmission of the disease (which no COVID vaccine in circulation has been demonstrated to do), he said, \u201cit would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on other organs.\u201d\nVaccine-associated spike protein in blood circulation could explain myriad reported adverse events from COVID vaccines, including the 4,000 deaths to date, and nearly 15,000 hospitalizations, reported to the U.S. government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of May 21, 2021. Because it is a passive reporting system, these reports are likely only the tip of an iceberg of adverse events since a Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare study found that less than one percent of side-effects that physicians should report in patients following vaccination are in fact reported to VAERS.\nNursing babies, children and youths, frail, most at risk\nBridle said the discovery of vaccine-induced spike protein in blood circulation would have implications for blood donation programs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want transfer of these pathogenic spike proteins to fragile patients who are being transfused with that blood,\u201d he said.\nThe vaccine scientist also said the findings suggested that nursing babies whose mothers had been vaccinated were at risk of getting COVID spike proteins from her breast milk.\nBridle said that \u201cany proteins in the blood will get concentrated in breast milk,\u201d and \u201cwe have found evidence of suckling infants experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract\u201d in VAERS.\nAlthough Bridle did not cite it, one VAERS report describes a five-month-old breastfed infant whose mother received a second dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine in March. The following day, the baby developed a rash and became \u201cinconsolable,\u201d refused to nurse, and developed a fever. The report says the baby was hospitalized with a diagnosis of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a rare blood disorder in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The baby died.\nThe new research also has \u201cserious implications for people for whom SARS Coronavirus 2 is not a high risk pathogen, and that includes all of our children.\u201d\nEffect on fertility and pregnancy?\nThe high concentration of spike protein found in testes and ovaries in the secret Pfizer data released by the Japanese agency raises questions, too. \u201cWill we be rendering young people infertile?\u201d Bridle asked.\nThere have been thousands of reports of menstrual disorders by women who had taken a COVID-19 shot, and hundreds of reports of miscarriage in vaccinated pregnant women, as well as of disorders of reproductive organs in men.\nVicious smear campaign\nIn response to a request, Bridle emailed a statement to LifeSiteNews on Monday morning, stating that since the radio interview he had received hundreds of positive emails. He added, too, that \u201ca vicious smear campaign has been initiated against me. This included the creation of a libelous website using my domain name.\u201d\n\u201cSuch are the times that an academic public servant can no longer answer people\u2019s legitimate questions with honesty and based on science without fear of being harassed and intimidated,\u201d Brindle wrote. \u201cHowever, it is not in my nature to allow scientific facts to be hidden from the public.\u201d\nHe attached a brief report outlining the key scientific evidence supporting what he said in the interview. It was written with his colleagues in the Canadian COVID Care Alliance (CCCA) \u2014 a group of independent Canadian doctors, scientists, and professionals whose declared aim is \u201cto provide top quality, evidence-based information about COVID-19, intent on reducing hospitalizations and saving more lives.\u201d\nA focus of the statement was the risk to children and teens who are the target of the latest vaccine marketing strategies, including in Canada.\nAs of May 28, 2021, there have been 259,308 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canadians 19 years and under. Of these, 0.048% were hospitalized, but only 0.004% died, according to the CCCA statement. \u201cSeasonal influenza is associated with more severe illness than COVID-19.\u201d\nGiven the small number of young research subjects in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine trials and the limited duration of clinical trials, the CCCA said questions about the spike protein and another vaccine protein must be answered before children and teens are vaccinated, including whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier, whether the vaccine spike protein interferes with semen production or ovulation, and whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the placenta and impacts a developing baby or is in breast milk.\nLifeSiteNews sent the Public Health Agency of Canada the statement of CCCA and asked for a response to Bridle\u2019s concerns. The agency responded that it was working on the questions but did not send answers before publication time.\nPfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson did not respond to questions about Bridle\u2019s concerns. Pfizer did not respond to questions about how long the company was aware of its research data that the Japanese agency had released, showing spike protein in organs and tissue of vaccinated individuals.\nUpdated on June 1, 12:15 p.m. to include an additional comment by\u00a0Stephanie Seneff.\nVaccine researcher admits \u2018big mistake,\u2019 says spike protein is dangerous \u2018toxin\u2019\nVaccine researcher admits \u2018big mistake,\u2019 says spike protein is dangerous \u2018toxin\u2019\n\u2018Terrifying\u2019 new research finds vaccine spike protein unexpectedly in bloodstream.

Getting vaccinated reduces the chance that \u201cwe\u2019ll get something worse than the delta variant. Something worse could very well ignore all the vaccines.\u201d\nMany people are hampered by the logistics of taking time off work, finding child care and getting to a vaccine site. Still others have legitimate questions but are not sure where to find the answers.\nPeople flock Sixth Avenue near Radio City Music Hall.

(Luiz C. Ribeiro/for New York Daily News)\nA sizable number, though, adhere to theories that simply have no basis in reality.

U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican,  was banned from Twitter for a week on Monday for spewing nonsense about vaccines and masks not working. Likewise, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, was taken down from YouTube for saying that masks don\u2019t work.\nDemonstrators gather outside Flathead High School to protest the Kalispell School District's face mask requirement on March 9, 2021, in Kalispell, Mont.

(Hunter D'Antuono /AP Photo)\nHere is a list of the biggest coronavirus and vaccine myths, and the impediments they bring to curbing this public health crisis that has killed more than 600,000 people in the U.S. alone since early 2020.\nMyth: Some COVID shots will turn people into chimpanzees.\nTruth: Um, no. Facebook just last week dismantled a viral disinformation network headquartered in Russia, removing hundreds of accounts that were convincing social media influencers to push phony claims such as this one about coronavirus vaccines.\nMyth: Coronavirus vaccines make you magnetic.\nTruth: This one tops the CDC\u2019s myth list. It\u2019s physically impossible, the agency points out, as the vaccines contain exactly zero magnetic compounds. For those who don\u2019t trust the nation\u2019s top health agency, the proponents of the theory could not themselves prove its veracity.\nMyth: The COVID vaccine implants a microchip that nefarious tech billionaires, specifically Microsoft founder Bill Gates, will use to track people.\nTruth: This one has been the butt of many a late-night comedic monologue, but the traction it still seems to have has stymied many \u2014 not least of all Gates. It has been debunked by everyone from the Mayo Clinic on down.\n\u201cYou have a cellphone and you\u2019re on social media,\u201d said Chrysalis Wright, an associate lecturer in the psychology department of the University of Central Florida who focuses on understanding the allure of misinformation and so-called fake news. \u201cThey\u2019re already tracking you, based on your own reasoning.\u201d\nTwo mass promoters of this one are Ty and Charlene Bollinger, \u201canti-vax entrepreneurs who run a network of accounts that market books and DVDs about vaccines, cancer and COVID-19,\u201d said the Center for Countering Online Digital Hate in a recent report. The Bollingers have promoted the conspiracy theory that Gates plans to inject everyone with microchips as part of a vaccination program, the report says.\nThe only chip idea that Gates has backed so far is that of a birth control device that would be implanted under a woman\u2019s skin \u2014 with her consent and knowledge \u2014 and automatically release hormones, as BBC News reported in 2014.\nMyth: The vaccine will alter your DNA.\nTruth: Vaccines based on mRNA teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response, but the mRNA (\u201dm\u201d stands for messenger) never enters the cell\u2019s nucleus, which is where the DNA resides, the CDC explains. In fact, after delivering the instructions, it breaks down almost immediately. Likewise, a \u201cviral vector\u201d vaccine takes a modified version of a different virus and uses it to deliver immune-response instructions to a cell \u2014 again, never coming into contact with one\u2019s DNA.\nMyth: Vaccines \u2014 any vaccines \u2014 cause autism.\nTruth: This has been a fear since long before COVID. It has been traced back to a since-debunked  study by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon whose license was later yanked. The study, published in the esteemed journal The Lancet, was taken down after severe procedural irregularities were noted. In addition, no one was ever able to duplicate his results.\nMyth: The COVID vaccine can impair fertility, make you infertile entirely or cause a woman to miscarry.\nTruth: This may stem from the apparent mixed messages when the vaccine was approved for emergency use. It wasn\u2019t recommended for pregnant women, University of Central Florida\u2019s Wright pointed out, but only because it hadn\u2019t yet been tested on them. Since then enough evidence has come in to convince medical experts that the vaccine is not only safe for pregnant or would-be pregnant women but also will help ward off severe illness. The CDC last week urged pregnant women to get the shot.\nMyth: Vaccines make you sick, can give you COVID, and have uncertain long-term side effects.\nTruth: Any immediate side effects from the vaccine are short-lived, and do not actually constitute illness from the vaccine. The symptoms are one\u2019s immune response, and mean that your body is making the antibodies that will fight off the real thing.\nMyth: The vaccines were rapidly developed and tested, and therefore their safety cannot be trusted.\nTruth: Years of research went into developing the mRNA technology underlying the Pfizer and Moderna shots, as The Associated Press reported extensively last December.\n\u201cThe emergency situation warranted an emergency response, but that does not mean that companies bypassed safety protocols or didn\u2019t perform adequate testing,\u201d the Mayo Clinic said on its website.\nThis may stem in part from the dubbing of last year\u2019s vaccine effort as \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d said Jay Van Bavel, an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, telling the Daily News, \u201cIt was a PR decision rather than a way to frame something you wanted to build confidence in.\u201d\nMyth: The fact that the vaccines only have emergency use authorization means they\u2019re experimental \u2014 and possibly unsafe.\nTruth: When the vaccines were approved for emergency use, exhaustive trials had already been conducted. In addition, both Van Bavel and Wright believe that full authorization, which is most likely on tap for the coming weeks, will give some vaccine-hesitant people the confidence to go forward with the jab.\nMyth: Someone who has already had coronavirus is immune.\nTruth: This is inaccurate on two counts. For one, the body\u2019s immune response is not as strong as the one the vaccines help create. Second, the vaccine has been shown to improve the symptoms of long-haul COVID patients who continue to suffer long after the infection itself has cleared.\nMyth: The virus is not dangerous; it\u2019s more like the flu. Moreover, the entire pandemic is a hoax.\nTruth: Many of the people who have said that are dead.\nThe COVID landscape is littered with grieving loved ones. Among the casualties are a Texas pastor who preached that coronavirus was a wake-up call for fornicating sinners; a conservative radio talk show host who spent June telling people not to get the vaccine and July dying from it, and a man who famously said he had \u201c 99 problems but a vax ain\u2019t one .\u201d\nA Texas politician also succumbed earlier this month, five days after posting an anti-vax meme. There was also the Ohio man who called the coronavirus lockdown a political ploy before taking ill, then dying. His widow later said they had been mistaken.\nH.

Mr Halpin has cerebral palsy and leases a car through the Motability scheme.\nJosefa Torres\nThe chip shortage has delayed a new car for musician Kris Halpin\nHis current lease ends in October and under the rules of the scheme he must replace his car at that time. However, his local dealership has told him that the car he ordered has been delayed until January next year at the earliest.\n\"As a disabled person I am really, really reliant on my car,\" says Mr Halpin, who uses a wheelchair. \"Where I live, I literally couldn't get beyond my drive without my car.\"\nThankfully, Mr Halpin says that Motability agreed to extend the lease and insurance on his current car until the new one arrives.\nIn the coming months and, particularly over Christmas, it's possible that even more products will fall foul of the shortage.\nSo, what is going on?\nThe chips that are in short supply perform various functions in modern products, and there are often more than one in a single device.\nPiotr Esden-Tempski is the founder and owner of 1bitsquared, a US-based firm that specialises in electronics hardware. He has orders on his books for several thousand electronics interface boards, which allow students and makers to connect various appliances to their computers.\n1bitsquared and Piotresden-Tempski\nCompanies like 1bitsquared face a 12-month wait for some components\nBut Mr Esden-Tempski's suppliers say that some of the components he needs containing semiconductors will not be available for 12 months or more.\n\"You cannot just assemble it and miss one part, it won't work,\" he says.\nJaguar Land Rover halts output over chip shortage\nChip shortage: Samsung warns of 'serious imbalance'\nHow will 'chipageddon' affect you?\nThis situation has been developing for years, not just months.\nKoray K\u00f6se, an analyst at Gartner, says that among the pressures facing the chip industry prior to the pandemic were the rise of 5G, which increased demand, and the decision by the US to prevent the sale of semiconductors and other technology to Huawei. Chip makers outside the US were quickly flooded with orders from the Chinese firm.\nOther, less obvious, manufacturing complexities have also hampered the supply of certain components.\nFor example, there are two main approaches to chip production right now: using 200mm or 300mm wafers. This refers to the diameter of the circular silicon wafer that gets split into lots of tiny chips.\nThe larger wafers are more expensive and are often used for more advanced devices.\nMore Technology of Business\nHow to keep your cool when the office heats up\nJust how hard is it to recycle a jumbo jet?\nHow can new technology protect outdoor workers?\nWhy artificial intelligence is being used to write adverts\nWhat is solarpunk and can it help save the planet?\nBut there's been a boom in demand for lower cost chips, which are embedded in an ever-wider variety of consumer products, meaning the older, 200mm technology is more sought after than ever.\nIndustry news site Semiconductor Engineering highlighted the risk of a chip shortage, partly due to a lack of 200mm manufacturing equipment, back in February 2020.\nAs the pandemic unfolded, early signs of fluctuating demand led to stockpiling and advance ordering of chips by some tech firms, which left others struggling to acquire the components.\nPeople working from home have needed laptops, tablets and webcams to help them do their jobs, and chip factories did close during lockdowns.\nAt times consumers have struggled to buy the devices they want, though manufacturers have so far been able to catch up with demand eventually.\nMr K\u00f6se says, however, that the pandemic was not the sole cause of the chip shortage: \"That was probably just the last drop in the bucket.\"\nGetty Images\nA winter storm in Texas shutdown semiconductor factories\nMore recently, bad luck has exacerbated the problem. An atrocious winter storm in Texas shutdown semiconductor factories, and a fire at a plant in Japan caused similar delays.\nLogistical headaches are compounding the situation. Oliver Chapman, chief executive of OCI, a global supply chain partner, says that for many years the cost of shipping was not of great concern for many tech firms because their products are relatively small, and suppliers could fit lots of them inside a single 40ft container.\nBut the cost of moving shipping containers around the world has ballooned because of sudden shifts in demand during the pandemic. It is accompanied by a rise in air freight fees and the lorry driver shortage in Europe.\nSending a single 40ft container from Asia to Europe currently costs $17,000 (\u00a312,480), says George Griffiths, editor of global container markets at S&P Global Platts.\nThat's a greater than ten-fold increase compared to a year ago, when it cost around $1,500 (\u00a31,101).\nChip makers are responding to sustained demand by increasing capacity but that takes time, says Mr K\u00f6se, not least because semiconductor factories cost billions of dollars to build. \"That is not going to be solved by this Christmas and I find it hard to believe it will be solved by the next Black Friday [November 2022],\" he says.\nGetty Images\nShipping costs ballooned during the pandemic\nBosses at the tech giants appear sharply aware of this. The chief executives of Intel and IBM have both said recently that the chip shortage could last two years.\nSeda Memik, professor of electrical and computer engineering, and computer science, at Northwestern University, agrees: \"It will take multiple years to accomplish\u2026 a better balance.\" She also says that the pace of demand for chips has been rising so strongly that a shortage was, at some point, \"inevitable\".\nEstablishing new chip factories is difficult to do quickly, she adds: \"It's extremely expensive and requires a well-trained workforce.\" It's a potential spanner in the works for those who advocate \"re-shoring\" - relocating chip fabrication to a wider variety of countries, including those in the West, in order to ease the pressure on global supply chains.\nGetty Images\nMaking high-end computer chips is extremely difficult\nMr Chapman isn't convinced that the market is up for grabs. He argues that Asia-based chip makers, such as those in Taiwan, China and South Korea, are already racing to meet demand, and will likely continue to dominate in the future.\nMr K\u00f6se says that consumers aren't likely to notice price rises or widespread shortages of tech products this Christmas. Certain in-demand devices, such as games consoles, could become hard to get, with customers having to wait a few months for the item they want. However, he doesn't expect interminable delays.\nThe bottom line is: the pandemic accelerated an already precarious situation for chip makers - we're in the middle of a tech boom, supply can't quite keep up - and it won't get sorted out overnight.\nIt means that all sorts of people, including those seeking a new car like Mr Halpin, could continue to experience delays and disappointment for months to come."}, {"Url": "https://ccm.net/computing/hardware/59-why-is-there-a-chip-shortage", "CluewebURLHash": "1EE18FA73962CD3731CEA260F5446D75", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why is there a chip shortage?", "Snippet": "The global \ue000chip\ue001 \ue000shortage\ue001 (2021) is defined by a demand that exceeds the production possibilities.

This crisis affects over 169\u00a0industries and results in longer production times, an important profit decrease for companies, and, in some cases, increased price tags. The production of video games consoles, cars, and electrical devices was amongst the most impacted.\nExamples of affected automaker companies include Tesla, which is reportedly experiencing difficulties securing chips for airbags and seatbelts, and General Motors, which had to halt the production of some pickup truck plants. Consumer tech is no exception, as Sony had to warn customers that a large supply of PlayStation 5 won't be possible until 2022\u00a0or later, and Xiaomi had to delay the shipment of a new model in India.\nWhat is the chip shortage 2021\u00a0cause?\nThe Chip Shortage has various explanations.\nThe first and most obvious reason is the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic. On one hand, many countries experienced a lockdown and companies had to stop or slow down chip production. On the other hand, new home office working conditions and increased home time led to a growth of 26.1% of traditional computer sales during the last quarter of 2020\u00a0- and thus, to the demand exceeding the production. In addition, the pandemic caused a fluctuating demand from the industry: some tech companies overstocked chips in advance, while others couldn't acquire any. Many others, especially car companies, canceled chip orders, fearing that the industry was going to take a hit, so manufacturers adapted to the situation by switching their production to chips for consumer products.\nUnfortunately, things didn't stop there: a winter storm pushed Texas semiconductor factories to shut down, while a fire in Japan's Renesas plant caused delays - and this is where nearly one-third of the car chips used worldwide are produced.\nAnother cause could be the trade war between the United States and China. Restrictions placed on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) pushed companies to rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) and Samsung but those manufacturers had already been working at their full capacity.\nWhen will the Chip shortage end?\nAlthough there is no consensus on this question, many CEOs and analysts seem to agree that the shortage will continue throughout 2022, even though production is already on the right track. For example, President Joe Biden is asking for a $50\u00a0billion investment in American chip manufacturing.\nAn estimation from the CEOs of Intel (Patrick Gelsinger) and IBM (Arvind Krishna) states that the shortage could last at least two years.\nBuilding new factories may seem like a quick solution. However, it is important to note that this is not as simple as it sounds for two reasons: firstly, this is a long process that takes years, and secondly, manufacturing chips requires a highly specialized workforce that will need training.\nWhat is the conclusion?\nThe global chip shortage (2021) is defined by a demand that exceeds the production possibilities. It is the result of the interaction of various factors including less than optimal planning and decisions from the companies, a halt in production during the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, companies switching to chips for customer tech, an increased customer demand, natural disasters, and incidents, among others.\nOther components\nChip shortage definition\nM1x chip > Guide\n> Guide\nWebcam drivers > Forum - Windows\nSamsung Unveils 256-Gigabyte Chip\nFix mouse that is not clicking where pointer is\nHow to delete files that cannot be deleted on Windows?\nHow to replace the CMOS battery?"}, {"Url": "https://bbc.com/news/business-58230388", "CluewebURLHash": "CBB02162BC2148E2EA67C7E20FED31CB", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why is there a chip shortage? - BBC News", "Snippet": "Sales of used-cars are up, for instance, because\ue000 new vehicles, often packed with thousands of individual chips, are in short supply.\ue001 Kris Halpin, a musician based in North Warwickshire, is one of...", "Click_Cnt": 0.081, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0039-97-09171", "CluewebDocument": "Why is there a chip shortage? - BBC News\nWhy is there a chip shortage?\nBy Chris Baraniuk\nTechnology of Business reporter\n27 August 2021\nCoronavirus pandemic\nGetty Images\nComputer chips plants are working flat out\nThe tech industry is at a crunch point.\nToday, millions of products - cars, washing machines, smartphones, and more - rely on computer chips, also known as semiconductors.\nAnd right now, there just aren't enough of them to meet industry demand.

No one has been able to escape the global shortage of semiconductor chips. The automobile industry will lose $210 billion in revenue because of the lack of computer chips, according to one recent report. Game console makers have missed targets. Even the seemingly unstoppable smartphone manufacturers are facing slowdowns.\nIn over three decades in the semiconductor and optoelectronics industry, I have never seen supply fall so far short of meeting demand. The industry is notorious for going through global boom-and-bust cycles, but the current situation is largely a result of the pandemic. When so many of us began to work from home, we found ourselves suddenly wanting laptops. For the first time in years, there was a spike in personal computer shipments in 2020. Annual PC sales shot up by 11% compared to 2019, making it the biggest growth year in a decade and putting strain on silicon chip manufacturers.\nWhat we did with those laptops also contributed to the slowdown. More people have routers and broadband and are using more data for Zoom calls, FaceTime chats or streaming all kinds of entertainment. That all leads to a disruption in supply and an increase in use, resulting in depleted inventory across the industry.\nWhile the pandemic changed our work habits and confined many of us to home, it also restricted chip makers from scaling up fast enough to satisfy the public\u2019s hunger for more speed. Mandates on social distancing and indoor occupancy has meant manufacturers could not fully staff their operations for much of the past 18 months. You can\u2019t play catch-up in a competition when you\u2019re down half your team. Yet, that\u2019s what the industry has been challenged to do.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\nBest Tax Software Of 2022\nBest Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022\nIncome Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\nThe pandemic affects various aspects of our lives, and semiconductors touch pretty much every part of life in the 21st century. The demand for all things digital has gone into overdrive, which has left me and many of my industry colleagues stunned. Even foundries that have traditionally had excess capacity are oversubscribed, meaning many products will be delayed for months ahead.\nIt has been grim days for hitting deadlines, for sure.\nAn End To The Chip Shortage\nBut there are hopeful signs and even silver linings to these bleak and frustrating times. Chip manufacturers are building inventory and operating at a higher capacity than they normally would. The result will likely be an overcorrection. As the Covid-19 crisis wanes, I see an end to the shortage occurring because suppliers are already expanding their capacity. Plus, as more and more people return to work and to a daily routine that is less connected, that feverish demand for data will decrease.\nNecessity inspires innovation, of course, and that\u2019s also one of the positive developments of the past year. The shift toward hybrid integration in the photonics industry has led to technology that can reduce the number of components assembled at the wafer level. According to ZDnet.com, \u201cThere are up to 1,400 steps in the overall manufacturing process for semiconductor wafers; it can take as long as 20 weeks to complete advanced chips, and fabs can use as many as 300 different types of materials throughout fabrication.\u201d But hybrid integration allows for miniaturization of the assembly process. That shift in design reduces the bill of materials, meaning less components are required and costs are lowered, so manufacturers aren\u2019t spread so thin. With the adoption of more fifth-generation (5G) devices, innovation will be essential as we accelerate toward the next wave of digital solutions.\nHow To Mitigate Delays Now\nHybrid integration is on track to impact the industry in notable ways in 2022. Until we get there, companies ensnared in the supply-chain backlog can implement some sensible measures to mitigate the delays. One of the first things that can be done is to procure qualified secondary vendors who can help fill the gap when your primary supplier is unable to deliver. That is a step we took at POET Technologies in the spring and it has helped us limit the delays toward the commercialization of our products. Another step is to find ways to make your current processes more efficient. For example, Volkswagen recently said that automakers will try to reduce the number of chips used in manufacturing and focus on using smaller, more powerful modules as a way to deal with the depletion.\nHeavy Investment Brightens The Future\nThe brightest hope to prevent future shortages is the sudden heavy investment in the development and manufacturing of chips. Some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies have launched their own chip factories, in part to protect themselves against future slowdowns. In addition, Silicon Valley, seeing the unmet demand, has flooded the industry with funding. According to Crunchbase, more than $3.7 billion in venture capital has been invested in semiconductor companies this year.\nOn top of private funding, governments have promised gigantic investments to increase domestic chip-making. In May, the United States formed the Semiconductors in America Coalition (SIAC) and is seeking to spend $50 billion to boost manufacturing in the country. It is an investment that could end U.S. dependence on foreign chip makers. According to the SIAC, in 1990, the U.S. was responsible for 37% of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity, but that figure has tumbled to 12% in 2021. Europe is also planning to increase spending on chip-making, which will lead to increased production capability by the end of this decade.\nWhile the global semiconductor and optoelectronics industry has been trudging through an unprecedented depletion of key materials that run the world\u2019s machines and devices, it has also demonstrated resilience. I believe there are indications that the world will return to a stronger, better-prepared new normal in 2022. Soon enough, we\u2019ll be reaching manufacturing targets at such dizzying levels it will seem like we are indeed propelling at light speed.\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

They buy lots of semiconductors,\u201d O\u2019Donnell wrote.\n\u201cMobile phone sales remain hot. Makers like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei buy lots of chips. PCs are hot \u2026 Piled atop all that is a shortage of GPUs and other chips gobbled up by cryptocurrency gluttons. Demand is hotter than ever, and it\u2019s only getting hotter.\u201d\nThe global shortage is cutting a wide swath beyond mobile devices. \u201cIf it has a plug or a battery, it is probably full of chips,\u201d O\u2019Donnell wrote.\nGupta said, \u201cThe wireless community, industrial, aerospace, military\u2014anyone or everyone whose products require semiconductor chips is facing a shortage.\u201d\nA few isolated events, including an earthquake and semiconductor fabrication plant fire in Japan and a winter storm in Texas in March, which shut down some fabs this year, have also contributed to the problem, Gupta said.\nAutomotive, industrial sectors suffering most due to global chip shortage\nMorales said the automotive and industrial market segments, which are still using legacy node technologies \u201care not only at the back of the line and don\u2019t get priority [for chip orders] like smartphones, PC or cloud infrastructure [providers] would get \u2026 it\u2019ll take longer for them to recover.\u201d\nThese industries have inefficient supply chains, and even if they could get chips to move upstream, it could take months for them to reach the end product, he said.\n\u201cThey might get the chips by the third quarter of this year [then] they\u2019ll finally start seeing production but it will not be until the first half of next year potentially, that you will see cars with chips that they were asking for to run intelligent smart systems, ABS brakes or powertrain,\u201d Morales said.\nBesides the fact that they use legacy technologies, these industries are also a low priority because when they shut down last year they forced the semiconductors \u201cto take on the risk of uncertainty. So a lot of suppliers moved to other products and they\u2019ll move to the automotive industry when they\u2019re ready.\u201d\nIn contrast, gaming companies have experienced \u201ca tightness in supply,\u201d because they are more on the leading edge side and forecasted products better, Morales said.\n\u201cA lot of this has to do with the business decisions [companies] made. Automotive operates in a just-in-time environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re shocked by the pandemic it\u2019s hard to operate without business continuity planning.\u201d\nThe Japanese semiconductors and automotive companies \u201caren\u2019t crying shock\u201d because they know what to expect from past tsunamis and earthquakes, and are able to better anticipate their supply needs, Morales said.\nThere is no short-term solution, according to Gupta. \u201cIf supply is constrained you can\u2019t increase it in a short timeframe \u2026. We\u2019re looking at the second quarter of next year\u201d before lead times improve. In the meantime, prices will go up.\nThis article was updated on May 28, 2021.\nTop Story of the Day Newsletter\nIf you can only read one tech story a day, this is it.\nThe global chip shortage: What caused it, how long will it last?\nBy Esther Shein\n|\n5G\nInnovation\nInternet of Things"}, {"Url": "https://marketplace.org/2021/09/17/whats-behind-chip-shortage", "CluewebURLHash": "B92C71EB2372DF29F42091A785151823", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "What's behind the semiconductor chip shortage? - Marketplace", "Snippet": "But \ue000why\ue001 exactly \ue000is there\ue001 \ue000a chip\ue001 \ue000shortage\ue001 in the first place?

But why exactly is there a chip shortage in the first place?\nShortages happen when the demand for something is higher than the supply. When it comes to computer chips, there are problems on both sides of that equation.\nFirst, in the pandemic, demand for chips went up.\n\u201cThe consumption of chips has skyrocketed because more and more people are buying computers and various electronic devices as they\u2019re stuck at home,\u201d said Morris Cohen, who teaches operations and information management at The Wharton School.\nMarketplace\nHosted by Kai Ryssdal\nLatest Episodes\nOil producers\u2019 megaprofits  stir up calls for windfall tax\nApr 29, 2022\nThat fall in GDP may not be as bad as it seems\nApr 28, 2022\nJust how likely is a \u201csoft landing\u201d?\nApr 27, 2022\nThen, there\u2019s a supply problem.

Texas, for Intel, had a problem with the winter storms. And in Taiwan, which is one of the largest producers in the world of these chips, they\u2019re having a drought \u2014 and making computer chips requires lots of water, so they have been impacted,\u201d Wheaton said.\nAlso, the companies that make chips haven\u2019t been able to find enough workers. Not to mention the shipping bottlenecks.\n\u201cA lot of them go through China as one of the major ports. And they had a COVID outbreak, which stopped people from unloading and loading these container ships,\u201d Wheaton said. \u201cAnd then when you get a backlog of those, it\u2019s hard to unload them and get caught up, especially if you\u2019re having a labor shortage.\u201d\nLatest Stories on Marketplace\nWhy does the Federal Reserve raise rates in quarter percentages?\nBrits push back against SLAPP lawsuits that \u201cgag\u201d critics of oligarchs\nRising oil prices fuel a windfall for the industry\nThough these issues have beleaguered the chip industry broadly, for the car industry, there\u2019s another problem: Carmakers were expecting demand to slow down during the pandemic, so they canceled a lot of their orders for chips.

See details here.\n75\nby Jonathan Lopez\n\u2014 Aug 21, 2021\nSponsored Links\nThroughout the 2021 calendar year, headlines have been dominated by the ongoing global microchip shortage, which has impacted production for the entirety of the automotive industry, including General Motors. But why is there a microchip shortage in the first place?\nBefore we launch into this, it bears mentioning that the impact of the global microchip shortage now extends beyond the automotive industry \u2013 smartphones, home appliances, and numerous other industries around the world have all been affected by a scarcity of these small, but critical components. This is important to keep in mind as dwindling microchips supplies are sought after by a multitude of different industries in order to continue to do business, thus increasing competition.\nHowever, if we were to discuss the root cause of the microchip shortage, we could point to the COVID-19 pandemic as the primary driver. As lockdowns were put in place in the U.S. and abroad, consumers started buying a raft of products that require microchips to function. For example, workers looking to log on from home started buying laptops and computers, while televisions, video game systems, and tablets became a hot commodity to help stave off boredom.\nIn addition to an uptick in demand for consumer electronics, people bought more cars than expected last year, draining supplies even further.\nAmid soaring demand, microchip production has stumbled as well, with outbreaks of COVID-19 shuttering facilities, much like in the auto industry. Most microchip production is centered in Asia, and although U.S. semiconductor companies total nearly half of all global sales, only 12 percent of the global manufacturing is done stateside.\nPut it all together, and we have our current and ongoing microchip shortage. Back in February, President Biden said he was seeking $37 billion in funding to help boost domestic chip production, while General Motors says it is seeking new supply contracts in order to mitigate some of the effects of the shortage.\nUnfortunately, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continuing high demand for products requiring microchips to function, it looks like we\u2019re still quite a ways off from ending the shortage.\nSubscribe to GM Authority for around-the-clock GM news coverage.\nSweepstakes Of The Month: Win a 2022 Corvette C8.R IMSA GTLM Championship Edition.

But despite the demand for new technology, a global chip shortage is leaving prospective buyers with nothing but empty store shelves across the United States. Fortunately, Rocket IT is here to help you navigate this crisis and better your chances of acquiring this year\u2019s hard to find tech.\nWhy Is There a Chip Shortage?\nThroughout 2021, the word \u201cchip\u201d seems to be quite a buzzword. But what exactly is this component that\u2019s been wreaking havoc on the production time of new technology? Chips, also known as semiconductors, are the brains that power nearly every electronic device in your home or office. Despite their requirement in most modern tech, these components are extremely difficult to produce and two companies in East Asia are tasked with making up to 70% of the world\u2019s chips.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic began, manufacturers in East Asia closed their doors, completely halting chip production for multiple months. But this sudden stop in production didn\u2019t decrease the demand for technology. With many businesses shifting to remote operations, people were scrambling to acquire laptops and servers to support teams working from home. Additionally, with lockdowns keeping everyone inside, interest in video streaming devices, video game consoles, and TVs went through the roof.\nBut despite the ongoing needs and wants of individuals across the United States, chip manufacturers continue to struggle when fulfilling a backlog of order requests. In turn, this has led to lasting supply chain issues that are sure to impact your end of year purchases.\nTechnology Affected by the Chip Shortage\nWhile the following list is not exhaustive, it\u2019s important to remember that any device requiring a chip could be affected by the shortage, making it difficult to find:\nComputers & laptops\nMonitors\nDocking stations\nTelevisions\nTablets\nVR headsets\nServers & switches\nSmartphones\nVideo game consoles\nRefrigerators\nWashing machines\nCars\nExpected Wait on Backordered Tech\nFor businesses specifically, organizations are facing long wait times for essential items, such as computers, docks, and monitors. Without the help of a third-party vendor, like Rocket IT, and their exclusive partnerships with manufacturers, some wait times are estimated to be as long as 120 days before the product is received.\nAlongside the chip shortage, device manufacturers are now struggling to get their hands on other essential parts, like graphics cards (GPUs), circuits, and sensors. In turn, the average wait time for technology components has risen to an astounding 24 to 52 weeks. To put this into perspective, prior to these supply chain issues, the average wait was between four and eight weeks. Not only is this directly impacting the availability businesses tech, even life-saving healthcare devices, like pacemakers, have become incredibly difficult to find.\nWhy are Tech Prices Higher?\nWith the ongoing supply chain issues, you can expect to pay more for products, but why? Unfortunately, the increased demand and lack of supply has created the perfect environment for scalpers. Regardless of the tech you\u2019re looking to buy, it\u2019s likely that scalpers are using automated bots to snatch up the limited supply of products as soon as the manufacturer restocks them online. These scalpers are then listing their purchases on websites, like eBay, for up to three times more than the original retail price.\nFortunately, there are ways to avoid scalpers and ensure you\u2019re not drastically overpaying for resold technology. For years, Rocket IT has built partnerships with the leading brands and has priority access to certain products before consumers. When your organization is in a crunch for supplies, working with a trusted IT provider, like Rocket IT, gives you a value-added bonus by saving you time, money, and frustration.\nWhen will the shortage end?\nWhile there\u2019s no exact timeline for when the chip shortage will end, many experts suggest that the shortage will continue into 2023 .\nMore factories are needed to help solve the shortage, but building such a facility costs billions of dollars and usually take multiple years to start producing chips. To begin that process, leading chip manufacturer, Intel and the Department of Defense recently signed a deal to build two new factories in Arizona.\nHow to Navigate Shipping Delays\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s important for organizations to work with their IT provider to plan early and have patience when ordering inventory. With that said, here are a few basic rules to follow to ensure your team doesn\u2019t experience downtime because of supply chain issues.\nMeet with your IT department regularly to schedule upgrades in advance.\nDevelop plans to extend the life of existing technology until new equipment can be received.\nKeep an inventory of essential technology like laptops, docking stations, and monitors on hand.\n\u2018Tis the season to be jolly\nDon\u2019t let the chip shortage take the joy out of your holiday celebrations.

The challenges of securing a PS5 restock or finding where to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 have seen those chip shortages manifested as a proper consumer tech problem.\nBut the winds could be changing, as the South China Morning Post has reported that China's chip makers built a combined 31.6 billion integrated circuits (IC) units in July. That's a healthy 41.3% increase year-on-year and the country's highest monthly production yet, thanks to companies upping their output to meet sustained high demand. And more chips may, and we do stress may, mean more parts for the likes of the PS5, Xbox Series X, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT and more desirable hardware.\nPS5 restock update: Track on Twitter, GameStop, Best Buy and more\nMacBook Pro 2021 with mini-LED has me excited for the future of laptops\nPlus: Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G discontinued as Google looks to Pixel 6\nIt's also a modest increase month-on-month, with 30.8 billion units produced in June. Altogether 203.6 billion units have been produced in 2021 so far, 47.3& increase year on year.\nSponsored Links\nThe genius shopping trick every Prime Member should knowCapital One Shopping\nUndo\nAs our friends at Tom's Hardware note, Chinese chipmakers have a harder time sourcing the parts and machines they need due to U.S. sanctions. This is however also part of the reason why the Chinese government is focussing on chip production and offering generous subsidies, in order to make China less reliant on foreign silicon. However this is focussed on China's biggest manufacturers, with smaller companies facing financial trouble or buy-outs.\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...\n0 seconds of 3 minutes, 51 secondsVolume 0%\nPLAY SOUND\nThis video file cannot be played. (Error\u00a0Code:\u00a0224003)\nBut the reports doesn't specify what these chips are going to be used for, so we can't say for sure what tech this boost in production will help. Currently, the PS5 and Xbox Series X get their chips from chip maker TSMC in Taiwan, as do a lot of GPU makers, meaning that they are still at the mercy of TSMC's chip production.\nHowever, if China makes its chip fabrication appealing to the likes of Sony, Microsoft and others by offering to make the parts they need for competitive prices, then those companies could diversify their chip supply chains. In turn, that could see PS5 and Xbox Series X production ramp up. \u00a0If nothing else, TSMC may even subcontract its backlog out to one of these Chinese chip makers.\nIt's all speculation, but if this does happen the depressing challenge of trying to get hold of new gaming tech could start to abate. Time will tell, but we have our fingers cross that console and graphics cards shortages will start to get better come 2022.\nMore: Apple now has a Windows password manager, and this is how it works\nToday's best Nothing Ear 1 deals\n$100\nView\n$100\nView\nNo price information\nCheck Amazon\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\nRichard Priday\nStaff Writer\nRichard is a Tom's Guide staff writer based in London, covering news, reviews and how-tos for phones, gaming, audio and whatever else people need advice on.

Why is the shortage happening, and what can be done about it?\nHow is the shortage linked to the pandemic?\nThe start of the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020 prompted a global spending spree on electronic items\u2014from extra monitors as people rushed to set up home offices, to televisions and games consoles for beating lockdown boredom.\nTemporary factory closures due to the pandemic also put pressure on supplies.\nAnd as plants reopened, electronic goods producers continued to place orders\u2014creating an ever-increasing backlog for the chips, which can be just a fraction of a millimetre long.\nThe pandemic isn't the only factor. A storm briefly halted production at several plants in Texas in February, and a fire ripped through a Japanese factory in March.\nUS-China tensions are also part of the story. Last August, the US banned foreign companies whose chips use American technology from selling to Chinese tech giant Huawei, over espionage allegations.\nHuawei began stockpiling semiconductors ahead of the sanctions coming into effect, and other companies followed their lead, further straining supplies.\nWhich industries have been hit?\nMaking semiconductors is a delicate process that involves pressing layers of chemicals into silicon.\nThe car industry has been the most visible victim so far, with many brands forced to slow their output in recent months.\nAs automakers slashed production early in the pandemic, their chip suppliers turned to clients from other sectors\u2014namely the makers of electronic goods in high demand due to the pandemic.\nThat has left car brands, from Volkswagen to Volvo, scrambling to get hold of semiconductors now that sales are revving up again.\nSmartphone makers had been relatively protected so far as they had existing stockpiles of chips, but they too are starting to suffer.\nApple CEO Tim Cook warned this week that the shortages are set to hit the production of iPhones and iPads. Smaller phone-makers are likely to be worse affected, analysts say.\nGames consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have also been in short supply.\nSo great is the clamour among gamers to get hold of chip-powered graphic cards needed for their playing, that they have been resorting to increasingly unusual strategies.\nThe die-hards are tuning into live-streams on YouTube and Twitch, which ring an alarm every time a card is listed for sale online.\nWhen will this end?\nGovernments are hurrying to boost their chip-making capacities, meanwhile.\nThe pandemic has revealed our dependence on semiconductors, tiny components essential to many electronic goods.\nIn May, South Korea announced a whopping $451 billion investment in its bid to become a semiconductor giant, while the US Senate last month voted through $52 billion in subsidies for chip plants, known as \"fabs\".\nThe European Union is seeking to double its share of global chip-manufacturing capacity to 20 percent of the market by 2030.\nBut factories cannot open overnight\u2014particularly those that make semiconductors, a delicate process that involves pressing layers of chemicals into silicon.\n\"Building new capacity takes time\u2014for a new fab, more than 2.5 years\u2014so most expansions that are starting now will not increase the available capacity until 2023,\" said Ondrej Burkacky, senior partner and co-leader of the global semiconductors practice at consultancy McKinsey.\nHe added that long-term factors also meant global demand was in \"hyper growth\", such as the trend towards companies storing their data in the cloud, requiring more and more data centres to be built\u2014sites that use huge quantities of chips.\nJean-Marc Chery, CEO of Franco-Italian chip-maker STMicroelectronics, said orders for next year have already outstripped his company's manufacturing capacities.\nThere is a broad acknowledgement within the industry that the shortage \"will last up to next year minimum,\" he said.\nAnalysts say the continuing squeeze could lead to higher prices for consumers.\nSEB, a French maker of kitchen equipment such as blenders, has already warned that it is being forced to hike its prices.\nExplore further\n'Perfect storm': phones, consoles could get pricier as chip crisis bites\n\u00a9 2021 AFP"}, {"Url": "https://bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-semiconductors-chips-shortage", "CluewebURLHash": "1776755052AC910DFFD13CB5282B626D", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why Is There a Chip Shortage?

It\u2019s also catapulted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. to the top of investor and government agendas. Asia\u2019s two largest chipmakers are responsible for making the vast majority of the world\u2019s most advanced silicon, yet don\u2019t have the capacity to sate all demand. It\u2019s a bottleneck that could last several quarters\u2014or into next year.\nAlarm bells are ringing. A growing number of industry players from Continental AG to Innolux Corp. and Renesas Electronics Corp. have in recent weeks warned of longer-than anticipated deficits snarling production\u2014potentially well past the summer. Samsung flagged a \u201cserious imbalance\u201d globally, the largest company so far to warn of fallout from the crunch. Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan in March said his company is sold out this year and customers were \u201cwilling to book out for delivery of those products out through the rest of 2021.\u201d And on Friday, Nio Inc.\u2014the Chinese EV company sometimes compared with Tesla\u2014became the first high-profile automaker from the country to suspend production because of shortages.\nA Pandemic that Reshaped Demand\nOverall demand for semiconductors of all stripes\u2014from basic microcontrollers and memory chips to the most sophisticated high-performance processors\u2014has grown\u00a0over the past decade, as smartphone usage and computing power boomed.\u00a0A steady rise in semiconductor sales faltered in 2019, but was then boosted 5.4%\u00a0by 2020\u2019s shelter-in-place demand for home gadgets, IDC data shows.\nNeed for Chips\nSales of semiconductor have grown over the past decade\nChips built for:\nRevenue\n$500B\nAutomotives\nComputing\nConsumer electronics\nIndustrial, military, aerospace\nWired communications\nWireless communications\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n2010\n2015\n2020\nNote: Data does not include foundry-only businesses such as TSMC or Globalfoundries.\nSource: IDC\nAt the same time, once largely mechanical machines like cars have become smarter, entailing the use of many more chips. Automotive electronics, which may include everything from displays to in-car systems, are set to account for an estimated 45% of a car\u2019s manufacturing cost by 2030, according to a Deloitte report. The cost of the semiconductor-based components used in those electronics is estimated to jump to $600 by 2030 from $475 in 2020.\nFrom Horsepower to Chip Power\nModern cars are relying more on electronics that include semiconductors\n2010\n2020\n2030\n2000\nAll automotive electronics:\n18%\n27%\n40%\n45%\nof total car cost\nNote: Forecasts as of April 2019.\nSource: IHS, Deloitte analysis\nOn the other end of the supply chain, chipmaking capacity has kept pace with the growth in sales over past years, according to SEMI data, suggesting buyers are taking up capacity as soon as it comes online\u2014a sign that semiconductor demand has in general been on par with available production resources. But\u00a0advanced manufacturing has become concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players.\nIndustry experts say an imbalance is particularly apparent in so-called 200 millimeter wafers, from which lower-end chips are made. Those include power management chips and display ICs (or integrated circuits), required in a wide range of sectors from automotive to consumer electronics, but are in a short supply at the moment.\nInstalled capacity of 200 millimeter wafer equivalents\n24M\n12\n0\n2010\n2015\n2020\nSource: SEMI\nUncertainties caused by the pandemic also led to sharp swings in orders last year, which in turn muddied the waters for chipmakers trying to match capacity with demand. That\u2019s why carmakers have had to halt production in 2021 and why Playstations and Xboxes are getting harder to find in stores.\nCarmakers got hit first in part because of poor inventory planning. The industry underestimated vehicle consumption and thus the amount of chips they needed when the pandemic hit. They are now expected to miss out on $61 billion of sales this year alone. But TSMC executives said on their two most recent earnings calls that customers across many sectors have been accumulating more inventory than normal to hedge against the unknown.\nThe World Is Short of Computer Chips. Here\u2019s Why: QuickTake\nThe problem gets further magnified by the fact that the cost of chipmaking and keeping pace with technology advancements has increased exponentially this decade\u2014making the business of manufacturing semiconductors a rarefied field for the deepest of pockets. As an illustration, TSMC raised its envisioned capital expenditure for 2021 by as much as 63% to $28 billion, while Samsung is earmarking about $116 billion on a decade-long project to catch its Taiwanese arch-rival.\nIndustry Bottlenecks\nThe most complex and expensive pieces of silicon these days are logic chips from Qualcomm, Nvidia or Apple that give computers and smartphones their intelligence. But these \u201cfabless\u201d companies don\u2019t operate their own fabrication plants; they just design the semiconductors. Manufacturing happens at advanced factories called foundries that produce the designs of those big-name electronics companies.\nThis is another key bottleneck. Just three or four foundries now account for the majority of global chip fabrication\u2014TSMC and Samsung and their more distant rivals, California-based Globalfoundries Inc., controlled by Abu Dhabi\u2019s investment arm, and United Microelectronics Corp. Looking at it another way, an estimated 91% of the contract chipmaking business is housed within Asia, the lion\u2019s share of which is divided between just two regions: Taiwan and South Korea, home to TSMC and Samsung, respectively.\nAn opportunity for the U.S. to regain chip independence might come from Intel Corp., which last week unveiled a $20 billion plan to set up its own foundry business. Intel, the largest chipmaker by revenue, designs and manufactures its own chips, but this expansion would enable it to produce chips for other companies as well.\nAsia\u2019s Game\nCompanies from Taiwan and South Korea dominate the foundry business\nTaiwan\nSouth Korea\nU.S.\nChina\nIsrael\nSamsung\n$4.0B\nTSMC\n$12.9B\nrevenue estimate\nfor Q1 2021\nUMC\n$1.6B\nGlobalfoundries\n$1.5B\nTower\nHua\nHong\nVIS\nSMIC\n$1.1B\nPSMC\nDB HiTek\nNote: Estimates as of February.

TSMC\u2019s total wafer shipments were 12.4 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2020, up from 10.1 million in 2019. Taiwan\u2019s largest company has spent more than three decades to perfect its chipmaking craft and billions in past years to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology.\nAccording to Bloomberg supply-chain estimates, 25% of all TSMC\u2019s business comes from Apple, the highest-profile client it directly manufactures chips for. However, TSMC\u2019s importance lies in the critical role it plays in the entire semiconductor supply chain; it also manufactures chips for other chipmakers or for fabless chip designers, such as Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD or Texas Instruments. They are in turn supplying the world\u2019s biggest consumer electronics, communications equipment and auto parts companies.\nSupply Chain Bottleneck\nTSMC manufactures chips for chip designers and semiconductor firms, which in turn supply major makers of consumer electronics and cars\nAutos\nCommunications\nConsumer electronics\nHardware\nHousehold appliances\nOnline Services\nTSMC\nQualcomm\nCost for customer\n$537M\nApple Samsung HP Alphabet Continental\nBroadcom\n$498M\nApple Samsung Amazon Dell Alphabet HP\nNvidia\n$479M\nDell HP Samsung Continental\nAMD\n$430M\nHP Dell Amazon Samsung Alphabet Apple\nTSMC\nTexas Instruments\n$299M\nApple Samsung HP\nSTMicroelectronics\n$235M\nApple Samsung Tesla HP Continental Alphabet\nNXP\n$230M\nContinental Apple Samsung Amazon Alphabet\nRenesas\n$181M\nToyota Ford Continental Apple Samsung\nNote: The graphic captures only a subset of publicly-disclosed customers for TSMC and for its direct partners. Cost values are on a quarterly basis.\nSource: Supply-chain data compiled by Bloomberg, based on company disclosures or other publicly available sources\nBottlenecks can appear in other parts of the supply chain, too. The Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV has a virtual monopoly on advanced photolithography equipment required to print patterns of cutting-edge chips onto the wafer. Companies from Japan, such as Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., dominate the market for chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing. And manufacturing cannot start in the first place without access to electronic design automation software, a segment led by the U.S.\u2019s Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc.\nOfficials from the U.S. and Europe have beseeched Taiwan\u2019s officials for help in resolving the global chip crunch, and are pushing for the creation of domestic chipmaking capabilities. Yet research from Sanford C. Bernstein shows there isn\u2019t much that governments can do to address the current shortages. It takes years to build a new fabrication facility and get it operating smoothly\u2014regardless of where it is located.\nWith assistance from: Tom Lagerman and Ridho Reinanda\nEdited by: Edwin Chan, Peter Elstrom and Jeremy Scott Diamond\nNote on TSMC supply-chain data: Data compiled by Bloomberg.

They help us perform medical diagnostics, do our jobs remotely, and travel by plane. Semiconductors are \u201cthe brains of modern electronics,\u201d according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.\nAlso known as integrated circuits or microchips, semiconductors have facilitated significant technological advancement in the past 50 years, allowing electronic devices to become tinier and faster. However, all devices that rely on semiconductor chips have recently hit a stumbling block: Those vital components are in short supply.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed headlines about the global chip shortage. If you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s going on and what it means for your business, the following information should shed some light on the situation.\n1. Why is there a global chip shortage?\nNumerous factors contributed to the current semiconductor scarcity, according to the BBC and IEEE Spectrum. The following developments contributed to the shortage we\u2019re experiencing.\nThe rise of 5G and the growth of cloud computing have led to increased demand for computer chips.\nSome tech companies stockpiled chips and ordered them in advance at the start of the pandemic.\nThe abrupt shift to remote work led to greater demand for webcams, tablets, laptops, and other items that rely on semiconductors to function.\nMany schools switched to virtual learning and also needed equipment like laptops and tablets to facilitate remote education.\nDue to a lack of 200mm fabrication equipment, manufacturers have had issues satisfying the growing demand for lower-cost computer chips constructed with 200mm wafers.\nLockdowns and disasters such as fires and winter storms have disrupted operations at semiconductor factories.\nDuring the pandemic, people quarantined in their homes have bought more home entertainment products such as TVs and gaming consoles.\n2. When will the computer chip shortage end?\nIn a nutshell, it will be over when supply catches up with demand. Computer chip manufacturers are working on expanding capacity to remedy the deficit. Still, it takes time and money (typically billions) to create new factories, Koray Kose, a senior director analyst with Gartner\u2019s Supply Chain Sourcing and Procurement team, told the BBC. Kose predicts we\u2019ll probably still be dealing with the shortage roughly a year from now (November 2022).\nOverall, it\u2019s not certain how long the semiconductor shortfall will last, but experts seem to agree it won\u2019t end any time soon. For instance, Jean-Marc Chery, CEO of STMicroelectronics, has said the situation likely won\u2019t come to an end before the first half of 2023, according to Reuters. Similarly, CNN reported that Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger has predicted the shortage could drag on until mid-2023.\n3. What does the semiconductor chip shortage mean for businesses?\nThe mismatch between supply and demand for computer chips is driving up prices for devices that need semiconductors, David Yoffie of Harvard Business School told Popular Science.\nThe shortage has also led to delayed shipping. At Stratosphere Networks, we\u2019ve experienced long lead times (frequently 60 to 90 days) for various devices, including switches and laptops. So, if you think you\u2019ll need to replace any hardware or plan on hiring new staff members soon, you should place your orders now to ensure you have the necessary equipment on time.\nIf you have any questions about ordering equipment for your organization, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to our team by calling 877-599-3999 or emailing sales@stratospherenetworks.com.

From the soaring prices of the PS5 and Xbox Series X around us to the rows of cars waiting to install chips in car factories, many industries that rely on the use of chips have been severely hit.\nHow The Global Computer Chip Shortage Happened\nTopics covered in this post:\nWhat is a\u00a0chip?\nThe history of chips\nAnalysis of the causes of chip shortage\nThe impact and solution of chip shortage\nIn order to understand the reasons for the global chip\u00a0shortage, we first understand what a chip is and how much impact this undersized object has on our lives.\nWhat is a\u00a0chip?\nChip is a general term for semiconductor component products, essentially a silicon chip containing an integrated circuit, also known as microcircuit, microchip, and integrated circuit. Through some special processes, people connect the transistors, resistors, capacitors, and other components and wiring required in a circuit in series, install them on a semiconductor chip and finally package them so that a small chip has all the circuit functions. Electronic chips are the core devices that are installed on all the electronic devices we know (mobile phones, computers, electronic watches, etc.).\nIC chip\nThe history of chips\nWe will start with the introduction of transistors replaced by integrated\u00a0circuits and\u00a0lead you through the path of integrated circuit development.\nThe invention of the transistor:\nThe father of transistors William Shockley invented the junction transistor in 1948, which provided stable support for the use of electronic computers. The invention of the transistor is very important, and its long life and reliability make it the best choice for early chips.\nFairchild Semiconductor:\nAfter inventing the transistor, Shockley left Bell Labs and set up a semiconductor laboratory himself, located in the Santa Clara Valley in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, which is also known as the \"Silicon Valley\". He attracted eight outstanding start-ups, who have an irreplaceable position in the history of electronic chips. In 1957, they submitted their resignation to the mismanagement of Shockley. Under the investment of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Company, they founded Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild Semiconductor uses advanced technology and excellent management to develop rapidly and quickly achieved good returns.\nThe invention of the integrated circuit:\nIn 1938, Texas Instruments engineer Jack Kilby was inspired by the complaints made by female factory workers who were constantly soldering transistors. He chose to solder the components used in the production of transistors to a bottom chip together, thus creating the first baht integrated circuit. At the same time, Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor also had a similar inspiration. He created silicon integrated circuits using technologies such as plane photography. His invention is more conducive to production, so it is more favored by other companies than Baht integrated circuits.\nThe birth of Silicon Valley:\nWith the invention of silicon integrated circuits, Fairchild has a rapid development process. In 1966,\u00a0it has become the world's second-largest semiconductor company, second only to Texas Instruments.\nSilicon Valley high-tech company developed from Fairchild\nIn the 1960s, due to the conflict with the parent company's profit distribution, Fairchild Corporation triggered another wave of resignations. Employees and founders left Fairchild one after another to set up new companies. Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), etc. were all founded by the core cadres who left Fairchild. These new companies are like dandelion seeds, scattered in every corner of Santa Clara, spreading the spirit of technological innovation. Since most of these companies are related to the semiconductor industry, Santa Clara is also named after the main raw material of integrated circuits, \"silicon\", and Silicon Valley comes from this.\nAnalysis of the causes of chip shortage\nAfter understanding the function and history of IC\u00a0chips, you may have a question.\u00a0Now that electronic chips have such a wide range of applications, there should be many factories producing and inventing them, right? Why has this chip shortage suddenly occurred? To understand the reasons, we must first understand the supply chain of electronic chips.\nElectronic chip industry chain\nWe can divide the industry chain into three parts: the upstream is semiconductor raw materials and equipment; the midstream is the chip industry, the core chip design, manufacturing, packaging, and testing belong to this part of the industry chain; the downstream is the application port.\u00a0That is the development of electronic equipment such as automobiles and electronic products, etc. This is also the part we are most familiar with.\nNext, we will analyze the reasons for the\u00a0chip shortage from the perspective of the chip industry chain.\n1) The price of upstream raw materials is rising, and the supply of equipment is insufficient\nThe raw material for chip production is mainly silicon material, which occupies about 90% of the production of semiconductor materials. Therefore, the shortage and high price of silicon materials directly led to the shortage of chips. Since 2021, silicon materials have increased to 2.4 times that of the end of 2020. The high price of raw materials has led to the slowness and cessation of production by chip manufacturers, thus affecting the entire chip production industry.\nIn addition, semiconductor equipment is equally important to chip production, because chip production requires sophisticated production equipment, including photolithography machines. However, there are only a few manufacturers of semiconductor equipment that require extremely precise processes in the world, and they can only produce a few machines each year. This means that even if the short-term demand for chips rises, semiconductor equipment manufacturers cannot meet the requirements of chip manufacturers for equipment in a short time. Therefore, the low output of semiconductor equipment is also a factor causing the shortage of chips.\n2) Reduced production capacity of midstream chip manufacturing industry\nThis year, many chip manufacturers around the world have been affected by the epidemic, which has greatly reduced the production of chips. Not only that, natural disasters such as fires in many chip production areas have also had a huge impact on chip production. For example, there was a severe drought in Taiwan. Because chip production requires a lot of water to clean the chips and other materials, the production capacity of TSMC, one of the major chip manufacturers, has dropped drastically.\nThe Sino-US trade war has also had a significant impact on chip production capacity. In 2020, the United States restricted the supply of raw materials for chip production from companies such as Huawei and SMIC. As China's largest manufacturer, SMIC has dropped its production capacity significantly, exacerbating the global chip shortage.\n3) Sudden increase in downstream chip supply-demand\nThe arrival of the epidemic has started the era of home office work for residents around the world.\u00a0Computers and other electronic equipment with electronic cameras have ushered in a huge increase in sales during the epidemic. People want better office equipment. At the same time, they also want to relieve the boredom of their homes through electronic devices such as game consoles. In the last quarter of 2020, computer sales increased by about 26% compared to previous years.\nIn addition, the Sino-US trade war has also prompted companies such as Huawei to start hoarding a large number of chips, which has increased the demand for chips. At the beginning of the epidemic, many auto industries mistakenly predicted that their sales would drop significantly due to the epidemic, so they reduced their purchases of chips. But people did not go as expected. The result is that the auto industry\u2019s reserves of chips are very insufficient, which intensifies the shortage of chips and the demand for chips.\nUndiced chip\nUtmel Electronic has a huge stock of chips and other semiconductors. Welcome RFQ.\nThe impact and solution of chip shortage\nMany international industries such as automobiles, video card manufacturing, and electronic products have been affected.\nIndustry impact:\nAt present, the impact of the chip shortage\u00a0in 2021\u00a0on the automotive industry is gradually reducing, but the impact on other industries is still not to be underestimated. Intel\u2019s CEO said that the chip shortage will not end in a short time, and it may last until 2023, and the impact on the semiconductor industry is huge. It may take 2-3 years to reach the balance between supply and demand.\nSolution:\nAlthough it is difficult for us to find a solution to the shortage of chips in a short period of time, some people have also proposed that innovative packaging modes can be developed.\u00a0Using multiple small chips with different functions and capable of template assembly to achieve standardized chip\u00a0production, so that manufacturers can focus on the production of fixed small chips, reducing the pressure of chip production. This method is an idea to solve the shortage of chips, but it is also very difficult to implement. It needs to solve many problems such as defining the functions of small chips.\nThe future of chips\nThe development of the integrated circuit and semiconductor industries has brought a remarkable impact on our technological innovation. The 10nm, 7nm, and 5nm chips we are using now seem to be the limit of integrated circuit design.\nWe can\u2019t help\u00a0imagine\u00a0that\u00a0in the future, where will the semiconductor industry develop? We seem to be able to find the answer in quantum information technology, and new types of quantum chips have also been developed. Compared with integrated circuits, the computing power of quantum chips can increase exponentially, which is a huge breakthrough. I believe that in the near future, we can see the further development of more advanced electronic technology and semiconductors.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n1.How long will the microchip shortage last?\nThere is no end in sight.

Mike Blake/Reuters\nThe U.S. economy is supposed to be revving back up, but something keeps getting stuck in the gears. While isolated to a handful of sectors, product shortages of everything from wood to gasoline are becoming tougher to miss. A lot of these shortages\u2014cars, phones, gaming consoles, even automated dog-washing booths (!)\u2014have the same thing in common: They need semiconductor chips, which are themselves in short supply. Major tech companies believe the problem will persist for the next couple years; PlayStation 5s could be scarce through 2022. What caused the one supply chain shortage to rule them all, and how long will it last? Some answers, and some bad news.\nWhat are semiconductors?\nSemiconductors are the chips that manage functions like data storage, graphic rendering, and power consumption in electrical devices. They are typically made of silicon wafers and are omnipresent in today\u2019s digital world. Goldman Sachs reports that 169 industries in the U.S. have products with embedded semiconductors, and that there will be a 20 percent average shortfall of the components for the affected businesses. There are numerous varieties of chips and, in the past, shortages have typically been limited to a certain type. What\u2019s made the current shortage so difficult to manage is that it\u2019s affecting many different types and brands all at once.\nAdvertisement\nWhy is there a shortage?\nAs with seemingly everything these days, the problem has to do with the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, demand surged for laptops, monitors, smartphones, video-game consoles, and other devices as large segments of the population had to work and entertain themselves at home. In addition, Chinese tech companies have been hoarding semiconductors in anticipation of U.S. sanctions restricting the country\u2019s access to chip technology. Several major factories have also had to halt production due to fires, blizzards, and droughts, and renewed interest in Bitcoin has put a rush on cryptocurrency mining equipment, which, yes, requires semiconductors.\nSo it\u2019s going to be harder to get electronics?\nYes. Beyond PlayStation 5s, Apple has said that difficulties in procuring chips is hamstringing production of iPads and Macs, potentially costing the company $3 billion to $4 billion in sales for this quarter. CEO Tim Cook has said that Apple is having more issues with finding older models of chips that go into screen displays rather than the newer, high-tech ones. These difficulties have apparently lengthened delivery estimates for the company\u2019s 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Samsung also announced in March that it may skip the launch of the new Galaxy Note smartphone, and it looks as if Google is limiting the distribution of its forthcoming Pixel 5a to only the U.S. and Japan.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s not just these high-tech products that are feeling the squeeze. Appliance manufacturers in Asia say the shortage is affecting chips that washing machines use to weigh clothes and that toasters use to warm up bread. The Washington Post reported last week that a major supplier of automated dog-washing booths to parks and the U.S. military can\u2019t acquire the usual chips that its products rely on to handle transactions and dispense soap and water; it is now weighing the option of ordering a substitute chip that will ultimately raise costs and delay deliveries. Machinery manufacturer Caterpillar also said last month that it is anticipating problems with chips later in the year as demand for construction and mining equipment grows.\nThe automobile industry is one of the sectors that\u2019s been hit the hardest by the shortage. Demand for cars dropped sharply at the beginning of the pandemic, so many automakers decided to cancel their orders for chips. Car sales then had a stronger recovery than expected\u2014people are going back to workplaces, their wallets a bit heavier thanks to government stimulus checks\u2014but by the time auto companies tried to reorder the necessary chips, semiconductor manufacturers already had their hands full with the spike in demand for other electronics. In addition, a fire in March at Japan\u2019s Renesas Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. factory, which supplies two thirds of all chips used by auto makers, severely disrupted global supply chains. Consequently, car companies have had to pause operations. Volkswagen has paused production at plants in Mexico, Germany, and Slovakia. Mercedes-Benz is halting operations at two plants in Germany, and Ford is scaling back production in the country as well. These production problems are now contributing to a spike in prices for new cars, which often have thousands of chips. Some manufacturers are reporting 10 to 20 percent price increases for certain cars. It\u2019s so bad that demand is causing a shortage of used cars, too.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBut these companies have a plan to fix this, right?\nExecutives at Intel, the world\u2019s biggest semiconductor company, say that it will take about two years for the industry to construct more chip factories to meet the demand. Intel itself is spending $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., another major chip manufacturer, is investing $100 billion over the next three years to expand capacity, including by building a plant in Arizona as well. President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure package also includes $50 billion in subsidies for semiconductor factories, a provision that has received bipartisan support. The president further signed an executive order in February for a 100-day review of the semiconductor supply chain. Startups and venture capitalists are trying to attack the problem as well by trying to find effective new ways to develop chips more quickly, though it\u2019s unclear whether or when those efforts will pay off.\nThere are also a number of shorter-term strategies that these manufacturers are pursuing to alleviate some of the more pressing problems resulting from the shortage. Intel is opening its factory network to companies that design chips for cars with the goal of getting more semiconductors to the automobile industry in six to nine months. Electronics distributors are checking in with companies that might have extra chips lying around, and manufacturers have been trying to find ways to marginally improve production rates at existing factories by increasing the speed at which chips move down the line and delaying maintenance.\nThis is very clarifying but here\u2019s my real question: When is my PlayStation coming??\nCan\u2019t help you.\nChina Economy Video Games Cars Smartphones Supply Chain"}, {"Url": "https://fossbytes.com/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage", "CluewebURLHash": "DA85DF965917D6F28388AD8E062C3434", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "The Global Semiconductor Chip Shortage: Everything You ...", "Snippet": "\ue000Why is there a chip shortage\ue001 in the first place?

If you\u2019ve tried to buy a graphics card recently, you would know. To clarify, the shortage of a six-decade-old invention that has found a home in simple computers and devices, and reached the biggest and most expensive machines is causing trouble across the world.\nThe global chip shortage has the grabs over the world as demand for semiconductors has spiked way beyond the pre-existing supplies. In the same vein, the shortage has affected everything from smartphones and all the way up to cars.\nGlobal Chip Shortage Explained\nWhich \u2018chips\u2019 are we talking about?\nWhy is there a chip shortage in the first place?\nThe pandemic and issues of manufacturers\nGPUs and cryptocurrency\nWho is affected by the semiconductor shortage?\nWhen will this distress come to an end?\nConclusion\nWhich \u2018chips\u2019 are we talking about?\nSemiconductor microchips are becoming scarce.\nThe \u201cchips\u201d are basically made of integrated electronic circuits sitting on top of a small silicon wafer. They\u2019re mostly used to regulate the flow of electricity and are figuratively used everywhere. Moreover, these are commonly known as semiconductor chips or microchips.\n\u201cWhy are these even important,\u201d you ask? For starters, these semiconductor chips can house billions of transistors \u2013 meaning they\u2019re small, and they\u2019re efficient. Integrated circuit (ICs) chips have so many use cases that it\u2019s a hard task to even count them.\nIntegrated Circuits are a part of all devices that has some level of microprocessor control, meaning they\u2019re essential in CPUs/APUs, GPUs, and most portable devices. Their sophisticated development as a tiny package is the cause for their widespread usage.\nHence, these immediate benefits have made microchips vital. As of now, quite a large number of technologies simply cannot function without them.\nWhy is there a chip shortage in the first place?\nThe chip shortage has been all over the internet ever since the pandemic began last year. However, there are various reasons \u2013 big or small that have severely contributed to the global chip shortage.\nThe pandemic and issues of manufacturers\nFirstly, there\u2019s no doubt that the most obvious reason for the shortage is the Covid-19 pandemic. As soon as governments worldwide imposed lockdowns, the Work From Home and Online Education culture began. And with them, began the need for more laptops, PCs, external monitors, and whatnot.\nBut how could these menial expenditures cause a global issue? In simpler terms, most, if not all households spent on electronics after the pandemic began and companies also supplied the required hardware to their employees.\nConsequently, the demand for electronics housing silicon chips skyrocketed and there obviously wasn\u2019t enough supply. We\u2019ve seen GPU prices go unexplainably high, but it\u2019s real. Companies are unable to deliver products at the same pace and price as before; it\u2019s mainly because employees are working from home. For instance, manufacturing has taken a great hit because physically operating factories at full capacity has been a demanding job lately.\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, supply chains are likely to stay disrupted for another year as the demand is constantly increasing still and it only adds to the backlog for manufacturers. That said, it\u2019s safe to assume that Covid-19 has taken a big toll on the semiconductor industry.\nFurther, a severe water shortage in Taiwan affected the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of the most substantial companies in the world that produces semiconductor chips. To get a fair idea about the significance of the company, TSMC produces Apple\u2019s M1 chips and NVIDIA\u2019s parts. That is to say, TSMC is quite capable but has taken a big hit.\nChip imports over the years. Graph credit: Bloomberg.\nSpeaking specifically about the U.S., their recent trade war against China forced them to stop relying on Chinese semiconductor chip manufacturers. Hence, the country\u2019s only alternatives were TSMC and Samsung. With the added load, both of them could only do so much.\nGPUs and cryptocurrency\nThe spotlight has shifted to GPUs and the infamous cryptocurrency trends for everyone recently. If you know anything about PC parts and/or GPUs, you certainly would have heard about the spike in GPU prices. Since the end of 2020, GPU prices have a similar graph as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nContextually, ever since Ethereum\u2019s bump up in 2017, GPU prices have seen a steady increase which is a precise follow-up of Ethereum\u2019s price. Further, fast forward to another crypto market boom starting at the end of 2020, GPU prices reached new heights yet again which is pretty accurate. Cryptocurrency mining has reached an all-time high in its history.\nMiners hoarded GPUs as shepherds herd sheep. The rush of crypto miners stockpiling GPUs in bulk only meant one thing \u2013 no stock left for regular consumers. Likewise, some people started selling GPUs unofficially in the black market, and that too at insanely high rates.\nComing to regular consumers, the PC market saw its most substantial growth of 13.1% since the last spike a decade ago. However, seeing the catastrophic rise in GPU prices, veteran PC users couldn\u2019t upgrade.\nMoreover, NVIDIA and AMD released their next-in-line GPU series, but not everyone could get it. Companies like NVIDIA and AMD have to order chips in advance to produce GPUs. Although, when there\u2019s a shortage of this scale, it\u2019s obvious that graphics card production took a hit.\nHence, the availability of newer GPUs has been scarce for a while. At the same time, a critical DRAM memory module shortage came into being because of the same issues in Taiwan. DRAM modules are core components used in various hardware, such as graphics cards and SSDs.\nIn conclusion, the demand for graphics cards skyrocketed because of the cryptocurrency trends. To compensate for that, the ramped-up production required more semiconductor chips which have a major part to play in the chip shortage.\nWho is affected by the semiconductor shortage?\nA wide variety of industries are affected by the said chip shortage. From smartphones to automobiles. Samsung, the South Korean tech giant, said that the shortage has affected its television and appliance production. Also, during Apple\u2019s Q3\u20192021 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook was fret by the fact that the shortage could impact Apple\u2019s iPad and iPhone product lines.\nMicrosoft also called out a decline in Windows OEM revenue by 4%, caused directly by disruption of supply chains. Microsoft\u2019s next-gen consoles, Xbox Series X/S, and Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 have been announced for quite a while but availability is scarce for both brands.\nSignificantly, NVIDIA and AMD took a hit as mentioned before. The GPU shortage caused regular consumers such as gamers to pay an overhead sum of money. Paying an amount that is high above MSRP (Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price) being charged by importers and distributors might not be the best choice for everyone. AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted in a public interview that the company\u2019s supply could stay tight for the better part of 2021.\nAutomobile manufacturing.\nComing to the automobile industry, the production and supply chains took a major hit. Shortage of chips will impact the car market till 2022. Bloomberg reported that to cope with the chip shortage, carmakers are now leaving out high-end features. Automobile giants such as Ford, Volkswagen, Renault, and more are hit hard and are down bad. Toyota is reducing its production in Japan and North America because of the same.\nAlthough, there\u2019s a silver lining to this. The world hasn\u2019t lost hope and is finding workarounds to get around the shortage problem. For instance, Tesla redeveloped its entire software to substitute semiconductor chips, as reported by The Verge. On another hand, AMD increased its expenditure on the manufacturing department such that the supply chains thrive. That said, NVIDIA even halved the hash rate on its RTX 3060 GPUs to prevent miners from exploiting them.\nWhen will this distress come to an end?\nEveryone, a company or an individual who holds a significant authority in the tech industry has an opinion on how and when this semiconductor chip shortage will end. The key takeaway is \u2013 it\u2019s not ending soon enough. Experts say that the problem isn\u2019t going to get a quick fix, and it\u2019s only natural for a crisis this large.\nThe CEO of chipmaker STMicroelectronics, Jean-Marc Chery, said the shortage will likely last at least two years. \u201cThings will improve in 2022 gradually,\u201d Chery said, \u201cbut we will return to a normal situation \u2026 not before the first half of 2023.\u201d\nNVIDIA\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang earlier said that the GPU shortage would last until the end of 2021. However, Huang added, \u201cI would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment,\u201d in a call spotted by Videocardz.\nAfter Intel\u2019s quarterly earnings call, CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the global semiconductor microchip shortage could last into 2023 when the industry is able to completely catch up with the demand.\nTSMC hiked its chip prices by 10% since last year. And now, the chip manufacturer is back at it. The company plans to increase the price of its advanced chips (7nm and below) by almost 10%. Furthermore, chips built on 16nm and above nodes might see a hike as high as 20% according to a report by DigiNews, first discovered by Tom\u2019s Hardware.\nPersonally, I think this is too crucial of a problem to ignore, and the pandemic has caused a disruption in all industries that exist. We should see a relapse into the normal state in the coming years.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the semiconductor microchip shortage is as real as it gets, and an issue for various industries which ultimately leads to a bad economy. Everyone, including regular consumers, is affected. In the past few months, most brands have hiked car prices. Smartphones, even the budget ones are experiencing price hikes.\nIn addition, GPU prices are way up and it\u2019s really a bad time to build PCs. In simpler terms, the crisis is far from over and might spread to other industries too. We could see things going back to normal by 2023. However, the world is still trying to get around the problem and find workarounds and substitutes wherever possible.\nSiddharth Dudeja\nAn engineering student with a keen interest in most aspects of technology.

Consumers and businesses started buying new laptops and servers to cater for staff working remotely and children being home-schooled. So, whereas worldwide semiconductor sales declined between 2018 and 2019, in 2020 sales grew 6.5%. This rapid growth has continued in 2021, and according to trade organisation the Semiconductor Industry Association, sales for May 2021 were 26% higher than the same time last year.\nIt is, therefore, no surprise manufacturers are struggling to keep pace, but the pandemic has also exposed pressure points in the global chip supply chain, with the vast majority of manufacturing being carried out by two companies \u2013 Taiwan\u2019s TSMC and South Korea\u2019s Samsung. These foundries are particularly dominant when it comes to the leading-edge chips used in mobile devices or for military applications.\nData, insights and analysis delivered to you View all newsletters By The Tech Monitor team Sign up to our newsletters\nSign up here\nAside from the pandemic, other factors contributing to the shortage include a drought in Taiwan, the worst for 50 years, which has left TSMC and other manufacturers struggling to get hold of sufficient quantities of water, which is crucial in chip manufacturing. \u201cOther events have held back supply, such as fires in factories, power outages and the transportation blockage at the Suez Canal ,\u201d said Shane Rau, a semiconductor analyst at IDC.\nContent from our partners\nHow enterprises can best prepare for finance digitalisation\nHow AI can empower Middle East energy operators to deliver Oil & Gas 4.0\nWhich sectors are affected by the global chip shortage?\nThe shortage has affected a wide range of business sectors, delaying shipments of Sony\u2019s new PS5 games console, as well as restricting the supply of TVs and other OLED displays. The automotive industry has been hit particularly hard, with production lines around the world having to close for weeks at a time due to a lack of components. The shortage for automakers appears to be worsening, with both Ford and General Motors announcing prolonged shutdowns of plants across North America, while it has led to Jaguar Land Rover halving its sales expectations for 2021. According to analysis from GlobalData, the opportunity cost to the automotive industry resulting from lost production due to the global chip shortage stands at $47bn and rising.\nWhy is there an automotive chip shortage?\nThe automotive industry has been hit particularly hard because it scaled back its orders at the beginning of the pandemic as demand for vehicles dropped, and then found itself at the back of the queue when it wanted to restart production at scale. \u201cThe [chip] foundries business model is based on profit margin and volume,\u201d Gaurav Gupta, vice-president for semiconductors and electronics at Gartner, told Tech Monitor earlier this year. \u201cAutomotive electronics is a very small fraction [of their business], so now when demand has picked up and the automotive guys need chips they are not seen as a priority.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s Covid-19 stimulus package, which saw American citizens given up to $2,000 by the government, has also seen demand for new cars in the US market spike. \u201cA lot of people have that money burning a hole in their back pocket, and are putting it down on a car,\u201d said Calum MacRae, head of automotive at GlobalData.\nWhat is being done to solve the global chip shortage?\nWith demand for semiconductors likely to continue to increase as more industries undergo digital transformation, chip makers and governments are working to build more capacity into supply chains. TSMC is investing $100m in additional capacity over the next three years, while Samsung and SK Hynix, along with the South Korean government, have pledged to make $451bn of investment in capacity and incentives for chip makers.\nBut there is a recognition that chip supply chains must be diversified to decrease the reliance on Taiwan and South Korea. \u201cAmerica only makes about 10% of the chips it uses,\u201d said Mike Orme, who covers the semiconductor market for GlobalData. \u201cThat\u2019s not music to the ears of the American military or aerospace industry.\u201d US president Joe Biden has pledged to support the semiconductor sector as part of his Build Back Better plan for boosting manufacturing, and a massive bipartisan tech funding bill introduced last month would see $52bn earmarked for US chip production. Intel, now under the leadership of Pat Gelsinger, plans to expand its fab capacity and is spending $20bn on two new factories in Arizona.\nThe European Union states have also agreed to try and grow chip building capacity across the bloc, but the UK government has yet to reveal any plans to help its domestic semiconductor sector. Indeed, the UK\u2019s biggest chip factory, Newport Wafer Fab, is now in the hands of the Chinese after a take-over by Nexperia.\nWhen will the global chip shortage end?\nSemiconductor supply had been expected to rebound by the end of 2021, but the global chip shortage is now set to last into next year and could remain until 2023, experts fear. The current investments in capacity will not make an impact for some time, Malcolm Penn, CEO of industry analyst firm Future Horizons, told Tech Monitor in June. \u201cCapEx is now starting to happen but it takes a year to build out and kick in,\u201d Penn said.\nThe final quarter of 2021 could prove a key indicator as to how long the chip shortage will continue, according to Penn. Demand typically slows in Q4, which may help suppliers catch up on orders.\u00a0\u201cThat slowdown is unlikely to be severe enough to bring supply and demand back into balance, [but] if we limp through it, shortages will persist through the first half of 2022 until the current CapEx spend starts to impact supply,\u201d Penn said, adding that if demand continues to be stronger than usual, \u201cthe shortages could easily persist into the first half of 2023.\u201d\nThough chip company executives have previously been bullish about the prospects of the shortage coming to an end sooner rather than later, many have sounded more cautionary notes in recent statements. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said recently that he expects \u201cat least another year\u201d of demand far exceeding supply. Intel\u2019s Pat Gelsinger, meanwhile, believes the company will continue experiencing problems into 2023, though he told investors on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call that things would get \u201cincrementally better\u201d throughout 2022. \u201cWe still have some rough road in front of us,\u201d Gelsinger warned.\nCan we expect another global chip shortage in future?\nEven when the current global chip shortage ends it is likely more supply problems are just around the corner as demand for electronics grows further. \u201cThe capacity [the chip makers] are putting in place now will be enough for the next few years, and as these things come on stream there\u2019ll be too much capacity,\u201d said Gartner analyst Alan Priestley. \u201cBut then, in another five years, we\u2019ll be maxing out capacity again because everyone wants the latest smartphones, and we expect to see demand for things like smart homes and electric vehicles increasing. The industry is very cyclical; that\u2019s just the nature of the beast.\u201d\nAre RISC-V chips ready to take on Arm?\nTopics in this article: Hot topics,Semiconductors"}, {"Url": "https://wired.com/story/why-chip-shortage-drags-on", "CluewebURLHash": "1B5D68D4FEE0DA8AE48655AB1340FEEB", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why the Chip Shortage Drags On and On \u2026 and On | WIRED", "Snippet": "\ue000Why\ue001 the \ue000Chip\ue001 \ue000Shortage\ue001 Drags On and On \u2026 and On Demand is still surging, but it takes time to build new factories.

Today, we are talking about the semiconductor shortage which has caught the world off guard and is disrupting the auto industry and other sectors of the economy. My guest is Don Clark, a contributor to The New York Times on technology issues. Welcome to the show, Don.\nDON CLARK: Hello there.\nDOLLAR: So let\u2019s start with the big picture. How serious is the semiconductor shortage for the economy now that we are recovering from the pandemic recession? What are the sectors that are particularly hurt by this?\nCLARK: Well, I think the reason we are here talking today is because of the impact on the auto industry, which is a huge sector of the economy. They have been forced to temporarily close a bunch of plants in North America because of the chip shortage. So that has caused alarm bells in particular. Those are union jobs, the kind of people that voted for President Biden. This has definitely got the world\u2019s attention, but there\u2019s many other sectors of the economy that are affected. And not that the economy is doing that badly, but it\u2019s kind of like we would be in a much better position had this not happened.\nDOLLAR: I\u2019ve read a number of your articles. You have some great stories about the types of firms that are affected far away from automobiles. You had one about a cement manufacturer. Does that ring a bell?\nCLARK: This is a company that makes a little sensor that you place in places where you are going to pour concrete. So with these things that measure temperature in the ground, they beam signals to some people with laptops nearby and they can tell how quickly cement is hardening so that it\u2019s secure. So these guys are worried about making future sensors. And they are worried not just about themselves, but on all the construction projects that they are involved with.\nDOLLAR: So we\u2019ve got chips just throughout the economy now. It\u2019s really an interesting change. So how did we get to this shortage? What\u2019s the failure here? We economists usually think about there being some kind of market failure to get you into a real mess. So, what was the failure here?\nCLARK: Well, it\u2019s really a combination of short-term and long-term factors both on the supply side and on the demand side. So the short-term factor, of course, is the pandemic. When the pandemic came around, people pulled in their sales or they just physically couldn\u2019t keep production going. So the automakers in particular shut down temporarily. Meanwhile, everybody else, after sitting around at home, started buying everything you can imagine, particularly computers, appliances or game consoles, tablets, everything to educate and entertain themselves at home. So they started placing orders, and when the car guys came back around in the September time frame, they basically had lost their place in the manufacturing queue to get chip supplies. So they were disproportionately hurt. But there\u2019s some other really interesting factors.\nThe chip industry has had many shortages before, but they usually are in a particular kind of chip like memory chips. This time it\u2019s across the board, which is a sign that demand is really going through the roof. There\u2019s two vectors. The chips are being used in many more kinds of products, and then each product that is using chips\u2014like a car or a smartphone\u2014they are using many more chips. So the cars that we are making today, they were designed three years ago. The cars next year are going to have even more chips. So it\u2019s this kind of treadmill that wasn\u2019t really factored in.\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that there\u2019s both the new cutting-edge chips that are scarce supply\u2014those mainly come from this one company, TSMC, in Taiwan, and that\u2019s what\u2019s in, say, the latest Apple smartphone\u2014but also all these old factories, old chips, very simple things that were paid off years ago. In those cases, it\u2019s very hard to upgrade those supply lines. The biggest factor is demand, but after that you get to these supply bottlenecks.\nDOLLAR: Right. So to some extent, it sounds like the chip manufacturers didn\u2019t anticipate this big surge in demand, which is kind of understandable because it\u2019s been a really uncertain world.\nCLARK: Yeah, and they have been expanding, but the great thing for a chip manufacturer is when their factory is full. They love that. When it\u2019s empty, they lose lots of money. But if there\u2019s a shortage and they can\u2019t fill demand, they sort of leave money on the table. The history of the chip industry has been marked by these periods where they built too many factories so there\u2019s a glut of chips or they built too few factories and there\u2019s a shortage of chips. So they weren\u2019t getting accurate demand signals from their customers. So a lot of the problem here is properly evaluating and forecasting demand, which is very difficult.\nDOLLAR: Then I take it these firms cannot easily ramp up production. So the firms that suddenly have large increases in demand, can\u2019t just\u2014\nCLARK: Yes, they cannot. There\u2019s two dimensions of that. If they just wanted to build a new factory from scratch, the cutting-edge factories are $10 billion a pop, takes three years to build them. So that\u2019s a long lag right there. Then you have these older factories I was talking about. Some of those are using a kind of smaller silicon wafer to make the chips, and the machines for making those kinds of chips aren\u2019t being made anymore. So they can\u2019t increase production even if they want to. So anyway, it\u2019s not an easy situation.\nRead the full transcript.\nD\nDon Clark\ndonal888\nDavid Dollar\nSenior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Global Economy and Development,\ndavidrdollar"}, {"Url": "https://business-standard.com/podcast/current-affairs/chip-shortage-what-caused-it-and-how-will-this-impact-you-industry-121091300533_1.html", "CluewebURLHash": "931BB874E70010D8BED3FF07E05670F3", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Chip shortage: What caused it and how will this impact you ...", "Snippet": "Well, right now, \ue000there\ue001 just aren't enough of these \ue000chips\ue001 to meet industry demand.

It is the crisis of semiconductor chips. These tiny chips\u00a0are so ingrained in our lives that their shortage has caused a panic in the global market.\nSemiconductor chips power everything from TVs and\u00a0microwaves sitting in our homes to the laptops and mobile phones that we can\u2019t imagine our lives without. And now, the world doesn\u2019t have enough.\nSo, here's what causing the global semiconductor chip shortage and how long it might last.\nWhat\u00a0Is a Semiconductor Chip?\nIf the software is eating the world, then chips are the teeth.\nThis is how Kif Leswing from CNBC described semiconductor chips in a recent interview. He's right.\nSemiconductors, also called chips or semis, are the tiny components that silently but diligently power everything from rockets and jets to microwaves and mobile phones. The silicon-based chips were introduced in 1947 in the USA and ushered in a new paradigm of computing.\nPreviously, computers were built on top of vacuum tubes; we now know them as first-generation computers. A big problem with vacuum-based computers was that they consumed too much electricity, were too large, and would often fail. The ENIAC computer, for instance, would go down every two days.\nWhat is a semiconductor?\nWatch on\nWith the advent of silicon-based semiconductor chips, however, things changed for the better. For the first time, our devices were efficient, small, and reliable. We have come a long way since then.\nWhat\u2019s Causing the Global Semiconductor Chip Shortage?\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, and the subsequent lockdown, have been considered the biggest culprit for the massive chip scarcity.\nWhen the world went into lockdown in 2020, all major\u00a0automobile\u00a0manufacturers predicted a slump in sales. This\u00a0forced them to cut back\u00a0on manufacturing. As a by-product, orders for new semiconductor chips were also put on the hold.\nWhat was not taken into consideration during all this, though, was the impact of a year-long lockdown on the consumer psyche and their buying habits.\nHow The Global Computer Chip Shortage Happened\nWatch on\nAfter being confined to their homes for many months, many consumers either decided to buy new gadgets or upgraded to newer ones for work, education, or entertainment. This resulted in all the major gadget manufacturing companies increasing their semiconductor orders for meeting the increasing market demands.\nWhat\u2019s Being Done About It?\nAll the existent semiconductor factories are producing chips at their full capacity, but the demand for semiconductor chips has seen such a surge that they are not able to meet their targets.\nThe obvious response would be to build more factories, right?\nNot really. You see, it takes time and billions of dollars to build a single chip manufacturing factory. While building more manufacturing plants would be a good\u00a0strategy for the future, they won\u2019t\u00a0do much now.\nBiden rushes to address computer chip shortage\nWatch on\nBut there\u2019s hope for the future.\nOn 24th February 2021, the Biden administration signed an executive order to address the global semiconductor shortage.\nAccording to the Semiconductor Association, U.S. chip companies are responsible for 47 percent of semiconductor chip sales, but only 12\u00a0percent of those chips are manufactured at home. With the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies further increasing demand, chips\u00a0are poised to become even more ingrained in our lives.\nThe obvious\u00a0solution here\u00a0is to build independent semiconductor chip manufacturing plants to avoid a chip shortage like this again.\nWhen Will the Global Chip Shortage End?\nAccording to semiconductor industry experts, the shortage does not look like it will ease up anytime\u00a0soon. It is predicted\u00a0have an effect on technology manufacturing and hardware prices well\u00a0into 2021, if not 2022.\nSecurity Challenges During the COVID-19 Pandemic and How to Protect Yourself\nRead Next\nCPU\nPlayStation 5\nXbox Series X\nAbout The Author\nShaant Minhas (101 Articles Published)\nShaant is a Staff Writer at MUO.

LaReau\nDetroit Free Press\nView Comments\n0:10\n2:06\nThey are\u00a0a little bigger than a coin the size of a quarter, but tiny semiconductor chips are\u00a0bringing production of vehicles\u00a0across the nation to a halt.\nCar dealers have\u00a0barren parking lots, consumers face limited options on new vehicle purchases\u00a0and buyers must wait, and wait, for their new ride\u00a0to be built. Tens of thousands of new vehicles sit in parking lots awaiting semiconductor chips before they can be shipped to dealers.\nHere's what you need to know about semiconductor chips:\nSo what are these chips?\nThe chips are tiny transistors made from silicon, which is found in most of the minerals on the earth's surface. They allow computers,\u00a0smart phones, appliances and other electrical devices\u00a0to function. Vehicles use chips, too.\nSilicon\u00a0feeds a $500 billion\u00a0chip industry, according to a report by the BBC. The chips underpin a\u00a0global tech economy worth an estimated $3 trillion, the report said. The raw materials for the\u00a0semiconductor business often come\u00a0from Japan and Mexico, with the chips made in Taiwan, China and some in the U.S.\nWhat is the chip shortage?\nThe chip shortage is a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased demand for the personal electronics such as cell phones and laptops that the chips are used in to the point where production could not keep pace with demand.\nMore: GM build-shy strategy has tens of thousands of vehicles parked awaiting chip parts\nMore: GM to increase vehicle deliveries to dealers: 'Help is on the way'\nWhy is there a chip shortage?\nSo in March 2020,\u00a0the global pandemic prompted automakers, suppliers and car dealerships to close down. The economy went into a recession.\nThe automakers, who have\u00a0experienced previous recessions,\u00a0quickly canceled orders for parts with computer chips, thinking auto sales would nosedive, said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader.\nSales of new cars did plummet initially, but quickly rebounded with pent-up demand and\u00a00% financing offers. Also, dealers figured out how to sell vehicles online, offering home\u00a0pickup and delivery.\nSo when the factories restarted, the stronger-than-expected demand for new vehicles outpaced\u00a0production and\u00a0has yet to catch up.\n\"Automakers and suppliers that use chips contacted their chipmakers and put back their orders,\" Krebs said. \"By then, chip capacity was consumed by other businesses \u2014\u00a0phones, computers, video games \u2014\u00a0as people worked and schooled at home.\"\nGlobal chip production is monopolized by a few global, Asia-Pacific suppliers, said Joe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions LLC.\n\"Everyone\u2019s lights went off at the same time. This means that there was no ability to build inventory of products and solutions when businesses were able to turn their lights back on,\" McCabe said. \"This created a significant bottleneck in all manufacturing processes.\"\nThe chip deficit was further\u00a0complicated by a fire at plant owned by chipmaker Renesas Electronics in Japan. The damage was extensive and the plant\u00a0is not yet up to full production, but they are hoping it will reach full production in June, Krebs said.\nWhy is there so much competition for chips?\nIn September,\u00a0global consulting firm AlixPartners in Southfield said the\u00a0chip shortages could cost the global auto industry $210\u00a0billion in revenue\u00a0for the year.\nGM CEO Mary Barra has said\u00a0the shortage could cost GM up\u00a0to $2 billion in lost\u00a0earnings this year. Barra said GM\u00a0expected chip supplies to return to normal in the second half of the year.\nThe Alliance for Auto Innovation,\u00a0the trade group that represents automakers, said the shortage could hurt auto production for another six months and result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles being made in the U.S. this year.\nSo it is critical for automakers to get as many chips as possible to keep assembly lines moving to mitigate losses.\nMore:\nIt remains unclear whether\u00a0automakers might be able to make up that production and any revenue losses over time, Krebs said.\n\"The losses are being offset by higher vehicle prices and less expense,\" Krebs said. \"Almost every automaker in every region has been forced to make production cuts. As a result, inventories are extremely low while consumer demand is extremely high. That means vehicle prices are high.\"\nIn the first week of June, the average listing price of a new vehicle was $40,566, up nearly $200 from the prior week.\u00a0The average listing price was 5.5% above last year, and 10.3% above the same week in 2019, Krebs said.\nUsed car prices are also\u00a0high because with new cars not moving, trade-ins aren't happening creating a shortage ofused cars. too. The\u00a0average listing price for a used vehicle was $23,786, up nearly $340 from the prior week, Krebs said. Prices are running 22% above 2020 and 2019 levels, she said.\nWhy is my vehicle delayed because of chips?\nMany automakers have idled factories and stopped making some vehicles altogether so as to ship whatever chips they can get to more in-demand highly profitable vehicles such as pickups and SUVs. Also, GM and Ford Motor Co. are building the vehicles without\u00a0the chips, then parking them to await the part. Once the chips arrive, those vehicles are put through final assembly and shipped to dealers. But the delay can be weeks.\nIn the meantime, supply\u00a0of\u00a0new vehicles is at an all-time low, Krebs said. Used supply is slowly rising due to a slowing sales pace. These trends likely will continue over the coming weeks since there is little that could change the current situation, Krebs said.\nMore:\nMore:\nWhat sorts of things are chips used for in vehicles?\nCars\u00a0use the chips\u00a0in a variety of electronics systems. One car part could use\u00a0500 to 1,500 chips depending on the complexity of the part.\nHow long will the chip shortage last?\nCisco CEO\u00a0Chuck Robbins told the BBC in late April: \"We think we've got another six months to get through the short term. The providers are building out more capacity. And that'll get better and better over the next 12 to 18 months.\"\nMore: Ford dealer: 'We can't freak out' as automaker cuts F-150, Escape production again\nHow are the automakers adjusting, or not adjusting?\nIn the short term, automakers have been cutting the production of vehicles like cars that are not as much in demand and not as profitable as pickups and SUVs, so as to redirect\u00a0chips from cars\u00a0into the money-making vehicles.\nThey also are building vehicles and parking them until chips become available.\nOr they are building vehicles without some features \u2014\u00a0Tesla has taken out the passenger side lumbar support; GM took out fuel-saving features like automatic start-stop and the fuel management module.\nLong term, automakers are examining their supply chains. The just-in-time-inventory system that they took from Toyota may be revamped some with critical parts like chips, Krebs said.\nThe chipmakers are trying to boost production\u00a0and are looking at \u2013 and some committing to \u2013 building more capacity, including\u00a0in the U.S.\nThe Biden administration has also assigned\u00a0a task force to study the chips'\u00a0supply chain.\u00a0The U.S. Senate has voted 68-32 in favor of legislation intended to battle back against\u00a0overseas competition, especially a growing threat from China, including investing more than $50 billion into the making of semiconductors.\nLooking forward, automakers, suppliers and government \u00a0officials are looking at EVs and where batteries and other parts\u00a0come from as they push\u00a0for North American production.\n\"The chip shortage demonstrated our exposure to a limited domestic production capacity to the point where it has turned into an issue of national security,\" McCabe said. \"Each major global market is now getting full support from their governments for a combination of domestic and redundant supply streams. Expect to see many new, smaller chip producers, scale up to help mitigate the issue in the future \u2014\u00a0with government money supporting the efforts.\"\nMcCabe said carmakers are likely to become more vertically integrated in chip production, taking direct responsibility for multi-year, high-volume contracts to make sure there are no future capacity constraints. Volkswagen has already indicated this direction.\nAs most carmakers including Ford and GM move toward electric vehicles,\u00a0the need for high volume, and more complex chips will help shape the global chip manufacturing landscape, McCabe said.\nMore:\nMore:\nMore:\nContact Jamie L.

ASML\nA year into the covid-19 pandemic, Apple commemorated the growing array of devices featuring its custom M1 chip with great fanfare, including a \u201cMission Implausible\u201d ad on TV featuring a young man running across the rooftops of its \u201cspaceship\u201d campus in Cupertino and infiltrating the facility to \u201csteal\u201d the breakthrough microprocessor from a MacBook and place it inside an iPad Pro.\nApple\u2019s custom-designed chip is the latest triumph for Moore\u2019s Law, the observation turned self-fulfilling prophecy that chipmakers can double the number of transistors on a chip every few years. The M1 packs 16 billion transistors on a microprocessor the size of a large postage stamp. It\u2019s a marvel of today\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing prowess.\nThis story was part of our July 2021 issue\nSee the rest of the issue\nSubscribe\nBut even as Apple celebrated the M1, the world was facing an economically devastating shortage of microchips, particularly the relatively cheap ones that make many of today\u2019s technologies possible.\nAutomakers have been shutting down assembly lines and laying off workers because they can\u2019t get enough $1 chips. Manufacturers have resorted to building vehicles without the chips necessary for navigation systems, digital rear-view mirrors, display touch screens, and fuel management systems. Overall, the global automotive industry could lose more than $110 billion to the shortage in 2021.\nAdvertisement\nProduction has also slowed for smartphones, laptops, video-game consoles, TVs, and even smart appliances, all because of the lack of cheap microchips. Their use is so essential and so widespread that some observers think the chip crisis could threaten the global economic recovery from the pandemic.\nThe global shortage is shining a harsh spotlight on the semiconductor industry\u2019s ability to deliver cheaper and more powerful microchips. The longstanding promise of chips with ever more capabilities inspired engineers, programmers, and product designers to create generations of new products and services. Moore\u2019s Law has been more than just a road map for the semiconductor industry\u2014it has governed technological change over the last half-century.\nNow that promise of more computing power everywhere is crumpling, but not because chipmakers have finally run up against the physical limits of technology to make ever smaller transistors. Instead, the growing costs of sustaining Moore\u2019s Law have encouraged consolidation among chipmakers and created more choke points in the immensely complex business of chip production.\nThe Download\nYour daily dose of what's up in emerging technology\nEnter your email\nGet updates and offers from MIT Technology Review\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\nEven as microchips have become essential in so many products, their development and manufacturing have come to be dominated by a small number of producers with limited capacity\u2014and appetite\u2014for churning out the commodity chips that are a staple for today\u2019s technologies. And because making chips requires hundreds of manufacturing steps and months of production time, the semiconductor industry cannot quickly pivot to satisfy the pandemic-fueled surge in demand.\nAfter decades of fretting about how we will carve out features as small as a few nanometers on silicon wafers, the spirit of Moore\u2019s Law\u2014the expectation that cheap, powerful chips will be readily available\u2014is now being threatened by something far more mundane: inflexible supply chains.\nA lonely frontier\nTwenty years ago, the world had 25 manufacturers making leading-edge chips. Today, only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in Taiwan, Intel in the United States, and Samsung in South Korea have the facilities, or fabs, that produce the most advanced chips. And Intel, long a technology leader, is struggling to keep up, having repeatedly missed deadlines for producing its latest generations.\nOne reason for the consolidation is that building a facility to make the most advanced chips costs between $5 billion and $20 billion. These fabs make chips with features as small as a few nanometers; in industry jargon they\u2019re called 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer nodes. Much of the cost of new fabs goes toward buying the latest equipment, such as a tool called an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machine that costs more than $100 million. Made solely by ASML in the Netherlands, EUV machines are used to etch detailed circuit patterns with nanometer-size features.\nChipmakers have been working on EUV technology for more than two decades. After billions of dollars of investment, EUV machines were first used in commercial chip production in 2018. \u201cThat tool is 20 years late, 10x over budget, because it\u2019s amazing,\u201d says David Kanter, executive director of an open engineering consortium focused on machine learning. \u201cIt\u2019s almost magical that it even works. It\u2019s totally like science fiction.\u201d\nSuch gargantuan effort made it possible to create the billions of tiny transistors in Apple\u2019s M1 chip, which was made by TSMC; it\u2019s among the first generation of leading-edge chips to rely fully on EUV.\nOnly the largest tech companies are willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to design a chip for leading-edge nodes.\nPaying for the best chips makes sense for Apple because these chips go into the latest MacBook and iPhone models, which sell by the millions at luxury-brand prices. \u201cThe only company that is actually using EUV in high volume is Apple, and they sell $1,000 smartphones for which they have insane margin,\u201d Kanter says.\nNot only are the fabs for manufacturing such chips expensive, but the cost of designing the immensely complex circuits is now beyond the reach of many companies. In addition to Apple, only the largest tech companies that require the highest computing performance, such as Qualcomm, AMD, and Nvidia, are willing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to design a chip for leading-edge nodes, says Sri Samavedam, senior vice president of CMOS technologies at Imec, an international research institute based in Leuven, Belgium.\nMany more companies are producing laptops, TVs, and cars that use chips made with older technologies, and a spike in demand for these is at the heart of the current chip shortage. Simply put, a majority of chip customers can\u2019t afford\u2014or don\u2019t want to pay for\u2014the latest chips; a typical car today uses dozens of microchips, while an electric vehicle uses many more. It quickly adds up. Instead, makers of things like cars have stuck with chips made using older technologies.\nWhat\u2019s more, many of today\u2019s most popular electronics simply don\u2019t require leading-edge chips. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to put, for example, an A14 [iPhone and iPad] chip in every single computer that we have in the world,\u201d says Hassan Khan, a former doctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who studied the public policy implications of the end of Moore\u2019s Law and currently works at Apple. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it in your smart thermometer at home, and you don\u2019t need 15 of them in your car, because it\u2019s very power hungry and it\u2019s very expensive.\u201d\nThe problem is that even as more users rely on older and cheaper chip technologies, the giants of the semiconductor industry have focused on building new leading-edge fabs. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have all recently announced billions of dollars in investments for the latest manufacturing facilities. Yes, they\u2019re expensive, but that\u2019s where the profits are\u2014and for the last 50 years, it has been where the future is.\nTSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer for chips, earned almost 60% of its 2020 revenue from making leading-edge chips with features 16 nanometers and smaller, including Apple\u2019s M1 chip made with the 5-nanometer manufacturing process.\nMaking the problem worse is that \u201cnobody is building semiconductor manufacturing equipment to support older technologies,\u201d says Dale Ford, chief analyst at the Electronic Components Industry Association, a trade association based in Alpharetta, Georgia. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re kind of stuck between a rock and a hard spot here.\u201d\nLow-end chips\nAll this matters to users of technology not only because of the supply disruption it\u2019s causing today, but also because it threatens the development of many potential innovations. In addition to being harder to come by, cheaper commodity chips are also becoming relatively more expensive, since each chip generation has required more costly equipment and facilities than the generations before.\nSome consumer products will simply demand more powerful chips. The buildout of faster 5G mobile networks and the rise of computing applications reliant on 5G speeds could compel investment in specialized chips designed for networking equipment that talks to dozens or hundreds of Internet-connected devices. Automotive features such as advanced driver-assistance systems and in-vehicle \u201cinfotainment\u201d systems may also benefit from leading-edge chips, as evidenced by electric-vehicle maker Tesla\u2019s reported partnerships with both TSMC and Samsung on chip development for future self-driving cars.\nBut buying the latest leading-edge chips or investing in specialized chip designs may not be practical for many companies when developing products for an \u201cintelligence everywhere\u201d future. Makers of consumer devices such as a Wi-Fi-enabled sous vide machine are unlikely to spend the money to develop specialized chips on their own for the sake of adding even fancier features, Kanter says. Instead, they will likely fall back on whatever chips made using older technologies can provide.\nThe majority of today's chip customers make do with the cheaper commodity chips that represent a trade-off between cost and performance.\nAnd lower-cost items such as clothing, he says, have \u201crazor-thin margins\u201d that leave little wiggle room for more expensive chips that would add a dollar\u2014let alone $10 or $20\u2014to each item\u2019s price tag. That means the climbing price of computing power may prevent the development of clothing that could, for example, detect and respond to voice commands or changes in the weather.\nThe world can probably live without fancier sous vide machines, but the lack of ever cheaper and more powerful chips would come with a real cost: the end of an era of inventions fueled by Moore\u2019s Law and its decades-old promise that increasingly affordable computation power will be available for the next innovation.\nThe majority of today\u2019s chip customers make do with the cheaper commodity chips that represent a trade-off between cost and performance. And it\u2019s the supply of such commodity chips that appears far from adequate as the global demand for computing power grows.\n\u201cIt is still the case that semiconductor usage in vehicles is going up, semiconductor usage in your toaster oven and for all kinds of things is going up,\u201d says Willy Shih, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. \u201cSo then the question is, where is the shortage going to hit next?\u201d\nA global concern\nIn early 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order mandating supply chain reviews for chips and threw his support behind a bipartisan push in Congress to approve at least $50 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research. Biden also held two White House summits with leaders from the semiconductor and auto industries, including an April 12 meeting during which he prominently displayed a silicon wafer.\nThe actions won\u2019t solve the imbalance between chip demand and supply anytime soon. But at the very least, experts say, today\u2019s crisis represents an opportunity for the US government to try to finally fix the supply chain and reverse the overall slowdown in semiconductor innovation\u2014and perhaps shore up the US\u2019s capacity to make the badly needed chips.\nAn estimated 75% of all chip manufacturing capacity was based in East Asia as of 2019, with the US share sitting at approximately 13%. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC alone has nearly 55% of the foundry market that handles consumer chip manufacturing orders.\nLooming over everything is the US-China rivalry. China\u2019s national champion firm SMIC has been building fabs that are still five or six years behind the cutting edge in chip technologies. But it\u2019s possible that Chinese foundries could help meet the global demand for chips built on older nodes in the coming years.\u00a0 \u201cGiven the state subsidies they receive, it\u2019s possible Chinese foundries will be the lowest-cost manufacturers as they stand up fabs at the 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer nodes,\u201d Khan says. \u201cChinese fabs may not be competitive at the frontier, but they could supply a growing portion of demand.\u201d\nThe global semiconductor industry will need to almost double overall capacity by 2030 to keep pace with demand, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), a Washington-based industry group, which has advocated for strengthening the global supply chain rather than attempting to build fully \u201cself-sufficient\u201d domestic manufacturing capability.\nBut in a nod to the importance of advanced chips for national security and critical infrastructure, the SIA suggests that the US provide \u201cmarket-driven incentives\u201d for companies to build two or three new leading-edge fabs domestically. That could help ensure that the nation\u2019s core telecommunications networks and data centers\u2014along with the US military\u2014have a domestic supply of chips.\nThe White House photo ops with the president called to mind the role that the government has played since the dawn of the semiconductor industry that gave Silicon Valley its name. \u201cMaking that front and center is not something that the president has talked about in that way since Ronald Reagan,\u201d says Margaret O\u2019Mara, a historian at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cBiden sitting there waving a wafer around\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen that in a presidential hand ever.\u201d\nThe US government became \u201cthe Valley\u2019s first, and perhaps its greatest, venture capitalist,\u201d O\u2019Mara wrote in her 2019 book The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America. Large government orders for chips to supply NASA\u2019s Apollo program and the military\u2019s Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles encouraged chipmakers to begin mass production and helped lower the cost of the first silicon chips from $1,000 each in 1960 to just $25 by 1965.\nThe price drop made computing power affordable to many beyond just deep-pocketed government agencies. It kick-started the golden age of Moore\u2019s Law, in which customers reaped the benefits of cheaper chips that also delivered better performance every few years. And you might not know its promise was in peril if all you had to go on was Apple\u2019s latest ad.\nWhile I was interviewing O\u2019Mara for this story, a delivery person showed up at her door as if on cue.\n\u201cSpeaking of chips, I\u2019m just getting handed my brand-new computer,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got my new MacBook with my M1 chip.\u201d\nJeremy Hsu is a technology and science journalist based in New York City.\nby Jeremy Hsu\nJames Ball\nMat Honan\nSankar Das Sarma\nPatrick Howell O'Neill"}, {"Url": "https://iasnext.com/study-material/2022/01/06/why-is-the-world-short-of-computer-chips-and-why-does-it-matters", "CluewebURLHash": "E87C4A7481A1A511CDD65D6246DFEA75", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why is the world short of computer chips, and why does it ...", "Snippet": "\ue000There\ue001 are no signs of the global \ue000chip\ue001 \ue000shortage\ue001 easing any time soon, and one of the reasons behind it appears to be getting worse, not better.

Obviously, the biggest issue is how many plants are pausing production\u2014and we\u2019re here to let you know which major vehicles have their production currently affected by the chip shortage\u2014but let\u2019s not forget the Peugeot 308. Sure, it\u2019s not available in the U.S., but Stellantis said this week that instead of the digital speedometers the car was going to have, it will now be produced with analog dials as a way to save chips to use in more popular models. Here\u2019s hoping the upside is that these unexpected variants will be quirky collector's items some day.\nThe Latest on the Situation\nAlmost every automaker has been affected and forced to adjust production schedule in major ways. The consulting firm AlixPartners, cited by the Washington Post, estimated that the global auto industry will make somewhere between 1.5 million and five million fewer vehicles this year than originally expected. Volkswagen alone is down 100,000 vehicles for 2021, with the situation expected to worsen in the second quarter, and doesn't expect to be able to make up the difference this year.\nExactly how long this situation will last is up in the air, but it appears like there's darkness on the horizon. Taiwan, where many semiconductors are made, is suffering through a water shortage because no typhoons hit the island last year (which means aquifers are low) and rainfall for the first three months of 2021 was roughly half of the normal rate. Given this situation and many issues, the South China Morning Post reported this week that the chip shortage could last until 2022.\nHow the Chip Shortage Got Started\nAudi Q7/Q8, Porsche Cayenne, Volkswagen Touareg\nMichael Simari Car and Driver\nGerman business paper Handelsblatt reported on April 26 that the Volkswagen plant in Bratislava, Slovakia, will stop production of SUVs from April 29 through May 7 because of the chip shortage. The plant builds the VW Touareg and Porsche Cayenne (pictured) as well as the Audi Q7 and Q8. Production of smaller Europe-market cars, including the Volkswagen Up, Seat Mii, and Skoda Citigo, will continue.\nChevrolet Camaro, Equinox, Malibu, Traverse; Cadillac XT4/XT5/XT6; GMC Acadia\nChevrolet\nOver 10,000 workers will have some sort of extended break at a long list of GM plants. Three plants\u2014Spring Hill, Tennessee (which assembles the Cadillac XT5 and XT6 and the GMC Acadia), Delta Township, Michigan (Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse), and Ramos Arizpe in Mexico (Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox) will shut down for one or two weeks. Three other plants\u2014Lansing, Michigan (Cadillac CT4 and CT5, Chevrolet Camaro), Kansas City (Cadillac XT4, Chevrolet Malibu), and Ingersoll, Ontario (Equinox), will have their current shutdowns extended.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nFord Bronco Sport\nMichael Simari Car and Driver\nFord's Hermosillo, Mexico, plant that builds the new Bronco Sport has paused production from May 13\u201317, Reuters reported, citing sources at the plant who said supply shortages were the reason.\nFord F-150, Explorer, Mustang; Lincoln Aviator, Nautilus\nFord\nFord has already been cutting back on production of the popular F-150 and Explorer, but the automaker said this week that it will keep production rates down at some plants for an extra week or two. Ford plants in Chicago, Flat Rock, and Kansas City will continue to be idle until after the week of May 10. These plants, and others, have been idled since mid-April, and the affected model list also includes the Mustang, Edge, and Transit van. Production of the Lincoln Aviator and Nautilus has also been affected.\nOn April 28 when announcing quarterly results, Ford projected it will produce 1.1 million fewer vehicles than planned this year\u2014far beyond previous projections of up to 40,000 fewer vehicles built. Ford chief financial officer John Lawler, quoted by Automotive News, said the company has some 22,000 partly built vehicles with missing parts. That list is already known to include the popular F-150.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nHyundai\nNurPhoto Getty Images\nHyundai apparently had plenty of chips in its supply to keep production moving in the early part of the year, but the company did say it would have to adjust its production numbers in May as it did in April. Beyond that, the picture becomes murky, a company spokesperson told Reuters in Korea, as do the names of the affected models. Earlier this month, the company's Asan plant, which makes the Sonata for overseas markets, temporarily stopped production, and its main plant in Ulsan shut down for a week. There is no news about a production halt in the U.S. yet.\nJaguar XE, XF, F-Type; Land Rover Discovery, Range Rover Evoque\nLand Rover\nThe U.K.-based automaker will temporarily stop producing Jaguar XE, XF, and F-type vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant, and Land Rover and Range Rover SUVs at its Halewood factory starting on April 26, Bloomberg reported. The Halewood plant produces the Land Rover Discovery Sport and the Range Rover Evoque (pictured). Production at the company's Solihull facility, which builds the rest of the Range Rover lineup plus the Land Rover Defender and the Jaguar F-Pace, will not be affected.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nJeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Durango\nJeep\nStellantis NV\u2019s Jefferson North plant in Detroit will reduce its workers' schedules in April and May. That means production of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango SUV will be affected by rotating layoffs through the end of May. The plant usually runs for 20 hours a day with three crews, but two crews will be laid off between April 26 and May 17, while the third crew will be laid off from May 17 to May 31, according to Automotive News.\nMercedes-Benz C-Class, GLC, EQC\nMercedes-Benz\nMercedes stopped building the C-class at its Alabama plant last year, but there\u2019s no guarantee that production wouldn\u2019t be affected even if it hadn\u2019t. Daimler said that it will temporarily halt production at two of its plants in Germany, in Bremen and Rastatt, for at least one week. The C-class, the GLC crossover, and the EQC electric CUV are built in Bremen, while the Rastatt plant builds Mercedes\u2019s compact cars.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nMini Cooper; BMW X1, X2\nMini\nAs of April 30, Automotive News reports, BMW's Plant Oxford in the U.K. will stop production of Mini Coopers for three days, and the  automaker will also cut production at its plant in Regensburg, Germany. The Oxford facility is the largest of three Mini plants in the U.K. Regensburg is where plug-in-hybrid BMW X1 and X2 vehicles are built.\nMitsubishi\nMitsubishi\nAccording to Bloomberg, Mitsubishi built around 90,000 vehicles each month in January and February this year, so the news that the company will drop that number by 16,000 in May means around a fifth of the company\u2019s global production will be affected by the chip shortage. Exactly which models will be pausing production is currently unclear, but a Mitsubishi spokesperson confirmed to Car and Driver that the affected models will come from factories in Okazaki and Mizushima, Japan, and Thailand.

The shortage of processing components also has knock-on effects for other markets, including automotive, cryptocurrency, and smartphones.\nRelevant : All of Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon SoCs explained\nSmartphones seemed to dodge the crunch in late 2020 but were hit by shortages throughout 2021. In March 2021, Xiaomi president Wang Xiang implied that a chip shortage is driving up SoC prices and that this may result in more expensive smartphones. In the same month, Samsung CEO DJ Koh warned of \u201ca serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips.\u201d\nFortunately, we have rarely seen the same dreaded \u201cout of stock\u201d messages for smartphones that have plagued computer parts and gaming stores around the world. But the ongoing chip shortages continue to affect handset releases going forward.\nThe great global computer chip shortage: What you need to know\n2021\u2019s chip shortage resulted from a perfect storm of huge demand and limited supply. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the unprecedented desire for at-home entertainment saw stock issues for the latest games consoles and graphics cards last far beyond the usual launch window rush. The necessary shift to working from home has also seen laptop growth reach decade highs. At the same time, a boom in the value of cryptocurrencies reignited mining profitability, piling on demand for various high-end processing components.\nThe chip shortage is the result of a perfect storm of huge demand and limited supply.\nWhile consumers noticed the chip shortage most acutely when it comes to gadgets, the origins of the current shortage can be traced back to the automotive industry. In the early stages of the pandemic, automakers drastically cut back demand for processors in anticipation of falling sales. This turned out to be premature. Sales rebounded quickly, and the automotive market rushed to buy back cutting-edge manufacturing capacity. Although most of this had already been given away to other processor sectors experiencing their own demand. The end result is two huge markets both in need of more chips, but with production capacity already maxed out.\nA number of smaller factors have also contributed to the supply and demand ends of the shortage. February 2021\u2019s power outages from cold weather brought Samsung\u2019s Semiconductor manufacturing operations in Austin Texas to a halt until mid-March. Taiwan also experienced a severe drought that threatened the country\u2019s major semiconductor manufacturing operations. The US-China trade war has also seen Chinese companies, such as Huawei, stockpile chipsets and other components throughout 2020 and 2021.\nQualcomm\nThere are only so many chips to go round\nIt\u2019s important to note that Microsoft, Sony, Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and others don\u2019t manufacture their own processors. Samsung and TSMC manufacture the bulk of the world\u2019s cutting-edge semiconductors. Although output from other manufacturing operations worldwide, such as NXP and Texas Instruments, is also important and in equally short supply. This is particularly true when it comes to automotive components.\nThe bulk of industry demand for all sorts of chipsets falls on a handful of foundries.\nChipsets for high-end computing markets are mostly vying for 10nm and 7nm production from Samsung and TSMC. Smartphone chipsets use these manufacturing fabs too. Flagship-tier mobile chips compete with automotive orders on 5nm and 4nm manufacturing lines from TSMC and Samsung.\nWhy not add more capacity?\nIntel is an outlier. It manufactures its own processors and hasn\u2019t experienced a shortage like competing foundries. The company aims to capitalize on the current shortage by expanding its operations in Arizona and opening up its foundries to take orders from third parties once more. Including processors built on rival Arm and RISC-V architectures.\nAlso read: What\u2019s the best add-in GPU for you, AMD or Nvidia?\nSo, why not increase production to meet demand?\nUnfortunately, the situation is not that simple. Fabs are complex capital and time-intensive operations that require expensive expertise and intellectual property to construct. Extending existing production lines can take months, building new ones from the ground up can take years and cost tens of billions of dollars. As such, the Biden administration\u2019s review into US manufacturing can\u2019t hope to help alleviate the shortage in the short or medium term.\nWhat does the computer chip shortage mean for products?\nOliver Cragg / Android Authority\nWe\u2019ve already seen the chip shortage materialize in delays, shortages, and price increases for products across various industries.\nAutomakers felt the brunt first, with insufficient chip supplies to finish building vehicles. Major brands, including GM, Ford, and Tesla are all affected and have had less stock available for purchase in 2021. Analysts estimate the loss to the automotive market is around $60 billion in 2021.\nIn the gaming markets, the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles have been consistently in and out of stock as supply trickles its way into the market. The situation in the PC sphere is even worse, with the latest graphics cards and AMD CPUs still virtually unobtainable. There are small signs of this improving as we entered 2022 but stock remains hard to come by at most retailers. Reputable retailers are still listing PC products well above the Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), due to a combination of higher component costs, shortages, and the end to tariff exceptions in the US.\nProducts are selling well above MSRP due to a combination of component costs, scalping, and the end to tariff exceptions in the US.\nCompounding the woes is the scalping scourge. Games consoles and graphics cards have been the worst hit by the use of bots to snatch up limited stock which is resold with a major markup. Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 continues to sell on eBay for nearly double its MSRP, and graphics cards like Nvidia\u2019s RTX 3070 can be found for three times the list price or more. Even older GPUs are still valued at close to all-time highs.\nRenewed profitability in cryptocurrencies has been a major contributor to the demand for graphics cards and subsequent scalping. This has seen Nvidia announce dedicated mining GPUs and slashing Ethereum mining performance on its latest graphics cards. However, the growing cost and limited availability of hardware are pushing smaller miners out of the market, consolidating the rewards in larger-scale operations such as those in China. The chip shortage even has repercussions for the \u201cdemocracy\u201d of cryptocurrency mining. However, the move to proof-of-stake workloads should help to alleviate this problem in the future.\nWhat about smartphones?\nLuke Pollack / Android Authority\nIt\u2019s been tougher to gauge the chip shortage\u2019s impact on the handset market than with the automotive and gaming industries. We haven\u2019t seen the same outright product shortages and price surges. However, there are been signs that similar shortages have affected stock availability and launch schedules.\nBleeding-edge mobile SoCs compete for space on the same manufacturing lines as automotive, games consoles, and graphics cards. Reports in 2021 pointed to a shortage of flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipsets and essential audio, power, radio, and other components. Reports suggested that Samsung struggled with supplies needed for mid and low-end production. Other sources citing Realme (translated), highlighted out-of-stock power and radio components for their smartphones.\nAlso read: 4nm chipset showdown \u2014 Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 vs Exynos 2200 vs Dimensity 9000\nQualcomm acknowledged chipset supply issues mid-way through 2021. During Qualcomm\u2019s Q2 earnings call, CEO-elect Cristiano Amon noted that \u201cwe have seen, probably a shortage across the entire industry. It\u2019s been broad across the industry, not unique to handsets.\u201d Amon predicted that the supply and demand imbalance should \u201cnormalize towards the later part of 2021 as capacity is put in place.\u201d Although this shortage didn\u2019t result in major product cancellations, some manufacturers delayed or postponed launches in some regions to ease their supply issues.\nAs a result, global smartphone shipments fell by 6% in Q3 2021, according to Canalys. However, shipments rebounded slightly to grow by 1% by the end of the year. Similarly, Apple cut back its iPhone shipment goals for Q4 2021. CEO Tim Cook also revealed to CNBC that the company faced an estimated loss of $6 billion due to supply chain constraints. By contrast, Xiaomi improved its profitability year on year, even though it saw a considerable slow down in its profit growth rate. Clearly, the chip shortage has affected the mobile market too, but not quite to the same extent as in other industries.\nChip shortages in 2022 \u2014 what to expect\nThe ongoing chip shortage is already causing issues in early 2022. According to figures from the China Academy of Information and Communications (CAICT), chipset shipments in China are a further 32% lower in February 2022 than in 2021. This will obviously affect the ability of manufacturers like OnePlus, Realme, Xiaomi, and others to stock supply channels as they have done in previous years. Inevitably leading to a shortage of phones on store shelves and/or more limited regional launches.\nDespite the bad start, some of these brands are more bullish on the outlook as the year progresses. During Xiaomi\u2019s Q4 2021 earnings call, company president Wang Xiang noted that \u201cthe chip supply crunch is still challenging, but the situation will significantly improve in the second quarter, and such supply woes will be fundamentally solved and even revert in the second half of 2022\u201d. This sentiment was echoed by Realme vice-president Xu Qi, who revealed that the shortage of mobile phone chips had already eased in the first months of 2022 and that some chipset prices had fallen too.\nChip shortages will ease in 2022, at least for smartphones.\nThe outlook is more promising than it was this time last year. However, several major 2022 smartphone launches have already taken place, so we may see supply constraints for some of these phones as the weeks and months roll on. As such, Xiaomi\u2019s indication of a possible abundance of smartphone chips towards the end of the year, while possible, seems unlikely. Demand for smartphones appears to be as high as ever, and any slack in supply will almost certainly be gobbled up by manufacturers eager to recapture gains lost in the previous two years.\nOverall, the smartphone industry continues to weather the chip shortage storm better than virtually every other tech-based industry. This is because the sheer volume of high-margin chipsets consumed by the smartphone industry has seen mobile chips take manufacturing precedent compared to other market segments. Although there remains a chipset shortage in 2022, the worst will (hopefully) quickly be behind us. At least as far as smartphones are concerned.\nFeatures\nComments"}, {"Url": "https://msn.com/en-us/money/companies/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chip-shortage-that-s-plaguing-automakers/ar-aal4o9p", "CluewebURLHash": "EF95092A705EB508069FAC644147C51E", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Everything you need to know about the chip shortage that's ...", "Snippet": "\ue000Why is there a chip shortage\ue001?

Video: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg\nThe Chip Shortage Keeps Getting Worse. Why Can\u2019t We Just Make More?\nBy Ian King, Adrian Leung and Demetrios Pogkas\nMay 5, 2021\nShortages of semiconductors are battering automakers and tech giants, raising alarm bells from Washington to Brussels to Beijing. The crunch has raised a fundamental question for policymakers, customers and investors: Why can\u2019t we just make more chips?\nThere is both a simple answer and a complicated one. The simple version is that making chips is incredibly difficult\u2014and getting tougher.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science\u2014it\u2019s much more difficult,\u201d goes one of the industry\u2019s inside jokes.\nThe more complicated answer is that it takes years to build semiconductor fabrication facilities and billions of dollars\u2014and even then the economics are so brutal that you can lose out if your manufacturing expertise is a fraction behind the competition. Former Intel Corp. boss Craig Barrett called his company\u2019s microprocessors the most complicated devices ever made by man.\nThis is why countries face such difficulty in achieving semiconductor self sufficiency. China has called chip independence a top national priority in its latest five-year plan, while U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed to build a secure American supply chain by reviving domestic manufacturing. Even the European Union is mulling measures to make its own chips. But success is anything but assured.\nManufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories, dust-free rooms, multi-million-dollar machines, molten tin and lasers. The end goal is to transform wafers of silicon\u2014an element extracted from plain sand\u2014into a network of billions of tiny switches called transistors that form the basis of the circuitry that will eventually give a phone, computer, car, washing machine or satellite crucial capabilities.\nMore from Bloomberg Big Take: Chip Shortage Forces Carmakers to Strip Out High-Tech Features\nSo Small Yet So Complex\nMost chips are groups of circuits that run software, manipulate data and control the functions of electronic devices.

But Intel\u2019s undisputed leadership of the following decades ended between 2015 and 2020 when rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. started building chips with better transistors: ones with dimensions down to 5 nanometers, or 5 billionths of a meter (for comparison, an average human hair is 100,000 nanometers wide.)\nDesigner and manufacturer:\nIntel\nDesigner:\nApple\nNvidia\nManufacturer:\nSamsung\nTSMC\nTransistor count 1K 100K 1M 10M 100M 1B 10B 30B Transistor size 10 microns 1 micron 100 nanometers 10 nm 5 1971 \ud83d\udc46 Intel 4004 1993 Pentium 2001 Xeon 2006 Core2 Duo 2013 A7 2017 A11 2009 GeForce GTX 275 2020 GeForce RTX 3090 Transistors are getting smaller so chips can contain more\nSources: Company and industry reports, Our World in Data\nCleaner Than a Surgery\nBefore you put silicon\u00a0into chipmaking machines, you need a clean room.

They travel between machines in cartridges carried by robots that run on tracks in the ceiling. They only emerge from the safety of those cartridges when they\u2019re inside the machines and it\u2019s time for a key step in the process.\nVideo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg\nAtomic-Level Manufacturing\nChips consist of as many as 100 layers of materials. These are deposited, then partially removed, to form complex three-dimensional structures that connect all the tiny transistors. Some of these layers are just one atom thin. Machines made by Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. juggle a host of variables, such as temperature, pressure, and electrical and magnetic fields, to make this happen.\nOne of the most difficult parts of the process is lithography, which is handled by machines made by ASML Holding NV. The company\u2019s gear uses light to burn patterns into materials deposited on the silicon. These patterns eventually become transistors. This is all happening at such a small scale, the current way to make it work is to use extreme ultraviolet light, which usually only occurs naturally in space. To recreate this in a controlled environment, ASML machines zap molten droplets of tin with a laser pulse. As the metal vaporizes, it emits the required EUV light. But even that is not enough. Mirrors are needed to focus the light into a thinner wavelength.\n1\nFRONT END\n59+\nOxidation and coating\nTypes of\nequipment\nLayers of insulating and conducting materials are applied to the surface of the silicon wafer.

Compare that to the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to pass a bill supporting domestic chip production. This legislation would offer just $50 billion over five years.\nOnce you spend all that money building giant facilities, they become obsolete in five years or less.

But now only the biggest companies, in particular the top three that combined generated $188 billion in revenue last year, can afford to build multiple plants.\nBig-Fish Industry\nIntel, Samsung and TSMC generated almost as much revenue in 2020 as the next 12 largest chipmakers combined\nCombined total\n0\n95\n189\n284\n$378B\nIntel\nSamsung\nTSMC\nSK Hynix\nQualcomm\nBroadcom\nMicron\nNvidia\nTexas Instruments\n$188B\n$190B\nMediatek\nInfineon\nCombined revenue\nof the top 3\nCombined revenue\nof the rest\nSTMicroelectronics\nKioxia\nAMD\nSony\nNote: Figures for Samsung and Sony include their chipmaking businesses only.\nSources: Company data compiled by Bloomberg; IDC\nThe more you do this, the better you get at it.

But chipmakers only exceed that level by learning expensive lessons over and over again, and building on that knowledge.\nThe brutal economics of the industry mean fewer companies can afford to keep up. Most of the roughly 1.4 billion smartphone processors shipped each year are made by TSMC. Intel has 80% of the market for computer processors. Samsung dominates in memory chips.

Months into the shortage, the effects have spread far beyond the difficulty of buying an Xbox Series X or PS5. Car companies are being hit the worst, and even home appliances might start to see issues with supply.\nEarlier this year, companies expected to have supply chains sorted and products more consistently back on shelves by summer \u2014 but June is nearly over and there\u2019s seemingly no end in sight. And with the upcoming slate of big tech releases and the holiday shopping season coming up, expect things to get worse before they get better.\n\u201cWe had thought probably six or seven months ago, like everybody else, that it would be relatively short-term.\u201d Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere, commented on The Verge\u2019s Decoder podcast. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re into this for the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d\nChips could be in short supply for years\nIt\u2019s not just tractors and trucks, though. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger voiced similar sentiment, commenting in a Wall Street Journal interview back in April that it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. \u201cThis will take a while until people can put more capacity in the ground.\u201d And AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su noted at a May investor event that the company was being forced to prioritize its higher end chips over lower-powered parts due to shortages.\nThere\u2019s two different forces at work here. For some products, there\u2019s too much demand, which impacts the higher-end chips like the GPUs in a PlayStation 5 or an RTX 3080 graphics card. While chip shortages have undoubtedly played a part, there\u2019s also simply more people who want to buy these products than there are enough to go around.\nTake the PS5, for instance, which is the fastest selling console in US history despite the continued difficulty in purchasing one months after its launch. \u201cEven if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with demand,\u201d Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a private analyst briefing, according to Bloomberg.\nOr take GPUs, which have finally started to drop in price over the past few weeks \u2014 not because Nvidia has magically figured out how to churn out more parts, but because demand is finally slowing down following plummeting Bitcoin prices and China\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrencies.\nIt\u2019s in chipmakers\u2019 interests to keep trying to churn out those parts: newer chips are more lucrative. If you\u2019re TSMC or Samsung, it\u2019s in your best interest to focus on making (and expanding) those production efforts.\nOn the flip side, though, are supply issues, particularly for older chip designs. Unlike a new iPhone or Xbox, a Ford truck or a John Deere tractor doesn\u2019t need bleeding-edge chips using TSMC or Samsung\u2019s 5nm process. They use older chips, which are less powerful (and less pricey) than ones using brand new technology.\nOlder chips \u2014 like the ones used in cars \u2014 are being hit particularly hard\nThe impact here is already being felt. A Bloomberg report from last month notes that carmakers are starting to skip out on offering premium features like navigation systems or extra screens in order to stretch their supply of chips further. Nvidia repurposed old GPUs into special cryptocurrency mining boards to free up more supply of newer ones for gamers. Even Apple noted that it was running into trouble getting ahold of those older chips, due to the extra competition. \u201cMost of our issue is on licensing those legacy nodes, there are many different people not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,\u201d Cook said in Apple\u2019s Q2 earnings.\nRevathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex \u2014 the world\u2019s third largest electronics manufacturing company \u2014 noted a similar issue on Decoder last month. \u201cAutomotive semiconductors have been pretty outdated,\u201d she explains, noting that automakers either have to invest in upgrading to newer technologies more on par with consumer devices, or foundries need to build out more capacity for those specific legacy chips \u2014 parts which aren\u2019t really useful for phones or laptops.\nExacerbating the issue is that on a broader scale, the semiconductor industry has become increasingly consolidated. Despite the increasing importance of computer chips in virtually every hardware product across multiple industries, the number of companies that make those chips \u2014 especially specialized chips at the high end of the market \u2014 have grown increasingly fewer in number.\nTSMC alone accounts for 92 percent of the supply of cutting-edge chips, with Samsung providing the rest, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The company also reportedly makes about 60 percent of the chips for car manufacturers around the world. Which means that when those companies run out of capacity, there\u2019s not a lot of other places to go to get those processors.\nThat\u2019s also why chip shortages likely won\u2019t hit some of the biggest devices, like Apple\u2019s next iPhone or whatever Samsung\u2019s fall flagship ends up being, at least not as hard as they hit Ford trucks or GPUs. Digitimes reports that TSMC is already prioritizing Apple\u2019s orders (along with those of car manufacturers) heading into the fall. Because of the size and scale of Apple\u2019s orders \u2014 think of how many iPhones it sells every year, all using cutting-edge chips from TSMC \u2014 it has the pull to stay at the front of the line.\nThe bad news is that the crunch will probably get worse before it gets better. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are all heavily investing in expanding and building new fabs. The Biden administration is also trying to help, pushing to pump billions into US semiconductor manufacturing. But as Intel\u2019s CEO noted, it\u2019ll take months, if not a few years, for those investments to mature.\nAnd with the holiday season fast approaching and a new wave of products from across market segments all fighting for chips, there\u2019s almost certainly bound to be more product delays, cut corners, price jumps, and part shortages to come."}, {"Url": "http://oceanhondaweymouth.com/honda-research/chip-shortage-automotive", "CluewebURLHash": "7725F5A52806C1CE07F5A03CE05FEE02", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why is there a Chip Shortage? | Ocean Honda of Weymouth", "Snippet": "\ue000Why is there a Chip Shortage\ue001?

General Motors recently announced that it would reduce some truck production in North America due to the global chip shortage, while Ford has also pulled back production at several factories.\nThere are expectations that other tech sectors could feel similar effects soon.\nUS PREPS SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY PLANS AMID SHORTAGE: EXCLUSIVE\nSo what caused the shortage that is affecting companies and consumers around the world?\nTom Coughlin, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers fellow and Coughlin Associates president, told FOX Business that semiconductor chips are used in most electronic devices and provide a variety of functions ranging from computing to storage and memory.\n\"During the pandemic some of these semiconductor fabs and many of the manufacturers of the components, equipment and materials used to manufacture semiconductors experienced shutdowns and slowdowns in their manufacturing,\" Coughlin explained. \"In addition, many of the customers of semiconductor chips, reduced their orders on chips during the early days of the pandemic, as they expected reduced demand for their products.\"\nWhen the economy began to recover, Coughlin added, supply could not keep up with demand.\nIt has also been noted that increased telework opportunities caused a rise in some consumer electronics purchases, which typically contain semiconductor chips.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, the Biden administration is looking to open as many as 8 semiconductor chip factories in the U.S. within 18 months of the date that Biden signs the Innovation and Competition Act into law.\nThe administration is keen on building a \"leading edge\" chip plant in the U.S., according to a senior official.\nThe senior administration official added that Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo believes the U.S. is too dependent on Taiwan for semiconductor chips while noting that just 12% are made in the U.S. \u2013 a figure that includes none of the cutting-edge chips required to run more sophisticated technology.\nCoughlin said that it often takes \"many months\" to more than a year to build new semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\nIntel has announced plans to build two new chip facilities in Arizona \u2014 an investment that will be worth about $20 billion.

VCG via Getty Images\nWhy the global chip shortage isn't ending anytime soon\nExpect low stock and high prices to last until 2023 for GPUs, consoles and many other gadgets.\nNews of the global chip shortage has been so far-reaching this year, it's become a meme. \"I'm sorry I forgot to do the dishes, there's a global chip shortage.\" But as with many online jokes, there's a kernel of truth to it. The semiconductor chip crisis is real, and it's had a serious impact on our lives. Cars are more expensive and harder to build. Computer makers are rushing to keep up with an insatiable consumer demand for remote work and school devices. And countless products have been delayed, with release dates being pushed like dominoes throughout 2021 and into the coming years.\nWhile it's an issue that affects practically everyone, the chip shortage has been particularly painful for gamers. A year after the PlayStation 5's launch, it's still practically impossible to order one. (At least, not without paying an exorbitant markup, or following stock bots like a machine.) And PC players itching to upgrade their GPUs, who have already gotten used to dwindling hardware supplies and skyrocketing prices, will have to live with their old video cards a bit longer.\nAs Forrester Analytics' Glenn O'Donnell tells Engadget, the issue is mostly a simple supply and demand problem. You can point to several reasons for that: carmakers lowered their hardware orders at the start of the pandemic, with the assumption that consumers wouldn't be interested in buying new vehicles. It turns out the opposite was true \u2013 the overwhelming demand has pushed used car prices up significantly. Chipmakers were also forced to keep up with a rising demand for PCs, game consoles and a wide assortment of gadgets while also dealing with production slowdowns amid COVID lockdowns and other precautions.\nAaron Souppouris/Engadget\n\"I'd like to say things have improved, but they actually have gotten a little bit worse, and I'm not surprised,\" O'Donnell said in a recent interview with Engadget. In April, he argued that the global chip shortage would continue throughout 2022 and into 2023. Now, he's even more convinced that we won't see any major relief until then. While future chip fabs from Intel, TSMC and Samsung could boost supplies, it will still take at least two years from when those companies break ground to when they're up and running. Intel began construction on its two Arizona chip factories in September, and it doesn't expect to have them operational until 2024.\nBasically, get used to chip shortage, as we'll be suffering through it for a while. In an interview with Nikkei last week, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also confirmed that he expects the situation to last until 2023. \"COVID disrupted the supply chains, causing it to go negative,\" he said during a press event in Malaysia, where the company is investing $7.1 billion in manufacturing and packaging lines. \"Demand exploded to 20 percent year-over-year and disrupted supply chains created a very large gap ... and that exploding demand has persisted.\"\nIntel's $20 billion plan for \"unquestioned leadership\" | Upscaled Mini\nWatch on\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang echoed that sentiment in a recent Yahoo Finance interview, saying he doesn\u2019t think there are any \u201cmagic bullets\u201d when it comes to dealing with the supply chain. Huang also noted that NVIDIA\u2019s own group of suppliers is multi-sourced and diverse, so the shortage shouldn\u2019t dramatically affect the development of new products. But NVIDIA has also struggled to keep up with gamer demands even before the pandemic. Scalpers and cryptominers usually bought up all of the available stock, leaving average consumers with a limited amount of inventory from stores and resellers.\nWhile Huang expects production to ramp back up in 2023, he also believes the pandemic-driven push towards buying more computers and gaming hardware is here to stay. \u201cI think these are permanent conditions, and we\u2019re going to see new computers being built for quite a while,\u201d he told Yahoo. \u201cPeople are building home offices, and you could see all of the implications.\u201d\nIn the US, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope that the Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which includes $52 billion in funding for the CHIPs for America Act, could spur on more semiconductor production. But after passing the Senate earlier this year, the legislation has stalled in the House of Representatives, where Republican members said they would block USICA. The bill also includes $190 billion towards improving American semiconductor R&D, all in the hopes of becoming more competitive with China, which dramatically boosted its chip production over the last decade.\nThe manufacturing conflict between the two countries came to a head this year, when the Biden administration reportedly discouraged Intel from ramping up its chip production in China. And, of course, it doesn\u2019t help that the US and China have been engaged in a quiet cyberwar for years. That\u2019s despite the agreement made between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, where both leaders said they wouldn\u2019t support or engage in online intellectual property theft. Most recently, the US, UK and security experts blamed China for the massive Microsoft Exchange hack earlier this year, which infiltrated over 30,000 American companies.\nGiven the many obstacles in the way of fixing the chip supply chain, there\u2019s one thing everyone may have to get used to: Just be prepared to live with your gear longer. O'Donnell says he\u2019s noticed corporate suppliers trying to eke out another year or two before they refresh their business machines. For gamers, there\u2019s surely a healthy backlog of titles for your existing consoles, so don\u2019t stress about not being able to grab that PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X so much. And despite the droolworthy benchmarks we\u2019ve seen from NVIDIA\u2019s new RTX 30-series cards, you can still play almost every major game on a 20-series GPU (and even many older ones!).\nThe chip shortage could conceivably stretch out this latest console generation, as well. But really, who knows what the gaming world will look like in five to seven years? The PS5 and Xbox Series X are already plenty fast, with support for 4K, 120FPS and a bit of ray tracing. And if we\u2019ve learned anything from the success of the Switch, it\u2019s that you can do a lot with aging hardware.\nBy 2026, it may also make more sense to stream games over the cloud, instead of demanding the fastest hardware possible under your TV. But even if the cloud ends up dominating the gaming landscape within the decade, it\u2019ll still rely on servers, displays, accessories and powerful networking hardware to make it all possible. Hopefully by then, suppliers will actually be able to keep up with our insatiable desire for chips.\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Of course, the pandemic would persist beyond the new year, but many felt that the economy was on the fast track to a roaring recovery. And while the worst may be behind us, the aftershocks of the global shut-down continue to impact businesses significantly. These ongoing issues are numerous, however, one of the most pressing of them all is the shortage of semiconductor chips.\nAccording to the Semiconductor Industry Association Global semiconductor sales increased 6.5 percent in 2020, demonstrating a rapidly growing demand for chips from Automakers and Tech Giants. The semiconductor chip shortage was unavoidable but is still manageable. By building a resilient, flexible workforce model and a strong, reliable network of suppliers, crises like this can be not only managed but capitalized on.\nWhat\u2019s Happening?\nBefore discussing potential solutions, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s actually happening and what industries will be impacted the most. As it stands, automakers are projected to lose billions of dollars in earnings this year due to a shortage of semiconductor chips. Semiconductor chips are primarily used in new vehicles for things like brakes, power steering, and infotainment systems. They serve as the brain of nearly all modern electronics. According to CNBC, automakers are \u2018scrambling to get supplies of the chips, which have extremely long lead times due to their complexity.\u201d The shortage is creating significant, large-scale issues because it\u2019s far down the supply chain, causing a ripple effect through the entire network.\nCompanies like Ford Motor Co and GM are projected to each lose over $2 billion in earnings and may be forced to reduce production by upwards of 20%. The chip shortage is shaping up to be the first obstacle of many for the Electric Vehicle (EV) industry.\n\"No matter how bullish or conservative you are on EVs, the next 10 years are going to be a form of chaos for the industry.\"\n- Simon Moores\nManaging director of research firm Benchmark Minerals\nWhy is this happening?\nTo put it plainly, the Coronavirus pandemic has been the primary cause of the chip shortage. The reasons why are numerous:\nGlobal-wide shut-downs caused production to freeze up and stock to drain.\nThe demand for electronics boomed, increasing competition between Tech Giants and Automakers for the dwindling number of chips.\nAutomakers underestimated consumers' demand for cars in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased production, further spiking demand.\nThe cost of silicon has risen substantially due to the mass production of the COVID-19 vaccines; the silicon needed to make the vials is the same as the silicon used to manufacture chips and personal computers.\nAccording to Razat Gaurav, CEO of supply chain software and analytics firm Llamasoft, \u201cThis is a classic example of the bullwhip effect... Small changes in demand, as they propagate further upstream in the value chain, the variability, and the volatility grows dramatically.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been disastrous in many ways, and businesses will be dealing with the consequences of it for years to come. A chip shortage may have occurred without the pandemic\u2019s influence, but it\u2019s clear that the pandemic accelerated and worsened the issue.\nSolutions\nThe reality is, much like the global pandemic, there\u2019s no easy fix for this crisis. There is only what should have been done sooner*, and what can be done now. Many automakers, like Toyota and Tesla, began making chips in-house some time ago, however, they are still projected to experience slow-downs in production. Automakers like Hyundai caught wind of the looming shortage and started stockpiling chips months ago, but depending on how long the shortage persists, they may end up in the red, too.\nMoving the production in-house may not be the solution, especially when the issue stems from a lack of raw materials, rather than the manufactured product itself. For most companies, the best way to get through this crisis is to cultivate strong, stable relationships with their suppliers, partners, and personnel. It is essential to ensure that your business is working with experienced, trustworthy suppliers whose core aligns with your business\u2019s needs.\nThe coming months will prove difficult, and there\u2019s no easy way out. All anyone can do is buckle down and bolster up. Focus on what can be controlled and revitalized, like your workforce and network of providers.\nAt MAU, through people, processes, and technology, we are dedicated to supporting the companies we work with, and their supply chains, during both booming success or economic downturn.

In Malta, N.Y., GlobalFoundries Inc. makes chips through a complex process that requires precision, clean environments, expensive factory equipment and time.\nIt takes GlobalFoundries three months on average to engrave and transform mirror-smooth silicon wafers into layered semiconductors. Chip makers say ending the shortage is difficult because it takes years to get new factories up and running.\nEven a single speck of dust can damage a chip. Before entering so-called clean rooms, where the manufacturing actually occurs, workers have to put on safety gear, including safety glasses, a hairnet, mask, gloves, boots, gown and a hood.\nInside the clean room, air flows from the ceiling down into floor vents so particles don\u2019t linger in the air.\nThe process starts with the arrival of thin, circular silicon slices, called wafers. Each will spend an average of three months getting engraved and printed.\nChips are too intricate to be built by human hands. Workers keep the automated machinery up and running, but don\u2019t build chips themselves.\nChip designs come from glass plates known as reticles. Features on the reticle are transferred to the wafers using light.\nLiquid photoresist is applied to the wafer. As light passes through the reticle and onto the wafer, it reacts with the photoresist and transfers the design to the wafer. Each reticle transfers one layer to a wafer. Some wafers can have 70 layers.\nAn employee checks the surface of a wafer for defects and contamination. These scans also verify that the printed features on wafers match the intended design.\nHigh above the factory floor, automated material-handling systems move pods containing wafers between processing steps. This prevents human interactions and frees up floor space.\nBulk chemicals and slurries distribution equipment--support systems that don\u2019t need to be kept as clean--is located below the main floor and linked to the specialized equipment above through a network of pipes.\nFinished wafers are sent to customers for cutting and packaging. They could eventually end up in smart speakers and other electronics.\nPhotos by Caitlin Ochs for The Wall Street Journal\nProduced by Stephanie Aaronson"}, {"Url": "https://bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-28/no-really-how-bad-is-the-chip-shortage", "CluewebURLHash": "F5086CDEC61B164D3B28CB2344D39ECA", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "No really: How Bad Is the Chip Shortage? - Bloomberg", "Snippet": "\ue000Why\ue001 \ue000there\ue001's persistent murkiness around a very important question Hello, it\u2019s Ian here in San Francisco.

The shortage is crippling players in industries as diverse and far afield as automotives and smartphones\u2014though carmakers have it the worst.\nApple, for example, has staggered the release of new iPhones to adjust for reduced supply. Ford, meanwhile, is predicting that the shortage of chips\u2014used for onboard computers that control features like speedometers and antilock brake systems\u2014will result in a $2.5 billion reduction in operating profit as the automaker mothballs factories. It expects production to fall by half in the second quarter.\nSemiconductor manufacturers are already adding more capacity to meet future projections, and executives on the supply side of semiconductors have begun to speculate when the shortage, which emerged at the end of 2020, will ease.\nThere's consensus that supply will remain tight throughout 2021. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger predicts the shortage will persist for a \u201ccouple of years.\u201d German chipmaker Infineon likewise suspects supply to finally meet demand in 2023.\nBut the good news is that the shortage isn't the result of a genuine lack of resources, such as a dearth of the raw silicon that forms the wafer base for semiconductors; it\u2019s just a disequilibrium between demand and supply. Rebalancing will require expanding capacity\u2014and time.\nWhy is there a global chip shortage?\nDemand for semiconductors experiences natural peaks and troughs since manufacturers tend to launch new deliverables, such as the latest smartphone model or the newest car marque, seasonally. But in 2020 a number of factors converged to create an unexpected peak.\nIn May last year, the Trump administration\u2019s imposed sanctions against Huawei Technologies, which blocked the Chinese smartphone maker from purchasing semiconductors made with U.S. technology. The blockade, which gave suppliers 120 days to comply, prompted Huawei to increase orders and stockpile chips ahead of the ban.\n\u201cAfter the U.S. placed sanctions on Huawei, other Chinese smartphone makers started increasing semiconductor orders too because they wanted to take market share left by Huawei,\u201d says Brady Wang, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. \u201cThat was one of the triggers for the shortage now.\u201d\nNext, the pandemic forced millions to shelter and work at home, increasing orders for personal electronics, which run on chips. China\u2019s exports of laptop computers surged 9.8% in the first half of 2020, meeting the sudden demand for home offices. The pandemic also forced some chipmakers to temporarily shut down production lines, introducing a dip on the supply-side.\nPerhaps more importantly, automakers expected the pandemic to reduce new car sales, and they cut production outlook and canceled their orders for semiconductors as a result. But the pandemic downturn was less pronounced than automakers expected, and consumer demand came roaring back as major economies rolled out vaccines.\nAutomakers that had canceled semiconductor purchases rushed to put in new orders but found themselves at the back of a line front-loaded with personal electronics makers. Daniel Nenni, founder of chip information forum SemiWiki, says, \u201cCalling it a shortage is really not the case. It was just bad supply-chain management.\u201d\nCertainly not all automakers have been hit equally. Nissan chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told Bloomberg that the chip shortage is something that every company \u201ccould have avoided\u201d with better supply-chain management. Nissan, which has issued rolling stoppages on production lines because it can't source the chips it needs to complete orders, is among the companies that could have prepared better.\nMeanwhile Toyota, which keeps a close eye on its supply chains, began stockpiling chips early and has coasted through the shortage.\nSupply side\nOn a call with journalists on Wednesday, German chipmaker Infineon, which specializes in automotive chipsets, said automakers had learned their lesson from the chip shortage and that \u201cthis idea of ordering parts when you need them and canceling them then when you don\u2019t will not return.\u201d\nBut the semiconductor industry has other bottlenecks that are harder to resolve. Some 80% of the world\u2019s chip supply\u2014and, in fact, some 80% of Infineon's microcontroller supply\u2014comes from Asia, where Taiwan\u2019s TSMC dominates the market for contract chip manufacturing.\nTSMC has invested $2.88 billion to expand capacity at a factory in China that produces automotive chips, in order to \u201cease the global chip supply challenge.\u201d The company also has committed to spending $100 billion over the next three years to \u201caddress the structural increase in the long-term demand.\u201d\nThe Taiwanese firm\u2019s dominant position has made it something of a kingmaker amid the shortage. On Wednesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the commerce department was \u201cworking hard to see if we can get the Taiwanese and TSMC [to] prioritize the needs of [U.S.] auto companies.\u201d\nGerman ministers requested Taiwanese officials help get German automakers to the front of the queue as early as January. The Taiwanese side responded by requesting Germany help the island source COVID-19 vaccines, but the quid pro quo seemingly never materialized.\nBoth the U.S. and the EU have released plans to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity, limiting just slightly their reliance on Asia. The EU wants to double its chipmaking capacity by 2030, occupying 20% of the global market. Meanwhile U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing to secure $50 billion in government funding to revitalize the U.S.'s domestic industry. The extra capacity\u2014some of which is being built by TSMC\u2014won\u2019t resolve the chip shortage soon but will help increase capacity in the long term.\n\u201cAcross the industry, there will be a huge ramp-up of production by the end of 2021,\u201d says Sanyam Chaurasia, an analyst at Canalys. Some chipmakers, he says, started increasing capacity even last year, but it takes roughly a year for new factories to come online.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, supply will meet demand and there will be equilibrium,\u201d says Chaurasia. \u201cThat's how business is run.\u201d"}, {"Url": "https://minpn.com/news/why-is-there-a-chip-shortage", "CluewebURLHash": "7B29376252B647B2E631B0333EF09C62", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "News - Why is there a chip shortage?", "Snippet": "The length and complexity of the supply chain and opaque information make \ue000chip\ue001 makers afraid to expand production capacity because supply and demand are prone to mismatches. 4.The reflection brought about by the lack of \ue000chips\ue001.

The CDC noted that the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which remains available for those who prefer it and for use in certain circumstances.\nAre there risks or safety concerns regarding the COVID vaccines?\nTo help catch risks or safety concerns, the CDC and FDA monitor possible safety issues with the COVID-19 vaccines. This ongoing work has led to revised recommendations for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and information about rare side effects tied to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\nJohnson & Johnson/Janssen. In December 2021, the CDC updated its recommendations and stated that either of the two mRNA vaccines is preferred over the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC explained that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are preferred due to a greater risk for developing rare but severe blood clots, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), following administration of the J&J vaccine. The CDC noted that there are some situations when a J&J vaccine may still be used, if the recipient understands the risks and benefits of the J&J vaccine. Read about side effects related to the rare blood clot.\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we offer Pfizer and Moderna vaccines throughout our vaccine clinics. We have a limited supply of J&J vaccine and only offer it by request and if the recipient clearly understands the risks and benefits.\nPfizer and Moderna. After observing rare occurrences of myocarditis following the second injection of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC released information for the public. Most of these myocarditis events happened in teens and young adults, and the majority of the cases were mild and cleared up on their own. Read about side effects related to myocarditis.\nThis review process continues to monitor vaccine safety. Potential risks of COVID-19 vaccines are reviewed and weighed against the benefits of protection that the vaccines offer as well as the known, serious risk of harm due to COVID-19.\nWhat if I got a J&J vaccine? Should I worry about blood clots?\nIf you received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than three weeks ago, you do not need to watch for side effects related to blood clots.\nIf you received the J&J vaccine within the last three weeks, you should watch for possible symptoms of TTS and get medical help immediately if you have any of the following:\nSevere or persistent headaches or blurred vision\nShortness of breath\nChest pain\nLeg swelling\nPersistent abdominal pain\nEasy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin near the injection site\nIs there a risk of an allergic reaction to a COVID vaccine?\nAccording to the CDC, anyone who has a severe allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of the mRNA vaccine ingredients should not receive this vaccine. The CDC says people with allergies to certain foods, insects, latex and other common allergens can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Those with a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to injectables or other vaccines should discuss the vaccination with their doctor, who can evaluate and assess their risk.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know | Las vacunas anticovid-19: informaci\u00f3n imprescindible\nLet's Talk Health (Hablemos de Sauld) | The COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know\nWatch on\nHow was the COVID-19 vaccine developed so quickly?\nThe relatively quick development of these vaccines does not mean safety measures were skipped. There are several reasons why the COVID-19 vaccines were developed faster than other vaccines:\nThe technologies used to develop the COVID-19 vaccines have been in development for years to prepare for outbreaks of infectious viruses. The manufacturing processes were ready very early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCountries shared genetic information when it was available about SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which gave vaccine developers an early start at finding a vaccine.\nThe testing processes for the vaccines didn\u2019t skip any steps, but the vaccine developers conducted some stages of the process simultaneously to gather as much data as quickly as possible.\nGovernments gave money to vaccine developers in advance, so the companies had resources they needed.\nSome types of COVID-19 vaccines were created using messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that allows a faster approach than the traditional way vaccines are made.\nSocial media enabled companies to reach out to and enroll study volunteers, and plenty of people wanted to help, so there were enough research participants to test the COVID-19 vaccines.\nBecause SARS-CoV-2 is so contagious and widespread, many volunteers who got the vaccines were exposed to the virus, and with so many exposures, it took a shorter time to see if the vaccines worked.\nCompanies began manufacturing vaccines ahead of their authorization or approval so some supplies would be ready if authorization occurred.\nWhat steps are taken to help make sure the COVID-19 vaccines are safe?\nSafety is always a top priority as federal agencies work with vaccine manufacturers and independent scientific organizations to develop, study, authorize and approve new vaccines. Here are some of the steps taken for COVID-19 vaccines, as well as other vaccines:\nCareful testing. All vaccines go through clinical trials to test safety and effectiveness. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA set high safety standards for vaccine developers to meet. This graphic from the National Institutes of Health shows the four phases a vaccine goes through before it is released to the public.\nAuthorization for emergency use. If a vaccine or medicine is needed to address an emergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, once it is shown to be safe and effective, the FDA can grant it an emergency use authorization (EUA). An EUA allows a vaccine, treatment or medication to be used before the formal FDA approval.\nContinuous monitoring for problems and side effects. Once a vaccine gets an EUA and is being given to people, the FDA and the CDC continue to watch carefully in case problems arise. Data on the vaccine\u2019s safety record accumulates over time, as more and more people who receive it report on their experience and any side effects. One important way to report adverse events after vaccination is through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\nLearn more from the CDC about the safety steps for the COVID-19 vaccine.\nDemographics of the COVID-19 Vaccine Trials\nDemographics of the COVID-19 Vaccine Trials\nWatch on\nDo I still have to wear a mask if I get a vaccine?\nThe CDC continues to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and makes recommendations for wearing face masks, both for those who are fully vaccinated as well as people who are not fully vaccinated.\nThe CDC also recommends that masks and physical distancing be required when going to a doctor\u2019s office, hospital or long-term care facility, including all Johns Hopkins hospitals, care centers and offices.\nJohns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s mask safety guidelines have not changed, and we still require everyone to wear masks inside all of our facilities.\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\nYou cannot and will not get COVID-19 from any of the vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines do not have any virus or other infectious material in them.\nWhat about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for diverse groups of people?\nThe FDA and other reviewers closely consider diverse populations and include them in the trials. The clinical trials for the first two COVID-19 vaccines included members of underrepresented minorities and older age groups, and people with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart and respiratory conditions.\nDoes Johns Hopkins Medicine recommend that I get a COVID-19 vaccine?\nYes, we recommend that everyone who is eligible get vaccinated with one of the currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer or Moderna. We view both as highly effective in preventing serious disease, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (including disease caused by the very contagious delta and omicron variants of the coronavirus), and we believe that their benefits outweigh their risks.\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we offer Pfizer and Moderna vaccines throughout our vaccine clinics. We have a limited supply of J&J vaccine and only offer it by request and if the recipient clearly understands the risks and benefits.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Email Alerts\nSign up to receive

Covid-19 \"Vaccine\"\nPartial Informal Transcript Below the Fold\nIt takes at least 6 weeks from the time you get your injection for the spike antibody to start to develop.\u00a0 So, somewhere between 3 months and quite frankly 20 years.\u00a0 The immunologist I spoke to said that over the next 10 years we are going to see this go on in perpetuity, because it can take anywhere from 2 years to 19 years to get full blown auto-immune disease.\u00a0 I think we will see massive injuries and a lot more deaths starting somewhere between 4 and 18 months from now.\u00a0 \u00a0This Vaccine will permanently alter your immune system.\n*\u00a0 new type of shot that does not meet any of the criteria of a vaccine.\ndoes not keep you from getting sick, does not change the death rate.\nIt is NOT like getting another flu shot, still have to wear a mask and social distance.\n*\u00a0 When you get this spike antibody in your system it will permanently and irreversibly change your immune system.\u00a0 The messenger RNA is the spike protein to develop an antibody against that spike protein.\u00a0 It means next time you come in contact with a virus the antibody should block you from getting sick.\u00a0 However, not only does it not stop you from getting sick, the antibody itself is going to turn on your body and create havoc and massive auto-immune disease.\n* It attacks your organs by molecular mimicry.\nIt is a genetic modification technology.\n*\u00a0 10 ways it hurts you:\nToo complicated for me so I did not take notes.\u00a0\u00a0see 7M.\n*\u00a0 Governments around the world are saying NO to MRnA vaccines.\n*\u00a0 It is a well designed killing tool.\u00a0 It is a genetic modification technology.\nShe explains how messenger RNA works.\u00a0 The messenger creates a protein and indirectly changes your DNA.\u00a0 Makes a spike protein.\n*\u00a0 There are 35 to 40 corona viruses.\u00a0 The process allows the virus to replicate.\nThe antibody does not behave like a normal antibody. . ..\nThe antibody can bind to tissue in your lungs . . . and cause anaphylactic shock\nand other things.\n*\u00a0 The antibody process will be there forever because of . . .\nand we have no idea how long the mrna messenger will continue to be translated and create the proteins, etc. and there are no long term studies.\u00a0 For the rest of your life you may be susceptible to auto-immune disease, shock, allergies and death.\n*\u00a0 It is wrapped in a bubble of polyethylene glycol allows the virus to replicate.\nPolyethylene glycol (wiki)\u00a0That is what leads to anaphylactic shock and death.\n* Rashes as things like that are an allergic reaction.\u00a0 People who had the shot and say, I am fine are okay, until they get re-exposed to a CV.\nShe explains how the virus starts to replicate and you get an infection worse than if you had not had the shot.\n* They did not do animal studies because they knew the animals would get sick or die.\n*\u00a0 The antibody can cross the blood-brain barrier and make 2 proteins in the brain malfunction.\u00a0 You can get ALS or frontal lobe degeneration (Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia).\n* cytochrome storm goes on and the firemen never show up because there is NO off switch.\u00a0 Because the protectors are killed off.\n* The new J&J shot takes the spike protein and puts it inside an Adenovirus (common cold virus) that combines to your cell and opens up and deposits the spike protein antibody inside your cell.\nEnd result is that all 3 of them make these antibodies that are going to be so destructive.\u00a0 Study indicates there are 28 organs in your body that can be attacked by that antibody.\u00a0 You can have 100 different symptoms (so it is hard to diagnose).\u00a0 It van cause cancer.\nIt\u2019s mass murder.\nThe survival rate on the virus without the vaccine is 99.91%\nTimeframe on deaths:\u00a0 It takes at least 6 weeks from the time you get the injection for the spike antibody to start to develop, so somewhere between 3 months and 20 years.\u00a0 See above.\nend of notes\nNEW:\nMD does full notes:\nDr. Tenpenny Expains In Simple Terms Some Of The Dangers of The Covid-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d\nDr. Tenpenny is an integrative medicine physician in Cleveland, OH who has studied the vaccine problems for over 20 years \u2013 read 1000s of mainstream medical scientific papers and has put in over 40,000 hours of study on these issues\nCertificate of Vaccine Identification Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 is an acronym for Certificate of Vaccine Identification 19 (19 ==> 1 for A and 9 for I, thus AI)\nThis \u201cvaccine\u201d is not a vaccine, but an exceptionally well-designed genetic modification killing tool\nIt can cause full blown autoimmune disease anywhere from 2 years and up to 20 years after injection !!!\nThis \u201cvaccine \u201c permanently alters host immune system\nNot only does shot NOT stop host from getting sick, the antibody (AB) itself turns on host\u2019s body creating havoc & massive auto-immune disease\nGovernments around the world are saying NO to mRNA vaccines because they are a form of MASS MURDER = GENOCIDE\nRemember that genocide is absolutely a key part of the Deep State Plan\nSpike protein AG presented to host immune system in 1 of 2 ways\nPathway 1 \u2013 CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY\nSpike protein fragment antigen (AG) binds MHC-1 receptor in ER & then MCH-1 Protein Complex leaves ER as vesicle to be exocytosed at plasma membrane\nThis MCH-1 Protein Complex then binds to and activates cytotoxic T-cells\nPathway 2 \u2013 Antibody-Mediatedy IMMUNITY\nRemainder of article discusses this pathway\nHow Shot Works\nSpike protein mRNA created from viral DNA spike protein sequence via revverse transcriptase\nSpike protein mRNA transcribed by ribosomes to create spike protein\nmRNA codes for the spike protein on corona viruses (37 corona viruses out there for at least 60 years, but only 7 infect humans)\nWHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT TRANSFECTION DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME, AS TRANSFECTION IS INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN DNA OR RNA ????\nHost DNA is indirectly, not directly, affected\nSpike protein binds to ACE receptor to gain entry into host cell to begin to replicate\nIt takes up to six weeks for this spike protein to be fully expressed & for re-exposure problems to surface\nThen, host immune system generates AB against spike protein\nThe problem is that the AB against spike protein is a non-neutralizing AB, that it, it is NOT made against the entire virus, but only the spike protein\nSpike protein antibody (AB) is a non-neutralizing antibody (unlike measles, mumps, chickenpox, shingles, etc. antibodies)\nAn antibody (AB) has 2 Fab fragments and 1 Fac fragment in the shape of a \u201cY\u201d (which is creepy in an of itself ==> Family Y)\nFab fragments bind to antigen to neutralize it and make it go away\nWith this shot, the Fac fragment causes alot of problems\nFAc fragment can bind to tissue in the lungs, Eosinoophils, Basophilss, other receptors that can cause anaphalatic shock, can cause direct modification of macrophages, can cross react with human tissues to cause autoimmune disease via molecular mimicry\nA key problem is B cell sensitization \u2013 the AB generating B cells retain memory of the AB forever (Memory B cells\nWe have no idea how long the spike protein will last in host\nWe have no idea how long the AB will last in host\nWe have no idea how long the B cells will continue to be active\nFor the rest of host\u2019s life, host may be suseptible to autoimmune disease, shock, allergies & death from this injection\n10 Mechanisms by which this Injection Can Cause Harm (Dr. Tenpenny can only cover a few in this video)\nPEG \u2013 Polyethelene Glycol\nThe coding around the mRNA is unstable, so they had to encase it in a lipid bubble (liposome)\nThe lipid bubble contains PEG\nHumans have been sensitized (i.e. primed or made allergic to) to PEG via many, many products over the decades\nIn 1960, about 2% of population was sensitized to PEG\nIn 2021, about 70-72% of population is now sensitized to PEG\nPEG reaction can cause an acute allergic reaction and/or anaphalactic shock & death\nPEG is in Moderna & Pfizer shots\nConcept of \u201cRe-Exposure\u201d or Antibody Dependent Enhancement\nThere are many folks who have taken the shot and say \u201cLook at me, I\u2019ve had no problems !!!\u201d\nWell, the problem comes when that person is re-exposed to any of the corona viruses\nThe anti-spike AB can then set up autoimmune disease\nAnti-spike AB can bind to spike protein, AG-AB complex internalized in macrophages (MP), RNA of virus released inside MP then causes\nOVERWHELMING infection (MUCH WORSE than had you never had the shot)\nThey have been trying to develop ABs against corona virus since 2005 because the flu, a corona virus, has a large burden of disease WW and there are corona viruses other than flu that also have a large burden of illness (so getting a corona virus vaccine is desireable)\nScientists have NEVER been able to get their studies (ABs against the full virus) past the safety studies on rats, rabbits, ferrets, hamsters & monkeys). These animals all got extremely sick or died on re-exposure to corona virus. Failure on both safety & efficacy.\nThese evil, Cabal, DS scientists are very smart & have almost unlimited money to spend on their genocidal projects\nWith COVID vaccine, they did not even bother with animal studies, and went straight to humans\nAG-AB complex Can Cross BBB\nCan converts two proteins in the brain and cause them to malfunction\nWhen these two proteins are corrupted, one can lead to ALS and one to Frontal Temporal Lobe Degeneration (Alzheimers Dementia)\nCovid Vaccine linked to infertility (placental protein deviously & malevolently contained in shot causes generation of Anti-placenta AB)\nMechanism of Cytokine Storm\nMacrophages (MPs) are the little garbage eaters of the immune system\nTwo types of macrophages (MP): MP1 & MP2\nMP1 is active on initial infection\nWhen MP1 attacks pathogen, cytokines are released\nCytokines are proinflammatory & cause fever & call in NK cells\nAs infection begins to resovle, MP2 come in like fire fighters to quell & calm the hot inflammatory soup & then begin to clean up debris\nMP1 ==> increased cytokines (what you want in initial infection)\nMP2 ==> decreased cytokines (also what you want to resolve initial infection)\nThe Anti-spike AB inactivates MP2s by binding by the FAc fragment to the MP2 cells ==> fire fighters CANNOT show up because they are inactivated\nSo the cytokine storm goes on and on and on\nThe OFF SWITCH has been deactivated \u2013 \u201cThere is an ON SWITCH, but NO OFF SWITCH\u201d\nNew J&J Shot\nWe have very little information on this shot\nSpike protein is inserted into an adenovirus (> 100 different strains for adenovirus) to gain entry into host\nSome adenoviruses turn on ONOCGENES that can cause cancer\nAutoimmune Disease & the \u201cVaccine\u201d\nA well-know immunologist tested the Anti-spike AB on 55 tissue types to determine cross reactivity\nThe Anti-spike AB cross reacted with 28 of the tissue antigens\nThus, you can see how a plethora of autoimmune diseases can take hold.\nHundreds of Sx can look different, but underlying pathology is that the Anti-spike AB, via molecular mimicry, interacts with up to 28 different tissue AGs in multiple organ systems\nVAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)\nAs of 2/18/21 VAERS has over 1000 reported deaths\nThis is about 10% of what is out there, so 10,000 \u2013 100,000 deaths are possible just SO FAR\n> 19,0000 adverse events reported\nThis is about 10% of what is out there, so 190,000 to 1,000,000 adverse events are possible just SO FAR\nIn the next 4-18 months, we can expect to see massive injury & major death from these shots\nFDA & CDC have violated 3 areas of Federal Law to allow the Emergency Use Authorization for the \u201cVaccine\u201d\nGiven a 99.91 % Survivability of COVID , \u201cVaccine\u201d is much less \u201ceffective\u201d & this is part of Emergency Use Authorization criteria being violated\nOther Effective Treatments that can also PREVENT infection\nHCQ, Zinc, Ivermectin, High Dose Vitamin C & High Dose Vitamin D\nADDITIONAL LINKS\nVaxx causes Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease! 25 min. video by Jana Ben Nun.

The COVID vaccines are over 800 times more deadly.\nAlmost 20 years ago, 60 Minutes ran a story \u201c The Most Dangerous Vaccine \u201d which quoted Paul Offit:\n\u201cWe know if we immunize a million people, that there will be 15 people that will suffer severe, permanent adverse outcomes and one person who may die from the vaccine,\u201d says Dr. Paul Offit, one of the country\u2019s top infectious disease specialists, and he knows all about vaccines that prevent those diseases. In his lab at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, he studies and creates new vaccines. There\u2019s nothing new about the smallpox vaccine.\nThe vaccine was created in 1796. The vaccine used today is essentially the same, Offit says. \u201cWe tend to think of vaccines as being very safe and every effective, which they are. But all the vaccines that we use today are the result of modern technology. That\u2019s not true of the smallpox vaccine. It has a side effect profile that we, we would not accept for vaccines today ,\u201d he says.\nAccording to multiple independent analyses summarized here, the death rate from the COVID vaccines used in the US is at least 400 deaths per million doses. That\u2019s 800 deaths per million fully vaccinated.\nThat makes the COVID vaccines the new leader by a long shot: the most dangerous vaccine ever created in history. They are 800X more dangerous than the smallpox vaccine with respect to death, and over 25X worse with respect to permanent disability (since the permanent disability rates are 10% higher than the death rate as you can see from the OpenVAERS redbox summary for US reports ).\nAccording to Offit, this rate of death and disability is unacceptable. I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve been calling for a halt to these vaccines since May 25, 2021 when I wrote this very long article for TrialSiteNews summarizing what I found after 3 weeks of intensive research.\nnative advertising\nFast forward to the present. Offit voted to approve these same vaccines for kids at the October 26 VRBPAC meeting because he refuses to look at the safety analysis (done using 8 different data sources). Offit thinks nobody has died or been permanently disabled by these vaccines. What does he think caused all those VAERS reports? I wish I could ask him that question. He doesn\u2019t think there is a single death caused by the vaccine. That\u2019s impossible. The VAERS data shows that virtually all the deaths in VAERS are excess deaths. If the vaccine didn\u2019t cause those deaths, what did?\nNobody at the FDA, CDC, or on the committees has figured out that the COVID vaccines are 800X more deadly than the former record holder. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first one to figure this out.\nWhy won\u2019t Offit debate my team of vaccine experts?\nDr. Offit: my team of experts are the biggest and most prominent misinformation spreaders on the planet. If you want to end vaccine hesitancy, then show the world we are wrong by agreeing to a debate. Here\u2019s the offer made by TrialSiteNews: Challenge to the Scientific Community \u2013 It\u2019s Time for Honest and Open Debate on Vaccine Safety. Will you accept?

Just a lot of the exact same kind of \u201cbad luck\u201d.\nEven the few doctors that won\u2019t mention the unmentionable but are clearly treating them with an understanding that the vaccine is likely the culprit are absolutely not elevating these cases through VAERS \u2013 or even among their own colleagues. The medical community is entirely bought into the cult, the financial/licensing bind, or subject to a culture of absolute compliance to the narrative.

But the fact remains that if Pfizer succeeds \u2013 or Moderna, with whom Israel also has a contract \u2013 these will be the first-ever messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines brought to market for human patients. In order to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, the companies will have to prove there are no immediate or short-term negative health effects from taking the vaccines. But when the world begins inoculating itself with these completely new and revolutionary vaccines, it will know virtually nothing about their long-term effects. \u201cThere is a race to get the public vaccinated, so we are willing to take more risks,\u201d Tal Brosh, head of the Infectious Disease Unit at Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital, told The Jerusalem Post. When Moderna was just finishing its Phase I trial, The Independent wrote about the vaccine and described it this way: \u201cIt uses a sequence of genetic RNA material produced in a lab that, when injected into your body, must invade your cells and hijack your cells\u2019 protein-making machinery called ribosomes to produce the viral components that subsequently train your immune system to fight the virus.\u201d \u201cIn this case, Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 is programmed to make your cells produce the coronavirus\u2019 infamous coronavirus spike protein that gives the virus its crown-like appearance (corona is crown in Latin) for which it is named,\u201d wrote The Independent. Brosh said that this does not mean the vaccine changes people\u2019s genetic code. Rather, he said it is more like a USB device (the mRNA) that is inserted into a computer (your body). It does not impact the hard drive of the computer but runs a certain program. But he acknowledged that there are unique and unknown risks to messenger RNA vaccines, including local and systemic inflammatory responses that could lead to autoimmune conditions. An article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, a division of the National Institutes of Health, said other risks include the bio-distribution and persistence of the induced immunogen expression; possible development of auto-reactive antibodies; and toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components. Brosh compared the mRNA vaccine to traditional vaccines, such as those for influenza, which use an inactivated virus that was destroyed by heat or chemicals to elicit an immune response without infecting the recipient. Others, such as for measles or mumps, use a weakened virus that is unable to hurt you but can still train your immune system to fight it. Oxford University\u2019s AstraZeneca, the Russian\u2019s Sputnik V and the Israel Institute for Biological Research\u2019s Brilife are all based on more traditional technologies. BUT MICHAL LINIAL, a professor of biological chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told the Post that she believes there is no cause for concern. Linial explained that \u201cmRNA is a very fragile molecule, meaning it can be destroyed very easily... If you put mRNA on the table, for example, in a minute there will not be any mRNA leftover. This is as opposed to DNA, which is as stable as you get.\u201d She said that this fragility is true of the mRNA of any living thing, whether it belongs to a plant, bacteria, virus or human. As such, she said the worry should not be that the mRNA won\u2019t get into the cells and instead will stay outside, floating in the body and causing some kind of reaction. Rather the concern should be that if it doesn\u2019t enter the cells, it will disintegrate and therefore be ineffective. She said that while Moderna and Pfizer are based on new vaccine technologies, they are asking our bodies to do something they do every day: protein synthesis, the process where cells make proteins. Moderna and Pfizer are simply delivering a specific mRNA sequence to our cells. Once the mRNA is in the cell, human biology takes over. Ribosomes read the code and build the protein, and the cells express the protein in the body. Linial said she believes that the reason no mRNA vaccine has been developed yet is because there was just no need to move this fast on a vaccine until COVID-19 came along. She noted that most of the vaccines people take today were developed decades ago. She said her concerns have less to do with the use of mRNA and more to do with the long-term efficacy of the vaccine, as well as other challenges that could cause something to go wrong and lead people to believe they are vaccinated when they are not. For example, she said that because mRNA is so fragile, the Pfizer vaccine must be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius. If the ideal environment is not maintained, the vaccine could \u201cspoil\u201d and become ineffective. In addition, she said several questions remain, such as whether these vaccines will really be able to mount a sufficiently protective immune response and how long that immunity would last. \u201cIt would be the worst [scenario] if people behave like they are immune but can still become infected,\u201d Linial said. Brosh added that the country and the world should be cautious about any of the vaccine candidates until the final results of their Phase III trials are peer-reviewed and published. But he said that once those studies are published and the vaccines approved, it will be OK to take them. \u201cWe will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,\u201d Brosh said, adding that we could wait two years to discover them, \u201cbut then we would have the coronavirus for two more years.\u201d Linial expressed similar sentiments: \u201cClassical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop. I don\u2019t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.\u201d But when asked if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: \u201cI won\u2019t be taking it immediately \u2013 probably not for at least the coming year,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cWe have to wait and see whether it really works.\u201d\nSign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >>\nSign up for The Jerusalem Post Premium Plus for just $5\nUpgrade your reading experience with an ad-free environment and exclusive content\nJoin Now >"}, {"Url": "https://jayceescommentaries.wordpress.com/2021/06/25/the-covid-vaccines-are-toxicdeadly-and-harmful-to-your-health", "CluewebURLHash": "07D44DA2A6A0AC366C9595669192557E", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "The Covid Vaccines Are Toxic,Deadly And Harmful To Your ...", "Snippet": "Dr. joseph Mercola explains what Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology, says about the\ue000 dangers\ue001 of the Covid jab: As explained by Malone, many months ago he warned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that the spike protein \u2014 which the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d instruct your cells to make \u2014 could be\ue000 dangerous.\ue001", "Click_Cnt": 0.034, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0026-03-16134", "CluewebDocument": "The Covid Vaccines Are Toxic,Deadly And Harmful To Your Health!!! | Jaycee's Commentaries\n\u2190 Are The Toxic Covid Vaccines Really For\u00a0Depopulation?\nKamala Finally Visits The Border\u2026Well Sort\u00a0of!!! \u2192\nThe Covid Vaccines Are Toxic,Deadly And Harmful To Your\u00a0Health!!!\n25 Jun\nAs I have reported previously a virologist in Canada has claimed they made a big mistake in creating these vaccines. His name is Dr. Brindle and he says they injected a spike protein into people thinking it was an antigen when it was the exact opposite, \u201cThe short answer\u2014.\u00a0The spike protein gets into the blood, circulates through the blood in individuals over several days post-vaccination. Once it gets in the blood, it accumulates in a number of tissues such as the spleen, the bone marrow, the liver, the adrenal glands. And of particular concern for me is it accumulates in the ovaries, in quite high concentrations.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve Made a Big Mistake.\u201d COVID-19 Vaccine Spike Protein is a TOXIN Injected into the Bloodstream.\nDr, Brindle continues \u201cWe made a big mistake; we didn\u2019t realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So, by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. Some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens, in some people, they can cause damage, especially to the cardiovascular system.\u201d\nAccording to the CDC so far there have been 4000 deaths in this country attributed ot he vaccine and another 4000 have come down with e virus after getting both shots. Many people are having blood clots from them and other ailments such as Bell\u2019s palsy and partial paralysis. Another 52,000 in Europe have died from these shots. Famed guitarist Eric Clapton\u2019s hands were paralyzed for a week following his shot.\nRecently, images of red blood cells under the microscope have appeared, showing some shocking revelations of what the vaccine does to the body.\nAfter the mRNA vaccine, the images of the red blood cells have an abnormal membrane and start to clump together.\nAnd that\u2019s only the beginning.\nActivated white blood cells were seen everywhere on a single drop of blood. This means either the white cells were stimulated by the vaccine OR more likely activated by the toxins in the vaccine.\nOther appalling findings include seeing nanoparticles viewed which are possibly the result of the vaccine. And not surprisingly, thrombosis, or the clumping of cells together, was viewed under the microscope.\nProfessor Montagnier, who has a Nobel Prize in Science and is one of the best virologists in the world, says any foreign substance injected into the body induces oxidative stress.\nAll signs pointing to negative health outcomes for those receiving the mRNA vaccine.\nDr. joseph Mercola explains what Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology, says about the dangers of the Covid jab:\nAs explained by Malone, many months ago he warned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that the spike protein \u2014 which the COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d instruct your cells to make \u2014 could be dangerous. The FDA dismissed his concerns, saying they did not believe the spike protein was biologically active. Besides, the vaccine makers specifically designed the injections so that the spike protein would stick and not float about freely.\nWell, they were wrong on both accounts. It\u2019s since been well-established that, indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gets free, and that it is biologically active and causes severe problems. It is responsible for the most severe effects seen in COVID-19, such as bleeding disorders, blood clots throughout the body and heart problems.\nThese are the same problems we now see in a staggering number of people having received one or two shots of COVID-19 \u201cvaccine.\u201d For more in-depth information about how the spike protein causes these problems,\nUsing the word vaccine isn\u2019t really appropriate here, and I don\u2019t want to contribute to the misuse of that word. These injections are clearly not vaccines. They don\u2019t work like any previous conventional vaccines. As the actual inventor of the mRNA vaccines clearly says in the interview, they are gene therapy. So, please understand that when I say vaccine or vaccination, I\u2019m really talking about gene therapy.\nDr. Malone also goes on to say that the CDC panel says heart inflammation cases likely linked to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\nIn a recent interview with Alex Pierson, Canadian immunologist and vaccine researcher Byram Bridle, Ph.D.who I mentioned above,, discussed previously unseen research obtained from the Japanese regulatory agency through a freedom of information act request.\n\u201cThe study was a biodistribution study done by Pfizer, which showed that the mRNA in the vaccine does not stay in and around the vaccination site but is widely distributed in the body, as is the spike protein.\nThis is a serious problem, as the spike protein is a toxin shown to cause cardiovascular and neurological damage. Once in your blood circulation, the spike protein binds to platelet receptors and the cells that line your blood vessels. When that happens, it can cause platelets to clump together, resulting in blood clots, and/or cause abnormal bleeding. I detailed these and other findings in \u201cResearcher: \u2018We Made a Big Mistake\u2019 on COVID-19 Vaccine.\nDisturbingly, the Pfizer biodistribution data package reveals that corners were cut in the interest of speed, and one of the research facets that were skipped was reproductive toxicology. Yet, despite the lack of an initial reproductive toxicology investigation and a rapidly growing number of reports of miscarriages (which is likely to be a significant undercount), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still urging pregnant women to get vaccinated. Why is that?\u201d\nA new study has confirmed that people who have been vaccinated against COVID produce excessive spike proteins that are capable of passing the Blood Brain Barrier causing irreparable damage to the brain \u2014 and Pfizer\u2019s own documents warn that vaccinated people actually shed these excessive spike proteins putting the unvaccinated at risk for harm:\nIn their latest issue brief, America\u2019s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) warned how\u00a0spike proteins resulting from experimental COVID-19 gene therapy vaccines have the capacity to 1.) pass through the \u201cblood-brain barrier\u201d causing neurological damage, 2.) be \u201cshed\u201d by the vaccinated, bringing about sickness in unvaccinated children and adults, and 3.) cause irregular vaginal bleeding in women.\nThe Former Vice President of Pfizer, Dr. Michael Yeadon has warned against these vaccines and wanted to stop using them and warned other companies \u00a0to stop using them. He has said that there is \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d propaganda coming from governments in response to COVID-19, including the \u201clie\u201d of dangerous variants and the totalitarian potential for \u201cvaccine passports. Dr  Yeadon said recently : \u201cBeyond reasonable doubt vaccination of entire population is predictably leading to substantial loss of life\u2019\nIn an exclusive interview with LifeSite News, Dr. Yeadon, who was the Chief Scientist for Allergy & Respiratory and spent 32 years in the industry leading new medicines research, said that there is a strong possibility of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that would lead to carnage far worse than the horror witnessed in the 20th Century.\nLifeSite News listed Dr. Yeadon\u2019s seven main points from their interview as follows:\nThere is \u201cno possibility\u201d current variants of COVID-19 will escape immunity. It is \u201cjust a lie.\u201d\n2. Yet, governments around the world are repeating this lie, indicating that we are witnessing not just \u201cconvergent opportunism,\u201d but a \u201cconspiracy.\u201d Meanwhile media outlets and Big Tech platforms are committed to the same propaganda and the censorship of the truth.\n3. Pharmaceutical companies have already begun to develop unneeded \u201ctop-up\u201d (\u201cbooster\u201d) vaccines for the \u201cvariants.\u201d The companies are planning to manufacture billions of vials, in addition to the current experimental COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d campaign.\n4. Regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, have announced that since these \u201ctop-up\u201d vaccines will be so similar to the prior injections which were approved for emergency use authorization, drug companies will not be required to \u201cperform any clinical safety studies.\u201d\n5. Thus, this virtually means that design and implementation of repeated and coerced mRNA vaccines \u201cgo from the computer screen of a pharmaceutical company into the arms of hundreds of millions of people, [injecting] some superfluous genetic sequence for which there is absolutely no need or justification.\u201d\n6. Why are they doing this? Since no benign reason is apparent, the use of vaccine passports along with a \u201cbanking reset\u201d could issue in a totalitarianism unlike the world has ever seen. Recalling the evil of Stalin, Mao, and Hitler, \u201cmass depopulation\u201d remains a logical outcome.\n7. The fact that this at least could be true means everyone must \u201cfight like crazy to make sure that system never forms.\u201d\nMany other scientists who have spoken out are censored.\u00a0 Nobody is allowed\u00a0to know the true purpose of the vaccine, and they will ridicule any facts about it, like they shut off Dr. Yeaddon, who was CEO from Pfizer.\u00a0 He sent out a full review on the vaccine to all the media, thousands of outlets, especially MSM.\u00a0 Only one small outlet responded, whose video was posted online and only a few saw.\u00a0 He is being shunned by all his colleagues, whom he describes as being in a deep trance.\nSecond they came up with a name for people who oppose the vaccine as \u00a0\u201canti vaxxers\u201d like they are a problem.\nThirdly, they set out to debunk and ridicule anyone who speaks against vaccine.\u00a0 They\u2019ve engaged the FBI to raid the homes at 3 am of the outspoken doctors.\nI thought it highly suspicious when the government was forcing these shots on everyone. They\u2019re not concerned about our health. These shots are toxic and no good. These vaccines were never to help us.\u00a0 Governments\u00a0don\u2019t do that anymore.\u00a0 Those vaccines were meant to severely hurt us or kill us.\u00a0 No other reason.\nAs soon as I read that Dr. Fauci has the patent on this vaccine as he does with over 100 other vaccines many who have killed people throughout the world as Bill Gates has also with vaccines in India and Africa where he is no longer allowed, I\u2019m believing more and more these vaccines are for depopulation which Faui and Gates both believe in for their New World Order or great reset for 2030.\nBill Gates has publicly stated there should only be 500 million people in the world and there are currently seven billion and we need to eliminate at least six billion to save the planet from too much carbon dioxide breathed into the air. Gates has said the only way to do that is through vaccinations.\nAnd they say these vaccines are safe????\nNew reports highlight exactly what we have suspected for a while; namely, that people who got the Covid-19 jab will probably need a booster shot. When, and how often they will need boosters remains to be seen.\nAs sources point out, scientists need more data before they can make an accurate forecast on how often people will need booster shots.\nThis lack of data is EXACTLY why people are hesitant to take the first round of the Covid-19 vaccine altogether. The very fact that scientists need to wait to figure out what is going on should excuse people altogether.\nAlthough many scientists estimate that the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines authorized in the United States will last at least a year, no one knows for sure. It is also unclear whether emerging variants of the coronavirus will change our vaccination needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters here in terms of boosters,\u201d said Dr. Edward Belongia, a physician and public health researcher at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Marshfield, Wisconsin.\nPfizer and Moderna have fueled booster questions by estimating that people might need yearly shots, just like with flu vaccinations, and the companies are working to have some candidates ready this fall. But companies will not decide when boosters get used. That will be up to health authorities in each country.\nAnd they say these vaccines are safe???\nI report, you decide.\nLoading...\nRelated\nThe Vaccines Are Not Safe, Not Effective,Not A Vaccine And People Are Dying And Permanently Injured From\u00a0Them!!!March 28, 2022With 3 comments\nAgenda 21,Vaccines And\u00a0Depopulation!!!

What is wrong with booster shots?\nImplications for doctors and patients.\nSummary: Are COVID Booster Shots and Vaccines Safe and Necessary? New Discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Vaccine-Immune Interactions\nBy now, most people have heard that COVID-19 vaccines can cause blood clotting and bleeding. Some readers may even be aware that reports of death following COVID-19 vaccination outnumber those for all vaccines combined since records began, 31 years ago, in the official US database VAERS [1,2].\nWith many patients now having received their first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines, additional booster shots are being rolled out in many countries. Given that no clinical trials have been performed on more than two injections of any vaccine, it is important that doctors and patients understand how the vaccines interact with the immune system, and the implications for booster shots.\nSo far, doctors and patients confronted with information on COVID vaccine side effects are typically reassured that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks. Governments, the pharmaceutical industry, regulators and the media advise populations that the majority of adverse events are mild and transient, with serious complications in only a small minority of vaccine recipients.\nMost patients, however, are unaware that among relevant scientific experts such a view is not so readily shared. Eminent independent scientists and researchers in the fields of immunology and microbiology have been writing to medical regulators since early 2021 [3], warning of vaccine-related blood clotting and bleeding, including that the official data on blood abnormalities post-vaccination likely represent \u201cjust the tip of a huge iceberg\u201d [4]. Those scientists\u2019 warnings pre-dated vaccine suspensions around the world due to acute disease from aberrant blood clotting post-vaccination. The warnings were based on established immunological science, applied to the novel mechanism of action of the gene-based COVID- 19 vaccines.\nNow, more than six months later, new discoveries in the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 [5] have caught up with the rushed vaccination schedule, confirming and extending the experts\u2019 prior warnings. The good news is that we are more comprehensively protected against COVID-19 by our own pre-existing immunity than was previously understood. On the other hand, this pre-existing immunity aggravates the risk that COVID-19 vaccines will induce blood clotting and/or leaky blood vessels. This risk must be expected to escalate with each revaccination. Vaccine-induced harm to our blood vessels is unlikely to be rare.\nPerhaps the most pertinent finding is that, due to the discovery of a widespread memory-type antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, the antibodies induced by the COVID-19 vaccines can be expected to activate the so-called complement system. This can bring about the destruction of any cell that manufactures the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, particularly in the circulation. If that happens to the endothelia, that is, the cell layer that lines the inner surfaces of our blood vessels, then those vessels may begin to leak [6] and clots will form. Given that 2021 research showed the spike protein to enter the bloodstream shortly after vaccination [5], this dangerous endothelial involvement in spike-production is highly likely, and should be expected to occur.\nAs stark as these medical realities may be, the silver lining is that the same antibody profile, along with previously documented T-cell immunity [7\u201311], protects around 99% of the population against life- threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. This ties in with the known fact that over 99% of people are safe from death with COVID-19 [12\u201314]. The implications for doctors and patients are that:\nVaccination against COVID-19 is unnecessary. Populations are protected by their immune systems against COVID-19. This applies to SARS-CoV-2 in all its variants.\nBooster shots are uniquely dangerous, in a way that is unprecedented in the history of vaccines. This is because repeatedly boosting the immune response will repeatedly boost the intensity of self-to-self attack.\nAn important consideration for patients is that those who have already been vaccinated against COVID- 19, and whose health remains intact, can protect themselves against serious harm by stopping now.\nFor a detailed explanation of the science behind these vaccine-immune interactions, please read Part II. Implications for doctors and patients are considered in Part III.\nIn Full: Explanation of New Findings on the Immunology of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Vaccines\n2.1. How and why COVID-19 vaccines incite immunological attack on blood vessel walls. What is wrong with booster shots?\nUntil recently, the immune profile of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines was not fully characterised. While we have known since mid-2020 that robust and lasting memory T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exists [7\u201311], the antibody picture has been less clear. Now, however, a convergence of evidence from peer reviewed studies published in 2021 reveals that pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 involves not only T-cells but also memory antibodies, in 99% of people studied. Two publications from 2020 alert to the probability that the immune response to the vaccine will also involve an important and powerful component called the complement system. This has profound consequences for the risk-benefit analysis of the vaccines.\nKey papers behind these recent developments are:\nOgata et al. [15] showing that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein circulates in the bloodstream shortly after vaccination with mRNA vaccine. This constitutes compelling evidence that spike protein molecules are produced by cells that are in contact with the bloodstream. The endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls naturally represent prime candidates.\nAmanat et al. [16], Ogata et al. [15], and Wisnewski et al. [17], who found that circulating SARS- CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies became detectable within 1-2 weeks after mRNA vaccination. This early response indicates immunological memory\u2014it can only be elicited through re-stimulation of pre-existing immune cells.\nGallais et al. [18], who provided data consistent with a memory-type antibody response in over 99% of people studied following first contact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nWisnewski et al. [17], who reported a very rapid increase of spike protein antibodies after the second injection of mRNA vaccines. This finding underscores the immediate dangers of revaccination.\nMagro et al. [19,20] showing that following entry into the bloodstream, spike protein directs complement attack to the inner vessel lining, causing damage and leakiness of the blood vessels\nAn explanation of the underlying immunology for laypeople follows.\n2.2. Updated Immune Profile of COVID-19 and its Vaccines\nImportantly for COVID-19 vaccination, the 2021 discoveries reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 is not truly new to our immune systems. The finding that the overwhelming majority of people show a memory-type antibody profile to COVID-19 vaccines proves that our immune systems have seen viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 before. As a result, our bodies have stored an immune memory of that family of viruses, equipping us to fight back more rapidly and powerfully the next time we encounter a similar virus again. As SARS-Cov-2 is of the coronavirus family, this indicates that we possess lasting cross-immunity from previous exposure to other coronaviruses, such as common cold coronaviruses, which are in wide circulation globally. Simply put, almost anyone who is fundamentally healthy\u2014or \u2018immunocompetent\u2019\u2014is naturally sufficiently protected against COVID-19.\nThis immunological status accords with the well-documented reality that the infection fatality rate for COVID-19 is 0.15-0.2% worldwide [12\u201314]. As is well known, COVID-19 infection runs a fatal course only in those who are weakened by age and significant comorbidity. Put differently, once infected, COVID-19 is non-lethal to >99.8% of the world\u2019s population. This same figure is upwards of 99.9% in the young and middle-aged. These statistics reflect the fact that protective cross-immunity is the global norm.\n2.3. A Word on \u201cCases\u201d\nBut what about the second and third waves of \u201ccases\u201d, including from Delta and other variants, around the world?\nIt is important to understand that a COVID-19 \u201ccase\u201d, as currently defined, does not correspond to being ill. To an unprecedented extent in medical history, rather than referring to actual disease, the term \u201ccase\u201d has become conflated with nothing more than a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result. While PCR tests are useful in laboratory research and as diagnostic tools when carefully performed, they are not reliable or appropriate when used in isolation, nor set at extremely high sensitivities, nor in poorly trained hands, as has been the case overwhelmingly for COVID-19.\nIt has long been known that reliance on PCR tests alone to define medical \u201ccases\u201d and causes of death results in \u201coverdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased health care costs\u201d [21]. If PCR alone were used to diagnose an infection with the diarrhoeal pathogen Clostridium difficile (CD), for instance, an epidemic of CD would immediately appear. We would find, based on PCR results, that 50% of people in long term care, and 15% of those hospitalised for any reason, are CD \u201ccases\u201d [22]. Should they die of any cause\nfollowing a positive PCR test for CD, they would be recorded as \u201cdying with\u201d CD. That figure could conceivably approach 100% if PCR tests were performed at the high sensitivities, or cycle thresholds, routinely employed when testing for COVID-19, in which the sensitivity of the test has been dialled up to meaningless extremes [23].\nMoreover, even if we accepted PCR alone as a diagnostically appropriate tool\u2014and therefore the high number of \u201ccases\u201d that it generates\u2014we would still necessarily infer a very low infection fatality rate for COVID-19. This supports rather than contradicts the reality that SARS-CoV-2 poses no significant threat to the immunocompetent. In short, thanks to population immunity, for the vast majority of us, a \u201ccase\u201d does not equate to severe disease.\n2.4. Four Immunological Problems with COVID-19 Vaccines\nWhile the now clearly established widespread cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 implies that most of us are safe from severe COVID-19 disease, it also means that we are vulnerable to the harms of gene- based vaccines. Due to recall immunity against the virus, vaccination will cause our immune systems to fight aggressively against not only the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but against ourselves. This deleterious autoimmune attack must be expected to intensify with each repeated injection.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine technology\u2019s interaction with the immune system creates the following four specific problems:\nFlying under the immune system\u2019s radar with the vaccine\u2019s genetic code 2. Delivering the spike protein into the bloodstream\nInducing immune attack on the blood vessel lining\nEnhancing the severity of natural infection\n2.4.1. Flying Under the Immune System\u2019s Radar with the Vaccine\u2019s Genetic Code\nTo understand why COVID-19 vaccine technology is dangerous, it is necessary to first understand how\nthe gene-based vaccines differ from traditional vaccination methods.\nA conventional viral vaccine can be a live virus strain derived from the pathogenic virus that has been attenuated through one or more genetic mutations, or it can consist of chemically inactivated virus particles that are no longer able to infect any cells. In both cases, protein antigens will be exposed on the surface of the vaccine particles, which can be recognized by antibodies once these have been formed.\nCOVID-19 vaccines, on the other hand, are not protein antigens but the genetic blueprint for the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein antigen. That blueprint comes in the form of mRNA or DNA, which, after vaccination, enters our body\u2019s cells and instructs those cells to manufacture the spike protein. The spike protein then protrudes from the cell and induces antibody formation. In response, the immune system will react not only with the spike protein, but will attack and try to destroy the entire cell.\nIf we are injected with a traditional live virus vaccine to which we have no immunity, then these vaccine virus particles will also infect some of our body cells and propagate within them. Two kinds of immune reactions will then occur:\nCytotoxic T-lymphocytes (killer T-cells) (see section 2.4.3.1) that recognize viral protein fragments associated with the infected cells will proliferate, attack, and destroy the infected cells.\nB-lymphocytes that recognize viral proteins (see section 2.4.3.2) will proliferate and start producing antibodies\u2014soluble protein molecules that can recognize and neutralize virus particles.\nThis immune reaction will in principle resemble that to an infection with the corresponding wild-type virus. It will be milder, since the vaccine strain of the virus has been attenuated; however, some cells will get destroyed in the process, which may sometimes cause functional organ damage. Live virus vaccines therefore tend to be more prone to adverse reactions than are inactivated virus vaccines.\nNow, a key point to note is that if we inject a live traditional vaccine into a person who is already immune \u2014due to either a previous vaccination, or to prior infection with the corresponding wild-type virus\u2014the extent of cell destruction will be much reduced. Such a person will already have antibodies to the virus; these will recognize the viral protein antigens and will bind and inactivate most of the vaccine virus particles before they manage to infect a cell. Therefore, even though the killer T-cells may be all riled up, they will not find very many infected cells to pounce on.\nThe crucial difference between a conventional live virus vaccine and a gene-based COVID vaccine\u2014and in particular an mRNA vaccine\u2014is that the latter contains no protein antigens whatsoever; instead, it only contains the blueprint for their synthesis inside the infected cells. Therefore, if such a vaccine is injected into a person with antibodies and existing T-cell immunity, the vaccine particles will \u201cfly under the radar\u201d of the antibody defence and reach our body cells unimpeded. The cells will then produce the spike protein, and subsequently be destroyed and attacked by the killer T-cells. The antibodies, rather than preventing the carnage, will join in by also binding to the cell-associated spike protein and directing the complement system (see later) and other immune effector mechanisms against these cells. In a nutshell, pre-existing immunity mitigates the risk of conventional vaccines, but it amplifies the risk of gene-based vaccines.\nImportantly, before COVID, this risky gene-based vaccine technology had never before been used on a wide scale against infectious disease and is inherently experimental. The COVID-19 vaccination program is thus the largest human experiment ever performed in history.\n2.4.2. Delivering the Spike Protein into the Bloodstream\nA dire danger of COVID-19 vaccines is that spike proteins produced by myriad endothelial cells, i.e. the innermost cells lining blood vessel walls, will be exported to the cell surface and protrude directly into the bloodstream. Moreover, a fraction of these spikes will be cleaved during their passage to the outside world. They will fall off the cells into the bloodstream and then bind to their receptors on other endothelial cells at distant sites.\nWhile at the outset of the vaccination campaign in 2020 it was unknown to what extent COVID vaccines entered the bloodstream, human data from 2021 reveal that the spike protein shows up within the circulation on the very day of the injection [15]. Similarly, animal studies submitted by Pfizer to the Japanese government [24] found that the vaccine appears in the circulation within 15 minutes of intramuscular injection, reaching maximum plasma concentration within just two hours. Very high levels have subsequently been recorded in the liver, the spleen, the adrenal glands, and the ovaries. Vaccine components have also been observed in the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord), albeit at lower concentrations. Such widespread distribution throughout the body via the bloodstream is a feat that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not usually achieve.\n2.4.2.1. Open Questions in the Ongoing Experiment\nBut how do COVID-19 vaccine particles enter the circulation in the first place? The vaccine is injected intramuscularly, and the vaccine particles are too large to passively diffuse across blood vessel walls. Most obviously, the vaccines will follow the conventional, relatively time-consuming path which takes them via the draining lymph nodes to the blood circulation. But additionally, two possibilities for very rapid entry\ninto the bloodstream should be heeded. The first is via direct uptake by vessels that are damaged during insertion of the needle. Secondly, it is possible that the vaccine particles undergo \u2018transcytosis\u2019, a process that enables large molecules to be transported across intact cell layers. Whatever the case may be, although Pfizer knew before the onset of clinical trials that their vaccine reached the bloodstream rapidly, either they failed to file these findings with medical regulators in Europe, the US and other Western countries, or the regulators failed to act upon the findings [25].\nThis is a critical oversight where patient safety is concerned. Given that the gene-based vaccines induce the body\u2019s cells to become immune targets, where in the body this takes place is of critical concern. While immune-mediated cell death is never favourable, it is particularly detrimental and dangerous if it afflicts the blood vessel walls.\n2.4.3. Attacking the Vessel Walls: Clotting and Leaky Vessels\nWhile all vaccines seek to stimulate an immune response, not all immune responses are created equal. Some are safe and well-modulated whereas others can be misdirected and out of control. Immune responses are problematic when they attack the self, as in autoimmune conditions, and/or when they are excessively intense and severe.\nCOVID-19 vaccines incur problematic immunity in both key ways. First, they can be expected mobilise a self-to-self immune response against the endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls. Second, by boosting SARS-CoV-2 immunity, they can be expected to incite an increasingly aggressive response with each administration of the vaccine.\nTo understand the realities of these processes it is necessary to first understand the basics of the underlying immune response. There are three key components of the immune system relevant to risks from COVID- 19 vaccines: T-cells, antibodies and the complement cascade.\n2.4.3.1. T-cells\nOnce the body\u2019s cells have been infected with a virus, immune cells known as cytotoxic T-cells or T-killer cells attack and destroy the infected cells. This prevents infected cells from replicating the virus and spreading the infection throughout the body. After the initial battle with a certain pathogen is over, some of the specifically adapted T-cells enter a state of dormancy to become memory T-cells. In case the same virus is encountered again, these dormant T-cells can be swiftly reawakened and propagated to mount a faster and more vigorous response next time. Known as a secondary or memory-type response, it will also occur with viruses that are not exactly the same as the one initially encountered but sufficiently similar to be recognised. This latter phenomenon is referred to as cross-immunity.\nIt has been known since mid 2020 that we are protected against SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive memory T-cells [7\u201311]. As with antibodies, this is based on previous encounters with common cold coronaviruses, and with the SARS virus in a small number of people. Such prior experience has been found to confer \u201crobust\u201d [7] and lasting T-cell cross-immunity to COVID-19. T-cell memory for the SARS virus is known to last at least 17 years [7], but it likely lasts a lifetime.\n2.4.3.2. Antibodies\nBefore the new discoveries of 2021, scientists\u2019 concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial cells, causing lesions on\nvessel linings and promoting blood clots. While this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well.\nWhereas killer T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen\u2019s surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by \u201ccalling out the cavalry\u201d on infected cells.\nThis leads to the second process by which cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune attack. \u201cCalling out the cavalry\u201d means that the antibodies attached to the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial cells.\nImportantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen, new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen\u2019s epitopes must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks. This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen before.\nAnother defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new, IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its relatives, have invaded before.\nImportantly, this is precisely what we see with COVID-19.\nSeveral research groups found in 2021 that upon first exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even \u201con the slightest viral challenge\u201d [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel coronavirus after all.\nWith respect to variants and the need for booster shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody response. The rising \u201ccases\u201d, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26].\nBut why haven\u2019t circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before? The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement cascade.\n2.4.3.3. Complement\nRecent findings indicate that complement activation is a serious concern with respect to COVID-19 vaccine-immune interactions.\nIn light of the newly characterised antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, when antibodies attach to spike- producing endothelial cells on vessel walls following vaccine administration, activated complement proteins can be expected attach to the endothelial cells, and perforate their cell membranes [27,28]. The ensuing death of the endothelial cells will expose the tissue underneath the epithelium, which will initiate two significant events. It will induce blood clotting, and will cause the vessel walls to leak [6]. This pathogenic mechanism has been documented in biopsies taken from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [19,29]. Those studies have described a \u201ccatastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement\u201d [29] as part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immune response. It is precisely this immune response that COVID-19 vaccines seek to induce.\nSuch vaccine-immune interactions are consistent with adverse events involving visible capillary rupture under the skin that have been documented and reported following COVID-19 vaccination [30\u201333].\n2.4.3.4. Leaky Vessels\u2014The Promise of Booster Shots\nGiven that booster shots repeatedly boost the immune response to the spike protein, they will progressively boost self-to-self immune attack, including boosting complement-mediated damage to vessel walls.\nClinically speaking, the greater the vessel leakage and clotting that subsequently occurs, the more likely that organs supplied by the affected blood flow will sustain damage. From stroke to heart attack to brain vein thrombosis, the symptoms can range from death to headaches, nausea and vomiting, all of which heavily populate adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines [2].\nAs well as damage from leakage and clotting alone, it is additionally possible that the vaccine itself may leak into surrounding organs and tissues. Should this take place, the cells of those organs will themselves begin to produce spike protein, and will come under attack in the same way as the vessel walls. Damage to major organs such as the lungs, ovaries, placenta and heart can be expected ensue, with increasing severity and frequency as booster shots are rolled out.\n2.4.4. Enhancing the Severity of Wild Coronavirus Infection\nFinally, as with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the net effects are severely detrimental.\nAttempts to develop vaccines to the original SARS virus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35\u201337]. The vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were subsequently infected with the wild-type virus, they became more ill than the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38].\nImplications for Doctors and Patients\nAlthough vaccine manufacturers and regulators are aware of the risks of antibody enhancement of disease, this possibility was not adequately addressed in the clinical trials on any of the COVID-19 vaccines. The\nFDA noted that Pfizer, \u201cidentified vaccine-associated enhanced disease, including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, as an important potential risk\u201d [23]. The EMA similarly acknowledged that \u201cvaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease\u201d was \u201can important potential risk\u2026 that may be specific to vaccination for COVID- 19\u201d.\nWhy neither regulator sought to exclude such dangers prior to emergency use authorisation is an open question that all doctors and patients are entitled to ask. Why medical regulators failed to investigate the finding that large vaccine particles cross blood vessel walls, entering the bloodstream and posing risks of blood clotting and leaky vessels is yet another open question again.\nThe fact that vaccine rollout began before the immune profile of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines had been adequately delineated is symptomatic of a rushed and highly politicised approach to the approval and regulation of COVID-19 vaccines. As is the lack of clinical trials investigating the safety of COVID- 19 booster shots.\nIn this context, it is up to doctors and patients to uphold the social contract of the doctor-patient relationship, and take medical prudence and patient safety into their own hands.\nThe World Medical Association, Declaration of Geneva, Physician\u2019s Pledge states [39]:\n\u201cThe health and wellbeing of my patient will be my first consideration. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will practise my profession with conscience and dignity and in accordance with good medical practice. I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my patient. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat.\u201d\nReferences\nOpen VAERS, (2021) VAERS COVID vaccine data.\nOpen VAERS, (2021) All deaths reported to VAERS by year\nDoctors for Covid Ethics, (2021) Doctors for COVID Ethics: letters.\nDoctors for Covid Ethics, (2021) Rebuttal letter to European Medicines Agency from Doctors for\nCovid Ethics, April 1, 2021.\nBhakdi, S. et al.

Immunologist Dr. Bart Classen writes: 4\n\u201cDevelopment of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long-term safety testing. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations.\nThe enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks lead the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.\u201d\nAmid the challenges of physical adverse effects from the vaccines, the lack of adequate testing and the underhanded methods in which vaccination may ultimately be made mandatory, many are now faced with the moral dilemma of being injected with genetic material that was grown in aborted fetal cell cultures. 5\nAborted Fetal Cell Cultures Used in Vaccine Production\nFebruary 27, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration 6 announced the authorization of emergency use for the Johnson & Johnson single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. At the same time, the Archdiocese of New Orleans announced that the vaccine is \u201cmorally compromised as it uses the abortion-derived cell line in development and production of the vaccine as well as the testing.\u201d 7\nIn addition to their warning that Catholics avoid the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because of its \u201cextensive use of abortion-derived cell lines,\u201d 8 the Archdiocese acknowledged that while there: 9\n\u201c \u2026 was some lab testing that utilized the abortion-derived cell line, the two vaccines currently available from Pfizer and Moderna do not rely on cell lines from abortions in the manufacturing process and therefore can be morally acceptable for Catholics as the connection to abortion is extremely remote.\u201d\nThere are other clergy members that disagree with using any of the vaccines available for COVID-19 since, as the statement above indicates, abortion-derived cell lines were used in the lab testing. 10 However, the Vatican has been aggressively pro-vaccine and approved the use, writing: 11\n\u201cIn this sense, when ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines are not available \u2026 it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.\u201d\nThe debate within the Catholic Church has a long history, which centers on using HEK293 cells that were harvested from an aborted fetus in the early 1970s. 12 The disagreement leaves many within the church without clear guidance from religious leaders.\nSemantics and Technicalities Used to \u2018Debunk\u2019 the Truth\nMuch of the confusion about using aborted fetal tissue in testing and production can be summed up in the statement from The Washington Post, which said in an archived version of a March 2, 2021, article, \u201cThe cells used now, such as those used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, are not from the original fetal tissue.\u201d 13 It should also be noted that an updated version 14 of the same article deletes this quote without mentioning that the article has been changed.\nThis is a common mistake that has been perpetuated in the media using general language to describe the process, which is precisely what self-declared fact-checkers use when they rate something false or misleading. As detailed in \u201d Several COVID-19 Vaccines Are Made Using Aborted Fetal Cells ,\u201d the answer lies in the technicalities and not in the general terms.\nThere have been several cell lines commonly used in vaccine development that originated from aborted fetuses.15 Six vaccine makers are using at least one of these cell lines in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, including AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.\nFact-checkers label \u201cfalse\u201d the claims that cell lines from an aborted fetus have been used in the testing and development of the vaccine for several reasons. Some critics of abortion-derived cell lines have claimed that the vaccines contain the cells, and since the vaccines literally do not contain abortion-derived cells, the entire claim is labeled as false.\nIn other instances, fact-checkers claim the cell lines are not original, as in the statement from The Washington Post, but rather a clone. While there may indeed be some who are concerned that the cells could be in the vaccine, typically, the moral objection is to the use of aborted fetal cells in medical research and development.\nWhatever the concern, it has become apparent that fact-checkers are trying to dissuade people from having a public conversation about the ethics of using abortion-derived cell lines to produce and test vaccines.\nIn fact, fetal cell lines are used during the production of certain vaccines and the claim that the cells are clones of the original is like saying your 20-year-old or 40-year-old body is no longer your body since all the cells are copies of those when you were a baby.\nThey are, in essence, a clone of the original. However, there is virtually no difference between cells that grow and multiply in a petri dish and those that grow and multiply in your body during your lifetime. If the cells in your body are still you, then the cells in the petri dish are still those of the original aborted fetus.\nReports of Side Effects Are Rising Rapidly\nSide effects from the mRNA genetic therapies used to create novel \u201cvaccines\u201d are inevitable. The genetic material effectively turns your cells into bioreactors 16 that turn out viral proteins to incite an immune response. Historical and preliminary evidence shows there are short and long-term side effects.\nAs Judy Mikovits, Ph.D., explains in her interview featured in \u201c How COVID-19 \u2018Vaccines\u2019 May Destroy the Lives of Millions ,\u201d the mRNA is synthetic, which the body sees as \u201cnon-self.\u201d This can trigger the production of autoantibodies to attack your own tissues.\nCommonly reported side effects in those who have received the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines have included symptoms that are suggestive of neurological damage.\nSince the vaccines began being distributed some of the side effects have included severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, 17, 18, 19 seizures and convulsions, 20, 21 persistent headache and migraine, 22 paralysis 23 and sudden death within hours or days. 24, 25, 26, 27\nAs detailed in \u201c Why COVID Vaccine Testing Is a Farce ,\u201d Mikovits predicts a long-term significant uptick in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as psychosis, Parkinson\u2019s, migraines, ALS and sleep disorders. She also believes there will also be a rise in pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, as well as cancers, kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis, to name a few.\nAdditionally, Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, a pediatric rheumatologist specializing in multisystem inflammatory syndrome, submitted a public comment 28 to the FDA in December 2020, in which he expressed concern that mRNA vaccines have \u201cthe potential to cause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in ways that were not assessed in safety trials.\u201d\nHe cited research showing that \u201cthe spike protein in brain endothelial cells is associated with formation of microthrombi (clots).\u201d It seems that since no viral RNA has been found in brain endothelium, \u201cviral proteins appear to cause tissue damage without actively replicating virus.\u201d\nGovernments \u2018Held to Ransom\u2019 to Secure Vaccine Deals\nWithin the U.S., vaccine makers enjoy full indemnity against injuries that happen from the COVID-19 vaccine, or any other pandemic vaccine, under the PREP Act. If you\u2019re injured, you must file a compensation claim with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). 29 This is funded by taxpayers through the Congressional appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\nAlthough similar to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), the CICP is even less generous than the NVICP when it comes to compensation. You will be responsible for any attorney fees and expert witness fees.\nAnother problem is that, like the NVICP, the CICP is administered within the DHHS, which also operates and promotes the COVID-19 vaccination program. This is a significant conflict of interest that makes it less likely the CICP will acknowledge that a COVID-19 vaccine harmed someone. 30\nHowever, in many countries outside the U.S., drug manufacturers are not afforded such liability protection. While most governments are offering indemnity to the vaccine manufacturers, there are a fair few who have not. According to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 31 Pfizer has asked for sovereign assets in Argentina and Brazil to be put up against any future legal costs.\nOfficials from Argentina and an unnamed Latin American country, which cannot be revealed as it signed a confidentiality agreement with Pfizer, told a journalist from The Bureau of Investigative Journalism they felt: 32\n\u201cPfizer\u2019s demands went beyond those of other vaccine companies, and beyond those of Covax, an organization created to ensure low-income countries can access vaccines, which is also requiring its members to indemnify manufacturers.\u201d\nDo Your Own Risk-Benefit Analysis Before Deciding\nBefore taking the vaccine it\u2019s important to do your own risk-benefit analysis based on your moral beliefs and science. It is crucial to be careful about making up your mind before using experimental gene therapy.\nIt is also important to remember that the lethality of COVID-19 is surprisingly low, lower than the flu for those under the age of 60. 33 If you\u2019re under the age of 40, your risk of dying is just 0.01%. This means you have a 99.99% chance of surviving the infection, which can improve to 99.999% if you\u2019re metabolically flexible, insulin sensitive and vitamin D replete.\nThe mRNA vaccines are not designed to prevent infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, only to reduce the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 disease. In the meantime, you also have the potential of becoming sicker once exposed to the virus, or it may trigger persistent serious side effects such as those reviewed above.\nI urge you to take the time to weigh the potential risks and benefits based on your situation before making a decision you could regret for the rest of your life. Undoubtedly, Pfizer and other vaccine makers suspect this as well, which is why they are asking for indemnification from all governments and are working hard to quash any public debate about the morality or science behind the vaccine. https://articles.mercola.com/sites/mercola/special-content/nvic-conference.aspx?cid_medium=email\nhttps://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/03/25/covid-vaccine-morally-compromised.aspx?ui=a468010ffca324df72434fc1695dac5999dd01a6bba7897c6a8cbd3afbd3d619&sd=20210122&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20210325_HL2&mid=DM839649&rid=1116118935\nLike\n7 bloggers like this.\nIn \"Covid-19\"\nCovid-19\nVaccines\nklevon\nMarch 25, 2021\nLockdowns: The Biggest Public Health Mistake Ever\u00a0Made\nBaltimore Health Dept.\u00a0Statistics"}, {"Url": "https://paulcraigroberts.org/2021/07/01/cdc-date-shows-covid-vaccine-a-dangerous-threat-to-the-young", "CluewebURLHash": "2DDB2B78B2E5CCD380536B50EC8942F4", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "CDC Data Shows Covid Vaccine a Dangerous Threat to the ...", "Snippet": "According to the reporting system Covid\ue000 vaccine side effects\ue001 are seven times higher than all 48,000 side effects of all\ue000 vaccines.\ue001 The inflamed heart condition is a\ue000 dangerous\ue001 one that can cause permanent impairment and death.

The truth is that the COVID-19 vaccine encourages the body to create copies of the spike protein found on the coronavirus\u2019s surface. This \u201cteaches\u201d the body\u2019s immune system to fight the virus that has that specific spike protein on it.\nConfusion arose when a false report surfaced on social media, saying that the spike protein on this coronavirus was the same as another spike protein called syncitin-1 that is involved in the growth and attachment of the placenta during pregnancy. The false report said that getting the COVID-19 vaccine would cause a woman\u2019s body to fight this different spike protein and affect her fertility. The two spike proteins are completely different and distinct, and getting the COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the fertility of women who are seeking to become pregnant, including through in vitro fertilization methods. During the Pfizer vaccine tests, 23 women volunteers involved in the study became pregnant, and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss had not received the actual vaccine, but a placebo.\nGetting COVID-19, on the other hand, can have potentially serious impact on pregnancy and the mother\u2019s health. Learn more about coronavirus and pregnancy. Johns Hopkins Medicine encourages women to reach out to their medical providers to discuss other questions they have about COVID-19 as it relates to fertility or pregnancy.\nMYTH: If I\u2019ve already had COVID-19, I don\u2019t need a vaccine.\nFACT: Evidence continues to indicate that getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the best protection against getting COVID-19, whether you have already had COVID-19 or not.\nA study published in August 2021 indicates that if you had COVID-19 before and are not vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected is more than two times higher than for those who were infected and got vaccinated.\nWhile evidence suggests there is some level of immunity for those who previously had COVID, it is not known how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again. Plus, the level of immunity provided by the vaccines after having COVID-19 is higher than the level of immunity for those who had COVID but were not subsequently vaccinated.\nGetting vaccinated provides greater protection to others since the vaccine helps reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nAt the time of vaccination, be sure to tell your care provider about your history of COVID-19 illness, including the kind of treatment, if any, you received and when you recovered. Wait until your isolation period ends before making an appointment to get the vaccination.\nMYTH: Researchers rushed the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, so its effectiveness and safety cannot be trusted.\nFACT: Studies found that the two initial vaccines are both about 95% effective \u2014 and reported no serious or life-threatening side effects. There are many reasons why the COVID-19 vaccines could be developed so quickly. Here are just a few:\nThe COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were created with a method that has been in development for years, so the companies could start the vaccine development process early in the pandemic.\nChina isolated and shared genetic information about COVID-19 promptly, so scientists could start working on vaccines.\nThe vaccine developers didn\u2019t skip any testing steps, but conducted some of the steps on an overlapping schedule to gather data faster.\nVaccine projects had plenty of resources, as governments invested in research and/or paid for vaccines in advance.\nSome types of COVID-19 vaccines were created using messenger RNA (mRNA), which allows a faster approach than the traditional way that vaccines are made.\nSocial media helped companies find and engage study volunteers, and many were willing to help with COVID-19 vaccine research.\nBecause COVID-19 is so contagious and widespread, it did not take long to see if the vaccine worked for the study volunteers who were vaccinated.\nCompanies began making vaccines early in the process \u2014 even before FDA authorization \u2014 so some supplies were ready when authorization occurred.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know | Las vacunas anticovid-19: informaci\u00f3n imprescindible\nLet's Talk Health (Hablemos de Sauld) | The COVID-19 Vaccines: What you need to know\nWatch on\nMYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine means I can stop wearing my mask and taking coronavirus precautions.\nFACT: The CDC continues to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and makes recommendations for wearing face masks, both for those who are fully vaccinated as well as those who are not fully vaccinated.\nThe CDC also recommends that masks and physical distancing are required when going to the doctor\u2019s office, hospitals or long-term care facilities, including all Johns Hopkins hospitals, care centers and offices.\nJohns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s current mask safety guidelines have not changed, and we still require all individuals to wear masks inside all of our facilities.\nMYTH: Getting the COVID-19 vaccine gives you COVID-19.\nFACT: The vaccine for COVID-19 cannot and will not give you COVID-19. The two authorized mRNA vaccines instruct your cells to reproduce a protein that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which helps your body recognize and fight the virus, if it comes along.  The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain the SARS-Co-2 virus, so you cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. The protein that helps your immune system recognize and fight the virus does not cause infection of any sort.\nMYTH: The side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are dangerous.\nFACT: The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines can have side effects, but the vast majority are very short term \u2014not serious or dangerous. The vaccine developers report that some people experience pain where they were injected; body aches; headaches or fever, lasting for a day or two. These are signs that the vaccine is working to stimulate your immune system. If symptoms persist beyond two days, you should call your doctor.\nAlthough very low risk, due to potential blood clots following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC updated its recommendations in December 2021. The CDC noted that the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, are preferred over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which remains available for those who prefer it and for use in certain circumstances.\nIf you have allergies \u2014 especially severe ones that require you to carry an EpiPen \u2014 discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with your doctor, who can assess your risk and provide more information about if and how you can get vaccinated safely.\nRead more about vaccine safety.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Email Alerts\nSign up to receive coronavirus (COVID-19) email updates from Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nSign up now\nMYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine enters your cells and changes your DNA.\nFACT: The COVID-19 vaccines are designed to\u00a0help your body\u2019s immune system fight the coronavirus. The messenger RNA from two of the first types of COVID-19 vaccines does enter cells, but not the nucleus of the cells where DNA resides. The mRNA does its job to cause the cell to make protein to stimulate the immune system, and then it quickly breaks down \u2014 without affecting your DNA.\nMYTH: The messenger RNA technology used to make the COVID-19 vaccine is brand new.\nFACT: The mRNA technology behind the new coronavirus vaccines has been in development for almost two decades. Vaccine makers created the technology to help them respond quickly to a new pandemic illness, such as COVID-19.\nMYTH: The COVID-19 vaccine was developed with or contains controversial substances.\nFACT: The first two COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized by the FDA contain mRNA and other, normal vaccine ingredients, such as fats (which protect the mRNA), salts, as well as a small amount of sugar. These COVID-19 vaccines were not developed using fetal tissue, and they do not contain any material, such as implants, microchips or tracking devices.\nMYTH: Now that we have a vaccine for COVID-19, we can make vaccines for the common cold, HIV and other diseases.\nFACT: The thousands of viruses that cause various diseases are very different. Many change (mutate) year by year, making it difficult to develop one vaccine that works for a long period of time.\nDeveloping vaccines for some disease-causing viruses is tough. For example, the virus that causes HIV can hide and make itself undetectable by the human immune system, which makes creating a vaccine for it extremely difficult.\nThe common cold can be caused by any one of hundreds of different viruses, so a vaccine for just one of them would not be very effective.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\nWhat you need to know from Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nLearn More"}, {"Url": "https://foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-covid-vaccine-dangerous-kids-big-tech", "CluewebURLHash": "1C43FEA2B7294DB1E3D0712B52B6B5D1", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Tucker Carlson: The COVID vaccine is dangerous for kids ...", "Snippet": "They discovered that the VAERS system, the biggest database of self-reported\ue000 vaccine\ue001 harm we have, isn't just showing elevated rates of myocarditis.

It was the WHO, you\u2019ll remember, that told us COVID couldn\u2019t be transmitted between people, even as the virus was spreading into the United States. It was the WHO that worked in stealth with the Chinese government to obscure the source of the outbreak at the beginning, and then hide its origins from the world. We\u2019re not attacking the WHO. Those are statements of fact. You\u2019d think. they\u2019d be disqualifying. Just the opposite. For more than a year, the tech monopolies of Silicon Valley have used the World Health Organization\u2019s official statements to determine what American news consumers are allowed to know \u2014 and what they should be prohibited from knowing \u2014 about COVID. Facebook even announced a formal partnership with the WHO to \"bring up to date and accurate information to billions of people.\"\nThat partnership \u2014 between a China -controlled NGO, and the China-beholden tech platforms \u2014 continued smoothly until just a few days ago. That\u2019s when bureaucrats at the WHO published new vaccine guidance. Here\u2019s what it says: children should not take the coronavirus vaccine. Why? The drugs are too dangerous. There's not nearly enough data to understand the long-term effects or to show that the benefits are worth the risk that they bring. This is terrible news, of course, for the pharmaceutical industry. Big Pharma has been planning to test the vaccine on six-month-olds. It\u2019s deeply embarrassing for much of the news media, which have taken a break from ginning up hysteria about Russian spies to sell vaccines to their viewers. And above all, it is a shocking repudiation of the American health establishment, which has been relentlessly pushing universal vaccination, including for children. Biden's top coronavirus adviser, Zeke Emanuel, declared that young people should be required to get the shot.\nEMANUEL:\u00a0 There are clearly places where you\u2019re congregating people that we should have mandates: students in universities \u2013 my university for example, faculty and staff.\u00a0 Health care facilities. Every health care worker ought to be vaccinated. I shouldn\u2019t have to worry whether my doctor or nurse has been vaccinated. \u2026 And I think employers ought to take this very seriously and consider mandating and requiring their workers to get vaccinated \u2013 especially if they\u2019re coming back to the office.\nWait a second, Zeke Emanual, if you\u2019ve been vaccinated, why would you worry about why the people around you have been vaccinated if vaccines work? Kind of an obvious question, no one has ever asked it. Someone should.\nDATA SUGGESTS \u2018LIKELY\u2019 LINK BETWEEN COVID-19 MRNA VACCINES, RARE HEART ISSUES IN TEENS, CDC PANEL SAYS\nBut they may not have a chance, because the WHO's latest finding -- that the vaccine is not safe for children -- threatens everything that reckless creeps like Zeke Emanuel and the pharmaceutical industry have been working for. More vaccines, no matter what the human cost. That is their position. In the end, the forces of recklessness appear to have more power even than the WHO. Here\u2019s how we know: In a remarkable about-face, Silicon Valley has decided that the World Health Organization is, in fact, not reliable, it\u2019s a disseminator of disinformation.\nFacebook has just censored a woman called Michelle Coriaty-Herbst for sharing the WHO's bulletin on vaccines word-for-word. She just posted it. Facebook deleted it. \"Your comment goes against our community standards on spam,\" Facebook wrote. So, this is Silicon Valley\u2019s new policy: everything about vaccines is good. Period. You are not allowed to suggest otherwise. No matter what data you might have. No matter what data you might have, no matter what a health organization might tell you.\nVideo\nAn epidemiology Ph.D. called Tracey Hoeg learned this recently. She posted slides from the CDC's own website showing that rates of myocarditis -- a potentially fatal heart inflammation -- are extremely high in young people who have taken the vaccine. That's not in dispute anymore; the CDC's preliminary investigation has just confirmed a link between the vaccine and myocarditis.\nAs Hoeg put it, \"We are standing on shaky ground if we say the risk to otherwise healthy kids from COVID-19 is higher than it is from the vaccine.\" She wrote that on Twitter. That\u2019s true. Twitter censored her.\u00a0 But why? It makes you wonder: why is that the one forbidden thing?\nTUCKER CARLSON: SCIENTISTS WANT TO USE HUMAN ENGINEERING TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE\nAnd, while we\u2019re at it, what are the risks from the vaccines? All medicines come with risks, so what\u2019s the real answer? Two medical school professors -- UCLA's Joseph Ladapo and Yale's Harvey Risch -- recently tried to find out. They outlined what they found in The Wall Street Journal. They discovered that the VAERS system, the biggest database of self-reported vaccine harm we have, isn't just showing elevated rates of myocarditis. It's also showing much higher rates of other, very serious complications -- low platelets, deep-vein thrombosis, and death.\u00a0Many deaths.\n\"The implication,\" they concluded, \"is that the risks of a COVID -19 vaccine may outweigh the benefits for certain low-risk populations, such as children, young adults and people who have recovered from COVID-19.\"\nHOUSTON HOSPITAL WORKERS FIRED, RESIGN OVER COVID-19 VACCINE\nThat's what the data show. Clearly. But instead of listening to the data, many schools and countless employers are mandating that everyone take the shot -- even if they've already had COVID and recovered. People who do not need the shot. Why are they doing this? It\u2019s lunacy. Well, presumably because people like Tony Fauci told them the vaccine is more effective than natural immunity. Is that true? No. It is not true. There are no data to support that claim. But Fauci says it anyway.\nFAUCI: We know that reinfections with a homologous strain, namely the same strain as initial infection, remain rare. They occur, but they\u2019re rare. Vaccination in people previously infected significantly boosts the immune response and likely, as I\u2019m going to show you in a moment, providing better protection against certain variants. And then the issue of vaccines actually, at least with regard to SARS-CoV-2, can do better than nature.\nCollege students, young adults in the prime of their life, are being forced to take the vaccine because Tony Fauci said that, even though they don't need it, and in some cases, don\u2019t want it. What will the effects on them be? Well, judging by the VAERS reporting system, we can be certain that some will be harmed. Beyond that, we can't be sure. We aren't even sure what effects this vaccine will have on the elderly -- the one group we were told from day one should take the vaccine as quickly as possible. \u00a0And most of us believed that.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut new numbers are coming. The Norwegian Medicines Agency has found that the vaccine may increase the risk of death in the elderly, as well. The Norwegian study conducted a study of 100 nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer's coronavirus shot. They found that at least 10 of the deaths were \"likely caused\" by the vaccine. 10%. And in 26 other cases, they were \"possibly caused\" by the vaccine.\nWhat explains those numbers? Doctor Robert Malone tried to address that question recently in a podcast broadcast on YouTube .\u00a0 YouTube took it down. They did that even though Doctor Robert Malone may be the most qualified person on the planet to discuss the subject. He helped create the mRNA technology behind the COVID vaccines.\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the June 23, 2021, edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\""}, {"Url": "https://tapnewswire.com/2021/12/latest-evidence-shows-that-the-vaccines-are-more-dangerous-than-originally-thought-by-dr-yeadon", "CluewebURLHash": "6B3167DC8729020F82E8C8CCBE3041A8", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Latest Evidence Shows that the Vaccines are More DANGEROUS ...", "Snippet": "The numbers killed by these \ue000vaccines\ue001 is much worse than we thought, already.

This trope is nothing more than a clever repackaging of the old antivaccine distortions and exaggerations about viral shedding after vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccines. Truly, everything old is new again.\nDavid Gorski on May 3, 2021\nTweet\nThere\u2019s a new antivaccine trope going around. It\u2019s one I wrote about before over at my not-so-secret other blog a couple of weeks ago, but it\u2019s not going away. If anything, since I wrote about it the first time, it\u2019s been spreading and mutating, producing variants not unlike the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 is mutating into new variants the more it spreads among its human hosts. So I thought I had better deal with this new antivaccine myth here on SBM, as it\u2019s a perfect illustration of how antivaxxers have been revising and repurposing old antivaccine tropes to apply to COVID-19 vaccines, while producing\u2014if you\u2019ll excuse the term, as I can\u2019t resist\u2014variants of antivaccine tropes previously repurposed for COVID-19 vaccines. If you\u2019ve read the previous post, there will obviously be a lot of overlap, but I hope to treat this new and mutating antivaccine trope from a broader perspective in this post; plus, I\u2019ve updated it considerably.\nThe introduction out of the way, let me just ask: Have you heard about how \u201cshedding\u201d of spike protein from the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, such as the vaccines produced by Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech, are making the unvaccinated sick and interfering with women\u2019s menstrual cycles (or even causing miscarriages)? It\u2019s producing some really bizarre social media posts:\nThis is fucking madness.

IT DOES NOT SHED.\nI am so ashamed of humanity right now. https://t.co/MlJJkibyDb\n\u2014 Joel Hill (@krunchymoses) April 22, 2021\nWorse, this trope has led at least one private school to place restrictions on teachers who are vaccinated before the end of the school year, as The New York Times reported last week, and even to threaten teachers who receive the vaccine over the summer:\n\u201cEven among our own population, we have at least three women with menstrual cycles impacted after having spent time with a vaccinated person,\u201d she wrote, repeating a false claim that vaccinated people can somehow pass the vaccine to others and thereby affect their reproductive systems. (They can do neither .)\nIn the letter, Ms. Centner gave employees three options:\nInform the school if they had already been vaccinated, so they could be kept physically distanced from students;\nLet the school know if they get the vaccine before the end of the school year, \u201cas we cannot allow recently vaccinated people to be near our students until more information is known\u201d;\nWait until the school year is over to get vaccinated.\nTeachers who get the vaccine over the summer will not be allowed to return, the letter said, until clinical trials on the vaccine are completed, and then only \u201cif a position is still available at that time\u201d \u2014 effectively making teachers\u2019 employment contingent on avoiding the vaccine.\nIf you want to see how much harm this myth of COVID-19 vaccines \u201cshedding\u201d and making people ill is causing, it\u2019s hard to imagine a worse scenario than that of the Centner Academy, where teachers are basically being threatened with losing their job if they get vaccinated against COVID-19.\nI could go on and on and on with the Tweets and social media posts by people who think that COVID-19 vaccines cause \u201cshedding\u201d of spike protein that makes others sick, but I\u2019ll stop here, other than to note that prominent spreaders of this antivaccine myth of \u201cshedding\u201d include Naomi Wolf, who has gone full COVID-19 denier/minimizer and antivaccine:\nAnd an antivaccine pediatrician whom we\u2019ve met before on this blog, Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, who lent his cachet as a pediatrician to the claim that people vaccinated against COVID-19 \u201cshed\u201d spike protein and make others ill. The antivaccine blog Age of Autism provided a link to his video and a transcript of the video.\nWhat I\u2019ll do in this post is to outline the claims about shedding, follow up with a bit of historical perspective on the claim (which is not new), and then explain why the claim is nonsense, with no evidence to support it. Finally, I\u2019ll try to put the claim in a broader perspective of types of antivaccine messaging.\nThree videos on shedding\nTo give you an idea of the nature of these claims, I will start by presenting three videos. The first two videos are \u201ctestimonials\u201d warning people to \u201cstay away\u201d from people who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine. The first of these is a woman claiming that reproductive-age women should stay away from people who have been recently vaccinated against COVID-19 because they are having \u201csevere\u201d menstrual side effects because\u2026magical contagion? It\u2019s not clear, but here she is:\nYou Must Listen\nIn brief, this woman claims that women who are around other women who have had the COVID-19 vaccine are missing periods or having the \u201cmost excruciating periods of their lives\u201d to the point where they are \u201cbleeding so profusely that it is out of character\u201d. How? Some sort of \u201cshedding\u201d of\u2026something. She even claims that postmenopausal women have been \u201cgetting their periods back\u201d, which, if true, would be alarming because postmenopausal bleeding can be a symptom of uterine cancer and is something gynecologists take very seriously indeed.\nUnsurprisingly, the woman is a \u201cwholistic reproductive doula\u201d, and, amusingly, she says that this is not about conspiracy theories (even though she claims that \u201cthey\u201d are trying to \u201csterilize us\u201d) and that she is \u201cstanding up\u201d for women. Also, \u201cthey\u201d are coming for women\u2019s health. But not just women, men, too, as she also claims that the COVID-19 is \u201cdropping men\u2019s sperm counts\u201d. She\u2019s also oh-so-empathetic to the point that she says that if you\u2019ve had the vaccine you shouldn\u2019t feel \u201cshame or sadness\u201d, even though she understands how \u201cnatural\u201d that would be. How nice.\nNext up is a woman named Nic Stinson, who runs that Truth UnMasked website:\nStay Away (Warning)\nStinson claims that women and men who have come into close proximity to people who have had vaccines are complaining of problems. She blames it on \u201cshedding,\u201d not of weakened virus, as is the case with some attenuated live virus vaccines\u2014more on that later\u2014but of \u201cshedding\u201d of the spike protein due to \u201cmRNA gene therapy\u201d that is \u201caltering the makeup of the human body.\u201d (Yes, she\u2019s using all the antivaccine tropes about the COVID-19 vaccine, including the distortion of fact that it\u2019s \u201cexperimental gene therapy\u201d that \u201c permanently alters your DNA .\u201d I guess she\u2019s afraid of her precious bodily fluids being sapped and impurified .) In any event, she claims that the vaccinated are \u201cshedding\u201d spike protein from their breath, and that that\u2019s making others who come into contact with them sick, causing reproductive problems, mass sterilization, and more. She also claims that exposure to vaccinated adults have resulted in ten year olds starting their periods or 11-year-olds having two periods in a month, as if that were horrifically abnormal. (My wife is a pediatric nurse practitioner. She tells me that it is not at all abnormal to start periods at age 10, and it\u2019s quite common for a girl\u2019s periods to be irregular right after menarche.) Stinson also reiterates the other claims of postmenopausal women starting their periods again and reproductive age women missing periods or having horrible periods, adding to that the claim that men whose wives have had the vaccine sometimes wake up covered in bruises.\nI had never heard of Nic Stinson before, but a quick Google search quickly led me to her Twitter account and Instagram page, which reveals her to be antivax and antimask to the extreme, as well as, or so she claims, a nurse. Here are just a couple of examples:\nInstagram\nInstagram\nThe link to this photo or video may be broken, or the post may have been removed.\nVisit Instagram\nInstagram\nInstagram\nThe link to this photo or video may be broken, or the post may have been removed.\nVisit Instagram\nInstagram\nInstagram\nThe link to this photo or video may be broken, or the post may have been removed.\nVisit Instagram\nOh, goody. She\u2019s repeating the claim that vaccines are \u201c transhumanism \u201c, and she\u2019s not just antivaccine, but offensively and disgustingly ableist, to boot, not to mention homophobic and vindictive! She also seems to think that people who wear masks are pedophiles, too:\nHow do people like Nic Stinson become nurses? Nic Stinson appears to be Nicolle Wagner-Stinson, former Director of Nursing at a nursing home in Ilion, NY, who plead guilty to \u201ccovering up sexual abuse and neglect\u201d there, in 2015.\nAnd what is \u201cvaccine shedding\u201d, anyway?\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the claim, as described by Dr. Palevsky in his viral video. I choose this video as the version of the \u201cshedding\u201d claim to examine, because it contains all the common elements of this particular piece of disinformation that I\u2019ve seen floating around social media and Dr. Palevsky seems to be one of the main originators of the claim.\nDr. Palevsky explains shedding\u2026badly\nLet\u2019s move on to Dr. Palevesky\u2019s video. As antivax pediatricians always do, Dr. Palevsky believes that, whatever the problem, real or imagined or made up, it really, really, really must be the vaccine. He even proposes a nonsensical mechanism, \u201cshedding\u201d:\nDoctor Explains What is Up\nI can\u2019t help but \u201cthank\u201d the Laura Hayes at AoA for helpfully providing me a transcript, so that I don\u2019t have to transcribe relevant passages myself\u2014or even watch the entire video (and so that you, if you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t have to actually watch the thing).\nLet\u2019s dig in:\nWhen studies are done on injections that are thought to be vaccines, we sometimes need 7, 10, or even 15 years, to understand what the injection does to the body, and what it does to those around us.\nHow did Dr. Palevsky ever manage to graduate from medical school and get through a pediatrics residency? Seriously. How? No, we do not need that long to determine how vaccines affect us. In general, adverse events from vaccines generally occur fairly quickly, and, no, vaccines do not cause autism, autoimmune disease, diabetes, or all the other chronic illnesses that antivaxxers attribute to vaccines. Whenever you hear an antivaxxer opining about how we don\u2019t know about \u201clong term\u201d effects of vaccines, this is what is meant, that we \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d if the vaccine(s) can cause autism and other chronic conditions. We do, actually, to a very high degree of confidence. Vaccines don\u2019t cause any of those things.\nNext up, Dr. Palevsky further demonstrates his lack of understanding of biology, infectious disease, and immunology. Either that, or he has such contempt for his audience that he is knowingly misrepresenting the situation. Take your pick:\nThe other thing is that we are made to believe in the public eye that this is a vaccine against a viral infection. So, the entire world is thinking that this is a vaccine to protect us against SARS-COV2 infection. And when you have a vaccine that is supposed to be effective as a vaccine, you are supposed to have antibody immunity against the SARS-COV2 virus. And that has never been evaluated with these injections as to whether or not we have antibody immunity to a SARS-COV2 virus. Instead, what we have is the genetic information of what is believed to be a piece of the SARS-COV2 virus, and that piece is called the spike protein. And the technology that is being used is a technology to make this injection that has never been used in vaccine science or methodology before with any kind of success.\nSo, we are essentially taking the genetic instructions that make a synthetic spike protein, believed to be a part of the SARS-COV2 virus, and we are giving those sets of instructions into the body and asking the human body to take the genetic instructions of that spike protein and make more of it in our own machinery. And so this messenger RNA technology, which is what it is called, is delivering the genetic instructions for us to make the spike protein. And the problem is that no study has ever been done to test its safety. But, also, no study has been done to test whether we turn on the production of that spike protein, and ever turn it off.\nAgain, even though the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were made in record time, the groundwork for their development was two decades in the making, as scientists have been developing this technology for SARS, MERS, and other coronaviruses, as well as for other viral diseases. Contrary to what antivaxxers like to claim or imply, mRNA vaccine technology did not just magically appear last spring as the pandemic took off. Indeed, it\u2019s been said that, had COVID-19 hit us five years ago, the technology would not have been ready yet, and we wouldn\u2019t have had a vaccine so quickly. As for the claim that \u201cno study\u201d has been done to test the safety of such vaccines, that\u2019s just nonsense. No, it\u2019s a lie. For the mRNA vaccines, there were phase 3 studies involving a total of over 70,000 subjects, and now that over 240 million doses of these vaccines have been administered in the US alone, the post-vaccination safety monitoring has been intense and found no serious safety signals for mRNA vaccines. Even in the case of the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines, which do use the spike protein as the antigen but use replication-deficient adenovirus vectors to induce recipient cells to make spike protein, the monitoring system has found rare, literally one-in-a-million adverse events in basically real time, as discussed by Steve Novella and a certain friend of the blog.\nEven more ignorant, though, Dr. Palevsky doesn\u2019t seem to know that if you produce an effective immune response to a key protein of a virus (or even just a key portion of a key protein), as long as the protein or fragment of a protein used as an antigen was well-chosen, the immune response provoked by that antigen can attack the virus and prevent infection. That\u2019s the whole idea of not using killed whole cell vaccines (in the case of bacterial diseases) or inactivated virus vaccines (in the case of viral diseases). That\u2019s the whole attraction of using recombinant protein as a vaccine antigen. It\u2019s much \u201ccleaner\u201d and easier to scale up.\nDr. Palevsky then disingenuously implies that, because spike protein has been associated with various toxicities from COVID-19, then it must be toxic if it is \u201cshedding\u201d:\nAnd so spike protein in the naturally occurring SARS-COV2 viral infection has been shown to cause brain inflammation and neurological damage, heart attacks, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, and interacting with the male and female reproductive systems, along with affecting blood binding to oxygen and blood clotting. And so we know that the natural disease of SARS-COV2, because of the effects of the spike protein, is making people sick with all of these kinds of systemic illnesses. And so now we are taking that spike protein genetic instructions and we are asking our bodies to make more of that spike protein. And so by making more of that spike protein, we are essentially creating the symptoms and the illness of Covid 19, by giving people the potential to have brain damage and neurological damage, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, heart attacks, strokes, blood clotting issues, and impairments to male and female reproductive systems. And there is no study to show whether when the body starts manufacturing this synthetic spike protein, whether or not we ever turn off the production of that spike protein. And so that spike protein is known to be pretty damaging to the human tissue.\nYes, spike protein causes problems when it is being made in large quantities as part of a coronavirus infection. Vaccine safety monitoring of hundreds of millions of people after having received hundreds of millions of doses of these vaccines have failed to find any safety signal suggestive of any of the claims made by Palevsky. In addition, it\u2019s just plain wrong to say that we don\u2019t know how long the body keeps making spike protein after vaccination. The vaccines were designed such that the modified mRNA from the vaccine lasts longer than \u201cnatural\u201d mRNA, but not indefinitely. Like all mRNAs, the mRNA for the spike protein used in COVID-19 vaccines degrades fairly quickly and goes away. As this article explains:\nRNA is required for protein synthesis, does not integrate into the genome, is transiently expressed, is metabolized and eliminated by the natural mechanisms of the body and is therefore considered safe 4,5,6,7. RNA-based prophylactic infectious-disease vaccines and RNA therapeutic agents have been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials.\nI\u2019ve pointed out before that the vaccines do not induce your cells to produce spike protein for more than 10-14 days. Seriously, does Dr. Palevsky think that figuring out how long the mRNA persists and how long it can induce the production of spike protein wouldn\u2019t have been among the first priorities in the preclinical development of an mRNA-based vaccine to COVID-19? Think of it this way: Why do the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require a second dose at three and four weeks, respectively? If the mRNA from the vaccine keeps making spike protein indefinitely (or even forever), as antivaxxer \u201cjust asking questions\u201d imply, then why would a second dose be required so soon after the first dose?\nBut, of course, Dr. Palevsky continues to \u201cjust ask questions\u201d:\nSo we know that spike protein has been found in saliva, we know that it has been found in the anus, and so, we have to ask the question, is it found in the exhalation molecules that come out of our breath? Is it found in the skin when we sweat and we smell, do the spike proteins come out, and if so, does that impact other people with whom we come in contact?\nNote how he cites no evidence that spike protein is being exhaled. Even though spike protein has been found in saliva and in the anus, this was in patients with COVID-19, not in vaccinated patients. But Dr. Palevsky is \u201cjust asking questions\u201d! See:\nAnd so what we have been seeing is a massive increase in those who have been given the injection of blood clotting problems, miscarriages, stillborns, infertility, strokes, heart attacks, autoimmune diseases, and death, just to name a few. And that\u2019s in those who have been injected. So, certainly, there should be a suspicion when you see people around the injected people, who have not been injected, getting the typical symptoms of Covid, in addition to miscarriages, bleeding, irregular menstrual cycles, it should raise a very, very strong suspicion. So, certainly, there should be a suspicion when you see people around the injected people, who have not been injected, getting the typical symptoms of Covid, in addition to miscarriages, bleeding, irregular menstrual cycles, it should raise a very, very strong suspicion.\nNo. It should not. It might if this were an attenuated live virus vaccine, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a vaccine that just makes one protein from the virus, the spike protein, to which Dr. Palevsky seems to attribute magical properties, even as he invokes very bad molecular biology:\nAnd the thing is that we are finding that the genetic instructions of the spike protein are not specific just to the SARS-COV2 virus. The genetic instructions of the spike protein are also similar to, or the same, as many proteins that exist in the body itself. And so, therefore, if we are going to produce an antibody against the genetic instructions of the spike protein, those antibodies are going to find every bit of protein tissue around the body that matches the genetic instructions of the spike protein. And that antibody to the spike protein genetic instructions is going to produce an attack on any of the proteins and tissues in the body that are similar or the same to the genetic instructions of the spike protein. So that is why you will see autoimmune diseases.\nSomebody get Dr. Palevsky a college-level introductory molecular biology textbook! Why? He seems not to know the difference between \u201cgenetic instructions\u201d, mRNA, and proteins. He seems to think that an immune response to an mRNA strand coding for a protein will attack the protein itself and any protein that looks like it, thus producing autoimmune disease. Truly, Dr. Palevsky needs a remedial course in basic biology and molecular biology. (Either that, or, again, he\u2019s lying. Take your pick.)\nHe even invokes old antivaccine tropes about COVID-19 vaccines that I discussed long ago, such as the claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause miscarriages because of the similarity between parts of the spike protein and an important protein in the placenta called syncytin. (They do not, as the areas of similarity are far too short to result in an immune response against syncytin.) He even refers to an \u201carticle from the European literature\u201d that says that the vaccines will \u201ccause the body to make an antibody against the genetic instructions of the spike protein, we will also cause the body to make an antibody against the male and female reproductive systems because those proteins in the male and female reproductive systems had similar instructions to the spike protein\u201d. Is he referring to Michael Yeadon, who apparently once worked for Pfizer but has become a COVID-19 crank? I suspect he is.\nIn any event, this whole claim that somehow those vaccinated against COVID-19 \u201cshed\u201d spike protein, which then screws up the menstrual cycles of women (or even causes miscarriages in pregnant women) who come into contact with the vaccinated is a clever \u201ctwo-fer\u201d, repackaging a combination of the myth of \u201cshedding\u201d with the hoary old trope among antivaxxers that vaccines cause female infertility, a trope that had been repackaged earlier, before someone thought of \u201cshedding.\u201d\nBut don\u2019t listen to those scientists who dismissed these claims based on, essentially, everything we know about molecular biology and immunology telling us they are incredibly improbable. Listen to Dr. Palevsky dismiss these scientists instead:\nAnd so the experts around the world did the following\u2026when they heard this scientific concern, the experts around the world said, oh, but the amount of genetic instructions of the proteins in the male and female reproductive systems are so small in similarity to the genetic instructions of the spike protein, that it really shouldn\u2019t make a difference. And, ladies and gentlemen, that is how we got the science that said there should be no concerns about infertility or miscarriages in men and women, respectively. There were no studies, just an opinion, that said the genetic instructions of the proteins on the male and female reproductive systems were such small similarities to the spike protein, that it shouldn\u2019t matter. And, therefore, it didn\u2019t matter. And so what we are seeing in women who get the injection, is a very large, hundreds of percent increase, in miscarriages and stillborns of their babies, all being reported to VAERS.\nYes, friends. Dr. Palevsky is speaking The Truth that \u201cthey\u201d don\u2019t want you to know about and dismiss without studying, pointing to anecdotal reports rather than rigorous epidemiological studies. He\u2019s even going beyond that:\nAnd now what we are seeing is women who are around others who have been injected are having the same experience, which has to raise the suspicion that not only does that messenger RNA make the body produce spike protein on an ongoing basis, but that spike protein is probably shedding out of the breath, the saliva, the skin, and who knows where else in the body it is being shed from.\nAs a thought experiment, let\u2019s just assume for the moment that there is something to Dr. Palevsky\u2019s speculations other than the ravings of a man who clearly needs to have his medical license taken away and be sent back to remedial basic biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Is he saying that spike protein is absorbed through the skin? That\u2019s incredibly unlikely, given the keratinized epithelium that is pretty effective at keeping foreign proteins out, except when broken. Is he saying we\u2019re breathing in spike protein? I suppose it\u2019s possible, but a vaccinated person is not going to make anywhere near the amount of spike protein as someone with an active infection, much less exhale it in quantities that someone is likely to inhale in amounts sufficient to cause toxicity. The reason SARS-CoV-2 is infectious is because droplets containing the virus suspended in the air get inhaled and manage to take up shop in the respiratory tree, replicating and making a lot more virus. A protein alone can\u2019t do that. More importantly, it\u2019s not just the spike protein that makes you sick. In fact, the contribution of the spike protein, which is the protein that latches the virus onto cells so that it can infect them, is probably, in and of itself, a relatively small contributor to severe illness in COVID-19. Rather, it\u2019s the virus, its replication in cells leading to massive cell death, and the immune response provoked by the virus in the context of infection that lead to the severe illness we see.\nBut Dr. Palevsky is \u201cjust asking (more) questions\u201d:\nJust the last point before you ask me the next question. That is only based on what we think we know is in these injections. But Dr. Tenpenny and I have discussed this on numerous occasions, that there is potential for other mRNA proteins being injected into the body that would cause the body to make all sorts of proteins that we may not be aware of.\n\u201cOther mRNA proteins\u201d? Again, Dr. Palevsky, get thee hence to a molecular biology textbook! You\u2019re conflating mRNA and protein. mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines can only induce the cells they come in contact with to make the protein for which the mRNA in the lipid nanoparticles codes. That\u2019s it. This is nothing but a fallacious appeal to what is represented as \u201cunknown\u201d but really isn\u2019t unknown at all! Again, either Dr. Palevsky needs a remedial course in molecular biology or he is lying. Take your pick.\nTo wrap up this section, I\u2019ll note that I concentrated on the biology, but Dr. Vincent Iannelli has noted that there have been no safety signals to suggest that these vaccines affect menstruation or fertility. He also notes:\nConsider Palevsky\u2019s evidence example anecdote of the healthy people who he believes get sick from shedding. Isn\u2019t it more likely that these folks, who you have to assume aren\u2019t vaccinated, are just getting COVID-19?\nAfter all, it isn\u2019t the spike protein in COVID-19 that makes you sick. The spike protein simply helps the virus get into our cells. Once inside, the virus is translated into 29 different proteins, which are assembled into new viruses, and then infect more cells.\nBut when you get vaccinated, you just have the spike protein. There is no SARS-CoV-2 virus to take over cells, so even if this shedding somehow did happen, it wouldn\u2019t cause any of the signs or symptoms of COVID-19 that Palevsky imagines.\nOf course, the antivaccine claim of \u201cshedding\u201d from vaccines is nothing new. Antivaxxers have long claimed that outbreaks of measles are really caused by virus \u201cshed\u201d from the vaccinated. Steve Novella has addressed this claim before. I think it\u2019s worth discussing shedding again, in order to contrast reality with antivaccine claims.\nHow shedding after a vaccine really works\nRegular readers will know that a favorite antivaccine trope is to claim that live attenuated virus vaccines (vaccines using a weakened version of the virus that can\u2019t cause disease) \u201cshed\u201d the virus and that that this attenuated virus is dangerous to those around them. This is a trope that existed long before the COVID-19 pandemic, and is being repurposed by antivaxxers now. Steve Novella has discussed viral shedding in the vaccinated as antivaxxers use it to spread fear of vaccines, but I\u2019m going to go through it as well.\nBasically, it\u2019s the antivax answer to the observation that they are potential sources of infection and outbreaks. It\u2019s projection in which they try to convince you that it is the recently vaccinated, not the unvaccinated, who are a danger to the unvaccinated and vaccinated alike. It\u2019s long been very clear to me that the claim that children shed virus and are thus potential vectors for infection is important to antivaxxers because it allows them to portray others as equally, if not more so, the cause of outbreaks than their children, but is there anything to it? Regular readers can probably guess the answer to that question. The answer, of course, is that there\u2019s far less to the issue of virus shedding than meets the eye. As I mentioned above, virus shedding can only occur with live virus vaccines, such as the rotovirus vaccine, oral polio virus vaccines (which are not really used in the US anymore because of a one in 2.7 million risk of paralysis from the vaccine strain of the virus), or intranasal flu vaccines.\nThere\u2019s a difference between shedding and causing disease, however. For one thing, the strains of virus used in live attenuated virus vaccines are just that\u2014attenuated. They\u2019ve been weakened so that they don\u2019t cause actual disease. Otherwise, using a live virus vaccine would be the same as giving the disease to the person vaccinated, which would rather sabotage the whole purpose of vaccination in the first place. The question, then, is whether secondary transmission (transmission of the vaccine strain virus to others who haven\u2019t received it) is a major concern. The answer to that question is no, as these articles entitled \u201c Secondary Transmission: The short and sweet about live virus vaccine shedding \u201d and \u201c Live Vaccines and Vaccine Shedding \u201c, show.\nWe learn from the former article that these are the commonly given live virus vaccines:\nMMR \u2013 the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine\nVavivax \u2013 the varicella or chicken pox vaccine\nrotavirus vaccines \u2013 including two oral vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix\nFlumist \u2013 the nasal spray flu vaccine\noral polio vaccine \u2013 the original oral polio vaccine (sometimes called the Sabin vaccine). Again, this has been replaced in the United States by the inactivated polio vaccine (Salk vaccine)\nWe also know that:\nthe MMR vaccine doesn\u2019t cause shedding, except that the rubella part of the vaccine may rarely shed into breastmilk (since rubella is typically a mild infection in children, this isn\u2019t a reason to not be vaccinated if you are breastfeeding though). What about the rare case of a person developing measles after getting the MMR vaccine? In addition to being extremely rare, it would also be extremely rare for a person to transmit the vaccine virus to another person after developing measles in this way.\nthe chicken pox vaccine doesn\u2019t cause shedding unless your child very rarely develops a vesicular rash after getting vaccinated. However, the risk is thought to be minimal and the CDC reports only 5 cases of transmission of varicella vaccine virus after immunization among over 55 million doses of vaccine.\nthe rotavirus vaccine only causes shedding in stool, so can be avoided with routine hygiene techniques, such as good hand washing, and if immunocompromised people avoid diaper changes, etc., for at least a week after a child gets a rotavirus vaccine\ntransmission of the live, nasal spray flu vaccine has not been found in several settings, including people with HIV infection, children getting chemotherapy, and immunocompromised people in health-care settings\nIn other words, the claim that virus shedding is a serious problem is yet another bit of antivaccine nonsense. It\u2019s true that some pediatric cancer centers in the past used to caution the parents of immunosuppressed patients to keep their children separated from recently vaccinated children, but that was more out of an abundance of caution than anything else. Indeed, guidelines from the Immune Deficiency Foundation state:\nClose contacts of patients with compromised immunity should not receive live oral poliovirus vaccine because they might shed the virus and infect a patient with compromised immunity. Close contacts can receive other standard vaccines because viral shedding is unlikely and these pose little risk of infection to a subject with compromised immunity.\nAntivaxxers actually do (mostly) realize that none of the current COVID-19 vaccines use attenuated live SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but they\u2019re nothing if not clever. So, instead of \u201cviral shedding,\u201d as Dr. Palevsky does, they point to \u201cshedding\u201d of the spike protein as the \u201ccause\u201d of the vaccinated being somehow dangerous to the unvaccinated. Whereas there was a real, albeit oft exaggerated, concern about shedding from live attenuated virus vaccines, concern about those vaccinated against COVID-19 \u201cshedding\u201d spike protein and causing problems in others is ridiculous in the extreme, from a scientific standpoint, as I discussed. It is, however, yet another example of how everything old is new again and there are no antivax tropes about COVID-19 vaccines that were not antivaccine tropes about other vaccines before the pandemic.\nAntivaxxers invent a response to criticism\nThe trope about shedding has now been officially around long enough that antivaxxers have come up with a response to the criticisms I\u2019ve just made. As is often the case, it involves misinterpretation and cherry picking. Here\u2019s what I mean, taken from Twitter:\nVaccine Shedding? pic.twitter.com/Ej9GUEHvV5\n\u2014 JeanieOrdinaryGirlNoFearStandup (@JS49) April 28, 2021\nYes, antivaxxers are pointing to the clinical trial protocol for the Pfizer vaccine, specifically this passage:\n8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure\nExposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness.\n8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy\nAn EDP occurs if:\nA female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention.\nA male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.\nA female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy:\nA female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.\nA male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.\nInterestingly, I have yet to see any sort of reference to similar passages in the clinical trial protocol for the Moderna, J&J, or other COVID-19 vaccines, which is telling, particularly given how similar the Moderna vaccine is to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Those who read clinical trial protocols all the time will recognize this as fairly standard verbiage found in many clinical trials of investigational agents. It must also be understood that the \u201cstudy intervention\u201d means the vaccine:\nMoreover, the \"study intervention\" means the vaccine. These sentences refers to, for example, healthcare workers who might have dropped some of the vaccine on their skin. The protocol requires their data to be collected. The \"study intervention\" is not touching vaccinated people. pic.twitter.com/q4s9lN12la\n\u2014 Bad COVID-19 Takes (@BadCOVID19Takes) April 29, 2021\nThis is the sort of data collected out of the proverbial \u201cabundance of caution\u201d and is not the \u201cslam dunk\u201d evidence that Pfizer \u201cknew\u201d that its vaccine could \u201cshed\u201d spike protein that antivaxxers think that it is. In fact, it\u2019s not evidence at all that Pfizer \u201cknew\u201d about \u201cshedding\u201d of the spike protein! Indeed, antivaxxers pointing to this passage in the clinical trial protocol as evidence that \u201cPfizer knew\u201d that spike protein shedding is a problem with its vaccine is evidence only of the extreme ignorance of antivaxxers to basics of clinical trial protocols.\nProjection, thy name is antivaxxer!\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned over the years, it\u2019s that antivaxxers very much resent it when it is pointed out that they are nearly always the source of outbreaks. They interpret these observations as accusing them of being \u201cdirty\u201d\u2014or, to borrow a religious term, given how much antivaxxers\u2019 views tend to resemble religion\u2014that they are \u201cunclean.\u201d Moreover, given how steeped in alternative medicine much of the antivaccine world is, along with the germ theory denial that permeates antivaccine beliefs, it\u2019s not surprising that they believe, in essence, in miasmas or some sort of magical field radiated by the vaccinated that sickens the unvaccinated:\nIt boggles my mind that ppl believe a cutting edge mRNA vaccine can spread a miasma that affects \"the weaker sex.\" What century are we in?\n\u2014 Raven Mae (@MaeNena73) May 2, 2021\nIn the age of the pandemic, they resent it even more when it is pointed out to them that they are an impediment to vaccinating enough people to achieve herd immunity and get the pandemic under control. Before the pandemic, the claim that \u201cshedding\u201d from live attenuated virus vaccines was the real cause of outbreaks was a way to project criticism back onto vaccine advocates. Then, the shedding trope had the advantage of having a germ of truth to it, at least with respect to the polio vaccine, even though now recommendations do not preclude giving MMR, for example, to the family members of immunosuppressed people. In the age of the pandemic, the whole \u201cshedding spike protein\u201d meme is an attempt, either conscious or unconscious, to \u201cturn the tables\u201d on vaccine advocates and scientists and portray the vaccinated as the source of contagion, as Dr. Iannelli notes, citing an antivaxxer named Maureen McDonnell::\nIt\u2019s almost like we need to turn the tables on vaccine recipients. I mean, people who aren\u2019t getting vaccinated are typically considered, you know, the outsiders\u2026 we\u2019re in the wrong for resisting vaccines, but in actuality, it could be that the vaccine recipients are the ones creating the problem.\nI reiterate that it\u2019s not \u201calmost\u201d like \u201cturning the tables\u201d. It is a conscious strategy to \u201cturn the tables\u201d and portray the vaccinated, not the unvaccinated, as being the danger. Don\u2019t think that antivaxxers don\u2019t know this and respond to it, for example:\nI\u2019ll conclude by repeating once again that, when it comes to antivaccine disinformation, there is nothing new under the sun. The talking point about COVID-19 vaccine recipients supposedly \u201cshedding\u201d spike protein and making people sick with it, not to mention messing with women\u2019s fertility and menses, is nothing more than a resurrection of two very old antivaccine talking points that cleverly combines the antivaccine myth of vaccine \u201cshedding\u201d causing outbreaks with the other hoary antivaccine myth that vaccines sterilize women. It\u2019s a talking point that relies on such tenuous basic science that I hereby sentence any physician or scientist who repeats the claimed scientific rationale for this lie to an immediate course in remedial biology and molecular biology. Finally, there is no clinical or epidemiological evidence to suggest that shedding of spike protein even happens at a high level, much less that it can sicken the unvaccinated, mess up women\u2019s menses, cause miscarriages, and render men and women infertile. This is all disinformation designed to \u201cturn the tables\u201d and portray the vaccinated as the \u201ccontaminated\u201d or the vector of illness, nothing more. Unfortunately, similar to the way that SARS-CoV-2 itself keeps producing more harmful variants the longer it circulates widely among the human population, this particular antivaccine meme is producing more harmful variants the longer it circulates.\nAuthor\nDavid Gorski\nDr. Gorski's full information can be found here, along with information for patients.

They're the ones with oodles of spike protein in their bodies.\nFWIW, I read clinical trial protocols All. The. Time.  Industry sponsored, NIH/NCI-sponsored, etc.  They all have precautions against getting pregnant or fathering a child.  I've been on Institutional Review Boards (IRBs, human research ethics committees) where we have actually told investigators, \"Since all the women in your study will already have had a hysterectomy, you don't need to spend two pages discussing the dangers of getting pregnant and requiring the use of effective birth control during the study.\"  But nope, they have to leave it in because ... lawyers, the 1 in 50,000 women who will choose to keep their uterus, etc.  Pfizer's protocol language about following the status of women who get pregnant during the study, etc. is completely unremarkable.\nKayMarie \u2022 12 months ago\nIt's the immune system, so homeopathic principles apply.\n1) You have COVID-19 and are swimming in massive oodles of spike protein - totes safe\n2) You have the vaccine so make just enough spike protein to alert the immune system - moderately dangerous\n3) You come across one (or some dilution of one) spike protein shed into the environment - massively dangerous.\nAnd no, the super spreaders infecting all around them can't be shedding spike proteins, why would you even ask that.\n/s\nAnd yeah, I feel you about the pregnancy language stuff.\nCarmen Ilinca Bratulescu \u2022 10 months ago\nPeople with COVID-19 does not bleed or paralyze or dye in 3 days, like some vaccinated people .

Friend had a mild case, one of the kids got a high fever and had to go to the ED for the usual fever issues some kids have from any fever kids get.

Wild-type COVID-19 infection has been known to damage the lymph nodes where immune responses develop, leading to poorer immune response than from the vaccines, which can't do that. In any case, I don't think you would want to risk an approximately 2% chance of death and a much higher chance of organ damage or other lasting injury from getting a wild-type COVID-19 infection, even if it did give you stronger protection against future infection... if you survive that is. The chances of that happening are greatly reduced with the vaccine, even against the delta variant.\nMotherWithAnAttitude \u2022 8 months ago\nThank you\nAnthony Jackson \u2022 8 months ago\nThere's a report claiming that, but it's generally inconsistent with prior studies, so I'd wait for more data.

They do not enter the nucleus of the cell, and no reverse transcriptase (required to translate mRNA into DNA) is included in the vaccine because that would be stupid.

Those vaccines just make sure the toxins don't kill you.\nAnother little fun fact about those bacterial diseases:  even if you survive diphtheria or tetanus, you can get re-infected fairly soon.  There is no \"natural\" immunity to them.

See: Pfizer \u2018Vaccine\u2019 Contains 99% Graphene Oxide After Electron Microscope Analysis\nGraphene Oxide & 5G\nIt\u2019s of paramount importance to understand why such a large volume of a known toxin such as graphene oxide has been put into these \u2018vaccines\u2019.\nFrom the very beginning it was correctly observed that there was a direct correlation between COVID-19 outbreaks and 5G roll-outs around the world.\nIn fact, all the first major SARS-CoV-2 clusters mushroomed in major metro areas that had just undergone the military deployment of 5G in 2019.\nTherefore, the established connection between those coronavirus epidemic explosions and flipping the switch on the 5G power grids is now undeniable.\nThis critical data point informs an emerging scientific narrative that\u2019s now being explored by an experienced and qualified team of Spanish researchers.\nLa Quinta Columna, a team of Spanish researchers, has discovered\nthat vaccines contain graphene oxide. It has an absorption band\nfor 5G frequencies and it may also be the reason\nbehind the magnetic phenomenon.\nBioterrorism Conspiracy to Commit Global Genocide\nWhere it concerns this complex criminal conspiracy to commit mass murder, there simply is no defense for any of the malevolent co-conspirators\u2014 Big Pharma, the American Healthcare System, the Public Health Agencies of the US Government, WHO, B&MGF, etc.\u00a0 Each of these institutions was well aware that vaccines don\u2019t work and have never worked as follows:\nVACCINE FRAUD CONTINUES! During the smallpox epidemic of 1871, 90% of the smallpox cases had already been vaccinated!\nNot only do vaccines not work as alleged by the Big Pharma-Medical-Government Complex, they\u2019re actually manufactured as weapons of mass death and disease.\nWith the roll-out of every COVID-19 vaccine program around the world, it\u2019s now clear that the explicit purpose of the Covid Super Vaccination Agenda was to conduct a slow-motion extermination of the human race.\u00a0 Of course, many of those who do not die from the different Covid jabs will inevitably suffer a fate much worse than death.\nAnyone who does not believe this ought to listen to this former Big Pharma executive who has literally put his life on the line to get the shocking truth out about this rapidly unfolding Extinction Level Event.\nTHIS FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF PFIZER IS TOTALLY ON FIRE (Video)\nConclusion\nThe former Russian biowarfare expert warned us last year that the COVID-19 \u2018vaccines\u2019 were intentionally created as lethal and injurious bioweapons. See: Former Russian Bio-warfare expert warns that \u2018Covid-19\u2019 vaccine is a deadly bio-weapon (Video)\nHowever, what she did not tell us is just how convoluted this genocidal plot truly is.\u00a0 For those who are not killed by the killer jabs, they will certainly be seriously debilitated the more Covid injections they receive.\u00a0 Each booster is meant to turbocharge the previous shot in ways that will produce myriad medical ailments and crippling health conditions.\nAs for the true purpose behind the various Covid injections \u2014 for those who are able to survive them \u2014 there\u2019s one primary goal that the New World Order globalist cabal is dead set on accomplishing.\nFUNVAX: Globalist Plot to Mandate COVID-19 Vaccine\nExposes Shocking Satanic Conspiracy\nState of the Nation\nJuly 7, 2021\nRecommended reading\nTHE COVID-19 EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENT\nThis entry was posted in SOTN Special.

It\u2019s free.\nA new preprint study in medRxiv is making waves after the researchers found that the risk of myocarditis caused by the COVID vaccine is much higher in teenage boys than previously thought. In fact, the study concluded that the risk of hospitalization for cardiac adverse events following vaccination is higher than the risk of being hospitalized with COVID for healthy teenage boys.\nAnalysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with Covid over a four-month period.\nMost children who experienced the rare side-effect had symptoms within days of the second shot of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, though a similar side-effect is seen with the Moderna jab. About 86% of the boys affected required some hospital care, the authors said.\nThe report by Tracy H\u00f8eg, MD, PhD, of the University of California Davis, and colleagues found that rates of \u201ccardiac adverse events\u201d after the second dose were higher than previous CDC estimates, at 162 per million among boys ages 12 \u2013 15 and 94 per million among boys ages 16 \u2013 17.\nAt current US infection rates, the risk of a healthy adolescent being taken to hospital with Covid in the next 120 days is about 44 per million, they said. This means that healthy boys are between 214% and 369% MORE LIKELY to be hospitalized because of the vaccine than from the virus .\nThe study relied heavily on data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. As of September 10th, there were 14,925 reported deaths associated with the COVID vaccines (63% of all vaccine-related death s reported since 1990). There were 60,741 hospitalizations associated with the COVID jab (44% of all vaccine-related hospitalizations since 1990). There were 701,559 adverse events associated with the COVID shot (46% of all vaccine-related adverse events since 1990).\nThe study has caused an uproar on social media, with many physicians, politicians, and pundits citing the VAERS data as unreliable source due to its limitations. And they\u2019re right\u2026 sort of.\nThe Lazarus Report estimates that only 1% of vaccine-related adverse events are reported.\nThis means that the actual number of hospitalizations and deaths related to the vaccines may be closer to 6 million and 1.5 million, respectively. But the study has not slowed efforts to vaccinate children as young as 5 years old.\nOn Monday, Pfizer announced that it\u2019s new lower dose COVID vaccine was \u201c safe and effective \u201d for children ages 5 \u2013 11, a demographic that has not been eligible for the vaccine (or associated mandates) so far.\nBut that might soon change.\n\u201c These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency ,\u201d said Albert Bourla, the chairman and CEO for Pfizer.\nThe long-term health effects of the mRNA vaccines on teenage boys (or any demographic, for that matter) are unknown. VAERS is limited because it relies on voluntary reporting. It was designed as a sort of early warning system to track potential problems with vaccines.\nBy any metric, the significant increase in reported events associated with the COVID shots is alarming. Remember, there have been more reported deaths associated with the COVID shots over the past 9 months than from all other vaccines combined over the last 30 years!\nSome so-called \u201cexperts\u201d have complained that H\u00f8eg et al. misinterpreted the data and should trust the CDC\u2019s own research, which shows a much lower incidence of heart problems associated with the jab.\nH\u00f8eg said the group used the same definition of myocarditis that the CDC did for its previous estimates using VAERS data, and that cardiologist and co-author John Mandrola, MD was key in vetting reports. She also pointed to the established fact that VAERS often provides an underestimate of the true prevalence of an adverse event.\nSeveral physicians, however, have asked why this group would bother repeating the CDC\u2019s own analysis, especially if they are using the same definition of myocarditis \u2014 and working without CDC\u2019s adjudicated data.\n\u201c We repeated the project because we were concerned about the symptom search criteria the CDC used being too narrow ,\u201d H\u00f8eg told reporters. \u201c We found around 40% of our cases simply using expanded symptom search criteria from theirs but requiring the same objective evidence they did of myocarditis (which we called in our paper \u2018cardiac adverse event\u2019) .\u201d\nShe said they also wanted to stratify risk by age groups 12-15 and 16-17, which CDC hadn\u2019t done:\n\u201c As a mom of 10- and 13-year-old boys, this was important information for me to see and I know many other parents feel the same way. The benefit of using the VAERS first was this is a rare event, which we were just beginning to track in the U.S., and VAERS gave us quick access to the largest number of reported cases ,\u201d H\u00f8eg said. \u201c We could also easily identify instances of post-vaccination cardiac injury in terms of troponin levels, along with case descriptions (which we have made publicly available) and directly compare our rates with those that the CDC found, demonstrating that there may be a significant amount of missed post-vaccination cardiac damage in this age group, specifically in the youngest group, compared to what the CDC had initially reported .\u201d\nUnfortunately, this kind of bad science is par for the course when it comes to the CDC. And if you\u2019re wondering why the CDC would be motivated to spin the narrative, you don\u2019t need to look much further than their bank accounts.\nMembers of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), who actually decide which vaccines are recommended to be added to the CDC vaccine schedules, are often financially involved with vaccine manufacturers.\nACIP members may own stock in Big Pharma companies that are responsible for producing the vaccines that the ACIP committee recommends! In fact, the law firm Weltchek Mallahan & Weltchek found over 50 patents connected to vaccines owned or shared by one or more members of ACIP or other committees within the CDC.\nWillingly placing children in harm\u2019s way is arguably the most despicable sin of all. The available data tells us that these \u201cvaccines\u201d are putting our kids in even more danger than the disease it\u2019s supposed to treat.\nWith billions in annual vaccine revenue, it seems our children are just another way for Pfizer\u2019s cronies to make money\u2026 no matter the cost.\nThe system is broken. Our healthcare systems, the pharmaceutical industry, our government and its regulatory bodies, our media, and even the technology sector have all been corrupted.

When you\u2019ve been vaccinated against a specific disease, you can gain protection \u2014 or immunity \u2014 against it.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has, to date, given emergency use authorization to two vaccines against the virus that causes COVID-19. These vaccines are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Johnson & Johnson has also applied for emergency use authorization by the FDA for their single-dose vaccine.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is a vital tool in the effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. But, you may be wondering about the safety of the vaccine as well as its potential short- and long-term side effects.\nIn this article we\u2019ll dig into what\u2019s known about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine, the possible side effects, and how the vaccine works to protect you from becoming ill.\nHow Safe is the COVID-19 Vaccine?\nThe COVID-19 vaccines were developed faster than most. But no corners were cut regarding the science.\n0 seconds of 59 seconds Volume 0%\nHow were the COVID-19 vaccines able to be developed so fast?\nVaccine development typically takes many years. However, COVID-19 vaccines have been developed in a short amount of time.\nIn fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are over 200 potential COVID-19 vaccines in development as of December 2020. At least 52 of these have entered clinical trials in humans.\nHow were these able to be developed so quickly? Below, we\u2019ll take a look at how this was achieved.\nScientific collaboration\nAs soon as the new coronavirus was identified and its genetic material was sequenced, scientists around the world began studying it in earnest. Along the way, they shared important research results with other scientists.\nThis high level of cooperation helped to better distribute valuable knowledge throughout the scientific and medical community about the virus itself, how it causes illness, and potential vaccination and treatment methods.\nExisting research\nThe technology that went into the COVID-19 vaccine may seem new. However, it\u2019s actually been around for some time. Scientists have been studying new ways to make vaccines for many years now.\nThis includes mRNA vaccines like those made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. In fact, prior to the pandemic, scientists had been studying this method as a way to make vaccines for other viruses.\nThis existing research gave scientists an important head start for developing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.\nFunding\nVaccine development is very costly. One of the main reasons for this is that it requires an abundance of testing for both effectiveness and safety. When a vaccine enters human clinical trials, these costs begin to expand rapidly.\nThree different phases of clinical trials must show safety and effectiveness before a vaccine can be authorized or approved. As these trials progress, the number of participants grows and so do the costs.\nEarly in the pandemic, funding was poured into the development of COVID-19 vaccines. This funding, which came from both public and private sources, allowed companies to effectively conduct the necessary vaccine research and clinical trials.\nTimeline acceleration\nNormally, the stages of vaccine development and testing occur one after the other. For example, a phase 2 clinical trial would only proceed after a phase 1 trial had been completed. This can take a lot of time.\nDuring the pandemic, some of these timelines were accelerated in order to shorten development time.\nAdditionally, companies scaled up the manufacturing of their vaccines while they performed clinical trials.\nThis is a large financial risk for these companies, as data could show that their vaccine isn\u2019t effective or safe, leading them to scrap the vaccine altogether. However, if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a ready supply of doses is on hand, as was the case for the current vaccines.\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed is the fact that all COVID-19 vaccines still need to undergo rigorous testing protocols aimed at determining their effectiveness and safety. Although development is sped up, accelerated timelines don\u2019t compromise scientific standards or integrity.\nCompanies must still present solid data from human clinical trials to the FDA that shows a vaccine is both safe and effective. Additionally, vaccine safety continues to be monitored after authorization or approval.\nWhat exactly is an emergency use authorization?\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are currently authorized by the FDA under an emergency use authorization (EUA). This is different from an FDA approval.\nEUA is a way for the FDA to allow unapproved medical products to be used during a public health emergency, such as a pandemic. In reviewing for EUA, the FDA must determine that the benefits of a product outweigh its potential risks.\nWhen a company submits for EUA for a COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA expects to see safety and effectiveness data from a phase 3 clinical trial. The trial can still be in progress as long as it has met specific milestones determined by the FDA.\nOnce received, FDA scientists as well as an external advisory panel made up of scientists and public health experts, will carefully go over the data. The FDA will take both the internal and advisory panel reviews into consideration when deciding to grant an EUA.\nWhat\u2019s known about the short-term effects of the vaccine?\nThe short-term side effects of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are similar. The side effects typically start within a day or two of getting the vaccine and may include:\npain, redness, or swelling at the injection site\nfatigue\nfever\nchills\nheadache\nbody aches and pains\nnausea\nswollen lymph nodes\nIt\u2019s pretty normal to feel mild symptoms like those described above after getting a vaccine. Although it can be unpleasant, it\u2019s actually a good sign. It means that your body is in the process of generating an immune response.\nWhile these side effects can be unpleasant, they\u2019re typically mild or moderate and go away after a few days.\nSide effects that are felt throughout your body, such as fatigue and fever, are more common after getting the second dose.\nSerious short-term side effects\nAlthough rare, some people have experienced more serious short-term side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. These side effects include immediate allergic reactions and a severe type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.\nImmediate allergic reactions typically occur within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine and can include symptoms like:\nhives\nwheezing\nswelling\nAnaphylaxis typically happens shortly after receiving the vaccine. Symptoms to look out for include:\nhives\nswelling\ntrouble breathing\ntightening of the throat\nfeeling dizzy or faint\nabdominal pain\nnausea or vomiting\ndiarrhea\na rapid heartbeat\nlow blood pressure (hypotension)\na feeling of doom\nAfter getting the COVID-19 vaccine, you will likely be monitored for at least 15 minutes afterwards to make sure you don\u2019t develop any serious side effects.\nHEALTHLINE RESOURCES\nUntil you get through this, count on our support\nIn difficult times, you need to be able to turn to experts who understand and can help strengthen your mental well-being. We\u2019re here for you.\nREAD MORE\nWhat\u2019s known about the long-term effects of the vaccine?\nBecause the COVID-19 vaccines have only been administered in the United States since December 2020, the long-term effects are unknown at this time.\nEven though people have begun to receive these vaccines, studies will continue to evaluate their safety and effectiveness long into the future. These studies will also focus on how long the immunity lasts from the vaccines.\nCan you get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\nYou cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine. Neither the Pfizer-BioNTech nor the Moderna vaccine contain the live virus. Because of this, it cannot cause you to become ill with COVID-19.\nBoth vaccines use mRNA technology to generate an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.\nWhat exactly is mRNA?\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines consist of a piece of genetic material called mRNA. Simply put, mRNA provides the cells of your body with instructions on how to make proteins.\nIn fact, mRNA occurs naturally in your body. Your cells use mRNA all the time to produce many types of proteins that are necessary for your health and well-being.\nThe mRNA in the COVID-19 vaccine contains instructions for making a viral protein called the spike protein. This is a protein that\u2019s found on the surface of the novel coronavirus. The virus uses it to attach to and enter a host cell in your body.\nWhen you receive the vaccine, your body will recognize the spike protein as an invader. Because of this, it will produce antibodies to protect you against the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein.\nWhat happens when the vaccine is injected?\nAfter you receive your Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the mRNA can enter the cells in your body. These cells begin to produce the spike protein, displaying it on their surface.\nCells from your immune system will notice these spike proteins and recognize them as foreign. Because of this, your immune system will begin building an immune response to the spike protein, which includes the production of antibodies.\nIf the antibodies produced by your immune system then come across the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, they\u2019ll recognize it as an invader and will be able to destroy it before it causes you to become ill. In other words, your immune system will be primed and ready to fight off and neutralize the actual virus once you get the vaccine.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that it typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for your body to build up immunity. Because of this, you could be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 right before or right after getting the vaccine and still become sick.\nEffectiveness\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that no vaccine is 100 percent effective. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95 percent effective 7 days after the second dose. The Moderna vaccine is 94.1 percent effective 14 days after the second dose. After vaccination, it\u2019s important to continue practicing precautions such as mask wearing, physical distancing, and handwashing.\nCan the vaccine change your DNA?\nYou may have heard concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine affecting your DNA. This isn\u2019t possible.\nYour DNA is contained within a special part of your cells called the nucleus. The nucleus is separated from other areas of the cell.\nThe mRNA that your cells naturally produce every day is made within the nucleus, but is promptly transported outside of the nucleus to be translated into protein. After the protein is made, the mRNA is destroyed.\nLikewise, the mRNA from the COVID-19 vaccine will remain outside of the nucleus. It will also be destroyed after the spike protein has been made.\nWho should avoid getting the vaccine?\nSome people should avoid getting the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. This includes anyone who\u2019s had:\neither a prior severe or immediate allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine\neither a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of the vaccine\na previous allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccine, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna provide full ingredient lists on their fact sheets for recipients and caregivers.\nCan children get the vaccine?\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are currently only authorized for use in people 16 and older, and 18 and older, respectively. More clinical trials are beginning or are planned for younger children.\nShould people with underlying health conditions get the vaccine?\nIf you have underlying health conditions, you can get the vaccine. In fact, this is particularly important because some health conditions can put you at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 complications.\nCurrently, the only exception to this is if you\u2019ve had a serious or immediate allergic reaction to one or more ingredients in the vaccine. In this case, you should avoid getting the vaccine.\nIf you have an underlying health condition and have questions about receiving the vaccine, be sure to speak with your healthcare provider.\nShould you get the vaccine if you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding?\nYou can receive the vaccine if you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding. If you have questions or concerns about getting the vaccine, talk with your healthcare provider.\nShould you still get the vaccine if you\u2019ve had COVID-19 and is it safe?\nYou may be wondering if you still need to get the vaccine if you\u2019ve already had COVID-19. The answer to this question is yes.\nScientists currently don\u2019t know how long natural immunity lasts after having COVID-19. Research on this topic is ongoing. A 2021 study of 188 people who had recovered from COVID-19 found markers of immunity up to 8 months after infection.\nInstances of repeat infection have so far only been documented in casestudies. However, this does mean that it\u2019s possible to contract the virus and become ill a second time. Vaccination can help prevent this from happening.\nCurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that certain people who\u2019ve had COVID-19 wait 90 days before getting the vaccine. This includes those that were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.\nDo you still need to take precautions after getting the vaccine?\nIf you\u2019ve already received the COVID-19 vaccine, you\u2019ll still need to take precautions, such as:\nwearing a mask when around others outside of your household\npracticing physical distancing\nfrequent handwashing\navoiding crowded areas or indoor spaces that are poorly ventilated\nThese precautions are necessary because scientists don\u2019t yet know if you can still transmit the virus to others after you\u2019ve been vaccinated.\nIt\u2019s possible that this could happen if you\u2019re exposed to the virus following vaccination, even if you don\u2019t actually become sick or have any typical symptoms of COVID-19.\nUsing v-safe after vaccination\nV-safe is a tool that\u2019s been developed by the CDC. It uses text messages and web surveys sent to your phone to help you check in after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\nYou can use v-safe to let the CDC know about any side effects you may be experiencing. Based off of your survey answers, someone from the CDC may contact you to discuss your responses in more detail.\nV-safe can also help remind you of when you\u2019ll need to receive your second dose of the vaccine. However, it doesn\u2019t schedule vaccination appointments, so you\u2019ll still have to do that on your own.\nIf you\u2019re interested in using v-safe after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC has instructions for how to register.\nThe bottom line\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has been developed in a shorter time frame than most vaccines. This was possible due to many factors, including unprecedented scientific collaboration, a large body of previous research, increased funding, and accelerated timelines.\nDespite the quick development of the vaccine, no corners were cut with regard to the science. The current vaccines were still tested rigorously in human clinical trials in order to assess their safety and effectiveness.\nThe most common short-term side effects include discomfort at the injection site and mild flulike symptoms. Allergic reactions to the vaccine can happen, but are rare. The potential long-term effects of the vaccine are currently unknown.\nReceiving the COVID-19 vaccine is important for preventing illness and stopping the spread of COVID-19. If you have questions or concerns about the vaccine, talk with your doctor.\nLast medically reviewed on  February 9, 2021\n23 sources\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical associations.

Using this definition, no vaccine is 100 percent safe. Almost all vaccines can cause pain, redness or tenderness at the site of injection. And some vaccines cause more severe side effects. For example, the original pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine could cause persistent, inconsolable crying, high fever or seizures associated with fever. Although none of these severe symptoms resulted in permanent damage, they could be quite frightening to parents.\nBut, in truth, few things meet the definition of \"harmless.\" Even everyday activities contain hidden dangers. For example, every year in the United States, about 350 people are killed in bath- or shower-related accidents, about 5000 people are killed when food lodges in their windpipe, and about 50 people are struck and killed by lightning. However, few of us consider taking a bath, eating solid food or walking outside on a rainy day as unsafe activities. We just figure that the benefits of the activity outweigh the risks.\nThe second definition of the word safe is \"having been preserved from a real danger.\" Using this definition, the danger (the disease) must be significantly greater than the means of protecting against the danger (the vaccine). Or, said another way, a vaccine's benefits must clearly and definitively outweigh its risks.\nTo better understand the definition of the word safe when applied to vaccines, let's examine a few different vaccines and the diseases they prevent.\nHear Dr. Offit explain the risks and benefits of vaccines by watching this short video, part of the Talking About Vaccines with Dr. Paul Offit video series.\nView this video with a transcript\nIs the hepatitis B vaccine safe?\nThe hepatitis B vaccine has few side effects. However, one side effect is serious. About 1 of every 1 million doses of hepatitis B vaccine is complicated by a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis. The symptoms of anaphylaxis are hives, difficulty breathing and a drop in blood pressure. Although no one has ever died because of the hepatitis B vaccine, the symptoms of anaphylaxis caused by the vaccine can be quite frightening.\nOn the other hand, every year about 1,700 people die in the United States soon after being infected with hepatitis B virus. And, millions of people throughout the world live with chronic hepatitis B infection. Between 1 and 2 million of these people live in the United States. Up to 1 in 4 chronically infected people will suffer severe liver damage (called cirrhosis) or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B virus. People are much more likely to develop these severe, and often fatal, consequences of hepatitis B virus infection if they get infected when they are very young children. For this reason, the hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for newborns.\nSome parents wonder whether it is necessary to give the hepatitis B virus vaccine to newborns. They ask: \"How is a baby going to catch hepatitis B?\" But, before the hepatitis B virus vaccine, every year in the United States about 18,000 children less than 10 years of age caught hepatitis B virus from someone other than their mother. Some children caught it from another family member, and some children caught it from someone outside the home who came into contact with the baby.\nAlthough about 1 to 2 million people in the United States are infected with hepatitis B virus, many of these are \u201csilent infections,\u201d meaning without obvious symptoms. As a result, many people who are infected with hepatitis B virus don't know that they have it. So it can be hard to tell from whom you could catch hepatitis B virus.\nWorse yet, many people don't realize that you can catch hepatitis B virus after coming into contact with very small quantities of blood \u2014 small enough that they are not visible to the naked eye. This means that someone can be infected through relatively casual contact with someone who is infected, such as sharing washcloths or toothbrushes. In fact, a milliliter of blood (about one-fifth of a teaspoon) from someone who is infected can contain as many as 1 billion infectious viruses.\nBecause the benefits of the hepatitis B vaccine clearly and definitively outweigh its risks, the hepatitis B vaccine is safe.\nWas the old pertussis vaccine safe?\nIs the pneumococcal vaccine safe?\nDetecting rare side effects\nReference\nReviewed by Paul A.

QUIJANO, M.D.\nProfessor (Ret.)\nDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology\nCollege of Medicine, University of the Philippines Manila\nThe COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2) vaccine is fraught with hazards. This should be the obvious, rational conclusion of anyone who cares to objectively study the available scientific and other relevant information about it. There are many factual danger signals that are easily discernible.\nDuring the 2002-2003 SARS-1 outbreak, it took about 20 months before a vaccine was made ready for human testing in clinical trials despite the fact that concerns about safety were still unresolved. This was already way too fast compared to the usual time necessary for pre-clinical trials or animal studies to be satisfactorily completed before any ethical experimentation on human beings or clinical trials can be started. Yet for Covid-19 candidate vaccines, clinical trials were started barely five months after SARS-Cov-2 emerged, bypassing the necessary pre-clinical studies normally required and ignoring the serious safety concerns in the previous attempt to rush a SARS-1 vaccine (which was eventually scrapped).\nOne major safety concern in developing a vaccine is how to get around the danger that the vaccine might actually \u201cenhance\u201d the pathogenicity of the virus, or make it more aggressive possibly due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), as what happened with previous studies on test vaccines in animals. If that should happen in a major human trial the outcome could be disastrous. (1,2,3,4) This serious adverse effect may not even be detected by a clinical trial especially in highly biased clinical trials laden with conflicts of interest involving vaccine companies. Even when a serious adverse event is detected, this is usually swept under the rug.\nFor example, initial clinical trial results for the COVID-19 vaccine of Moderna reportedly showed that three of the 15 human experimental subjects in the high dose group suffered serious and medically significant symptoms. Moderna, however, concluded that the vaccine was \u201cgenerally safe and well tolerated,\u201d which the corporate-dominated media dutifully reported, covering-up the real danger from the vaccine.(5,6,7,8) In a brazen act of unethical behaviour, Moderna even used a volunteer vaccine recipient, Ian Haydon, to appear in many appearances on media promoting Moderna\u2019s experimental COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna encouraged Haydon to appear on TV to deceive the public and its shareholders. Less than 12 hours after vaccination, Haydon suffered muscle aches, vomiting, spiked a 103.2 degree fever and had lost consciousness.(9) The vaccine, pushed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental mRNA technology that supposedly would allow rapid deployment, waiving the usual pre-clinical and animal studies.\nThe fact that an entirely new RNA vaccine technology which has never been used before in humans is a danger signal that should not be ignored. Several of the US candidates (Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Arcturus Therapeutics) are using this never-before-approved technology. Exogenous mRNA is inherently immunostimulatory, and this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It may provide adjuvant activity and it may inhibit antigen expression and negatively affect the immune response. The paradoxical effects of innate immune sensing on different formats of mRNA vaccines are incompletely understood. Potential safety concerns include local and systemic inflammation, biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies, and potential toxic effects of non-native nucleotides and delivery system components. A mRNA-based vaccine could also induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Another potential safety issue could derive from the extracellular RNA which has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may promote blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation. (10)\nAnother danger of mRNA vaccines is the use of biotech \u201ccarrier systems\u201d involving lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNPs \u201cencapsulate the mRNA constructs to protect them from degradation and promote cellular uptake,\u201d and additionally, rev up the immune system. The LNP formulations in the three mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are also \u201cPEGylated,\u201d meaning that the vaccine nanoparticles are\ncoated with a synthetic, non-biodegradable and increasingly controversial polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG). LNPs could contribute to one or more of the following: immune reactions, infusion reactions, complement reactions, opsonation reactions, antibody reactions or reactions to the PEG from some lipids or PEG otherwise associated with the LNP, as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mRNA or the LNP, any of which could lead to significant adverse events. Furthermore, PEG can also provoke severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in offsprings, including mood swings, rage, phobias and paranoia. Investigators who once assumed that the polymer was largely \u201cinert\u201d are now questioning its biocompatibility and warning about PEGylated particles\u2019 promotion of tumor growth and adverse immune responses that include \u201cprobably underdiagnosed\u201d life-threatening anaphylaxis. This is a significant concern since a 2016 US study reported detectable and sometimes high levels of anti-PEG antibodies (including first-line-of-defense IgM antibodies and later-stage IgG antibodies) in approximately 72% of contemporary human samples and about 56% of historical specimens from the 1970s through the 1990s. The manufacturers of genetically engineered adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines undergoing clinical trials (Johnson & Johnson, Oxford, and CanSino) also use PEG as an inexpensive additive for vaccine storage. If one of the PEGylated mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 gains approval, the increased exposure to PEG will be unprecedented and potentially disastrous. (11,12)\nLike the mRNA vaccines, the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines are still experimental and have not been used before in mass vaccination for infectious diseases. Given the history of poor safety record of many vaccines, the risk of unpredictable and potentially disastrous adverse effects is of utmost concern.\nFor example, among other dangers, the virus-vectored vaccines could undergo recombination with naturally occurring viruses and produce hybrid viruses that could have undesirable properties affecting transmission or virulence. The numerous variables affecting the probability that recombination will take place and the possible outcomes of recombination are practically impossible to quantify accurately given existing tools and knowledge. The risks, however, are real, as exemplified by the emergence of mutant types of viruses, enhanced pathogenicity and unexpected serious adverse events (including death) following haphazard mass vaccination campaigns and previous failed attempts to develop chimeric vaccines using genetic engineering technology.\nGenetically engineered vaccines carry significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards, including unintended and unwanted side effects with regard to the targeted or non-targeted individuals. Potential undesirable immunological effects include unexpected immunopathological reaction, autoimmune reaction, long-term tolerance, persistent infection and latent infections. There is also the potential to transfer or recombine genetic material from genetically engineered viruses or GE virus-vector vaccines to the targeted individual germ line cells. It can also undergo chromosomal integration or insertional mutagenesis, leading to random insertions of vaccine constructs into host cellular genomes, resulting in alterations of gene expression or activation of cellular oncogenes, thus raising the possibility of inducing tumors. Even minor genetic changes in, or differences between, viruses can result in dramatic changes in transmission abilities, host preferences, and virulence. The new, hybrid virus progenies resulting from such events may have completely unpredictable characteristics. Virulence reversion, for example, was documented when a live recombinant vaccinia\u2013rabies glycoprotein virus vaccine prepared for wild raccoons and foxes infected a 28-yr-old pregnant woman. (13) Virulence reversion was also documented when recombination between commercial infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) vaccines in poultry has resulted in virulent recombinant viruses that caused severe disease and that have emerged as the dominant field strains in important poultry producing regions in Australia. (14)\nThe risks of recombination was actually raised earlier in a meeting convened by the World Health Organization in 2003, wherein regulators representing the European Union, the US, China, and Canada raised the specific issue on recombination: \u201cRecombination of a live virus-vectored vaccine with a circulating or reactivated latent virus could theoretically generate a more pathogenic strain\u2026The risk of recombination should be studied if possible in a non-clinical model system, but should also be considered in clinical study designs.\u201d This was listed among the \u201crecommendations to WHO and priorities for future work\u201d as one of several \u201cissues of critical importance to be investigated further.\u201d (15) Apparently, however, the WHO, governments and the vaccine industry never took this recommendation seriously. This comes as no surprise, given the history of WHO\u2019s rapid approval and endorsement of several such live virus-vectored vaccines without the necessary and thorough safety studies, made especially concerning during the current mad scramble for a COVID-19 vaccine.\nThere\u2019s also a concern that some people may already be immune to the adenovirus carrying the coronavirus gene into the body since adenoviruses circulate through the human population making the vaccine ineffective. (16) Data on the initial clinical trial of the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine made by CanSino Biologics of China that was published in the Lancet showed that in the highest of the three doses used in the study, the number of side effects was high \u2014 75% of the people in the highest dose group reported at least one side effect. Side effects included fever \u2014 pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, among others. Ten volunteers (9% of the overall study group) had Grade 3 side effects, defined as \u201cserious and medically significant symptoms,\u201d six (17%) in the highest dose group and two (6%) each in the low and middle dose groups. The study also found that one dose of the vaccine, tested at three different levels, appeared to induce a good immune response in some subjects. But about half of the volunteers \u2014 people who already had immunity to the backbone of the vaccine \u2014 had a dampened immune response. (17)\nThe Dengvaxia vaccine fiasco in the Philippines also illustrates the danger of rushing a vaccine and allowing corporate interests driven by market forces to address people\u2019s health needs. As a result, many of the vaccinated suffered or died after a botched mass vaccination program.(18) According to the Chief Pathologist of the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, 153 of those vaccinated with Dengvaxia had died as of February 18, 2020. (19)\nAnother example of the danger of corporate fast-tracking of vaccine clinical safety trials is the case of the HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) vaccine. Two of the biggest vaccine manufacturers spiked their placebos with a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant and cut observation periods. Numerous adverse events, including life-threatening injuries, permanent disabilities, hospitalizations and deaths, were later reported after vaccination with bivalent, quadrivalent or nine-valent HPV vaccines. The company scientists routinely dismissed, minimized or concealed those injuries using statistical gimmicks and invalid comparisons designed to diminish their relative significance. Some regulatory agencies were complicit in covering up increased incidence of adverse effects in post-marketing surveillance studies.(20, 21)\nAnother concern is that vaccines produced with cell cultures are often contaminated with naked nucleic acids, genomic fragments, retroviruses and other foreign materials that carry uncertain but potentially serious hazards. This contamination may be present in the source material, e.g. human blood, human or animal tissues, cell banks, or introduced in the manufacturing process through the use of animal sera. Many candidate COVID-19 vaccines are produced on what is called \u201cimmortal\u201d cell lines or cancerous types of cells (e.g. Vero cells derived from the African green monkey) that could spread cancer-promoting material into the human recipient. Manufacturers and authorities assure us that these do not cause tumors per se. However, scientific studies tell us that after these cells have been repeatedly cultured a certain number of times, they can convert to a cancerous state. Immortal cell lines show 100-times greater number of DNA recombination events compared to normal cells. This could result in viral-viral or viral-cellular interactions that can generate new viruses and result to pathological consequences, including autoimmunity and cancer. (22) Even the US FDA recognized this danger. In a paper published in its website, it stated: \u201cIn some cases the cell lines that are used might be tumorigenic, that is, they form tumors when injected into rodents. Some of these tumor-forming cell lines may contain cancer-causing viruses that are not actively reproducing. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods. These latent, or \u2018quiet,\u2019 viruses pose a potential threat, since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions.\u201d (23)\nStill another concern, not only in terms of safety issues but also on moral grounds, is the use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacture. Vaccines produced from human fetal cells contain cell debris and contaminating fetal DNA (together with its epigenetic modification) which cannot be fully eliminated during downstream purification. This could cause insertional mutagenesis (potentially causing cancer) and autoimmunity in the vaccinated. At least six of the COVID-19 candidate vaccines (Cansino, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, ImmunityBio/NantKwest, University of Pittsburgh and Altimmune) use one of two human fetal cell lines: HEK-293, a kidney cell line that comes from a fetus aborted in about 1972; and PER. C6, a proprietary cell line owned by Janssen, developed from retinal cells from an 18-week-old fetus aborted in 1985. (24)\nThere are many plausible biological mechanisms for potential adverse effects of all the vaccines in the pipeline for COVID-19. The history of vaccination is replete with scientific evidence of adverse effects through enhanced pathogenicity, mutation, recombination, induced immune system dysfunction, and various non-specific effects following vaccination despite regulatory approval and prior clinical trials and other corporate sponsored studies that were claimed to be proof of safety. The inherent danger of injecting microbial protein fragments, contaminants, DNA and other foreign materials into the human body is well documented in the scientific literature. Practically all vaccines contain such hazardous foreign fragments and materials and are unavoidably unsafe. Furthermore, exposure of the vaccinee to other environmental hazards (pesticides, air pollutants, 5G radiation, ionizing radiation, etc.) resulting to synergistic adverse effects not captured by corporate sponsored \u201csafety\u201d studies is also another plausible mechanism that may result in acute or long-term injury, including death.\nSafety assessments under the corporate dominated scientific milieu are grossly inadequate and oftentimes erroneous. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are done or sponsored by the very corporations who sell the vaccines and they do not adequately address the plausible adverse effects that cannot be detected by the corporate sponsored studies. There are no independent studies that could validate the claims of the vaccine manufacturers. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the potential benefits from an upcoming COVID-19 vaccine would outweigh the potential adverse effects, despite assurances of safety by the vaccine industry, international institutions, governments and the mainstream medical science groups.\nReferences:\n(1).

Wells\nJuly 5, 2021\nThe whole premise of getting a vaccine is based on the supposed science that proves there is more of a threat from the disease than the vaccine itself. Yet, three months after getting vaccinated with the Moderna Covid-19 jab, six of this doctor\u2019s patients are STILL experiencing severe neurological side effects, and they only got the first shot. Was it worth it?\nThe Chinese Flu is only killing people who are already suffering from cancer, diabetes, heart disease or autoimmune problems, so now why is everybody else told to get jabbed when the risk of vaccine injury FAR OUTWEIGHS the risk of dying from Covid-19, or Delta Variant, or Beta, or Gamma or whatever else Fauci and Gates release next.\nA family doctor in\u00a0British Columbia\u00a0can\u2019t stay silent about the dangers of these Covid-19 vaccines anymore\nHe\u2019s had enough. His patients that he\u2019s seen for 10, 20, 25 years are suddenly suffering severe neurological damage and allergic reactions like he\u2019s never seen before, and right after they got their China Flu jabs made by Moderna. Dr. Charles Hoffe is on the record now describing his First Nations patients\u2019 life-threatening \u201cside effects\u201d as he shares this whistle-blowing information with other medical professionals and journalists alike so the word can get out. The vaccine is MORE dangerous than Covid-19. Period.\nIn his open letter to B.C. Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Hoffe describes the mild effects coronavirus has had in his community, and how they haven\u2019t had to give medical care to the people who catch it, because they just have mild symptoms and it goes away.\nNow the vaccine is quite clearly more dangerous than Covid-19, as people are suffering severe nervous system disorders that, months later, are showing signs of being permanent, while previously perfectly healthy other patients (around the world) are suffering blood clots in rare places, like the lungs and brain, just three or four days after vaccination.\nWhy should any young person or healthy adult risk life-threatening blood clots to get inoculated \u201cprotection\u201d when they\u2019re not even at risk from natural infection?\nGerman scientists have discovered the Covid-19 vaccines cause blood clots, and so have thousands of \u201cpatients\u201d who\u2019s cells now produce unlimited sticky \u201cprotein\u201d prions that travel throughout the blood vessels, causing \u201croad blocks,\u201d and this is why we\u2019re seeing the huge up-tick (pardon the pun) of heart inflammation cases right after vaccination.\nThese injected patients now have cells that have instructions to clog the blood using a genetically modified adenovirus taken from monkeys (J&J and AstraZeneca use this kind of adenovirus-vector jab). There you go all you vaccinated folks. You\u2019ve got monkey-blood-clot disease now, and your cells have a new code for it that can\u2019t be undone. Enjoy. Right after being injected with monkey-blood-clot-disease, new genetically-coded SARS-CoV-2 virus information sneaks into your cells like a bio-weapon terrorist, forcing your cells to produce clones of inflammation-causing \u201cspike proteins.\u201d\nYour entire body believes it\u2019s under attack, because it is. And now, that attack is relentless. Just wait until the next shot, for Delta or as a \u201cbooster,\u201d that instructs your cells to produce billions more of these protein prions. That\u2019s when all the vaccinated lose their minds, not just their central nervous systems and swollen, over-worked hearts.\nOnce you\u2019re injected with foreign particles, they come into contact with platelets from your blood, and that\u2019s when the real problems begin. The body tries to stop the bleeding, but it\u2019s fooled by clones. The platelets surround the adenovirus \u201cshells\u201d and the foreign \u201cproteins\u201d and all of a sudden the human body has an ABNORMAL number of platelets. The medical doctors in America are completely and utterly \u201cpuzzled\u201d and \u201cbaffled\u201d by this. So much for those eight years of medical school. What a waste.\nNext comes the blood clotting on top of blood clots. Yes, that happens. Your blood flowing over and around these clots starts clotting more, adding to the chaos. For some, death follows, like those four airline pilots that died just days after vaccination.\nFinally, the antibodies attack your own platelets, recruiting white blood cells, and the whole inflammatory response is so overblown it causes blood clots to form. Now the vaccine manufacturers are being required, one by one, to label the Covid toxic jabs with a blood clot warning. It\u2019s a little late, and just wait until the real carnage comes. All vaccine injuries and deaths will now be labeled as caused by the \u201c Delta Variant .\u201d Get ready for the big lie.\nVisit CovidVaccineReactions.com if you already got a toxic Covid jab or two and you are experiencing side effects, blood clots or other adverse events.

We\u2019re trying to go big and bring the patriotic truth the the nation, but we need help.\nReaders may or may not realize that over the past year, we\u2019ve been bringing more conservative news and opinion outlets under our wing. Don\u2019t take our expansion as a sign of riches; all of the \u201cacquisitions\u201d have been through sweat and promises of greater things to come for all involved. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to bring together several independent media sites under a unified vision of preventing America from succumbing to the progressive, \u201cwoke,\u201d Neo-Marxist ideologies that are spreading like wildfire across America.\nThe slow and steady reopening of America is revealing there was a lot more economic hardship brought about from the Covd-19 lockdowns than most realize. While we continue to hope advertising dollars on the sites go up, it\u2019s simply not enough to do things the right way. We are currently experiencing a gap between revenue and expenses that cannot be overcome by click-ads and MyPillow promos alone (promo code \u201cNOQ\u201d by the way).\nTo overcome our revenue gap and keep these sites running, our needs fluctuate between $3000-$7000 per month. In other words, we\u2019re in the red and hemorrhaging.\nThe best way you can help us grow and continue to bring the truth to the people is by donating. We appreciate everything, whether a dollar or $10,000. Anything brings us closer to a point of stability when we can hire writers, editors, and support staff to make the America First message louder. Our Giving Fuel page makes it easy to donate one-time or monthly. Alternatively, you can donate through PayPal as well.\nAs the world spirals towards radical progressivism, the need for truthful journalism has never been greater. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible.

Today, most sites are stuck on the Big Tech gravy train.\nI\u2019ll keep this short. The rise of Pandemic Panic Theater, massive voter fraud, and other \u201ctaboo\u201d topics have neutered a majority of conservative news sites. You\u2019ll notice they are very careful about what topics they tackle. Sure, they\u2019ll attack Critical Race Theory, Antifa, and the Biden-Harris regime, but you won\u2019t see them going after George Soros, Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, or the Deep State, among others.\nThe reason is simple. They are beholden to Big Tech, and Big Tech doesn\u2019t allow certain topics to be discussed or they\u2019ll cut you off. Far too many conservative news outlets rely on Google, Facebook, and Twitter for the bulk of their traffic. They depend on big checks from Google ads to keep the sites running. I don\u2019t necessarily hold it against them. We all do what we need to do to survive. I just wish more would do like we have, which is to cut out Big Tech altogether.\nWe don\u2019t get Google checks. We don\u2019t have Facebook or Twitter buttons on our stories. We don\u2019t have a YouTube Channel (banned), and Instagram profile (never made one), or a TikTok (no thanks, CCO). We\u2019re not perfect, but we\u2019re doing everything we can to not owe anything to anyone\u2026 other than our readers. We owe YOU the truth. We owe YOU the facts that others won\u2019t reveal about topics that others won\u2019t tackle. And we owe America, this great land that allows us to take hold of these opportunities.\nLike I said, I don\u2019t hold other conservative sites under too much scrutiny over their choices. It\u2019s easy for people to point fingers when we\u2019re not the ones paying their bills or supporting their families. I just wish there were more who would break away. Today, only a handful of other major conservative news outlets have broken away from the Big Tech teat. Of course, we need help.\nThe best way you can help us grow and continue to bring proper news and opinions to the people is by donating. We appreciate everything, whether a dollar or $10,000.

Media.\nFreedom First Network\nBased Underground\nUncanceled News\nAmerican Conservative Movement\nConservative Playbook\nOur Gold Guy\nWe are also building partnerships with great conservative sites like The Liberty Daily and The Epoch Times to advance the message as loudly as possible, and we\u2019re always looking for others with which to partner.\nAlso, we could use contributions of content. If you write or want to start writing and you share our patriotic, conservative, America First ideology, contact us. The contact form on this and all pages on the site goes directly to me.\nSome of our content is spread across multiple sites. Other pieces of content are unique. We write most of what we post but we also draw from those willing to allow us to share their quality articles, videos, and podcasts. We collect the best content from fellow conservative sites that give us permission to republish them. We\u2019re not ego-driven; I\u2019d much rather post a properly attributed story written by experts like Dr. Joseph Mercola or Natural News than rewrite it like so many outlets like to do. We\u2019re not here to take credit. We\u2019re here to spread the truth.\nWhile donations are the best way to help, you can also support us by buying through our sponsors:\nMyPillow: Use promo code \u201cNOQ\u201d to get up to 66% off AND you\u2019ll be helping a patriotic, America First company.\nFreedom Phone: Use promo code \u201cMAGA\u201d and get $50 off AND you\u2019ll be helping a patriotic, America First company.\nOurGoldGuy: Tell them we sent you in your request to buy gold and it will help us\u2026 AND (wait for it) you\u2019ll be helping a patriotic, America First company.\nWe know we could make a lot more money if we sold out like so many \u201cconservative\u201d publications out there. You won\u2019t find Google ads on our site for a reason. Yes, they\u2019re lucrative, but I don\u2019t like getting paid by minions of Satan (I don\u2019t like Google very much if you couldn\u2019t tell).\nTime is short. As the world spirals towards The Great Reset, the need for truthful journalism has never been greater. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible. Please help keep NOQ Report and the other sites in the network going. Our promise is this: We will never sell out America.

The protein is linked to blood clots, heart and brain damage, and potential risks to nursing babies and fertility\nby Celeste McGovern\nMay 31, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) \u2014 New research shows that the coronavirus spike protein from COVID-19 vaccination unexpectedly enters the bloodstream, which is a plausible explanation for thousands of reported side-effects from blood clots and heart disease to brain damage and reproductive issues, a Canadian cancer vaccine researcher said last week.\n\u201cWe made a big mistake. We didn\u2019t realize it until now,\u201d said Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at University of Guelph, Ontario, in an interview with Alex Pierson last Thursday, in which he warned listeners that his message was \u201cscary.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin,\u201d Bridle said on the show, which is not easily found in a Google search but went viral on the internet this weekend.\nBridle, a vaccine researcher who was awarded a $230,000 government grant last year for research on COVID vaccine development, said that he and a group of international scientists filed a request for information from the Japanese regulatory agency to get access to what\u2019s called the \u201c biodistribution study .\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever scientists have been privy to seeing where these messenger RNA [mRNA] vaccines go after vaccination,\u201d said Bridle. \u201cIs it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is: absolutely not. It\u2019s very disconcerting.\u201d\nNewsRescue\u2013\nVaccine researchers had assumed that novel mRNA COVID vaccines would behave like \u201ctraditional\u201d vaccines and the vaccine spike protein \u2014 responsible for infection and its most severe symptoms \u2014 would remain mostly in the vaccination site at the shoulder muscle. Instead, the Japanese data showed that the infamous spike protein of the coronavirus gets into the blood where it circulates for several days post-vaccination and then accumulated in organs and tissues including the spleen, bone marrow, the liver, adrenal glands, and in \u201cquite high concentrations\u201d in the ovaries.\n\u201cWe have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin. It can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation,\u201d Bridle said.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is what allows it to infect human cells. Vaccine manufacturers chose to target the unique protein, making cells in the vaccinated person manufacture the protein which would then, in theory, evoke an immune response to the protein, preventing it from infecting cells.\nA large number of studies has shown that the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, such as blood clotting and bleeding, are due to the effects of the spike protein of the virus itself.\n\u201cWhat has been discovered by the scientific community is the spike protein on its own is almost entirely responsible for the damage to the cardiovascular system, if it gets into circulation,\u201d Bridle told listeners.\nLab animals injected with purified spike protein into their bloodstream developed cardiovascular problems, and the spike protein was also demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier and cause damage to the brain.\nA grave mistake, according to Bridle, was the belief that the spike protein would not escape into the blood circulation. \u201cNow, we have clear-cut evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles manufacture this protein \u2014 that the vaccine itself, plus the protein \u2014 gets into blood circulation,\u201d he said.\nBridle cited the recent study which detected SARS-CoV-2 protein in the blood plasma of 11 of 13 young healthcare workers that had received Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, including three with detectable levels of spike protein. A \u2018subunit\u2019 protein called S1, part of the spike protein, was also detected.\u00a0Spike protein was detected an average of 15 days after the first injection. One patient had spike protein detectable on day 29, one day after an injection, which disappeared\u00a0two days later.\nEffects on heart and brain\nOnce in circulation, the spike protein can attach to specific ACE2 receptors that are on blood platelets and the cells that line blood vessels. \u201cWhen that happens it can do one of two things: it can either cause platelets to clump, and that can lead to clotting. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been seeing clotting disorders associated with these vaccines. It can also lead to bleeding.\u201d Bridle also said the spike protein in circulation would explain recently reported heart problems in youths who had received the shots.\n\u201cThe results of this leaked Pfizer study tracing the biodistribution of the vaccine mRNA are not surprising, but the implications are terrifying,\u201d Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told LifeSiteNews. \u201cIt is now clear\u201d that vaccine content is being delivered to the spleen and the glands, including the ovaries and the adrenal glands. \u201cThe released spike protein is being shed into the medium and then eventually reaches the bloodstream causing systemic damage. ACE2 receptors are common in the heart and brain, and this is how the spike protein causes cardiovascular and cognitive problems,\u201d\u00a0Seneff said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced it was studying reports of \u201cmild\u201d heart conditions following COVID-19 vaccination, and last week 18 teenagers in the state of Connecticut alone were hospitalized for heart problems that developed shortly after they took COVID-19 vaccines.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was halted in a number of countries and is no longer recommended for younger people because of its link to life-threatening and fatal blood clots, but mRNA COVID vaccines have been linked to hundreds of reports of blood clotting events as well.\nFDA warned of spike protein danger\nPediatric rheumatologist J. Patrick Whelan had warned a vaccine advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration of the potential for the spike protein in COVID vaccines to cause microvascular damage causing damage to the liver, heart, and brain in \u201cways that were not assessed in the safety trials.\u201d\nNewsRescue\u2013 #LongHaulers: Spike Protein Present on Covid And in Vaccines Dangerously Modifies Genes Even After Exposure \u2013 Texas Tech Uni Study\nWhile Whelan did not dispute the value of a coronavirus vaccine that worked to stop transmission of the disease (which no COVID vaccine in circulation has been demonstrated to do), he said, \u201cit would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on other organs.\u201d\nVaccine-associated spike protein in blood circulation could explain myriad reported adverse events from COVID vaccines, including the 4,000 deaths to date, and nearly 15,000 hospitalizations, reported to the U.S. government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of May 21, 2021. Because it is a passive reporting system, these reports are likely only the tip of an iceberg of adverse events since a Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare study found that less than one percent of side-effects that physicians should report in patients following vaccination are in fact reported to VAERS.\nNursing babies, children and youths, frail, most at risk\nBridle said the discovery of vaccine-induced spike protein in blood circulation would have implications for blood donation programs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want transfer of these pathogenic spike proteins to fragile patients who are being transfused with that blood,\u201d he said.\nThe vaccine scientist also said the findings suggested that nursing babies whose mothers had been vaccinated were at risk of getting COVID spike proteins from her breast milk.\nBridle said that \u201cany proteins in the blood will get concentrated in breast milk,\u201d and \u201cwe have found evidence of suckling infants experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract\u201d in VAERS.\nAlthough Bridle did not cite it, one VAERS report describes a five-month-old breastfed infant whose mother received a second dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine in March. The following day, the baby developed a rash and became \u201cinconsolable,\u201d refused to nurse, and developed a fever. The report says the baby was hospitalized with a diagnosis of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a rare blood disorder in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The baby died.\nThe new research also has \u201cserious implications for people for whom SARS Coronavirus 2 is not a high risk pathogen, and that includes all of our children.\u201d\nEffect on fertility and pregnancy?\nThe high concentration of spike protein found in testes and ovaries in the secret Pfizer data released by the Japanese agency raises questions, too. \u201cWill we be rendering young people infertile?\u201d Bridle asked.\nThere have been thousands of reports of menstrual disorders by women who had taken a COVID-19 shot, and hundreds of reports of miscarriage in vaccinated pregnant women, as well as of disorders of reproductive organs in men.\nVicious smear campaign\nIn response to a request, Bridle emailed a statement to LifeSiteNews on Monday morning, stating that since the radio interview he had received hundreds of positive emails. He added, too, that \u201ca vicious smear campaign has been initiated against me. This included the creation of a libelous website using my domain name.\u201d\n\u201cSuch are the times that an academic public servant can no longer answer people\u2019s legitimate questions with honesty and based on science without fear of being harassed and intimidated,\u201d Brindle wrote. \u201cHowever, it is not in my nature to allow scientific facts to be hidden from the public.\u201d\nHe attached a brief report outlining the key scientific evidence supporting what he said in the interview. It was written with his colleagues in the Canadian COVID Care Alliance (CCCA) \u2014 a group of independent Canadian doctors, scientists, and professionals whose declared aim is \u201cto provide top quality, evidence-based information about COVID-19, intent on reducing hospitalizations and saving more lives.\u201d\nA focus of the statement was the risk to children and teens who are the target of the latest vaccine marketing strategies, including in Canada.\nAs of May 28, 2021, there have been 259,308 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canadians 19 years and under. Of these, 0.048% were hospitalized, but only 0.004% died, according to the CCCA statement. \u201cSeasonal influenza is associated with more severe illness than COVID-19.\u201d\nGiven the small number of young research subjects in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine trials and the limited duration of clinical trials, the CCCA said questions about the spike protein and another vaccine protein must be answered before children and teens are vaccinated, including whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier, whether the vaccine spike protein interferes with semen production or ovulation, and whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the placenta and impacts a developing baby or is in breast milk.\nLifeSiteNews sent the Public Health Agency of Canada the statement of CCCA and asked for a response to Bridle\u2019s concerns.

Coronavirus vaccine falsehoods carry particular dangers, said Dr. Stephanie Sterling, chief of infectious diseases at NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn.\n[ A century after 1918 pandemic killed 675,000 Americans, the USA remains a country divided over a COVID-19 vaccine ]\n\u201cThey\u2019re dangerous because they are feeding into the fear and anxiety that this pandemic continues to cause,\u201d she told the Daily News, noting that the more people who contract COVID, the more chances it has to mutate. Getting vaccinated reduces the chance that \u201cwe\u2019ll get something worse than the delta variant. Something worse could very well ignore all the vaccines.\u201d\nMany people are hampered by the logistics of taking time off work, finding child care and getting to a vaccine site. Still others have legitimate questions but are not sure where to find the answers.\nPeople flock Sixth Avenue near Radio City Music Hall.

(Luiz C. Ribeiro/for New York Daily News)\nA sizable number, though, adhere to theories that simply have no basis in reality. Why are so many dying while denying that COVID even exists?\nThe myths themselves range from the ridiculous to the blatantly untrue, to misconstrued and distorted facts.\nMany of the biggest disseminators of vaccine misinformation online are entrepreneurs themselves \u2014 making money off people\u2019s vaccine hesitancy \u2014 as the Center for Countering Digital Hate documented in demonstrating that 65% of online misinformation comes from just 12 people.\nStill others are politicians using the pandemic to drive a further wedge between blue and red voters. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican,  was banned from Twitter for a week on Monday for spewing nonsense about vaccines and masks not working. Likewise, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, was taken down from YouTube for saying that masks don\u2019t work.\nDemonstrators gather outside Flathead High School to protest the Kalispell School District's face mask requirement on March 9, 2021, in Kalispell, Mont.

(Hunter D'Antuono /AP Photo)\nHere is a list of the biggest coronavirus and vaccine myths, and the impediments they bring to curbing this public health crisis that has killed more than 600,000 people in the U.S. alone since early 2020.\nMyth: Some COVID shots will turn people into chimpanzees.\nTruth: Um, no. Facebook just last week dismantled a viral disinformation network headquartered in Russia, removing hundreds of accounts that were convincing social media influencers to push phony claims such as this one about coronavirus vaccines.\nMyth: Coronavirus vaccines make you magnetic.\nTruth: This one tops the CDC\u2019s myth list. It\u2019s physically impossible, the agency points out, as the vaccines contain exactly zero magnetic compounds. For those who don\u2019t trust the nation\u2019s top health agency, the proponents of the theory could not themselves prove its veracity.\nMyth: The COVID vaccine implants a microchip that nefarious tech billionaires, specifically Microsoft founder Bill Gates, will use to track people.\nTruth: This one has been the butt of many a late-night comedic monologue, but the traction it still seems to have has stymied many \u2014 not least of all Gates. It has been debunked by everyone from the Mayo Clinic on down.\n\u201cYou have a cellphone and you\u2019re on social media,\u201d said Chrysalis Wright, an associate lecturer in the psychology department of the University of Central Florida who focuses on understanding the allure of misinformation and so-called fake news. \u201cThey\u2019re already tracking you, based on your own reasoning.\u201d\nTwo mass promoters of this one are Ty and Charlene Bollinger, \u201canti-vax entrepreneurs who run a network of accounts that market books and DVDs about vaccines, cancer and COVID-19,\u201d said the Center for Countering Online Digital Hate in a recent report. The Bollingers have promoted the conspiracy theory that Gates plans to inject everyone with microchips as part of a vaccination program, the report says.\nThe only chip idea that Gates has backed so far is that of a birth control device that would be implanted under a woman\u2019s skin \u2014 with her consent and knowledge \u2014 and automatically release hormones, as BBC News reported in 2014.\nMyth: The vaccine will alter your DNA.\nTruth: Vaccines based on mRNA teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response, but the mRNA (\u201dm\u201d stands for messenger) never enters the cell\u2019s nucleus, which is where the DNA resides, the CDC explains. In fact, after delivering the instructions, it breaks down almost immediately. Likewise, a \u201cviral vector\u201d vaccine takes a modified version of a different virus and uses it to deliver immune-response instructions to a cell \u2014 again, never coming into contact with one\u2019s DNA.\nMyth: Vaccines \u2014 any vaccines \u2014 cause autism.\nTruth: This has been a fear since long before COVID. It has been traced back to a since-debunked  study by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon whose license was later yanked. The study, published in the esteemed journal The Lancet, was taken down after severe procedural irregularities were noted. In addition, no one was ever able to duplicate his results.\nMyth: The COVID vaccine can impair fertility, make you infertile entirely or cause a woman to miscarry.\nTruth: This may stem from the apparent mixed messages when the vaccine was approved for emergency use. It wasn\u2019t recommended for pregnant women, University of Central Florida\u2019s Wright pointed out, but only because it hadn\u2019t yet been tested on them. Since then enough evidence has come in to convince medical experts that the vaccine is not only safe for pregnant or would-be pregnant women but also will help ward off severe illness. The CDC last week urged pregnant women to get the shot.\nMyth: Vaccines make you sick, can give you COVID, and have uncertain long-term side effects.\nTruth: Any immediate side effects from the vaccine are short-lived, and do not actually constitute illness from the vaccine. The symptoms are one\u2019s immune response, and mean that your body is making the antibodies that will fight off the real thing.\nMyth: The vaccines were rapidly developed and tested, and therefore their safety cannot be trusted.\nTruth: Years of research went into developing the mRNA technology underlying the Pfizer and Moderna shots, as The Associated Press reported extensively last December.\n\u201cThe emergency situation warranted an emergency response, but that does not mean that companies bypassed safety protocols or didn\u2019t perform adequate testing,\u201d the Mayo Clinic said on its website.\nThis may stem in part from the dubbing of last year\u2019s vaccine effort as \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d said Jay Van Bavel, an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, telling the Daily News, \u201cIt was a PR decision rather than a way to frame something you wanted to build confidence in.\u201d\nMyth: The fact that the vaccines only have emergency use authorization means they\u2019re experimental \u2014 and possibly unsafe.\nTruth: When the vaccines were approved for emergency use, exhaustive trials had already been conducted. In addition, both Van Bavel and Wright believe that full authorization, which is most likely on tap for the coming weeks, will give some vaccine-hesitant people the confidence to go forward with the jab.\nMyth: Someone who has already had coronavirus is immune.\nTruth: This is inaccurate on two counts. For one, the body\u2019s immune response is not as strong as the one the vaccines help create. Second, the vaccine has been shown to improve the symptoms of long-haul COVID patients who continue to suffer long after the infection itself has cleared.\nMyth: The virus is not dangerous; it\u2019s more like the flu. Moreover, the entire pandemic is a hoax.\nTruth: Many of the people who have said that are dead.\nThe COVID landscape is littered with grieving loved ones. Among the casualties are a Texas pastor who preached that coronavirus was a wake-up call for fornicating sinners; a conservative radio talk show host who spent June telling people not to get the vaccine and July dying from it, and a man who famously said he had \u201c 99 problems but a vax ain\u2019t one .\u201d\nA Texas politician also succumbed earlier this month, five days after posting an anti-vax meme. There was also the Ohio man who called the coronavirus lockdown a political ploy before taking ill, then dying. His widow later said they had been mistaken.\nH.

However, a respected cardiologist has warned that a study has illustrated the fact that the vaccines are in fact more dangerous than the virus they are supposed to protect people from.\nDr Peter McCullough is a top cardiologist who has had his works published more than 650 times in a variety of medical journals. Additionally, he has authored a cardiology textbook, is an editor of a cardiology journal and has served past experience on teams that review and examine new vaccines.\nDuring his years in the medical field, he has chaired data safety monitoring boards on a multitude of occasions and has stated that he was incredibly surprised by what occurred when the Covid-19 vaccines were first rolled out earlier last year. He said that in normal circumstances, what happened in January this year when officials learned of 182 deaths following 278 million jabs should have been enough to end the Covid vaccine program.\n\u201cOur [COVID] vaccine program would have been shut down in February for excess mortality in America,\u201d he said.\nThe cardiologist added that the vaccines are especially dangerous for the elderly and also other people from vulnerable groups, including those who are immunocompromised. He said that studies carried out in care homes in Europe revealed that at least 40 percent of deaths were linked to the jabs.\nMcCullough said: \u201cWe now know it\u2019s the seniors who die with the vaccine \u2026 50 percent of these deaths occur within 48 hours, 80 percent within a week.\u201d\nHe added that some vaccine recipients suffered from serious adverse reactions, which often were followed by death within a day or two. According to the doctor, many people are dying from cardiopulmonary collapse due to their body\u2019s overwhelming production of the spike protein, whilst others are dying from a thromboembolic or blood clot-related death within a few weeks of getting vaccinated. He said in these cases it\u2019s very clear that the jabs are responsible for the deaths.\nThe cardiologist warned that young people should steer clear of the vaccines as the jabs can cause serious heart problems such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart sac), which the mainstream media have repeatedly attempted to downplay.\nWhilst he understands that many people want to do what\u2019s best to stop the virus, he also understands there are those who do not wish to lose their life as a result.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what they\u2019re being asked for; they\u2019re being asked to \u2026 take a vaccine, and even though it\u2019s rare, you could lose your life and then people are saying, \u2018Well, how rare is rare?\u2019 and I can just tell you, the mortality rate by all expert analyses is unacceptably high,\u201d McCullough said.\n0\nLike\nOne blogger likes this.\nWith 4 comments\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized by permalink .\nAbout multidimensionalocean\nI have always known that I am a starseed, however I only consider myself as a lightworker for the past few years.

Vaccine doubts have slowed vaccination rates in the United States to a crawl, and have been a major factor as the delta variant sweeps through the country, leading to a rise in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\nFederal health officials have spoken of a pandemic of the unvaccinated, a worrisome development that could lead to many more deaths in the nation from the coronavirus.

They question why they need a shot to take care of what their own body is now designed to fight.\nOthers are hesitant because of the haste in which the COVID vaccines were approved. As an increasing number of potential side effects from the vaccine surface, many people are growing more entrenched in their feelings.\nAt what risk do you take a vaccine that might do more harm than good? Newly released documents support decisions by those who have been reluctant to get a COVID shot. Attorney Aaron Siri has published an initial report addressing information he demanded from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).\nSiri, the Managing Partner of Siri and Glimstad, has considerable experience with civil litigation cases. He has specialized in cases involving lawsuits brought by clients who have endured injuries from vaccinations. It required a civil lawsuit to pry this information from the FDA.\nIn a discussion with a U.S. Congressional panel led by Senator Ron Johnson, Siri said his law firm had received hundreds of legal requests about COVID vaccination problems. The documents reveal over 150,000 incidents involving side effects have been reported to Pfizer.\nSiri proclaimed, \u201cIf we actually sued all of the pharmaceutical companies for all of the complaints, it would actually be impossible for all of the attorneys around the country, around 100, to handle all of those matters.\u201d\nOf the thousands of documented side effects, the data indicate more than 25,000 of these have directly affected the central nervous system. These numbers become even more disturbing when we consider the period for claims fell within a short two-and-a-half month window.\nThis timeframe was during the initial months when Pfizer was distributing vaccines under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Pfizer even admits that the company was overwhelmed by, \u201cthe large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product.\u201d\nThe alarming ramifications of this data are further supported by shocking revelations within the Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) for COVID. There have been over 18,000 deaths resulting from the COVID vaccination and nearly 100,000 hospitalizations.\nNearly 100,000 more adverse vaccination incidents have required urgent care. There are thousands of reported cases of Anaphylaxis and Bell\u2019s palsy. No one expected that there wouldn\u2019t be problems with a hastily approved vaccination.\nThere aren\u2019t many people fighting against the mandates who dispute that the vaccines have at some level been useful. They take issue with the tyrannical mandating of the COVID vaccine. Joe Biden has overstepped his authority. He is not a dictator, although he thinks he is.\nThe choice to receive a COVID vaccination should be a personal one. It should involve a thorough consideration of individual health circumstances. \u201cThe jab\u201d may not be for everyone. The increasingly disturbing number of reported side effects must be part of the conversation. However, the mainstream media refuses to engage in open discussion.\nTheir reasoning is simple. Fake news doesn\u2019t want to upset their cozy relationship with the radical liberals. Joe Biden and his liberal cronies don\u2019t care about the American people. They feel they have been remanded control over public and personal decisions. They have not.\nJoe Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates are not concerned about the health of our nation. They\u2019re a strategy designed to impose complete government control of our lives. Many are resisting a shot because of this issue. However, it\u2019s now obvious that others have viable reasons to refuse the COVID vaccination for legitimate health concerns.\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author of the article and not necessarily shared or endorsed by SteadfastClash.com\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, vulgarity, profanity, all caps, or discourteous behavior.

It is built upon customs, practices, beliefs and ideas that are instilled in an individual by influential parties such as parents from childhood. These are all derived from imagination, knowledge and cultural values which are developed over time depending on customs and beliefs. These then influence an individual\u2019s customs. Also, culture is divided into two, individual culture which is the way one\n\u201d It\u2019s the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief.\u201d\n-Mohammed Ali[2]\nThis is basically to say that once something is repeated to an individual over time especially by someone in authority over them, they begin to believe and practice the said affirmation.\nBelief is something that is perceived to be true by an individual but is not common to all individuals. According to Michael Woolman, belief is a tendency to accept principles one has always accepted regardless of evidence to the contrary.[3]Belief can be deemed fallacious because it is relative especially by people who do not share the same beliefs.\nBelief is also confidence in the truth of what we believe in and it is justified by its working.[4]Belief is also associated with action, ergo, one must practice what they believe in.\nIf I try to doubt all my beliefs, one day I will find that there is at least one whose truth I cannot doubt\u201d\n\u2013 Rene Descartes[5]\nDescartes basically means that you cannot doubt your beliefs for there is a reason you believed in the first place. Over time, beliefs evolve from being just mere beliefs and become part of an individual\u2019s belief system which is what people believe in, inspired by their culture.\nTherefore, we cannot have beliefs which are independent of our culture.\nCulture does not exist in a social vacuum but it inhabits a complex world where the attitudes and beliefs of those around an individual have a massive impact on every aspect of their lives. This means that culture, be it societal or individual is influenced by other beliefs from other cultures which end up an individual, depending on what the already present belief is and how closely related it is to the other culture. Culture determines behaviour, customs, values, habits and tradition and it meditates on every aspect of our lives and experiences.[6]\nGet Help With Your Essay\nIf you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help!\nEssay Writing Service\nThere is a thin line between knowledge and belief in the sense that belief never leads to knowledge, but knowledge leads to belief. It is not possible for one to believe in something they do not know, however, it is possible to know something they do not believe in. For instance, in the late 1800\u2019s, the Kikuyu community of Kenya believed in naming people according to what they were good at, akin to the characteristics they exhibited. This is paradigm of a culture believing in something they know. On the other hand, one may possess full knowledge of what a religion other than their own stands for but may not believe in the tenets (the example of Islam)\u2026\u2026.. According to Bastian Sue, Bammi Vivek , Howard Craig, Kitching Julian, Oberg Dennis, Wilkinson David and Salomon Manjula. knowledge is, a sub-category of belief and it is a claim that one accepts regardless of the degree of confidence, emotional intensity and sense of significance one may have. p\nThis is to say that for one to know they must believe. This only applies to the statement \u201cKnowledge leads to belief\u201d as it may differ in regard to other statements or claims.\nThis is justified because knowledge is information that is factual and based on the truth.\nKnowledge is the acquaintance of facts, truths and principles as a form of study or investigation also as to have a clear perception as of fact or truth.[7]Also, according to Plato, knowledge is justified as true belief.\nThe greater our knowledge increases, the more our ignorance unfolds.\n\u2013 John F Kennedy 3\nThis quote by J F Kennedy implies that as we learn more, our lack of knowledge expresses how ignorant we are. To some extent, knowledge and belief are somewhat alike in the sense that most of the time they are both based on perception and on what one is told rather that what one knows for a fact. After research, I realised that Knowledge does not have a clear definition of what it is but rather related words like teaching are used to express it. According to geek philosopher Aristotle \u201cThe one exclusive sign of knowledge is the power of teaching\u201d.\nFind Out How UKEssays.com Can Help You!\nOur academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have.

Knowledge by authority is when an individual knows something from someone older, knowledgeable and in authority over them so much so to influence them. For instance, parents and teachers. Authoritative knowledge is usually led by wisdom because such knowledge is thought to have been tested over time. However, it is important not to pass over the fact that authorities may also be wrong.\nPerception is the act\u00a0or\u00a0faculty\u00a0of\u00a0apprehending\u00a0by\u00a0means\u00a0ofthe\u00a0senses\u00a0or\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mind; \u00a0cognition, understanding or the immediate\u00a0or\u00a0intuitive\u00a0recognition\u00a0or appreciation,\u00a0as\u00a0of\u00a0moral,\u00a0psychological,\u00a0or aesthetic\u00a0qualities:\u00a0insight;\u00a0intuition; discernment.[8]Knowledge by perception follows the empiricism view that all knowledge is derived from what is observed. This is one Way of Knowing under which belief is and this is because with perception, one makes an observation and sometimes, it may influence what the individual believes in.\nBelief is the confidence in the truth or existence of something not immediately susceptible to rigorous proof.[9]This implies that more often than not, what is believed cannot be proved. It may also not be the truth it could however be deep trust about something and they tend to buried deep within the subconscious with the result that they trigger automatic reactions and behaviours. We seldom question beliefs because we hold them to be truths which have been repeated over time such that they automatically become truths.[10]This then means that people internalise beliefs from the people around us when we are most vulnerable and this is when we are children. This way of thinking can be fallacious in that it is an error in reasoning. In this case, the question of whether or not we can have beliefs or knowledge that are independent of culture.\n\u201cIt is the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief\u201d\n-Muhammad Ali[11]\nAccording to Famous boxer Muhammad Ali, when something is repeated and stressed to an individual then it becomes part of their belief s. The stressing and repetition of the belief not done by the believer but by another party who influences the believer to believe that what has been said is truth, thus making the belief part the believer\u2019s conscience. The fact that sometimes, beliefs cannot be proved doesn\u2019t make them right, neither does it make them wrong because as much as there is no proof n its truth, there is no proof that it is false. For instance the statement \u201cI believe today is Wednesday\u201d is only true because it has been repeated to us over and over again to the extent that it is now true although it is not a statement that has be proved right or wrong theoretically and scientifically.\nTherefore, it is impossible to have beliefs which are independent of our culture because culture and belief work hand in hand to make an individual\u2019s values, traditions, values and habits therefore they cannot be separated and one cannot have beliefs which are independent of our culture. It is also important to note that the culture in question here is an individual\u2019s culture and not another\u2019s culture, because one cannot believe in a culture that they do not practice because belief is backed by action.\nIn conclusion, it is possible to have knowledge which is independent of our culture but it is not possible to have beliefs which are independent of our culture.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp\nCite This Work\nTo export a reference to this article please select a referencing stye below:\nAPA\nMLA\nMLA-7\nHarvard\nVancouver\nWikipedia\nOSCOLA\nUKEssays.

Counterclaim: All knowledge is based on our culture, without culture there is no knowledge. Culture is the characteristics of a particular group of people, defined by everything from language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts. Since we come into the world, we become part of a culture. Our parents and guardians slowly push us into it, they teach us about values, traditions, religion and everything else that can be called culture.\nWe first attain culture by our guardians as we are too young to understand anything when we are born and our development as human beings can be determined by culture. However, it is not known whether our opinions are driven by our culture or we are responsible for them. Culture can affect how we see migration. Depending on the culture in which we are brought up, we can have different views on migration.\nFor example, taking the Australian Aborigines which have a nomadic culture, a nomadic culture is when a tribe migrates from place to place, without settling permanently. This is one of the ways in which culture has an effect on our knowledge, through emotion comes culture as you need to care about the culture to practice it, even more when someone has had that lifestyle since birth. On the other hand, culture does not fully depend on migration, as most of the time migration happens because of social factors.\nTaking El Salvador as an example, El Salvador, an LEDC that has a main export of coffee, has a net migration of -8. 78, this means that 8. 78 people per thousands per year are leaving the country with different destinations. El Salvador\u2019s emigration had been decreasing in the last decade until 2009 where the minimum emigration peaked, after this year, when everything seemed to be in the increase, a significant gap took place, taking a -3. 27 from 2009 to a -9. 13, the lowest value recorded for emigration, and then slowly recovering.\nEl Salvador has many traditions and habits but it does not have a nomadic culture, which makes the counterclaim conditional, this meaning both hypothesis are true and can be supported by significant empirical evidence. The issue with migration is it does not depend on culture but mostly on personal background, social status, family background and other social factors. So it is not really possible to tell whether culture has a role in migration or if it is just personal and nothing can be deducted from it.\nWe can have views on migration independent of our culture, but we can also have a view centered by our culture, like in Australia. Gay marriage is one of the most controversial topics today, whether two individuals from the same gender can get married has raised conflict and awareness globally and has raised issues of knowledge as it has progressed. Some people may say it is acceptable for two people from the same gender get married but almost the same number of people would say it is unacceptable and morally wrong.\nThis topic raises an issue of knowledge, and that is religion. For many people, marriage is the sacred bond between a male and a female, like the bible states. This issue of knowledge accounts for approximately 43% of people who think it is wrong. The rest of the people say it is wrong as they believe that raising a child with two dads or two moms is incorrect as it can make the child grow insecure and confuse as they claim. People who are in favour of the motion say gender is not an excuse to determine people\u2019s happiness and that love is what counts at the end of the day.\nDepending on the culture in which we are raised then we can have an opinion on gay marriage, for example, El Salvador is a country full of traditions and alive with culture, since we are born, most of us are introduced into religion, newborns get baptized without any awareness, parents take the decision and when children are slightly older, they are forced to go to church on Sundays with family. The debate on legalizing gay marriage is still ongoing in El Salvador and this is one of the cases where culture can influence your opinion on a topic religion, a part of culture is a determinating factor on the decision.\nThe opposite to this would support the claim, by saying that knowledge can be independent of culture and this can be proven by all the people who support gay marriage. Ideology is the way in which people think about several factors, and ideology is key to understanding the claim, as it makes us think on how people raised in the same culture and country and social background can have such different views about the world. Like the students in a school, the ABC has nearly 4,000 students from lower primary to secondary.\nPeople in 11th and 12th grade are making decisions on where to go study, if they stay in El Salvador or they leave. Everyone shares a common thing, the wish to succeed, and we students take different paths to succeed. We share the same thing but one thing no one is similar to anyone, and that is ideology. How can it be that people raised in the same country, culture, following the same traditions and coming from the same or similar social background and having gone through the school their entire lives can have such different opinions about different things is still a mystery.\nHowever it is a crucial point for the claim, where our knowledge, our emotions, our reasoning, our logic and everything else does not depend on culture. Everyone has a point of view, if they didn\u2019t there wouldn\u2019t be any diversity and the point of view would cease to exist, everyone has a different opinion, some are alike but there can never be two individuals with the exact same ideology. It is part of reasoning, for example, people at the age of 17-18 are said to reason without logic, by rational reasoning.\nFor example when you do badly in a test and as response you think, \u201cWell, I studied all night and it didn\u2019t work so the teacher gave us the wrong topic\u201d instead of being objective and admitting no one can study the night before the test and get a good grade. Another example happens in sports when a team loses and the natural response is to blame everyone but yourself, by saying the referee was unfair or the goalkeeper wasn\u2019t playing good enough. Everyone has their own way of reasoning, even when they are raised in the same context and culture, so ideology is independent of culture, as stated by the claim.\nKnowledge is something every human being possesses, it does not matter where they come from, or how old, knowledge starts since we can reason. Culture is a great part of a person\u2019s identity and personality, in their way of thinking and how they view others. We cannot say all knowledge comes from our culture, nor can we say that culture has no influence on the opinion of people. And as shown with the examples, we can have knowledge that can both, base itself on culture and be determined by social factors.\nCulture in Kazakhstan\nDeveloping and assessing intercultural competence\nThis essay was written by a fellow student.

Culture can be defined as the characteristics in a person or a society, defined by excellent arts, manners, religion, language, etc. Culture heavily affects how an individual acts and thinks towards others and could be argued that it can define a person. Being independent from something can be defined as not having a clear relationship and not relying on something else, in this case it would be beliefs and knowledge being independent from culture. One must also understand the definitions for knowledge and beliefs, which will be explained later on. This essay will argue that in a way, knowledge acts as being more independent of our culture than our beliefs, as beliefs are heavily affected by the culture we grow up in and different cultures we\u2019re introduced to.\nA belief can be defined as being a faith, theory or acceptance that doesn\u2019t necessarily need evidence or proof for an individual to believe it\u2019s true. It can also be considered a system of thought that contains information that a person has accumulated and stored in his/her brain.

So what is knowledge? Knowledge is \u201cwhat one knows, the body of facts accumulated over a period of time\u201d (Webster\u2019s dictionary,2004).\nWhat is culture? \u201cCulture is appreciation and understanding of the arts, skills of a given people in a given period\u201d. Another definition is culture is the \u201ccustomary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a religious, social or racial group\u201d\nAll this definitions led to the question as to how knowledge, belifs and culture are acquired by a person. So how do we acquire knowledge? Knowledge is usually acquired through sensory perception an example being a curios little boy will acquire the knowledge that cactus plants are not meant to be held by the naked hand after he/she touches the plant and feels the pain. Knowledge can also be acquired through logical operations and emotional reactions. This kind of knowledge is caused by biological responses to stimuli, and could be considered not to be dependent of culture an example being facial expressions which are not taught or learned but they are biologically determined.\nSo how is culture acquired? Culture is basically instilled in us when we are born. An example being me as I was born in Kenya and grew up in an Islamic background. So my culture is Islamic and Swahili and we do have our fair share of beliefs.\nBuddhists consider that knowledge is acquired through direct experience. So how is this experience achieved? Well the Buddhists achieve this experience by meditation opposite to the western traditions, which gives emphasis on a clear expression of thoughts and argument. Buddhists believe that words tend to expose the truth on the other hand, the recognition of Buddhists beliefs and customs for discovering the truth shows dependence of the culture of that knowledge.\nGet Help With Your Essay\nIf you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help!\nEssay Writing Service\nSo are beliefs independent of culture? I will have to say yes on this. ? I will have to say yes on this. People may so no because some beliefs such as you must always wear clothes and shoes when leaving the house well I won\u2019t classify that as a belief but a ritual. Most beliefs are usually based on religion and culture. In the case of religion I as a Muslim have many beliefs that are dependent on my religion some of them being I must pray five times a day, the consequence of missing prayer is that we will burn in hell for a very long time. I believe in this theorem although there is no proof of sort but it\u2019s a belief based on our religion.\nBeliefs that are based on my culture which is the Swahili culture are numerous. Some make sense and some do not make sense but I have no other choice than to live by these beliefs and follow them no matter what. A belief that I have always been told by my mother and has never ever made sense to me is that we should not clip our nails at night. I don\u2019t see how it applies in a real life situation. I usually cut my nails at night and so far so good nothing has happened to me. Another belief that is based on our culture is that we are told not to borrow salt at night. I don\u2019t know why it had to be salt but still like I said they do not make any sense to me at all, and we are expected to follow this beliefs although I think they don\u2019t make sense. But we do have to follow them, But some beliefs that my culture expects me to follow are somewhat sensible and I do follow them, examples of the sensible beliefs and rituals are like we should respect our parents and follow there each and every command, that is a belief that makes sense and I do believe that the people that do not live by this rule are actually bad people. I know there is no evidence that if you do not respect your parents you are going to get punished by the Almighty God but it\u2019s a belief and in order to believe you don\u2019t need evidence or anything. All you need is your mind on whether to decide that you are going to believe in that belief or not.\nAnother belief that I tend to differ with and is totally and purely based on culture is gender equality. I did some asking around and I found out in most of Kenyan tribes as well the Swahili culture tend to believe that men are more superior to women. They claim that man was created first so making them more superior and all that the women in our cultures should do is stay at home and prepare meals and clean the house while men are the bread winners. This is not such a wise belief, men and women are both humans so why should one kind be more superior than the other?, they were all created by the same creator!. With all this said I thing that all of my beliefs are independent of my culture. Some other people like the westerners who have no culture or don\u2019t know anything about their culture also have beliefs like the men should take care of their children and women, that is a belief that is common to all cultures in the world and also to those who don\u2019t have cultures so on an American\u2019s point of view not all of their beliefs are based on the culture because the clearly have or don\u2019t know their culture.\nCommunity education (sociology), is dependent on the cultural expression of human knowledge that has been repeated again and again. \u201cAlfred webwruses\u201d was studying in the sociology of culture and he came up with the term \u201ckultursoziologe\u201d which mean cultural sociology which is a specific branch on sociology which is entirely dependent on culture.\nCulture is a very significant concept found in many branches of sociology, social stratification in the fields of scientific and social network analysis.\nIs knowledge based on culture? Well I will have to answer no on this query, knowledge is not entirely independent of culture. People may argue that knowledge such as traditional medicines, herbs are based on culture and some of those herbs that the traditional men used to use are used now by the scientists to make the medicine we consume today and they end up saving lives.\nFind Out How UKEssays.com Can Help You!\nOur academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have.

Some of the knowledge in history is independent on culture a good example being the creation theory which one of the three possible theories of the origin of the world is based on culture and religion. In Swahili culture , the Elders have told us to believe in the creation theory and that it is God who created the world in six days and life starts on the seventh day. Knowledge such as this is independent of culture and. I gained this knowledge just by interacting with the elders of the family and they told me all sorts of stories\nKnowledge such as mathematics in example has no connection whatsoever with culture and such knowledge is not dependent of culture even one bit. Mathematics is purely about numbers and in my case the Swahili culture the elders who are supposed to be the \u201cwisest of humans\u201d don\u2019t even know simple math like one plus one.\nSo are our beliefs and knowledge independent of culture? To some extent YES! Why am I saying yes? It\u2019s simply because most beliefs are based on culture and example being me, most of my beliefs are based on my culture although I do have beliefs outside my culture like if I drink plenty water at one go It may react with my body forcing me to throw up so it\u2019s my belief that we should not drink much water and slowly as well. Knowledge also is somewhat dependent on culture and an example being the community sociology which is a whole branch in sociology that focuses on just culture. I then come up with the answer that both beliefs and knowledge are dependent of culture\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp\nCite This Work\nTo export a reference to this article please select a referencing stye below:\nAPA\nMLA\nMLA-7\nHarvard\nVancouver\nWikipedia\nOSCOLA\nUKEssays.

For example, mathematics and the natural sciences are universal in their application. Others include logic and language, where certain patterns and constraints hold true regardless of the group or society that one may be a part of. There does not need to be an agreement on what these universally-applicable domains are to say that there can be such things as knowledge that is independent of culture. With respect to the sciences and mathematics, while there is debate on what we should consider \"universal\" in these fields (e.g. if all humans use the same methods, then they are universal; however, would this also include different cultures who apply very different methods or do not apply methods at all?), there is no doubt that even without such agreement, there are aspects of these fields that hold true regardless of culture. For example, basic math applies to all cultures and language applies to everyone regardless of culture. This does not mean that a mathematical system will be the same across cultures or languages, but it does mean that they have a common basis in logic and reality itself.\nIn addition to being universal, mathematicians have been able to use the same techniques across cultures as well as across time. In other words, some mathematical techniques have been consistent over centuries of time and cultures. As a matter of fact, Greek mathematician Archimedes was able to discover some simple laws of buoyancy using different volume rules for an object submerged in different liquids. These discoveries were not limited to a specific culture, nor a specific time period.\nThere are similar universal aspects in the natural sciences. The laws of nature are always the same, regardless of culture. If one says that the laws of nature were not discovered until the 17th century, one is mistaken because these laws exist in much older texts, such as the Zend Avesta (the oldest existing text in that language; it predates both Greek and Sanskrit literature). These texts contain facts that seem to be consistent with modern science (e.g., zero can be rounded to an infinite number of digits; zero is not the only number). They also seem to be consistent with modern discoveries (e.g., conservation of angular momentum). This means that these facts were known before scientists began their investigations into nature. There is no need to ground our knowledge of these laws in certain cultures or previous experiments. The question of \"where did humans come from?,\" for example, has been asked since the dawn of history. These are still being asked today so why would it be any different today?\nWhile there are similarities between mathematics and the natural sciences, there are also differences between them. For example, while one can have mathematical knowledge without knowing how to use mathematics, one cannot create a mathematical system without knowing how to apply mathematics. The same goes for the natural sciences which rely on mathematical knowledge that governs their conclusions (i.e., algebra).\nThe point here is not to debate whether there can be knowledge that is independent of culture. It may be true for some specific cases, but almost certainly not in the sense that many people think. What I am saying is that there is no evidence that would prove that human knowledge cannot be universal. This does not mean that all humans everywhere are equal, but at least it shows where the limits of our understanding are.\nStep-by-step explanation\nYes, there can be knowledge that is independent of culture, and this assertion is true for mathematics and the natural sciences. Mathematics and the natural sciences do not require cultural variables to exist or to be learned. We might even say that these disciplines hold truth that transcends any particular culture. They are, in other words, universal subjects.\nIn the natural sciences, mathematics is universal and affects everything in our lives, creating a connection between humanity and the universe. To form this connection, ancient humans had to make the breakthroughs in geometry, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and other fields\u2014knowledge that is still valid today. An example can be found in the research of Albert Einstein who proposed his theory of relativity\u2014a theory that has changed the way we perceive the universe. This theory would later play an important role in nuclear physics, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics. These are all areas that are independent of culture because they are not affected by social status or dominance. Some say that Einstein's theories are controversial, but it is their validity and not whether they draw opposition from certain individuals that makes them universal and independent of culture.\nIt can also be seen at a societal level: mathematical formulas for traffic flow, area and volume estimation, thermodynamics, and economics play a tremendous role in everyday life. In fact, mathematics is one of the most important subjects in school because it affects not only our physical surroundings but also our daily interactions with others. However, there are exceptions to this rule. A case in point is the US government's budgeting problems that have threatened to shut down the entire government because two fractions of a political party could not agree on a mathematical formula that represents an acceptable compromise. Therefore, it is up to each user which set of laws he or she will follow\u2014the rules dictated by those who have been elected as leaders or those dictated by numbers and formulas.\nOn a similar note, mathematics is the only field of knowledge that is capable of proving that another field of knowledge is incorrect. The proof has not been made in this manner, but this potential makes it superior to all other areas of study. The rules and formulas for mathematics are so precise and distinct that any deviation from them will result in an error or an invalid result. For example, if you take three apples from a pile and add them to four apples you will get seven apples. If you take three apples from a pile and add them to five apples you get the same number: seven. This is because you are adding apples, not adding apples to the number three or five. And if you try to mix these two things up\u2014adding apples to five\u2014you will get an incorrect result. Even if you make the same mistake in any other field of knowledge, it is impossible to be sure that the mistake is that exact one.\nSimilarly, you can use mathematics to describe things in nature that cannot be seen through the naked eye. On the basis of mathematics alone, you can determine where something is in relation to another thing without ever seeing either one. For example, using mathematical formulas it is possible to calculate precisely where planets are in our solar system without ever seeing them directly or measuring their distance from Earth. In fact, it is possible for a scientist to discover a new planet orbiting an unknown star without ever seeing the star directly. In this case, well-designed mathematics can open up all sorts of possibilities for exploration and discovery.\nIn modern times, the study of mathematics has been combined with computer science and other scientific fields such as physics and biology in order to create scientific predictions that describe our universe and describe things that we cannot see with our naked eyes. This combination of fields has become so sophisticated that it is now possible to detect previously unknown planets across thousands\u2014and even millions\u2014of light years from their parent stars. Modern astronomy has come so far because mathematics and computers combined with visual observation have opened up a universe that was never known before. This is due to the fact that mathematics can calculate hidden planet movement within families of stars without error.\nThis cannot be said for other fields of study, such as culture and political ideology. For example, although mathematics can calculate the truth of a statement in this way\u2014without error\u2014it will never be known if it is the case that the statement describes reality or if it describes only what we or our peers wish to see. Therefore, use caution in using this method to prove that culture (and politics) are irrelevant because you cannot say with any certainty whether it is true or not. It is merely an approximation based on mathematical formulas and computer algorithms in which you bring in your observations to one side in order to make sense of them.\nAnother thing to remember is that numbers and mathematical formulas do not tell you that they are true; they only show you how to calculate the approximate truth of a statement. For example, if you want to know what time it is, you can look at a clock. This makes it easy to estimate the time and allows you to make decisions regarding whether or not they will let you make your flight on time, or whether or not it is too late to return your library books on time. However, if the clock were broken and insisted that it was one o'clock in the afternoon when in fact it was three o'clock\u2014 this would create problems.\nHowever, if you instead believe that the clock is wrong and that you can reliably tell how much time it takes to distinguish between noon and three\u2014you will make better use of it. This is because there are many things that go into making a watch accurate, but its accuracy is independent of the accuracy of any other instrument. It simply measures time in a way that works for it. The same thing applies with mathematics. Mathematics can be applied to different problems in different ways, but the end result will only be approximate at best.\nWhile this has been true since mathematics began thousands of years ago, what has changed recently is the fact that it has become possible to calculate exact truths with mathematical formulas. This has given rise to computers that can calculate exact mathematical truths. Interestingly enough, these exact mathematical calculations are used by many people in different ways. For example, you can use them to create accurate computer models of the universe. This type of calculation is called simulation because the output is an approximate truth based on mathematical formulas and algorithms. Simulation is useful because it allows you to test theories and predictions without having access to the real thing.\nThere is no such thing as the natural sciences as a culture. Natural sciences are dependent upon the scientific method, not on any particular culture. That method is learned and utilized by those in almost every culture, and it transcends those cultures. The effects of gravity exist everywhere -- it matters not at all whether they are called gravity according to the American system or gravit\u00e9 according to the French system: these effects can be measured and they exist independently of any cultural context.\nThe same is true for mathematics: A + B = C, or one plus one equals two; these facts do not depend on any particular culture's understanding of what numbers mean (or even if numbers \"mean\" anything -- they might just be meaningless symbols). This is not to say that mathematics is culturally neutral, only that it does not depend on any particular culture. The natural sciences and mathematics do depend on human culture in many ways, particularly when it comes to the acquisition of knowledge by humans.\nScience and math classes are taught in schools, where they are learned by students who are part of the culture (and this includes both students and teachers). But when it comes to the actual understanding of these subjects, they transcend culture; truths about gravity or how to solve quadratic equations exist independently of any particular culture's mathematical or scientific methods.\nWe might make the claim that certain truths about mathematics and science need prior knowledge (cultural knowledge) in order for them to be understood. We might place our fingers on the sides of our head and say, \"What is the third number between one and two?\" Without some cultural understanding, it would be impossible to answer this question. We might also claim that mathematics must be learned before it can be understood -- but experience has proven that not to be true. A three-year-old child can understand basic mathematics (even though he or she doesn't \"get it\" until 10 or 15 years later) -- what is called the Euclidean axioms (the basics of geometry), for example. No cultural knowledge is necessary for this.\nThere are truths that cross cultural boundaries. The scientific method, the making of observations -- these do not depend on any particular culture. They don't depend on any particular language, either. And the scientific method is not \"a Western invention.\" We can observe that something exists or doesn't exist, that something causes an effect or does not cause an effect, even if we have no idea what it is, or how it works -- and even if we never do figure out why it works. \"Science\" is not a brand name -- it's a process by which knowledge is acquired about the physical world around us. It doesn't belong to one culture or another.\nReferences:\nBrown, J. R. (2011). The laboratory of the mind: Thought experiments in the natural sciences. Routledge.\nPickering, A. (2010). 1.

(Maya Angelou) Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nThoughts to consider with essay 2 include:\ntruth is a property of representations, e.g. factual sentences\nfacts are truth-makers - what make true sentences true\ndo all facts exist independently of all minds?\nThe kinds of things that can be true or false are representations: they represent things as being a certain way:\n\t\t\t\t\tsome represent truly, some falsely (misrepresent things). Photographs are representations:\n\t\t\t\t\tan acceptable passport photo represents the face of the passport owner with a true likeness, for example. \n\t\t\t\t\tFactual sentences are an important kind of representation.\nTrue factual sentences describe or represent the actual facts: e.g. the factual English sentence \"gold is a metal\" \n\t\t\t\t\tis true because gold is, in actual fact, a metal. False factual sentences misrepresent the facts: e.g. \"gold is plastic\" \n\t\t\t\t\tis false because, in actual fact, gold is not plastic, but is metal.\nTrue factual sentences are therefore an important way of recording and communicating factual knowledge: knowledge of the facts.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, I can use the English sentence \"The city of London is on the river Thames\" to communicate the \n\t\t\t\t\tfactual knowledge (knowledge of the fact) that the city of London is on the river Thames.\nFacts are therefore truth makers: they are what exist in reality to make factual sentences true. \n\t\t\t\t\tReality therefore comprises, or contains all the facts. Someone who claims to live by \"alternative facts\"\n\t\t\t\t\tis therefore claiming to live, literally, in an alternative reality.\nMany TOK students make the mistake of talking about \"true facts\". This commits a category mistake. \n\t\t\t\t\tFacts aren't the kind of thing that can be true or false, precisely because they aren't representations,\n\t\t\t\t\tthey just exist there in reality.

Can we ever have objective, universal, absolute knowledge?\n- People of different cultures have very different knowledge what we think are biological aspects of life, like gender roles\n- In some developing countries, such as Afghanistan, there is great inequality between men and women: men are seen to have a higher authority and ranking than women. Women have little power in their day-to-day lives, are to act obediently, as well as be taken care of by men. While the men work and earn money during the day, these women stay at home with the children.\n- In the Tchambuli tribe in Papua New Guinea, women have more \u2018masculine\u2019 traits, and rule their communities with their dominant personalities, while men are more \u2018feminine\u2019, as they are more emotionally dependent, and enjoy fashioning their physical appearance.\nBODY LANGUAGE\nBody language is another type of knowledge that differentiates across cultures. Etiquette in particular is something that varies.\nIn Canada, for example, many people greet each other with a handshake. This handshake is firm but not too strong, and  typically three shakes. There is even knowledge within this greeting. Variations on a handshake may imply things about someone's character. For example, we might think someone with a strong handshake very self-confident and ambitious. Eye contact is encouraged, and considered polite.\nIn Asia, typically a handshake should be very gentle, and one should avoid direct eye contact, which can be considered rude in most Asian cultures. As well, hand holding among the same sex is normal, and signifies friendship and respect in some Asian countries, something typically romantic in Canada.\nAlthough there are many areas in the world that cannot obtain objective knowledge, there are some areas that could be argued do have objective knowledge, and are not influenced by culture.\n- We have created mathematical and scientific laws and principles that do overcome subjective thinking.\n- Everyone can understand them, no matter what your experiences or cultures are.\nFor example, think one of the most basic mathematical statements: 1 + 1 = 2.\nThis is an objective statement because there is only one viewpoint on it. One could not justify saying that 1+1 = 3, because there are no perspectives in this statement; any other response would simply be incorrect.\nREAL LIFE SITUATION\nThere have been many times in history when we people have independently discovered things.\nThe study of calculus, for example, was discovered by multiple different people\u2019s independent formations in the 17th century, including Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm and others.\nBetween 1950 and 1963, the Polio vaccine was discovered independently by three different people: Hilary Koprowski, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin.\nWhat are the implications of these topics?\nGoing back to the Arab-Israeli conflict, if there is no objective truth, does this mean there is no absolute right or wrong in the situation?\nThey have the argument \"I was there first\", as the Israelites supposedly colonized and lived in the Palestinian land  thousands of years ago\nJust because it was theirs first, does that mean it is still theirs?\nEven though Palestine is a small area of land compared to the entire Arab land, it encompasses almost 4 million people\nCONCLUSION\nIt is possible to have objective knowledge in certain areas of study, such as basic mathematical theories\nHowever, it is not possible to have a universal absolute truth on issues that involve subjective knowledge and cultural references\nThis is because two nations such as Palestine and Israel will never be able to have a unified view. Their experiences have shaped the knowledge the have, and they cannot change that. They both have reasoning behind their knowledge, and their beliefs are justified, so we can never come up with a completely correct solution.\nFUTURE KNOWLEDGE ISSUES\n- In the early 19th century, Britain had mandate of the area that consisted of Palestine and Jordan, but divided the area in two, giving what was west of Transjordan Palestinian mandate.\n- A small Jewish group known as Zionists sought to take over the Palestinian land in order to create a homeland for the Jewish people\n- They started to colonize Palestine, which caused violent conflict.\n- WWII, the rise to power of Hitler, and the persecution of European Jews, along with the Zionist\u2019s increasing influence for more Jewish immigration to Palestine  led to an increase in conflict.\n- In 1947, the UN intervened and chose to externally divide up the land. They recommended making 55% of Palestine Jewish state, though they were only 30% of the population, and presently owned less than 7% of the land. The Arabs found this unfair, and rejected this plan.\nWhat is Culture?\n- Israel's population is approx. 80% Jewish, and it has never declared its borders nor written a constitution\n- Palestine is mainly populated of Muslims and Christians. It's status is in dispute: about 2/3 of the countries in the UN recognize it as a nation-state. Other countries do not regard it as this, calling it the \"Palestinian Occupied Territories\".\n- In a recent vote to upgrade the Palestinian Authority to nonvoting observer state status, 138 nations voted for, and just 9 voted against, two of which were the U.S. and Canada.\nCulture is the characteristics of a particular group of people. Some of the main ideas culture consists of include:\nCulture is important in understanding concepts, as people have different knowledge of issues in different cultures.\n- In the Bible, God originally gives what is currently Palestine/Israel to Abraham's descentants\n- This promise of land to descendants is interpreted to the people of Israel\n- It was prophesied that the Jewish people would eventually return to their homeland\n- Birthplace of Judaism and Christianity; among the earliest civilizations in the world\n- In ancient times, supposedly Palestine used to be a Jewish homeland. However, the Romans removed the Jews from the area, and changed the name from Israel to Palestine.\n- The Jewish people had looked for a new homeland, but had never stayed anywhere permanently, and were not safe anywhere.\nAnother example of objective knowledge is the relation of the circle to pi. The ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter is always the mathematical constant \u201cpi\u201d, equal to 3.14159 etc\u2026\nImmanuel Kant said that many kinds of knowledge are not based on experience or culture, but pure reason (Kahut, \u201cImmanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason\").\nIt has many forms an contexts, and can be described in terms of as a set of values and activities, individual and characteristic to human societies.\nIt is a cohesive societal system of learned behaviour patterns.\nRecent History\nIsraeli\n- this supports the idea that we cannot have objective knowledge, as, if we are constantly using are background & culture to create new knowledge, it means we cannot have the same knowledge as people form other cultures\nSupportive Evidence\nHowever, does that make it ethical for them to force the Palestinians out of their own homes?\nArab\n- This also raises the question of whether an outside force decide on what is good for people of different cultures.\n- After WWII, the UN offered to give the Zionists half of Palestine\n- The UN is an outside force, so they would have had to base their decisions on reasoning, and the ways of knowing\n- To what extent did emotion play a part in the decisions?(emotion - the decision came soon after the Holocaust, a traumatic experience for the Jews)\n- In 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared foundation of the state of Israel. This caused a war over the Palestinian land. Arab forces fought, but were outnumbered.\n- By the end of the war, Israel had conquered 78% of Palestine, over 500 towns and villages were obliterated, and about 750,000 Palestinians were made refugees.\n- The chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization vowed to reclaim the land and destroy the state of Israel.\n- perception\n- reason\n- emotion\n- language\n- Political Situation\n- Historical Events\n- Language & Religion\nLet us look at how culture has affected knowledge in this conflict.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS\nAncient History\n- from these examples, we can see how culture does greatly influence knowledge\nGENDER ROLES\nThe Arabic people have a lot of other land in their power compared to the land Israel took over.\n- Muslims also claim rights to this land in accordance with the Quran\n- They argue that they too are descendants of Abraham, so are therefore also entitled to the land\n1517 - 1917: what is now Lebanon, Syria and Palestine was controlled by Turkey's Ottoman Empire\n1916: Turkish Empire is defeated in WWI, and Palestine is mandated to Great Britain\n1920: Jewish colonization\n1948: Creation of state of Israel\nOn one hand, it is true that the Jewish people have faced horrific persecution in the past, through the Nazis and the Holocaust.\n- Pre-1900, Palestine was a relatively multicultural land that lived without conflict\n- In 1967, tension continued, both sides increased military strength. In the six-day war, Israeli forces launched Arab attacks and seized areas from Egypt, Syria and Jordan(some of which have been returned), also occupying the final 22% of Palestine.\n- Since then, the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank has continued, which has led to Palestinian uprisings and violence. Many have been killed in attacks and bombings, both Israeli and Arab.\n- The original population of what is now Israel was 96% Muslim and Christian, yet over 4 million of these refugees who fled Israeli expansion are still in exile, prohibited from returning to their homes.\nTOK PRESENTATION:\nKNOWLEDGE\nBY: ALEXANDRA PIPE\nMAY 31, 2013\nPOLITICAL SITUATION\nWays of attaining knowledge:\nRELIGION\nOpposing Evidence\n- These aspects of culture all affect knowledge\n- The things people learn and experience in their own culture all create a person bias, and in turn change knowledge\n- For example, the Jewish Zionists' religion caused them to believe that the Palestinian land was theirs.\n- This extends on the fact that knowledge greatly depends on culture.\nShow full text\nThe Science\nConversational Presenting\nFor Business\nTestimonials\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nOur Customers\nCompany Information\nContact Us\nSecurity\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\nDeutsch\nPortugu\u00eas\nFran\u00e7ais\nMagyar\nItaliano\nHire an Expert\nBlog\nApril 22, 2022\nZoom meeting tips and tricks with Prezi Video\nApril 16, 2022\nHow to make a video with Prezi Video\nApril 7, 2022\nHow to run a Zoom meeting effectively\nLatest posts"}, {"Url": "https://toktips.com/may-2022-tok-essay-prescribed-titles-key-words-and-phrases", "CluewebURLHash": "779D96F5D6044EB61AE8448C3245DCBC", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "May 2022 TOK Essay Prescribed Titles - Key Words and ...", "Snippet": "\u201c\ue000Independent\ue001\u201d \u2013 \ue000There\ue001 may not be that many cases where \ue000knowledge\ue001 is completely \ue000independent\ue001 \ue000of culture\ue001 but \ue000there\ue001 will be cases where the connection between \ue000knowledge\ue001 and \ue000culture\ue001 is quite weak.

Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge.\n\u201cTo what extent do you agree\u201d \u2013 There are very rarely cases in TOK where an argument is 100% for or against something.\u00a0\u00a0If your whole essay completely agrees or completely disagrees with the statement you may likely not do well.\u00a0\u00a0You need to find a variety of specific examples that show that there is and is not a \u201cworld of difference between truth and facts.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Overall your essay may lean one way or the other or may end up squarely in the middle.\u00a0\u00a0It is important that you make it clear to the marker that you clearly show the extent to which you agree with the statement \u2013 it is essentially the thesis of your essay.\n\u201cthere\u2019s a world of difference between truth and facts\u201d \u2013 Your first point in exploring this prescribed title is having a solid understand of the meanings of \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d and you can start by reading a variety of dictionary definitions.\u00a0\u00a0They are obviously not the same but there is of course overlap between them.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, these words have different meanings in different AOKs so your discussion of \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d will vary depending on what AOKs you are focusing on.\u00a0\u00a0For example, \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d in literature are quite different from \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d in chemistry.\nAfter you have a solid set of specific examples in two different AOKs you need to critically examine how they show that there is (or is not) \u201ca world of difference between truth and facts.\u201d\n\u201cMaya Angelou\u201d \u2013 there is no benefit to researching Maya Angelou or researching the original context behind the quotation.\n\u201cAnswer with reference to two areas of knowledge.\u201d \u2013 Unlike many of the other prescribed titles in this session, your choice in AOKs is up to you.\u00a0\u00a0Two AOKs only, though.\n3. Is there solid justification for regarding knowledge in the natural sciences more highly than knowledge in another area of knowledge? Discuss with reference to the natural sciences and one other area of knowledge.\n\u201cIs there\u2026\u201d Historically, not many prescribed titles are yes / no questions.\u00a0\u00a0This prescribed does have a yes / no answer though although it is highly unlikely that you will end up 100% in the \u201cyes\u201d or no\u201d camp.\u00a0\u00a0The best TOK essays as a whole do not end up completely on one side of an argument.\u00a0\u00a0Your essay still needs a definitive answer though and your thesis statement and essay as a whole need to clearly answer the question.\n\u201csolid justification\u201d \u2013 Different people (and groups of people) will view knowledge in the natural sciences in vastly different ways.\u00a0\u00a0They will have different kinds of justifications for viewing knowledge in the natural sciences more highly (or less highly) than knowledge in other AOKs.\u00a0\u00a0You need to carefully look at how people justify their opinions about knowledge in the natural sciences vs. knowledge in other AOKs.\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d \u2013\u00a0make sure you are clear and specific in your essay about what kinds of knowledge you are focusing on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make sure the marker can see precisely what aspects of knowledge you are discussing in each paragraph of your essay.\n\u201cmore highly\u201d \u2013 How can knowledge in the natural sciences be viewed more (or less) highly than knowledge in other AOKs?\u00a0\u00a0To give one example, the need for peer review may be a reason why some view knowledge in the natural sciences as more trustworthy than knowledge in other AOKs.\u00a0\u00a0However, there are definitely drawbacks to peer review and from some points of view peer review is a negative, not a positive.\n\u201cDiscuss with reference to the natural sciences\u00a0and one other\u00a0area of knowledge.\u201d \u2013 Your choices are limited but clear with this prescribed title \u2013 you MUST choose the natural sciences and one other AOK.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not write about the natural science or you write about mathematics and two other AOKs it seems clear that you will lose marks.\n4. How do historians and human scientists give knowledge meaning through the telling of stories? Discuss with reference to history and the human sciences.\n\u201cHistorians and human scientists\u201d \u2013 You need to talk about more than history and the human sciences with this prescribed title \u2013 you need to specifically discuss individual historians and human scientists .\u00a0\u00a0You should look for specific examples where individual historians and human scientists are \u201ctelling stories.\u201d\nAlso note that the prescribed title asks \u201cHow do historians\u2026\u201d. And not \u201c To what extent do historians\u2026\u201d If the prescribed title started with \u201cTo what extent do historians\u2026\u201d you would have to discuss how stories are and are not used but that is not the case with this prescribed title.\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d \u2013\u00a0make sure you are clear and specific in your essay about what kinds of knowledge you are focusing on.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure the marker can see precisely what aspects of knowledge you are discussing in each paragraph of your essay.\n\u201cgive knowledge meaning\u201d \u2013 your essay must be able to pinpoint places in your specific examples where the telling of stories gives knowledge meaning.\u00a0\u00a0You need clear concrete evidence to support your arguments.\n\u201cthe telling of stories\u201d \u2013 This may involve publication of academic research, seminars, lectures, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Look for how the stories are told in your specific examples.\u00a0\u00a0There may (or may not be) differences in the \u201ctelling of historians\u201d between historians and human scientists.\u00a0\u00a0There may also be significant differences between how stories are told between people in the study of history and between people in the study of the human sciences.\n\u201cDiscuss with reference to history and the human sciences.\u201d \u2013 If you choose this prescribed title you have to discuss these (and only these) AOKs.\n5. How can we distinguish between good and bad interpretations? Discuss with reference to the arts and one other area of knowledge.\n\u201cdistinguish\u201d \u2013 There are numerous ways (sometimes the ways depend on the AOK) to distinguish between good and bad interpretations.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the ways include peer review of academic publications, re-doing experiments, debates, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You need to identify and analyze these different methods in the specific examples you choose to discuss in your essay.\n\u201cgood and bad interpretations\u201d \u2013 Sometimes it is very clear / easy to distinguish between a good and bad interpretation and sometime it is just a matter of judgement.\u00a0\u00a0Different AOKs will have different ways of determining whether something is a good or bad interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0Even within an AOK there will be significant differences \u2013 graffiti artists and kabuki actors (both artists) are held to very different standards and the way their artistic interpretations are distinguished between good and bad vary significantly.\u00a0\u00a0An \u201cinterpretation\u201d could refer to how a historian interprets a source, how a mathematician interprets a data set, how an artist interprets an event, how a reader interprets a poem, etc.\n\u201cDiscuss with reference to the arts and one other area of knowledge.\u201d \u2013 Your choices are limited but clear with this prescribed title \u2013 you MUST choose the arts and one other AOK.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not write about the arts or you write about the arts and two other AOKs it seems clear that you will lose marks.\n6. If we conclude that there is some knowledge we should not pursue on ethical grounds, how can we determine the boundaries of acceptable investigation within an area of knowledge? Discuss with reference to two areas of knowledge.\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d \u2013 make sure you are clear and specific in your essay about what kinds of knowledge you are focusing on.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure the marker can see precisely what aspects of knowledge you are discussing in each paragraph of your essay.\n\u201cpursue on ethical grounds\u201d \u2013 First of all, the pursuit of knowledge can take many forms and your essay should have a variety of types of \u201cpursuits.\u201d As for \u201cethical grounds,\u201d this also a broad area.\u00a0\u00a0In some situations the ethics are drawn from professional standards within an AOK but on other cases the ethical foundation may come from laws, regulations, religious doctrine, etc.\n\u201chow can we determine the boundaries of acceptable investigation. \u201d \u2013 There are various ways to look at \u201cdetermining the boundaries.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0There are different individuals and groups who determine the boundaries of acceptable investigations depending on the context.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a researcher / artist / religious leader etc. makes the determination alone while in other cases it is a set of professional standards, a licensing body, or a government that determines the boundaries of acceptable investigation.\n\u201c within an area of knowledge\u201d \u2013 It could be argued that some areas of knowledge are broader and less uniform than others.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless, this prescribed title asks how the boundaries are determined within an AOK. It is possible that your investigation within one AOK finds that the AOK has a fairly uniform way of \u201cdetermin[ing] the boundaries of acceptable investigation.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0A different AOK, however, may have quite different ways of determining boundaries.\u00a0\u00a0In the human sciences, for example, the ways in which psychology, criminology, law, economics, etc. determine boundaries may have some significant differences.\n\u201cDiscuss with reference to two areas of knowledge.\u201d \u2013 Unlike many of the other prescribed titles in this session, your choice in AOKs is up to you.\u00a0\u00a0Two AOKs only, though."}, {"Url": "https://assignmentnation.com/can-there-be-a-knowledge-that-is-independent-of-culture", "CluewebURLHash": "9BD43A8C73E0F9DD42E4580D93C2A2AF", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Can there be a knowledge that is independent of culture? - Assignment ...", "Snippet": "2nd version \u2013 Title for the essay: \ue000Can\ue001 \ue000there\ue001 be a \ue000knowledge\ue001 \ue000that is independent\ue001 \ue000of culture\ue001?

What are outlined below are some strategies and suggestions, prompts and prods, questions and possible responses only for deconstructing the TOK titles as they have been given. They should be used alongside the discussions that you will carry out with your peers and teachers during the process of constructing your essay. The TOK essay is a challenging assignment at any time but especially now given the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic and the various learning environments that are a result of that pandemic.\nThe notes here are intended to guide you towards a thoughtful, personal response to the prescribed titles posed.\u00a0 They are not to be considered as\u00a0an answer let alone the answer to the question(s) posed by the title and they should only be used to help provide you with another perspective to the ones given to you in the titles and from your own TOK class discussions and research. You need to remember that most of your examiners have been educated in the logical positivist schools of Anglo-America and this education and its social contexts pre-determines their predilection to view the world as they do and to understand the basic concepts as they do. The TOK course itself is a product of this logical positivism though efforts are being made to make it more universally embracing.\nThere is no substitute for your own personal thought and reflection, and these notes are not intended as a cut and paste substitute to the hard work that thinking requires. Some of the comments on one title may be useful to you in the approach you are taking in the title that you have personally chosen, so it may be useful to read all the comments and give them some reflection on how they might be of some use to you towards the title you have chosen.\nMy experience has been that candidates whose examples match those to be found on TOK \u201chelp\u201d sites (and this is another of those TOK help sites) struggle to demonstrate a mastery of the knowledge claims and knowledge questions contained in the examples. \u00a0The best essays carry a trace of the struggle that is the journey on the path to thinking. Many examiners state that in the very best essays they read, they can visualize the individual who has thought through them sitting opposite to them. To reflect this struggle in your essay is your goal.\nRemember to include sufficient TOK content in your essay. When you have completed your essay, ask yourself if it could have been written by someone who had not participated in the TOK course. If the answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d, then you do not have sufficient TOK content in your essay. Also, follow the basic format requirements of the assignment: 1600 words, 12-point font, etc. Have the assessment rubric ready-to-hand and use it to guide you in the structuring of your paper.\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/0B-8nWwYRUyV6bDdXZ01POFFqVlU/edit?resourcekey=0-n1jVSy4hexafvfYZdPcW8A#slide=id.p4\nA sine qua non: the opinions expressed here are entirely my own and do not represent those of any organization or collective of any kind.\nCan there be knowledge that is independent of culture? Discuss with reference to mathematics and one other area of knowledge?\nWe are asked in Title #1 to consider whether there is a knowledge which transcends culture, a knowledge free from the limitations or biases that might be seen in the \u201cvalues\u201d that a particular culture esteems most highly. We are asked to consider mathematics as the one area of knowledge that appears to transcend cultures since a man working in Moscow, Idaho will have no problems collaborating with a woman who researches in Moscow, Russia on the same topic of research since mathematics is perceived as a \u201cuniversal language\u201d. It might be better, perhaps, to ask whether there is a mode or manner of knowing that will provide a knowledge for us that is beyond the limits of change that is brought about by becoming (time) and history, what is properly called \u201chistoricism\u201d.\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d is a product (something that is brought forth) of and through human beings; and individual human beings are the product, or what is brought forth, of and through the societies, communities or \u201ccultures\u201d they happen to inhabit at any given time. Being products of these cultures, they will value or esteem what their particular culture holds most highly or most dear. What a culture values most highly will be based upon or grounded in what that culture has determined is most necessary to its \u201csecurity\u201d and permanence. The culture\u2019s need for security and permanence decides in advance what the individuals in that culture think experience is and what the things about them are. For us in TOK, this is central to how we understand and interpret our Core Theme of \u201cknowers and what is known\u201d.\nTitle #1 asks what is considered \u201cknowledge\u201d and asks you to look specifically at mathematics and one other area of knowledge. This is an appropriate question, since in technological societies algebraic calculation is esteemed or valued most highly by those various \u201ccultures\u201d and societies. (I put \u201ccultures\u201d in scare quotes because there is only one \u201cculture\u201d in technological societies since technology is, ultimately, an homogenizing force. That is the point of the example of the man and woman collaborating in different Moscows: they are able to do so because they are working in the same \u201cculture\u201d).\nThe word \u201cculture\u201d was first used by the Roman orator Cicero where he spoke of \u201cthe cultivation of the soul\u201d, the perfection of human beings, what we today would call \u201cempowerment\u201d. Culture is related to the word \u201ccultivate\u201d, to the gathering and securing of a place, to the tilling of it, to being responsible for it, to responding to it, and to attending to it caringly. In the Biology lab, we speak of a \u201cbacteria culture\u201d. Care and its attendant concepts would be a central category or predicate of any discussion of our Core Theme in our attempts to describe who we are as human beings. We are the beings who \u201ccare\u201d for things.\nThe concept of what we mean by \u201cculture\u201d today is relatively new. It came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries\u00a0 in Germany, although today it is ubiquitous or commonplace. Today we speak of \u201cancient Greek culture\u201d, but this is erroneous for the Greeks had\u00a0 no \u201cculture\u201d. Their closest word to our concept of \u201cculture\u201d would be ethos from which we get our word \u201cethical\u201d. The ethical has to do with actions, with doing something, what the Greeks called praxis, and this ethos was lived out in the polis or the \u201cshared community\u201d. We sometimes call a culture the sum of all the thoughts and actions of the human beings who compose it.\nWhy does a culture need to secure itself? Because a culture involves the activities that engage the human beings within it, there must be some purpose or goal that provides the ground to those activities, something which gives those activities meaning and stability. The concept of \u201cculture\u201d was necessary because of the relativism that arose with the arrival of historicism. Is there a knowledge that is independent of historicism i.e. a knowledge beyond an historical period, geographical place, localized cultures which in turn are used to give context to theories, stories and narratives, and other interpretations of our being-in-the-world from within those cultures?\nThe issues present in Title #1 are not new. They have been with us since human beings began questioning and thinking about the world we live in. Historically, the nominalist view thought that universals or general ideas were merely \u201cnames\u201d without any corresponding reality or relation to particular objects. Properties, numbers, sets or the mathematical itself were considered merely a way or mode of considering the things that exist and, therefore, they were arbitrary and had no correspondence to the \u201creal world\u201d. It took no less an effort than Immanuel Kant\u2019s three great Critiques: Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, and Critique of Judgement to overcome this view, and Kant did so through showing how the mathematical was related to nature and to objects in the world around us. The mathematical was embedded in the objects of Nature.\nIn the AOK Mathematics, the title invites us to consider whether mathematics was \u201cdiscovered\u201d or \u201cinvented\u201d. Until the thinking of the French philosopher Rousseau, reason (upon which the mathematical and mathematics are based) was considered ahistorical and beyond or independent of any cultural limitations such as time and place, etc. After all, it was reason which determined what human beings are ( the animal rationale: the being capable of reason ) and thus determined and made what became called \u201cculture\u201d possible. Reason was prior to mathematics and culture; and the principle of reason (nihil est sine ratione: nothing is without (a) reason) was the ground of both mathematics and culture. If mathematics was \u201cdiscovered\u201d, it would be beyond the limitations of any particular culture. If mathematics was \u201cinvented\u201d, then it would be a product of those particular cultures wherein and from whence it arose. Today, of course, scientists are able to collaborate on projects without regard to the culture in which they are dwelling (or can they? Do they not \u201cdwell\u201d within the same \u201cculture\u201d?). Some research on your part should provide you with examples of the discoveries of the origins of mathematics which occurred simultaneously in China, India and Greece and would seem to suggest that mathematics is not a product of a culture but is more a determiner of what a culture would become. (The Greeks, for instance, rejected Babylonian algebra as being \u201cunnatural\u201d for them.)\nToday, we rely on the mathematics of finite calculus and algebra. These define what knowledge is for us. Nature is understood as that which can be measured with exactitude, and through such measurements its \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201chow\u201d, and \u201cwhy\u201d can be determined through reason. Our culture esteems mathematical reason, for through it our control over nature (our \u201cknowledge\u201d) provides us with the power to secure our human being-in-the-world (our \u201cculture\u201d) through our sense of caring (concern) and responsibility. Mathematical science is a product of technology , that is, it is a predicate of technology, not vice versa as we commonly think. (See the writings on technology on other pages of this site.) Technology will be used by our culture to solve the problems that technology itself has brought about (climate change, pollution resulting from the use of fossil fuels, etc.).\nWhen considering the Arts as an AOK relating to this title, one does not have to look far to see that the Arts play a secondary role in the estimations of value in our modern cultures. Arts are for our entertainment, amusement, or to provide us with \u201cexperiences\u201d in our leisure hours. They help us to pleasantly pass the time when we are not engaged in the more \u201cserious\u201d pursuits that our cultures reward.\nWhenever I ask a group of young people if they agree that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the usual response is a one hundred percent hands raised. When I follow up the question with \u201cwhat then is beholding\u201d, the perplexed looks begin. The more brave will try to give a Cartesian-inspired response along the lines of \u201csubject/object\u201d and of the \u201csubjective\u201d representations of the evaluations of the work of art as an object and the \u201csubjective\u201d values deriving from matters of taste. It is no co-incidence that judgements in the Arts and their truth became \u201csubjective\u201d along with the arrival of the \u201cobjective\u201d considerations of algebraic calculus in mathematical physics. Truth lies in the domain of mathematical calculus, not in the works produced by artists. Artistic judgement is now called \u201cthe philosophy of aesthetics\u201d.\u00a0 The separation of human beings and their actions\u00a0 (what we understand as their \u201ccultures\u201d and \u201chistories\u201d) from those of nature (Descartes\u2019 concept of the Self as Ego cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore I am) resulted in human beings being placed at the centre, as the apotheosis of nature, as makers of their own destinies and histories. This was the great paradigm shift of Occidental human beings and it began around the time of the Renaissance and found its completion in the Age of Reason. Human beings became \u201ccreators\u201d unlike the \u201cmakers\u201d or technites/technes as the Greeks understood them.\nWe can rephrase our earlier question regarding mathematics by asking: \u201cIs great art discovered or invented?\u201d The most probable response (because it is the easier response) will be that great art is invented or created. Does great art\u2019s truth lie beyond (or is it independent of) the culture of which it is a product?\u201d If great art is \u201cinvented\u201d, then it is clearly a product of its time and place, its social contexts, etc. If it is \u201cdiscovered\u201d, from where does it originate? We often hear of the \u201ctimelessness of great art\u201d. And when the artists themselves are asked about their art, they are at many times, at a loss for words to explain it and sometimes refer to mystical or other sources such as \u201cmuses\u201d or \u201cpossession\u201d, other \u201cspirits\u201d or \u201cdaemons\u201d. They are usually not at a loss for words, however, when they speak of their techniques when engaging in bringing forth their works. This suggests that the truth of art and art itself (and I am only speaking of great art here) lies independent of and beyond the culture of which the artist as an individual is a product.\nHere in Bali where I live, the people do homage to their gods for the many gifts that the gods have bestowed on them. Those of us from the West and from the technological societies of the East find it \u201csilly\u201d or \u201csuperstitious\u201d that the Balinese would pay homage to their gods rather than to Honda, Toyota or Yamaha for the making of their motorcycles and their automobiles. But for the Balinese, it is not Toyota or Honda that have \u201ccreated\u201d their motorcycles and cars. Motorcycles and automobiles were always already there as gifts from the gods, waiting for \u201cinspired\u201d human beings to \u201cdiscover\u201d, or more precisely, to \u201cuncover\u201d them and bring them out into the \u201copen\u201d.\n00:00\n00:00\n2. To what extent do you agree with the claim that \u201cthere\u2019s a world of difference between truth and facts \u201c? (Maya Angelou) Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nTitle #2 asks for a personal response from you: do you agree with the claim that there is a world of difference between truth and facts and to what extent i.e. totally? partially? not at all? So the title is not looking for an academic scholarly recitation on the distinction between \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfacts\u201d (if indeed there is any) but rather, a personal response filled with personal examples (unless, of course, you happen to have made those scholarly opinions on truth and facts \u201cyour own\u201d). These notes and thoughts to follow may not be helpful to you in this regard, but the hope held here is that they may prod you along the path to thinking about a possible response to the topic.\nTruth is usually discussed from within three main theories: the correspondence theory, the coherence theory, and the pragmatic theory. The correspondence and coherence theories of truth were introduced into Western thinking through the thought of Aristotle and rely basically on the principles of logic. The pragmatic theory of truth finds its origins in the sophist Protagoras (\u201cman is the measure of all things\u201d) and gains further development in the thinking of British and American empiricists and finds its foundations in the Greek word pragma or practical, \u201cmaterial\u201d, concrete things. If you have read any of the other writings on this blog, you will probably have noted that I subscribe to the original meaning of the word \u201ctruth\u201d as it is found in the Greeks: aletheia, which means \u201cto uncover\u201d, \u201cto reveal\u201d, \u201cto unconceal\u201d, \u201cto bring out into the open so that something may show itself\u201d, \u201cto retrieve from forgottenness\u201d. This original meaning of the word \u201ctruth\u201d is broader and encompasses the other main theories within it. No matter what your response to this topic, your essay will have to contain elements of the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic theories of truth if it is to be successful. Your essay will \u201cbring forth and show\u201d your propositions and assertions (correspondence), your evidence (coherence) and your judgements (pragmatic) regarding the question asked and demonstrate or show your knowledge of the terms used.\nWhat is a \u201cfact\u201d and are there facts that stand alone outside of the systems which create them? Here in Bali, the date on the Balinese calendar posted on my wall is much different than the date and time shown on my computer. The Balinese calendar is a lunar calendar; the computer\u2019s calendar is a solar one. Both calendars are correct but they express different facts. The Balinese calendar shows me when I can anticipate various religious activities to occur here; the solar calendar lets me know when, for instance, the TOK essay titles will be released. The two calendars reference two distinct worlds. Both calendars express \u201ctruths\u201d in that they are a \u201cshowing forth\u201d of time; it is the same time. Both calendars are attempts to understand what time is. We commonly view time as a series of consecutive \u201cnows\u201d which can be measured with exactitude in discrete mathematical units. We do the same with space. But what time and space are in themselves (their \u201ctruth\u201d) remains a mystery for us, hidden from us. The use of mathematics and the facts which it reveals about the nature of ourselves and our worlds (and the world) is the reason why it is so highly valued among technological cultures. The spontaneity of our freedom is made greater through our control and commandeering of the spontaneity of nature.\nWe as human beings inhabit a number of different \u201cworlds\u201d simultaneously. You inhabit the world of being a student or a teacher; you are a mother or a father, a son or a daughter, a friend or lover in another \u201cworld\u201d; you may have a number of different avatars in the virtual \u201cworlds\u201d you may inhabit; you may be a sportsperson, or musician, or inhabit some other \u201cworld\u201d in your hobbies. Each of these worlds contain their own facts which are illuminated for you by their \u201ctruths\u201d.\nIn the AOK Human Sciences, a phenomenon that should be of great concern is the assault on truth that is occurring among the populist movements of both Europe and North America, something which the African-American poet and novelist, Maya Angelou, would be greatly concerned about since truth, knowledge and freedom would be inextricably linked for her. The distinction between North American populism and its European counterpart is in the fact that European populism is based on \u201cblood and father/motherland\u201d while North American populism directs its goals to more abstract concepts such as \u201cliberty, justice and freedom\u201d, etc. Europeans and Asians, for the most part, are indigenous or autochthonous peoples: they have belonged to the \u201cfather/motherland\u201d from before the time of making the land their own in their \u201cconscious\u201d memory. North Americans are not so. For North Americans, there has always been an historical awareness of making the land their own since they have no history from before the age of progress.\nThe North American making of the land their own began with the genocide of its Native Peoples, and in the USA, the establishment of the institution of slavery among its white landholders. The truth of these facts is not written in many of their historical narratives (which have been written primarily by white males, though this is changing). The desire to include critical race theory in the curriculum of its schools is divisive for many in the white society \u00a0which does not want to know itself and which is finding itself becoming a minority and feels itself under threat. North American history texts are filled with facts, but truth is very much lacking in most cases.\nNorth American populists are searching for the roots that they have never had. The search appears to be focusing on what they believe are their \u201croots\u201d in European fascism where race, \u201cpatriotism\u201d, and the need for a scapegoat for their perceived ills (African Americans, later immigrants, any \u201cother\u201d perceived as \u201calien\u2019) are what they use to give their threatened identities some meaning. This sense of threat is an indication of their underlying weakness. The threat that North American whites feel is the loss of security in their own homeland (their \u201cculture\u201d, if you like), and they are willing to defend themselves against this perceived threat through the use of violence with the many weapons they have ready-to-hand. Any viewing of \u201cright wing\u201d media and its topics of discussion will reveal their concerns. The phenomenon of \u201calternative facts\u201d is not directed at a desire for truth, however, but a desire for power even if this must be achieved through falsehood. (The Italian political philosopher, Machiavelli, once said that princes gain power through fraud.)\nTruth as understood by the Greeks also relates to the individual human being as \u201cone who does not hide or forget\u201d. It referred to a person of candour and frankness, someone who does not dissemble or lie when being with others. It is the person who is \u201cfree\u201d to be the person that they are (something that seems to be waning in the worlds of our social media today). Truth is a product of our world: it is given to us; falsehood is the product of human being-in-the-world. The world does not lie; it hides. The denial of truth destroys something essential to our humanity and makes us become more bestial.\nWithin the Arts as an AOK there is, literally, a world of difference between the truths expressed through the Arts and the facts and their truths given to us through our scientific interpretations of the world understood as nature. Scientific research looks for the \u201cfixing of facts\u201d in a world of constant change. This \u201csolidification\u201d of what are called \u201cfacts\u201d is provided by our ability to give an explanation and evidence of the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of things (objects) so that they can be secured, fixed, and commandeered to meet whatever ends or goals that we may have in mind. Our age and culture is grounded through a specific interpretation of what is as objects (facts) and through specific comprehensions of truth (correspondence, coherence, pragmatic), and these grounds have come to determine our age as the technological age. This is the reality of our age; the \u201cworld\u201d of our age.\nVan Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers: Pb(NO3)2(aq) + K2CrO4(aq) \u2013> PbCrO4(s) + 2 KNO3(aq)\nThe painting by Van Gogh shown here (one of his many \u201cSunflowers\u201d paintings) is titled with the chemical compounds that compose Van Gogh\u2019s yellow paint. A chemist familiar with the compositions of the paints would recognize this \u201cfact\u201d, but knowing this fact would\u00a0 not bring her anywhere nearer to the painting\u2019s truth, for its truth lies elsewhere, literally, in another world than that of her laboratory. The chemical composition of the paint, its \u201cfact\u201d does reveal something about the painting, but its truth lies elsewhere. The chemist herself, as a human being, not only occupies the world of her laboratory. She also dwells within a number of other worlds, one of which may be where the beauty of the truth of the painting of the \u201cSunflowers\u201d enriches her life and gives to her a greater sense of her humanity. To dwell only within the world of the facts of her science would be akin to madness.\n00:00\n00:00\n3. Is there solid justification for regarding knowledge in the natural sciences more highly than knowledge in another area of knowledge? Discuss with reference to the natural sciences and one other area of knowledge.\nTo \u201cregard\u201d something is to show \u201ccare and concern\u201d for that thing. We send our \u201cbest regards\u201d to our near and dear ones when we contact them in order to show our care and concern for them. Since we modern human beings define our \u201cessence\u201d, what we are, as \u201cfreedom\u201d, the knowledge that enhances and secures that freedom will be held in the highest regard i.e. it will be given our greatest care and concern (attention) and will be \u201cvalued\u201d and esteemed most highly. The knowledge which we have gained from the natural sciences, the knowledge that controls and commandeers the chance brought about by nature\u2019s spontaneity, increases our own spontaneity understood as \u201cfreedom\u201d.\nThe two Greek words techne and logos have been combined by moderns into the one word technology, and this one word captures the knowing (the knowledge) that is present in the sciences (logos) with the making (techne) that is the application of those sciences in the applied and mechanistic arts. Modern medicine, for example, is one area where the discoveries of the natural sciences are applied through the art of healing. Technology is our way of being-in-the-world and through it we demonstrate our care and concern for \u201clife\u201d.\nTo look at an immediate example of what is being said here: nature has demonstrated its spontaneity with the arrival of the Covid 19 virus and its many mutations, and this virus has limited the spontaneity and freedom of human beings in obvious ways. Through the knowledge that we have from the natural sciences, we have been able to somewhat control nature\u2019s spontaneity through the development of vaccines even though the virus continues to mutate. The ability to secure our freedom (our \u201clives\u201d, in this case) is the reason why the knowledge that we get from the natural sciences is most highly valued in our technological societies.\nThis esteeming of the knowledge gained from the natural sciences comes at a price, however, and this price may be seen and understood in the use of the words \u201csolid justification\u201d in the title. Science is \u201cthe theory of the real\u201d. In modernity, theory is the viewing of the real, how the real is seen and appropriated, how the world is taken into ourselves by way of experience. Science sets upon the real to set itself up as theory and to set the real up as a surveyable, calculable series of causes. What comes to presence through the viewing is the real, and science throughout its history has been transformed into the theory that entraps the real and secures its objectness, makes it come to a stand, \u201cfixed\u201d, \u201csolid\u201d, \u201cpermanent\u201d. Theory makes secure a region of the real. Every new phenomenon emerging within an area of science (physics, chemistry, biology and even the Human Sciences) is refined to the point that it can be defined and fit into the standardized objective coherence of the theory. It becomes \u201csolid\u201d, \u201cfixed\u201d in other words. It is not permitted to change.\n\u201cSolid justification\u201d is the requirement of the principle of sufficient reason necessitating that reasons be rendered to others for assertions made regarding the \u201creality\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d of an object, situation or condition. Human beings are the \u201crational animals\u201d; to be \u201cirrational\u201d is, by definition, to be less than human, to be inhumane. We believe that we can \u201cjustify\u201d our scientific observations of the world through mathematical calculation, and from these calculations make \u201cpredictions\u201d of events that will occur in the future. It is this \u201cpre-dictive\u201d power (lit. before \u201cspeech\u201d, before the handing over to others) that gives calculative reasoning its dominance since the predictive power provides security and certainty with regard to the way things are. This security and certainty enhances our \u201cpreservation of life\u201d and allows us to empower ourselves towards \u201cenhancement of life\u201d through a recognition of life\u2019s potentialities in our freedom. By predicting and controlling nature\u2019s spontaneity, our freedom is enhanced and our possibilities widened.\nTo \u201cpre-dict\u201d is to make an assertion prior to that speech which renders reasons. When the predictions or results are justified through reason, we believe that we have achieved a correspondence between our minds and the objects, conditions or situations under observation and questioning. To justify is to indicate \u201cthat which is responsible for\u201d the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of the \u201cjudgement\u201d made in the assertion. As the philosopher Kant indicated, \u201cJudgement is the seat of truth\u201d, or that upon which truth is grounded or based. \u201cReasons\u201d bring that which is being spoken about to light and justifies them. Without such reasons, the thing being spoken about remains in the dark, hidden. \u201cEvidence\u201d, or that which is experienced through sight primarily, must be provided and the correspondence between that which is \u201cexperienced\u201d, the evidence and the thing, situation or condition must correspond. For example, reasons provide the relations between a criminal and his crime and \u201cjustifies\u201d the assertion of guilt. When one asserts a position that Democrats in the USA are really lizard-like aliens preying on children for their blood (just one of many QAnon beliefs) evidence must be provided for making such a statement. When one asserts that \u201cthe Presidential election was stolen\u201d, one must provide corresponding evidence to show that that was indeed the case. Believing that a situation or condition is the case is not the same as \u201cjustifying\u201d that belief, as many courts throughout the USA have asserted. Conspiracy theorists, in general, lack the corresponding evidence and reasons for their assertions to be taken as true. Their beliefs are irrational, without reasons.\nOne of the consequences of the type of \u201cjustification\u201d required by reason is, some believe, not possible when making assertions about morals or ethics because moral judgements are \u201cvalues\u201d and these must be distinguished from assertions made about what we call \u201cfacts\u201d: i.e. there are no \u201cmoral facts\u201d because morals are ephemeral, lacking solidity, and fixity and thus without the possibility of justification. \u201cValues\u201d are what we human beings create through our freedom and willing in the world and through our determination of what things are and how they are and what we think they should be. This separation of statements or assertions of fact from statements or assertions of value is known as the \u201cfact-value\u201d distinction and it is the dominant principle or position in every Human Science. Efforts have been made to make morals subject to the same calculations that are used for scientific evidence such as Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism, \u201cthe greatest happiness for the greatest number\u201d, and the use of statistics is the primary language that the Human Sciences use to reveal their \u201ctruths\u201d.\nTo \u201cjustify\u201d clearly has relations to its root word \u201cjustice\u201d. How does our understanding of the word \u201cjustice\u201d relate to justifying and justification? With the modern view of what human beings are given to us by the philosophers Descartes and Kant, human being is that being before whom all other beings are brought before and required to give their reasons for being what they are as beings. This is the domineering, commanding stance of human being before whom all other beings are brought before and \u201cjustified\u201d as to what they are as beings. This \u201cjustification\u201d is that which is responsible for something being defined as what it is, how it stands in its truth. To justify is to argue for or defend. Our reasons for justifying our mathematical calculations, for instance, are that these calculations give the best explanation of our observations and experiences (experiments).\nOur calculations secure our standing in our being-in-the-world and provide the potential for the all-important \u201clife enhancing\u201d or \u201cquality of life\u201d activities that are the purposes and ends of our arts, what we have come to call our \u201cculture\u201d. It is our calculations that give us our domination and control, our mastery of nature; and their \u201ccorrectness\u201d is demonstrated in the predictability of outcomes. There is a \u201cjustification\u201d provided by the mind\u2019s correspondence to the object in question and in the mind\u2019s representations of that object in the mathematical. These justifications are shared in the language of the principle of reason through the belief in the schemata of the technological framing of the things in this world i.e. the world and its beings (things) understood as object. In many parts of the world, there is a turning away from the facts so that we may affirm what is contradicted by the experience of everyday living (climate change denial, for instance, or the need to live in an alternative reality).\nIn the modern age, beauty has been radically subjectivized so that we have our belief that \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the beholder\u201d. In all of our scientific explanations of things, we are required to discount the \u201cother\u201d as beautiful because the beautiful is not calculable (try as we may to do so). \u201cLove\u201d is consent to the fact of authentic \u201cotherness\u201d: we love otherness not because it is other but because it is beautiful.\u00a0 But what happens to \u201clove\u201d in a world dominated by the view that the freedom brought about through the objectivication of the things that are becomes most highly valued? The Greek philosopher, Plato, places the tyrant (Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, for example, but the list could include all of the other autocrats currently parading or \u2018strutting and fretting\u2019 around the world\u2019s stage) as the worst human being because in his self-serving, \u201cotherness\u201d has completely disappeared for him.\nWhat I am trying to say here is that the world before us is beautiful and our appropriate response to it is love. However over time, trust in the world has been replaced with doubt as the methodological pre-requisite for an exact science. If we confine ourselves to anything simply as an object, it cannot be loved as beautiful (reflect on the example of Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers in title #2). The key difficulty is that in loving the beauty of the world as it is (and esteeming it most highly), how does this affect the desire to change it? With regard to our title, what is being maintained here is that one knows more about something by loving it, and it should be this love that should be most highly esteemed because it should determine our understanding of the world. In our age, the knowledge gained in the natural sciences through the principle of reason is exalted above understanding and this is the reversal of the world shown to us in Plato\u2019s Cave.\n00:00\n00:00\n4. How do historians and human scientists give knowledge meaning through the telling of stories? Discuss with reference to history and the human sciences.\nTitle #4 is very restrictive in the parameters of its requirements: you are required to confine yourself to the areas of knowledge of history and the human sciences. You will also have to consider what \u201cmeaning\u201d is and how it might be understood, and what is meant by \u201cthe telling of stories\u201d.\n\u201cMeaning\u201d is that knowledge that is handed over to others. It is \u201cmeaningful\u201d; it is something requiring concern and care to a greater or lesser degree. It is that knowledge that is intended to be conveyed to another through the use of language, whether that language be in words or in numbers, symbols or signs. Meaning ascribes to something its \u201cde-finition\u201d, its limits or its boundaries so that it may be distinguished from something else which is not intended. The Greeks identified human being as the zoon logon echon, that animal that is capable of speech and thus that animal that is capable of conveying meaning through language. We constantly tell each other stories about our experiences. This telling of stories is the giving of an account, whether it be what we did over the weekend or our view of what the meaning of life is.\nSince their inceptions, both History and the Human Sciences have aspired to the exactitude and \u201ctruth\u201d that is given to us in the knowledge of our Natural Sciences because the knowledge given to us in the Natural Sciences is that which is most highly valued. This aspiration realizes itself in History and the Human Sciences in what is called \u201cresearch\u201d as the most appropriate method in the approach to what is called knowledge. The Natural Sciences deal with the objects of nature, those objects which come to presence in their own ways from out of themselves, and those objects tend to remain \u201cfixed\u201d and can be accounted for as masses in motion in time and space for the most part. These movements of coming to presence can be accounted for mathematically through the use of axioms, principles, laws and theories. This is how they are accounted for.\nIn History, the object of study is not present before us. It is in the past and must somehow be brought to presence, to the present, through a way of viewing (theory) and the selection of either appropriate artefacts or other evidence that will support the assertions or propositions put forward. In the way of viewing, the way of how the first principles have been pre-determined, the objects of History become fixed and can be researched in such a way that what we call knowledge can result. The objects that are studied in the Human Sciences are in constant motion. They, too, must be fixed so that statements/assertions can be made about them. This fixing comes about in the form of statistics which provide the \u201cevidence\u201d to support the assertions that are made based on the first principles that are used.\nWhether the world is accounted for through language or mathematics, it must necessarily be accounted for. The giving of an account is the interpretation that provides meaning, that which makes something meaningful. The giving of an account is a narrative, the telling of a story. We must remove from our minds the fossilized conception of a \u201cstory\u201d being a \u201cfiction\u201d. Accounts or stories may be simple or complex. A recipe is an account of how to bake a cake. Its step-by-step algorithm when followed correctly will result in the bringing to presence of the end product: a cake. The accounts of History or the Human Sciences, likewise though more complex, are stories which will bring about end results that are meaningful to the historian and the social scientist and their audience. The first principles will determine what will be chosen and how the stories will be told, the methodology. A difficulty in the stories told, for instance, is that many women complain that the stories are told by men, particularly white men for the most part.\nHistory is different from the other Human Sciences, or indeed other sciences in general, in that the seekers of knowledge or researchers cannot directly observe the past in the same way that the object of research can be observed and studied in the Natural Sciences. How the past is to be viewed must be decided on beforehand. \u201cHistoriology\u201d is the study of history in general, the search for what its essence is, what its purpose is. \u201cHistoriography\u201d, that is, a study of the writings of history, is not a study of all of the past, but rather a study of those traces or artifacts that have been deemed relevant and meaningful by historians; and this choosing of artefacts and evidence is the most important aspect of the study of history as it attempts to aspire to \u201cscientific research\u201d. This is where the importance of \u201cshared knowledge\u201d comes into play: what we call our \u201cshared knowledge\u201d is \u201chistory\u201d, and what artefacts we choose to select and what stories we decide to tell are determined beforehand by our culture.\nOur ways of knowing are the manners in which we establish a relation between ourselves and our worlds, our communities, and to the things that we encounter in the world about us. One of these ways of relating is through Memory. With Memory, we must also keep in mind \u201cforgetting\u201d and what is forgotten or what is chosen to be forgotten, for memory and forgottenness go hand in hand.\n\u201cTo forget\u201d in Greek is lethe. It is the opposite of aletheia or the Greek word for \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201ca bringing to presence\u201d. To bring something to presence, to bring something to mind, to \u201cregard it\u201d with care and concern, is \u201ctruth\u201d. It is a \u201cbringing things to light\u201d. Lethe is to cast something into oblivion, into darkness, or that the something is \u201cnot present\u201d for us. In Greek mythology, one must first drink of the river Lethe after death in order to be able to cross over in Charon\u2019s boat into the underworld; remembering is essential to being human and to its \u201clife\u201d. To be good at rote learning, to remember facts and dates or mathematical formulas, has nothing to do with Memory as a way of knowing. Memory is more akin to \u201ccommemoration\u201d and is part of what distinguishes human beings from other animals; we are able to \u201ccommemorate\u201d; other animals cannot. This is why Memory is an essential part of history, and its elements of story telling for History must take the form of \u201cnarrative\u201d, a story.\nIn the oral traditions prior to the arrival of written narratives and stories, Memory was seen as \u201csaving\u201d and \u201cpreserving\u201d the story, but this saving and preserving also gave the story \u201cmeaning\u201d by its being supported as plausible. The Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, saw philosophy as more akin to poetry than to science. Both History and the Human Sciences attempt to find their truth through the methodology of scientific research and its first principles, but in the search for meaning and preserving both must resort to stories or the telling of narratives. This is especially so in the USA where there is no collective Memory from before the Age of Progress.\nWhat we call History as an object of study appears simultaneously with ratio, calculation, thought. Thucydides, the first historian of the West, wished in his History of the Peloponnesian War, to give an account of the war without the \u201cadornments and embellishments of the poets\u201d (Homer\u2019s Iliad and the Trojan War, for instance) so that he could arrive at his universal main theme: an understanding of the essence of war, all wars. He wished to go from the particular to the universal such as you attempted to do in your Exhibition. The height of Thucydides\u2019 History, however, is \u201cPericles\u2019 Funeral Oration\u201d and it is a fiction: it is not a verbatim of the actual speech. It was written by Thucydides himself. Some questions could be: does Thucydides\u2019 History as an account of the Peloponnesian War come closer to the essence of war, the universal, than does Homer\u2019s Iliad? Does an historian aspire to make myth? If Josef Stalin is correct in his statement \u201cOnly the winners get to write the history\u201d, are not all historians engaged in writing myth (at best) or propaganda (at their worst)? Are modern historical accounts \u201cscience\u201d or \u201cmyth\u201d since to arrive at their statements of \u201ctruth\u201d they must use words (rhetoric) rather than mathematics to make their judgements? Do modern historians give a sufficient account of their first principles?\nThe basic problem for history in its attempts to be a \u201cscience\u201d is that in establishing the past as object and in establishing ourselves as the summonsers for its artefacts to give us their reasons, we can learn about the past, but we cannot learn from the past since our positions as summonsers already establish us as superior to that which is being studied. Since we have seen the kind of societies the \u201cwinners\u201d of history have produced, perhaps it is time to look at what knowledge the \u201closers\u201d of history might have to share with us. This is what \u201ccritical race theory\u201d is all about.\n00:00\n00:00\n5. How can we distinguish between good and bad interpretations? Discuss with reference to the arts and one other area of knowledge.\nWhat we commonly mean by \u201cinterpretation\u201d is to provide an \u201cexplanation\u201d for some thing that appeals to reason and to common sense. To say that the wildfires in California and Greece are attributable to \u201cJewish space lasers controlled by the Rothschilds\u201d does not appeal to our reason and common sense, for instance. It is a \u201cbad\u201d interpretation and explanation for the phenomenon of wildfires.\nAn interpretation is meant to bring some thing to presence in order for it to show what, how and why it is as it is. It is associated with the thing\u2019s \u201ctruth\u201d. In Group 1 and Group 6 subjects, you are asked to provide an \u201cinterpretation\u201d of a work of art, whether a novel, a poem or painting for instance, and in doing so name it as \u201csuch-and-such\u201d or \u201cso-and-so\u201d, but to do so you must first turn that art into an object. In the Human Sciences attempts are made to find fixed, permanent principles that will lead to interpretations of social life which attempt to understand what is present at all times and in all places when living in communities, while in the Natural Sciences \u201cexplanations\u201d are looked for through experiments on the \u201cfixed\u201d things that are the objects of nature.\nOur lives are pervaded by interpretations both of ourselves and of other entities and things. Our \u201cCore Theme\u201d seeks to interpret how we understand ourselves, while our \u201cOptional Themes\u201d seek to understand other entities in the world around us. Our everyday interpretations or awareness of things is prior to our systematic interpretations undertaken in the Human Sciences and prior to our explanations provided by and given in the Natural Sciences. You need to find your way to the library or the science lab and interpret the contents in those places as books or science equipment before doing any of the activities called science or research. When you walk into a classroom, you do not first see uninterpreted black marks on the white board or hear the sounds of your classmates arriving. You perceive these things right away as printed or spoken words even if you cannot understand them. That you understand speech as speech or a textbook as a book does not mean that your interpretation is unreliable nor that it creates the meaning of what is interpreted. Your understanding of what the things are about you is bound together with your interpretation of them. Understanding is global and general; interpretation is local and particular.\nHermeneutics is a special kind of \u201cinterpretation\u201d. In Plato\u2019s Ion Socrates refers to the poets as the \u201cinterpreters\u201d of the gods. Hermeneta is Greek for \u201cinterpretation\u201d, the disclosing of that which was previously hidden. Interpretation is conjoined with what the Greeks understood \u201ctruth\u201d to be. Formally, hermeneutics wa s the study of how interpretation occurs and is intertwined with \u201cmethod\u201d. It is the art of understanding written texts; but in it, all things are understood as written texts. The Irish writer, James Joyce, gives us a beautiful example of hermeneutical activity and what we understand as art, and in doing so, of what understanding and interpretation indicates, in the \u201cProteus\u201d section of his novel Ulysses: Continue reading\nLoading...\nWorld and Meaning in the Sefer\u00a0Yetzirah\nThis is a supplemental writing to a larger \u201cCommentary on the Sefer Yetzirah \u201c. It contains thoughts relevant to an interpretation of the context of the Theory of Knowledge guide as given in its latest release, though those unfamiliar with the text of the Sefer Yetzirah or the Tarot may find some of its references difficult to follow. It may shed some light on how knowledge, understanding and meaning are understood in the writings on this blog. It also sheds light on how I have come to understand the saying of Simone Weil: \u201cFaith is the experience that the intelligence is illuminated by love.\u201d\nWorld and Meaning in the Sefer Yetzirah\nBeing the \u2018perfect imperfection\u2019, as human beings we desire to know the \u201creality\u201d of whatever is, how it \u201cis\u201d as it is whatever it is, and the being of whatever has being. For the Sefer Yetzirah, as it was for the Greek philosopher Aristotle, \u201cpresence\u201d (ousia) is what constitutes the reality of the things that are. Two questions predominate: what is the thing\u2019s nature (essence)? what is its source (arche )?\nIn the Sefer Yetzirah, the study of the first question, the \u201cwhat\u201d question, is metaphysics. The study of the second question, the \u201chow\u201d question, is theology (\u201cnatural theology\u201d as opposed to \u201crevealed theology\u201d, although these, too, are interrelated). For Aristotle, the nature of the being of the real is energeia. The ultimate source of the being of the real is \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cperfect energeia\u201d. Some thing is real if it is, and is some thing. For Aristotle, a thing\u2019s form is its \u201cideal\u201d way of being; it is what the thing is supposed to be.\nWe may compare Aristotle\u2019s concept and that which is in the Sefer Yetzirah to the metaphor of the athlete and the ascetic: to athlon \u201c the prize to be won in a contest\u201d; athleo \u201cto contend for the prize\u201d. Contending for the prize requires that the athlete continuously work out in order to get in shape. Being an athlete requires being an ascetic, someone who constantly works to get in form or stay in shape. The Sefer Yetzirah is a training manual for the ascetic, and in this characteristic it shares a number of similarities with the writings of the Gnostics.\nTo apply the metaphor to the concept of \u201cpresence\u201d: the only thing perfectly in shape is the divine, the ideal form. Everything else is striving for its ideal form or shape.\u00a0 To be real does not mean being in one\u2019s form but becoming one\u2019s form. Human beings are not yet in their finished form like a completed work of art. Human being is \u201cstill on the way\u201d to a goal. With this view, \u201cbeing real\u201d can be still becoming one\u2019s ideal form or already being it, either still moving to perfection (kinesis) or already at rest with one\u2019s fully achieved self (stasis ). In the Sefer Yetzirah, the ideal forms or shapes are the Sephirot, the Ten. The being on the way for human beings is the achievement of a unity or a harmony with the emanations of the divine that are the real as revealed through the Sephirot.\nThis unity or harmony is attained by human beings in a lived context within a world where things (such as the Sephirot) are encountered. A \u201cworld\u201d is the matrix of understanding which is intelligibly structured by human interests and purposes. In this world of understanding (what is referred to as Binah in the Sephirot of the Sefer Yetzirah) beings become \u201cmeaningfully present\u201d in the world of Yetzirah, one of the four worlds of the Sefer Yetzirah. Yetzirah means \u201cformation\u201d, although it is oftentimes translated as \u201ccreation\u201d. In our modern context, it is the world dominated by that form of seeing, knowing and making that is called \u201ctechnological\u201d.\n\u201cThe world worlds\u201d i.e., contextualizes things, gives meaning to things found within it by providing the medium whereby they make sense. The meaningful and what it is is what appears in understanding and what allows it to appear. The meaningful is what shows up in the understanding of its meaning to human beings. \u201cPresence\u201d is not to be understood as a spatio-temporal \u201cout there\u201d but as what is \u201csignificant\u201d to us, meaningful to us. The word parousia, so important in understanding the Sefer Yetzirah, is what means \u201cnear to our concerns though far away in distance\u201d. This meaning is also to be considered with its other meanings of \u201cbetween\u201d, \u201calongside\u201d.\nWhat constitutes the meaning of things is the context of human involvement within which those things are met, the matrix of human purposes ordered to human interests and to human survival i.e., a world. This is the world of Yetzirah. Each human world discloses or unlocks the meanings that can occur to the things found within a world. A world discloses by providing a sense of possible relations in terms of which the things as they appear get their significance. In the language of the Sefer Yetzirah these are the \u2018paths\u2019 or \u2018the gates\u2019 that are travelled or met on the soul\u2019s journey. (This is not to deny that the thing itself has its own telos or purpose outside of human involvement. This is dealt with in the discussion of the beauty of the world in another segment.)\nHuman beings live in many distinct worlds at the same time, but they are encompassed by the One world. A mother can make business calls from home while rocking her baby to sleep. Each world \u2013 her job, her parenting \u2013 has the function of providing the range of possibilities among the sense-making activities within its specific area.\nYou will note that meaning is to be derived in the lived world from the practical activities within that world. The Greeks understood this as praxis i.e., the activity of the parent, student, athlete, artist, and it is from these activities that one could attain \u201csplendour\u201d or \u201csocial prestige\u201d through proficiency in the knowledge and skills required in those activities, the \u201cknow how\u201d. \u201cKnow how\u201d was called techne by the Greeks.\nA world is any place wherein human beings live out their interests and purposes, the \u201crelations\u201d whereby the things within that domain get their meaning and significance. A world is a range of human possibilities in terms of which anything within that context can have significance. All such possibilities are teleologically (limited, possible of completion) ordered to human beings by way of fulfilling human purposes; however, in the perfection of their imperfection, human beings still hold a belief in the possibility of re-uniting with the Good wherein they will find their own \u201ccompletion\u201d. The world, the relational context which constitutes the meaning which is ordered by Love, is ordered to the final cause of human fulfillment that lets things in our everyday world make sense. This is the manner in which the relations between the Sephirot, the paths, and the gates are to be understood and interpreted in the Sefer Yetzirah. Meaning is given in the hierarchical order given to things in their relation to the Good. It is the Good which makes us give priority to our world of parenting over our world of business or the job, or to give priority to study rather than to merely whiling our time away in mindless pleasures and activities.\nThere is a fundamental difference between the meaningful thing and its meaning i.e., between any particular instance and its class, between a Sephirot and the thing or event it signifies, between the Tarot card and the experience it illuminates. Things do not come with their meanings built into them but get made as meaningful. Discursive meaning, meaning that is obtained by knowledge and reason and is able to be communicated to others, is a synthesis between distinct elements that are synthesized into a meaningful whole. Affirming that so and so is an athlete assumes that she does not exhaust the class \u201cathlete\u201d \u2013 she and the class are distinct \u2013 even though she can be identified, in a synthesis, as being a member of that class. In analyzing \u201cworld\u201d, the structure of synthesizing and distinguishing (dianoia and diaresis) relates not only to the random acts of making sense (e.g., \u201cShe is an athlete\u201d \u2013 an assertion), but also towards the world itself where such athletic acts are performed. Synthesis and differentiation (what Plato termed dianoia and diaresis) is the condition of all discursive sense-making. (See the discussion of Plato\u2019s Divided Line in the Appendix to the \u201cCommentary on the Sefer Yetzirah .\u201d)\n\u201cWorld\u201d is both static and dynamic, at rest and in motion. The world as static is the place of meaningfulness. Viewed dynamically, the world is the placing of things in meaning. This placing of things in meaning is done through the logos: contextualizing things within a set of possibilities that makes things able to be known and used in terms of their possibilities. \u201cBeing\u201d as static is \u201cpresence\u201d; taken as dynamic it is the \u201cpresenting\u201d of things, the act of allowing things to be meaningfully present. This letting things be meaningfully present is done through Love acting as it does through sight which allows the things to be seen meaningfully.\nThe place where things become meaningful is in \u201cthe open that opens things up\u201d. For Aristotle, \u201cthe soul\u201d is the topos eidon, \u201cthe place where meaning shows up\u201d. In the static world, it is the open field in which all forms of meaningfulness occur. (The Chariot card of the Tarot in the Rider-Waite deck, for example, is placed in an open field, outside the city.) In the dynamic world, this open area opens things up for possible use and appropriation i.e., makes them accessible and significant, lets them \u201cbe\u201d. In Greek philosophy, the condition of \u201cbeing open\u201d indicates imperfection (the circle being the highest form and circular motion being higher than linear motion, for instance). Closure, self-closure upon one\u2019s self would be the realization of all one\u2019s possibilities, perfection, completion, accomplishment. This end is not possible for human beings in time. The meaning-giving-world is open rather than closed. It can never be fully known. Human being is always incomplete and finite.\nOur \u201cmaking sense\u201d is always a partial synthesis for there is always an element of tension or \u201cstrife\u201d in the area of \u201cdifference\u201d and in the in-betweenness and mediation. Meaningfulness requires mediation (the logos) in order to make possible the relations that connect \u2013 these tools to that task, for instance. The pre-requisite for mediation is a medium, a field of possible relations within which the connections can be made. When static, the world understood as the logos, is the medium of intelligibility. In its dynamic state, the world as medium mediates tools and tasks (as well as subjects and predicates in language and reason) to each other with the result that sense or meaning occurs. The meaningfulness is never a perfect unity but always exists within a \u201cstrife\u201d or tension.\nAccording to Aristotle, what we understand as \u201cfreedom\u201d is the power that \u201cempowers\u201d things in the static world to open themselves up to their various possibilities and potentialities. In the dynamic world, the \u201cfree\u201d frees the things of the world and the power \u201cempowers\u201d their significance. In this world of Yetzirah, insofar as the world is one of relations between tools and their possible utility, language and number become the tools that are used to liberate those tools from their \u201cjust thereness\u201d by revealing their suitability for fulfilling this or that purpose. For Plato, it is the Good that makes intelligibility possible, for it is the medium between the person\u2019s ability to understand and the ability of the form\u2019s eidos to be understood.\nIn the static presence of being, the opening is that region which clarifies things, the area of unfolding that lets them appear. Their emergence in this opening is a coming-forth or a stepping-forth. It is the light (love) which brings things to presence; but in order to do so, there must be an opening that allows the light in. In the allegory of the Cave in Plato, the opening is that of the Cave to the light of the Sun; the Cave itself is physis or Nature. In the dynamic state, the light brings clarity to things by letting light shine on them and show themselves as this or that. Aletheia or truth is the self-unfolding of the static world itself. The dynamic unfolding is the bringing of them into meaning. Physis is the world\u2019s arising or self-emergence. In its dynamis, it is the emergence that brings things forth into the open where they can appear as this or that.\nWhat is the source of meaningfulness? The open that opens things up through love (care, concern), the clearing that clarifies them, the ever-present presence that allows things their meaning is determined by what we think our \u201ctreasure\u201d is. It can be the freedom that empowers (power itself for its own sake) or it can be the love of the beauty of \u201cotherness\u201d that enables the \u201cletting be\u201d of things to be as they are. In the Gospel of St. John, \u201cIn the beginning was the Word\u2026\u201d shows that Christ is both \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cword\u201d, and as Love it is through Him that all things come into being. Things that do not come into being through Him are but \u201cshadows\u201d. One question that arises is whether or not the opening of world, the ontological movement of human beings that opens up the clearing for the parousia of being (Christ\u2019s \u201cpresence\u201d within the world), is a human doing or whether it is a receiving of a gift from outside of the human being, a gift from the God.\nIn Aristotle, kinesis or movement is \u201cperfect\u201d when it is a \u201cself-possessed\u201d movement: a thing is perfect or complete when it possesses its telos \u201cwholeness\u201d, \u201cownness\u201d and it does so by being a finished work. Every entity is perfect to the degree that it has come into its own. The imperfect is what is still striving to fulfill its essence. We participate in a goal without fully possessing it. You speak some French even if not perfect French; you strive in your studies for \u201cA\u2019s\u201d though you have not arrived there yet. Participation without full possession is deficient or a-teles, still coming into its own. Aristotle says \u201cbecoming is for the sake of Being\u201d. The telos of the thing actively moves the thing. This is contrary to Plato who states that the Good is beyond Being and the Good is the telos of all Being and beings and moves all beings and Being.\nEverything in Aristotle\u2019s universe is either telic (reached its limits) or erotic (deprived, in need). When the thing is telic, it is wholly present informing and fulfilling the thing. When not, it is still drawing the thing from within, not to anything outside of itself, but towards its own fulfillment. Self-fulfillment is what Aristotle means by \u201cthe good\u201d. The telos moves by being desired (the good). We are erotic creatures because self-fulfillment is what we long for. A moved thing is drawn on by its telos and human being is self-moved by its own desire for self-fulfillment. Human being is defined by its absence from perfection and is equally its erotic presence to perfection. Absence (relative but not absolute \u2013 deprivation \u2013 the desired telos) draws us to ourselves. Absence gives (lets be; allows for; is the source of) Presence. Our imperfect presence is the gift of the presence-bestowing-absence.\nThis ontological condition is shown in how we comport ourselves in our everyday dealings. Ari is studying for the IB Diploma: that is his raison d\u2019etre at the moment. The Diploma is relatively absent yet but, as desired, gives Ari his presence, the world of meaning in which he currently lives, that of being an \u201cIB Diploma student\u201d. The absent Diploma which is desired but still unattained bestows presence. It gives world to Ari.\nWhat kind of presence does human beings\u2019 self-absence give? In the world of Sefer Yetzirah, becoming and perfection are paradoxically tied together. We may understand it in Plato\u2019s words that \u201cTime is the moving image of eternity\u201d. The becoming that is Time is the absence of the perfection of God. God is perfectly perfect having always attained perfection being eternal. There is no becoming in God. God\u2019s absence in His creation is to be understood as such: by withdrawing, God allows the beings to be in their presence. If there is no withdrawal, there are no beings since all would be perfectly perfect, a One. The telos for human beings then becomes unity with the Divine. In the world of Yetzirah, the wood for a table participates in its future perfection, but deficiently. It is still being moved towards its fulfillment, and once it reaches it, the movement of becoming a table will stop.\nFor human beings, the paradox expresses itself in that we are the perfectly imperfect creature in our incompleteness. Human beings can never attain completeness or perfection in the future because human beings are finite creatures i.e., in Time. Human being is always becoming a this or a that, yet it is always human being. It is itself \u201ca moving image of eternity\u201d. The difference between a table and a human being is that a table\u2019s becoming will cease once the construction reaches its goal, whereas human beings\u2019 becoming is directed toward the Good itself. The question is always whether or not there is such an end or whether human beings\u2019 becoming is an end in itself. Whereas God is always whole and perfect and in a state of rest, his Creation is whole and perfect in its state of infinite motion. Human being is going nowhere because it is always where it is supposed to be, in its state of coming-into-its-own. For the Sefer Yetzirah, Adam is the first human being because he was the first being capable of discourse. Human being is neither progress over time (as in change of place, quality or quantity i.e., \u201cevolution\u201d), nor ontological transformation into something it essentially was not before (as in the case of substantial change). Human beings\u2019 perfection is to be imperfect.\nFor the Greeks, reality is not only a matter of perfection (coming-into-one\u2019s-own) but also a matter of \u201cshowing forth\u201d and \u201cappearing\u201d \u2013 being present and accessible. Being and truth are interchangeable. The greater the thing\u2019s degree of being, the greater its degree of meaningfulness in the double sense of its ability to know itself and others and to be known by itself and others. This \u201cknowability\u201d is the danger tied to \u201csocial prestige\u201d as the illusion when the Good is mistaken and understood as Necessity.\nMeaningfulness comes in different degrees at different levels of perfection. Human being is only partially knowing and knowable. For Aristotle, knowing is being one with that which is known. The erotic desire for the good is bestowed by its absence. For imperfect human beings, the degree of their presence to the relatively absent telos gives them their measure of knowing and knowability. The relatively absent goal, to the degree that it is desired, gives the moving entity its degree of ability to make sense of things. Human beings know mediately by bonding with the knowable in a matrix of mediating relationships. Human being makes sense of itself and others only by way of world (logos ).\nInsofar as human beings are imperfect, needing beings, that need is a longing and a desire for belonging even if there is nothing to belong to and no some thing else to long for. Human being (best depicted in the Tarot card The Chariot) is held in the strife between difference and synthesis, and human being is this strife. Human being is world \u2013 logos the zoon logon echon the living being capable of speech, thought. Eros pulls human being into its openness. As drawn out and opened up by its own need, its imperfection, human being frees things from the area of unintelligibility into the clearing and clarifies them, and the unifying of difference draws them into meaningful entities. When human being appears as what it is, it is not just the place where meaning appears but the very appearing of appearance, and is human being is capable of apprehending the source of meaning: the aitia, arche, and logos \u2013 the cause of, source of, and reason for appearance in the first place. This is its salvation. We are moved by eros (not ourselves: it is done to us) and in this moving world occurs. We are the always near but never arriving being.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nTOK Essay Titles November\u00a02021\nTOK Essay Titles for Nov. 2021\nThe TOK essay provides you with an opportunity to become engaged in thinking and reflection.

The TOK essay is a challenging assignment at any time but especially now given the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe notes here are intended to guide you towards a thoughtful, personal response to the prescribed titles posed.\u00a0 They are not to be considered as\u00a0an answer let alone the answer to the question(s) posed by the title and they should only be used to help provide you with another perspective to the ones given to you in the titles and from your own TOK class discussions and research. You need to remember that most of your examiners have been educated in the logical positivist schools of Anglo-America and this education pre-determines their predilection to view the world as they do and to understand the basic concepts as they do. The TOK course itself is a product of this logical positivism though efforts are being made to make it more universally embracing.\nThere is no substitute for your own personal thought and reflection, and these notes are not intended as a cut and paste substitute to the hard work that thinking requires. Some of the comments on one title may be useful to you in the approach you are taking in the title that you have personally chosen, so it may be useful to read all the comments and give them some reflection on how they might be of some use to you towards the title you have chosen.\nMy experience has been that candidates whose examples match those to be found on TOK \u201chelp\u201d sites (and this is another of those TOK help sites) struggle to demonstrate a mastery of the knowledge claims and knowledge questions contained in the examples. \u00a0The best essays carry a trace of the struggle that is the journey on the path to thinking. Many examiners state that in the very best essays they read, they can visualize the individual who has thought through them sitting opposite to them. To reflect this struggle in your essay is your goal.\nRemember to include sufficient TOK content in your essay. When you have completed your essay, ask yourself if it could have been written by someone who had not participated in the TOK course. If the answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d, then you do not have sufficient TOK content in your essay.\nHere is a link to a PowerPoint that contains recommendations and a flow chart outlining the steps to writing a TOK essay. Some of you may need to get your network administrator to make a few tweaks in order for you to access it. Comments, observations and discussions are most welcome.

Why is it so difficult to identify a clear line between accepted and disputed knowledge within a discipline? Answer with reference to two disciplines, each taken from a different area of knowledge.\nTitle #1 offers many key concepts which must be identified (deconstructed) in order to proceed. The initial question \u201cwhy\u201d asks us to provide reasons as to why there are disputes and agreements within various disciplines as to what may be called knowledge within those disciplines. What type of reasons are to be considered and what type of knowledge is meant in the question? To answer the question \u201cwhy\u201d is necessary because the principle of reason dominates the majority of disciplines and this principle demands the rendering of sufficient reasons: \u201cbe-cause\u201d, \u201cthe cause is\u201d. So, what is the \u201ccause\u201d of the disputes over what is to be considered knowledge within the various disciplines that you have chosen? This will require some research.\nThe rendering of sufficient reasons requires evidence which grounds and supplies the base for the assertions being made regarding knowledge in the discipline. Each discipline requires different kinds of evidence. In the natural and human sciences, this evidence will be in the form of mathematical equations which, due to their accuracy and correctness, provide the basis for making statements of \u201cfact\u201d. We believe \u201cnumbers don\u2019t lie\u201d and are the surest way in establishing the \u201ctruth\u201d of an assertion or a proposition. Numbers, it is believed, are more \u201ccertain\u201d than words in identifying and communicating statements regarding knowledge for \u201cwords strain,\u00a0crack\u00a0and sometimes break, under the burden, under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, will not stay in place, will not stay still\u201d to quote T.S. Eliot. Could this be because languages are living things while numbers are not and we have chosen to place our faith in numbers? Is it necessary that in order to \u201cknow\u201d things we must, in some way, \u201ckill\u201d them first? The philosopher Nietzsche constantly railed against the \u201cmummification\u201d of knowledge.\nThe \u201cdifficulty\u201d we have in \u201cestablishing clear lines\u201d is that in the establishment of \u201clines\u201d we are attempting to set the limits (horizons) of what something is and in so doing define what that thing is. To de-fine is to set the limits of something, to say it is this and not that. The philosopher Nietzsche once wrote: \u201cOnly that which has no history can be defined\u201d. This setting of limits is to \u201cframe\u201d something so that the something may be brought to presence before us in time and space, given its horizons. In order to do so, time and space must be measured in units (seconds and metres, for instance) and this is why we are so keen to use numbers when we bring something to presence. Bringing something to presence is to reveal the thing for what it is; this we call knowledge. In making the assertion of what the thing is, we are saying \u201ctruth\u201d about the thing and revealing the thing for what it is. The problem is that things are not revealed in their whole truth but only partially. The search for the whole truth regarding things is what the journey toward knowledge is all about and it is because things are only partially revealed that we have \u201cdisputed\u201d and \u201caccepted\u201d knowledge regarding them. What we call knowledge is how the things are brought to stand in their presence before us. Do things come to a greater illumination before us with the assertions made by others regarding them?\nIn the Arts, for instance, a basic question is \u201cIs it Art\u201d? Whether or not something is art or is to be considered art depends, of course, on how art is defined, on the limits established for a work (a thing) to be considered art. These preliminary definitions or limits establish the breath of the scope of the seeing for what that some thing (the work) is. Can other animals, other than human beings, make a work of art? When an elephant swashes a brush across a piece of paper and fills it with colorful strokes, is this a work of art? How one defines art will determine whether or not something is art. Because it is a product of the 20th century, Political Science has had difficulty defining fascism as a modern political phenomenon and is helpless in stating whether corporate capitalism, liberal socialism, or historical fascism is a superior form for establishing and running a state. Here the difficulty lies in the adherence to the \u201cfact/value\u201d distinction and the belief that judgements of value are not useful in describing something as it is.\nIn the Physical or Natural Sciences, one could question whether the tree the botanist views is illuminated in its truth, its presence, to a brighter stage than the tree beheld by the poet. The nature of the beholding is the key to how a thing is defined and, therefore, made one\u2019s own while it itself remains its own. (If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, what then is the beholding?) The accepted viewing and the challenging of this viewing occurs on the theoretical, not the experimental level. In the history of the viewing that is Physics, we could not have the paradigm shifts of Galileo/Newton or Einstein/Heisenberg (quantum physics) without the challenging of the viewing that had become the \u201caccepted\u201d knowledge of those who worked and investigated within those fields. Physicists still attempt to challenge the findings and conclusions of quantum physics while attempting to search for evidence of the truth of Einstein\u2019s viewing of the world.\n2. \u201c Knowledge gained through direct experience is powerful but problematic .\u201d To what extent do you agree with this statement?\nWhat is the type of \u201cknowledge\u201d gained through direct experience? What is \u201cdirect experience\u201d? In your science classes you are asked to do \u201cexperiments\u201d in order to have direct \u201cexperience\u201d of the knowledge that has been handed over to you. We could call this \u201cknowledge by acquaintance\u201d: you are familiar with what is being discussed and you can claim knowledge of the topic because you have become familiar with and determined the outcomes and seen the outcomes of the experience (experiment) yourself. But is what you have gained truly \u201cknowledge\u201d? In order to determine whether or not it is so, it is necessary to go back to the grounds of questions that have determined how you will view the world of the experience that you are to undergo. When we touch a hot stove for the first time, the knowledge that we gain of the pain that results is not problematic. We will not touch the stove again if we are rational. We were told by our mothers \u201cDon\u2019t touch the stove\u201d, but we had to find out for ourselves, right? This type of knowledge, the voices of our mothers, is knowledge from authorities or the shared knowledge given to us by the communities we happen to be members of.\nThe example provided may seem trite, but it contains the core of what are called \u201cknowledge problems and issues\u201d in TOK. You are constantly told to \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d when you write your essays and make your exhibitions. \u201cTo show\u201d means that you are required to bring to presence before others evidence for the judgements you have made regarding the experiences or situations which you have claimed to have undergone and what the things are that are to be considered. Those of us who would like to consider ourselves sane ask for evidence that our political enemies, our neighbours, are really lizard-like aliens who prey on the blood of children and worship Satan in evil cabals. Or that California wildfires are the result of Jewish space lasers in the control of the Rothchilds and George Soros. Those who make such claims are unable to provide such evidence, of course, and yet they stubbornly cling to their beliefs in the judgements that are made regarding our common experience of these things i.e. politicians and wildfires. At the root of such stubborn clinging is the desire for power, whether it be the need for \u201cself-empowerment\u201d by being seen as a member of some group who believe themselves to be downtrodden by history, or for political power by being seen as a member of a faction within their communities.\nWhen we are speaking of knowledge and its problems, whether it be knowledge by acquaintance or theoretical knowledge, it is important to distinguish and determine what type of knowledge we are talking about. When we are in the science lab, it is perfectly appropriate to question the theoretical knowledge that is being handed over to us: from where are the origins that brought about the seeing in this way? The type of questions asked will determine the kind of knowledge we are seeking. If we ask the question \u201cWhy is there more crime in the United States than in Singapore?\u201d we can hope to find an answer to this question through scientific research. We have direct knowledge or experience of the data but problems arise when and how that data is interpreted. No scientific research, however, will answer the question \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d When the Jock\u2019s intellectual girlfriend asks him \u201cWhy is there air?\u201d, to an extent he is being correct to respond \u201cThere\u2019s air to blow up volleyballs and basketballs; that\u2019s why there\u2019s air\u201d.  The Jock\u2019s world and the world of his intellectual girlfriend clash for each requires a different viewing and interpretation of things and thus a different experience of the things.\nWhen we ask about the knowledge gained from \u201cdirect experience\u201d, its power and its problems, a very complex process is going on which, at most times, we are unaware of. We have direct experience of things in most waking moments of our lives. What is it that determines its importance for us so that we take possession of the experience and make it knowledge for us? All of us have different preferences for different things and place their importance in a hierarchy. Many of you have demonstrated this hierarchy of importance by your course choices for your IB program of study. But clearly, your world of being a student is only one aspect of who you are. You are also a son or a daughter, a Canadian, a Chinese, an Indonesian, an American and so on. In your virtual worlds, you may inhabit or hide under other guises. Because you inhabit a variety of worlds, various direct experiences of the overall world itself will either draw your attention or be ignored by you. Your knowledge will be limited by which worlds have been given to you and by the worlds you have chosen. How deep your knowledge of those worlds will become is something for you to determine.\n3. \u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact \u201d (Arthur Conan Doyle). Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nThe quote from the writer of the Sherlock Holmes tales expresses a deeply disturbing thought and begs us to ask the question \u201cWhat is reality?\u201d. What, in fact, is a \u201cfact\u201d? That today is the 5th of June, 2021 (at the time of this writing) is a supposed fact. But here in Bali, the calendar is some 78 years behind our Western traditional Gregorian calendar. Both calendars are correct; they express facts but the facts are different because the interpretation of time is different. One calendar is based on the moon; the other is based on the sun. But both are based on the motion, movement of these celestial bodies.\nWhat is time? What is space? All of what we call \u201cfacts\u201d are determined by an interpretation of these two phenomenon for we need to place things in the concepts of time and space and make them stand fast so that they can be defined and their limits set: \u201chere and now\u201d, \u201cthere and then\u201d, \u201chere or there next week\u201d, etc. To make these determinations, we use \u201cunits\u201d, numbers. Time is composed of seconds or nano-seconds, something which is measurable and calculable and these units are uniform in themselves. Space is measured in centimetres, or other units of distance which are also uniform. We use these units of measurement in order to gain some control over time and space and the things that occur within them but in order to do so we must make time and space uniform first.\nWhen we speak about the possible \u201cdeception\u201d of facts, we are speaking about how a thing appears, how a thing comes to stand in its presence before us. In Physics, for instance, the difference between the classical physics of Aristotle and the modern physics of Newton is that what is actually apprehended as appearing and how it is interpreted are not the same. For Aristotle, nature is the change of something into something else. How a body moves, how it relates to its place (space) has its basis in the body or thing itself. The body moves according to its nature. An earthy body moves downward; a fiery body moves upward. Why? Because each body has its place according to its kind and moves towards that place. The motion of bodies occurs in a straight line and is incomplete. The motion of the stars and the heavens, however, is circular. Linear motion is incomplete; circular motion is complete and eternal. Thus Plato can say: \u201cTime is the moving image of eternity\u201d and we can construct our calendars according to the movements of the sun or moon.\nIn Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion, all natural bodies are of the same kind (mass) and celestial bodies are not superior ones. There is no priority of circular motion over linear motion. Linear motion is decisive. Every body can be in any place; place is no longer where the body belongs according to its nature but only a position in relation to other positions. Why the moon moves in a circular motion and not a linear motion is what must be accounted for. Newton\u2019s answer is gravity. With the experiments of Galileo in Pisa, both Galileo and his opponents saw the same \u201cfacts\u201d, but they interpreted those facts differently and made the same \u201cdirect experience\u201d visible to themselves in different ways. This viewing, as quantum physics shows us, impacts the how of the thing that is under observation comes to presence for us; our viewing has an impact on the thing. What Galileo thought in advance about motion was the determination that the motion of every body is uniform and rectilinear when every obstacle is eliminated from hindering it. Such an occurrence as a lack of hindering does not occur in \u201creality\u201d; it is not a \u201cfact\u201d. But the conclusions arrived at are: all bodies are alike; no motion is special; every place is like every other place; every moment is like every other moment; every force is calculable only by the change of motion it causes and results in change of place. Nature is everywhere uniform and becomes subject to a mathematical calculation that is itself uniform.\nIt is clear from the above example that the \u201cdeception\u201d regarding \u201cfacts\u201d lies in the viewing and how this viewing determines their interpretation and how they are and will be interpreted. There are no \u201calternative facts\u201d; there are only alternative interpretations of the facts that are given to us. When a USA senator states that the events of January 6, 2021 were not an insurrection but an ordinary day in the life of the American government, when he himself is shown cowering in fear when these \u201ctourists\u201d were attempting to storm the floor of the Senate, then we as sane people must reject this interpretation of the facts in light of the evidence given to us, and as \u201ctourists\u201d avoid putting a visit to the US Capital on our itineraries. In the Human Sciences, the use of statistical data is an area where \u201cdeception\u201d regarding facts comes to the fore. In political polls in the USA, it appears that reliability is an issue because many respondents are lying and their words and actions are not congruent. The world of social media is also one where deception, lies and fraud necessitate the condition of anonymity and a healthy skepticism with regard to the assertions made by other people in those various communities. This begs the further question: why is truth under such a great attack at the present time?\nFacts and their interpretations rely on their contexts and on the prevailing viewing that dominates the community where those facts and their interpretations predominate. This is what is meant by the word ethos. In our everyday worlds, we move about within an opinion of the way things are. We go along with the way that the world shows itself. We orientate ourselves to others that we are with within the world through holding opinions, but we demand from ourselves and from others evidence that the opinions that we and they hold are justified and true. Opinion motivates us to speak to each other and express an opinion, and it is in expressing these opinions that our humanity is revealed and it is this that distinguishes us from other animals.\n4. \u201cAreas of knowledge always rely on a systematic process of trial and error to aid the production of knowledge .\u201d Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nWhat is \u201cthe production of knowledge\u201d? Production is a \u201cshowing forth\u201d, a \u201cbringing forth into presence\u201d of some thing. In other blogs on this site, I have tried to show that this \u201cshowing\u201d and \u201cbringing forth\u201d is what the ancient Greeks referred to as \u201ctruth\u201d, aletheia. The \u201cprocess of production\u201d attempts to achieve \u201cperfection\u201d, a state of being complete and correct in every way. This bringing forth that attempts to achieve an end of completion and correctness results in a \u201cwork\u201d whether it be a work of art, a drama production, an experiment, an algorithm or app, an essay or an exhibition. Help with the \u201cproduction\u201d of this \u201cwork\u201d is probably why you are consulting this blog at the moment. You have a number of ideas, materials, and resources ready-to-hand that you will use to carry out this \u201cwork\u201d. If you are wise, you will use a process of trial and error (that is, drafts) to achieve a level of completeness and correctness that will bring the work to the highest degree of completeness and correctness of which you are capable.\nYou will notice, though, that prior to your going forward and proceeding to bring your work into view, you will already have an end in view, a purpose which will pre-determine how you will view the ideas, materials and resources that you will gather or have gathered in order to \u201csystematically\u201d bring this end about. This systematic process of trial and error is what has been called \u201ctechnology\u201d in the Optional Themes for TOK on this blog. (https://mytok.blog/2019/09/30/ot2-knowledge-and-technology/ ). It is the \u201cknowing\u201d (logos) and \u201cmaking\u201d (techne) that is grounded in the principle of reason that determines the methodology necessary to bring about the kind of end or work which you wish to bring about. The principle of reason (\u201cnothing is without (a) reason\u201d), particularly the principles of causation and contradiction, are the grounds of all those concepts that we can call \u201csystematic\u201d.\nThe title states areas of knowledge \u201calways rely on\u201d the systematic methodology of trial and error in order to produce knowledge. Of course, when we hear the words \u201calways rely on\u201d we are skeptical of the truth of the statements that contain them. We try to find exceptions to this \u201calways\u201d. Certainly, there is no problem in the Natural Sciences. They rely on the trial and error method of experimentation in order to prove their hypotheses, propositions and premises to be true. The discoveries and disclosures of the results will be handed over to others in the form of mathematical calculations. The experiments must be repeatable for others in order for the evidence shown to be seen and verified by others and demonstrated to be true. The experiment follows the viewing and the viewing determines how the experiment will be set up and what procedures will be followed.\nThe great revolutions in the Natural Sciences occur when a change of viewing occurs. From Plato and Aristotle to Galileo and Newton to Einstein and Heisenberg, it is the change of viewing in relation to the things that are which brings about a fundamental change in what human beings conceive themselves and knowledge to be. Charles Darwin\u2019s viewing of the priority of modification and natural selection brought about a great upheaval in how human beings viewed themselves and the other species surrounding them in the natural world. These changes of viewing the world were the result of a prior \u201csystematic process of trial and error\u201d in order to account for the things as they were beheld by these great scientists. From the viewing of these great scientists, vast amounts of knowledge have been produced by others.\nIn the Arts in most cases, there is a \u201csystematic process of trial and error\u201d that the artist goes through in order to bring forth the work that she has in mind in all of its completeness and correctness. Many artists are not satisfied with their work once it is finished because it lacks this completeness and correctness that they originally envisioned in their minds when the work is finally brought forth. If you \u201cwork out\u201d in the weight room or on the practice pitch, on the basketball court or in rehearsals for the school drama production, you are constantly going through a process of trial and error in order to develop your knowledge and skills in order to bring your body to its highest level of perfection that you are capable of in order to bring about the end that you have in view so that this end can be the best that it can be.\nIn terms of looking for an exception to the \u201calways rely on\u201d in the Arts, we might look to the example of Mozart and his music. Mozart claimed that he received his music \u201call in one look\u201d, complete, correct and perfect. His manuscripts which have come down to us show no corrections or edits, which is a remarkable achievement. His \u201cviewing\u201d allowed him to compose the overture for the opera Don Giovanni in one night at one sitting, or so we are told. In considering this example of Mozart, we might want to reflect on and consider the manner in which we view the world. Mozart\u2019s viewing is a \u201creceptive\u201d viewing by an individual of eminent knowledge and skill. Its reception requires an acceptance of what is received, the gift given. His only freedom is to choose to accept or reject the gift. Many artists claim that their art does not come from them but is given to them. In their works, they are \u201cmakers\u201d, not creators. The creating belongs elsewhere.\n5. \u201cIf all knowledg e is provisional, when can we have confidence in what we claim to know?\u201d Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nWhy and when is all knowledge considered provisional? Or is it? The word \u201cif\u201d is a subordinate conjunction in English grammar. A subordinate conjunction is an incomplete thought and the use of the clause \u201cif all knowledge is provisional\u201d indicates that the clause is dependent and provides further information to add to the sentence\u2019s main idea \u201cconfidence in what we claim to know\u201d, signaling a cause-and-effect relationship (\u201cif\u2026then\u201d) or a shift in time and place (\u201cif\u2026when\u201d) between the two clauses. That all knowledge should be considered provisional and conditional creates a disturbing situation for our understanding of our being-in-the-world which would be made clearer by our changing the subordinator \u201cif\u201d to \u201cwhen\u201d so that the dependent clause becomes \u201cwhen all knowledge is considered provisional\u201d. When all knowledge is considered provisional, what then? So an appropriate response to this title will consider the if and the when in its response. Is all knowledge provisional? Is reason provisional? If so, then when did this occur and why did it occur? What becomes of our \u201cconfidence\u201d in such \u201cknowledge\u201d and from where does this confidence arise? Certainly, the current attack on truth founds itself upon the \u201cprovisionality\u201d of what we think knowledge to be.\nKnowledge is sometimes considered provisional because it is part of a whole and we cannot gain knowledge of the whole because we ourselves are part of it. The word \u201cprovisional\u201d arrives into the English language around the 1600s. This was around the same time as the new discoveries in the modern sciences by Galileo and Newton, and in the philosophy of the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz is considered to be the creator of finite calculus in mathematics and what is known as the modern insurance industry. Why are these two creations of Leibniz not co-incidental but related in their grounds?\nThe word \u201cprovisional\u201d comes from the\u00a0Latin root provisionem, \u201ca foreseeing, foresight, preparation, or prevention.\u201d Our modern viewing of the world is a mathematical projection of that world (algebraic calculation) developed from a plan initiated beforehand to commandeer and control the objects of the world (by understanding the cause-effect relations of objects and their forces) and to overcome any contingencies that would hinder that domination and control. This mathematical projection is what is known as transcendentalism. It is the projection of human thought over and beyond the objects of the world so that the thought creates the object and \u201cknows\u201d it. We know more about the things we make than those that we do not make. The human mind makes the object. (Kant) Or as the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum physics, said: \u201cWhat we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning. \u00a0Our scientific work in physics consists in asking questions about nature in the language that we possess and trying to get an answer from experiment by the means that are at our disposal.\u201d The development of the plan or system (which is mathematical in nature) helps us to maintain \u201cconfidence\u201d in what we feel we can claim to know.  We can see here the connection between the creation of finite calculus and the creation of the insurance industry. Insurance is the foreseeing and preparation in case of contingencies and allows one to have \u201cconfidence\u201d in their willing and actions in the world.\nIn modern Physics, for example, we know that there is a gap between the macro-physics of Newton and the sub-atomic physics of relativity and quantum physics. The discoveries of sub-atomic physics overturn the findings of Newtonian physics yet we know that they both operate on the micro and macro levels. We see the principles of quantum physics explain the behaviours of celestial bodies within the vastness of the galaxies and their movements through space in astrophysics, and we see the operation of the principles of Newtonian physics in every waking moment of our lives. At the moment, we are unable to determine where these two views of the world meet so that their truths will illuminate and not contradict each other.\nTitles #5 and #6 are really the same. From certainty comes confidence and while we may rarely be certain from a theoretical perspective and view our theoretical knowledge \u201cprovisionally\u201d, we act with surety and confidence from a common sense perspective. In our day-to-day lives we could not act and plan without some sort of confidence in our knowledge that the sun will come up tomorrow. We know how to get to school, to find our classrooms, to find our way to the library or the gymnasium. We know these things because we are able to distinguish between things, and we can distinguish between them because we already have knowledge of them beforehand.\nAs we have been discussing in the other titles here, the modern view of knowledge is that it is dependent upon the social and historical contexts in which it appears or occurs. Such a view is known as historicism. The word \u201cprovisional\u201d indicates that social and historical contexts change. The type of knowledge that we are speaking about here is dependent upon the manner of the \u201cvision\u201d or seeing that is prevalent at the time and is subject to change due to various contingencies or chance. The if of the \u201cif all knowledge\u2026\u201d is a very big \u201cif\u201d indeed. The position taken in the quote is that all knowledge is provisional and therefore disposable. What are the grounds of such disposable knowledge so that it may be called knowledge in the first place? Is not the statement nothing more than nihilism when the if becomes when and do we not already act as if the if were when? Is not such action, in many cases, irrational?\n6. \u201cWe are rarely completely certain, but we are frequently certain enough .\u201d Discuss this statement with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nFrom where does the desire and need for \u201ccertainty\u201d arise and at what type of knowledge is it directed? We need to go back to the 16th century to find some background; and then, we need to make a few observations of what, where and when \u201cwe are frequently certain enough\u201d.\nThe desire for \u201ccertainty\u201d arises from two main sources in Western historical and philosophical thinking: 1. the need to ground the mathematical project which was briefly discussed in title #5; and 2. the Christian dogma and doctrine prevalent before and during the 1600s that required the certainty and security of the individual\u2019s salvation. How Protestant Christianity came to accept the account of Nature that was given in the new natural sciences resulted in that phenomenon that we call humanism where human beings are seen as the centre of the world that was seen as a created thing. The new sciences exalted \u201cfreedom\u201d and it was in their freedom that human beings  would find the certainty of their salvation.\nThe first thinker to address the problem of certainty in depth was the French philosopher Rene Descartes whose answers to the questions he posed resulted in the beginning of what is called modern philosophy. Descartes began by doubting everything. Descartes does not doubt because he is a skeptic; he doubts because he posits the mathematical project as the ground of all knowledge and seeks for a foundation that will be in agreement with it. This foundation turns out to be the reason expressed in the axioms and principles of mathematical calculation itself. Cogito ergo sum: \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d. For Descartes, thinking and reason are the same and constitute the very being of a human being. The \u201cI think\u201d of Descartes becomes the ground upon which all certainty and truth becomes based. Descartes inverts the traditional subjectum or what the classical thinkers saw the things in the world to be (a subject with predicates: a book that is green, heavy, on the table, a new book, etc.) into a special subject and so arose the subject/object distinction of Cartesianism. Historically, we call this period The Age of Reason and from this age we proceed to The Age of Enlightenment. These Ages culminate in The Modern Age. In our Age, the only knowledge that deserves to be called knowledge is that achieved through algebraic or mathematical calculation.\nIn our common sense world of day-to-day activities, this reason also operates. When we deny the facts of reason and the reality that is revealed through the use of reason, we become less than what we truly are as human beings. The European Holocaust, the genocide conducted by the Khmer Rouge, and the endless list of many other human atrocities throughout history were first preceded by a loss of faith and trust in reason and the disappearance of the recognition of the otherness of human beings. As Plato showed, the disappearance of Otherness leads to political tyranny. Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth is the best example we have of this in the English language.\nAs was mentioned, this title is really the same as title #5. When we cross San Francisco Bay, we cannot be certain that an earthquake of sufficient size to take down the bridge will not occur as we are doing so, yet we are certain enough that we proceed to do so. We all know that accidents can happen and we try to minimize our risks against them. If we are wise, we look both ways before we cross the street. We could not live if we did not do so. Those who are motivated to take risks usually do so because they find their lives too secure and boring to begin with and the element of risk makes them feel more alive. What is being said about human being here?\nIn reflecting on this question and referring it to the areas of knowledge, you should first discuss the type of knowledge that you are dealing with and the specific examples from the areas of knowledge that address the question.\nShare this:\nLoading...\nOT 2: Knowledge, Language and\u00a0Technology\nKnowledge and Language\n\u201cNow I am tempted to say that the right expression in language for the miracle of the existence of the world, though it is not any proposition in language, is the existence of language itself.\u201d\u2014Wittgenstein\n\u201cLanguage is the house of Being. In its home humans dwell.\u201d\u2014Heidegger \u201cLetter on Humanism\u201d\n\u201c\u2018En arche \u2018en \u2018o Logos\u201d (\u201cIn the beginning was the Word\u201d)\u2014 John 1:1\n\u201c\u2026we ourselves no longer have the power to trust that the word is the essential foundation of all relations to beings as such.\u201d\u2014Heidegger: \u201cAristotle\u2019s Physics\u201d\nLanguage is probably the most important theme of 20 th century philosophy and will be of the philosophy that moves into the 21 st century. Why this has come to be the case will be the outline of these writings on language and its relation to what we think knowledge is.\nThe very essence of what we are as human beings, our ontology, our being-in-the-world is contained in our language and in our relation to and understanding of language. To understand language is to contrast instruction with teaching; and to do so is to recognize that the teaching in TOK is to be characterized as \u201cuseless\u201d and it must be \u201cuseless\u201d in order to allow true learning and teaching to happen.\u00a0 To reflect on the issue of \u201cuselessness\u201d and \u201cusefulness\u201d is to connect these seemingly\u00a0 irrelevant themes to the status of education in our modern technological age and what we think education is today. \u00a0In order to begin this reflection, we must think upon language and rethink language.\nThe rethinking of language takes place from and within the rethinking of technology. The relation between technology and language is crucial for a rethinking of language in our modern technological age. It is therefore necessary to talk about the technological language, which defines \u201ca language that is technologically determined by what is most peculiar to technology,\u201d that is, by framing (or \u201cpositioning\u201d or enframing). It is imperative that we ask what is language and in what special way it remains exposed to the dictates of technology. Such imperatives to our thinking about language are only met in the rethinking of the current conception of language that we might characterize in the following way:\nToday we think speech is: (1) a faculty, an activity and achievement of humans. It is: (2) the operation of the instruments for communication and hearing. Speech is: (3) the expression and communication of emotions accompanied by thoughts (dispositions) in the service of \u201cinformation\u201d. Speech is: (4) a representing and portraying (picturing, the making of pictures) of the real and unreal. Because human beings live within societies necessitates that they have language of some kind.\nThe traditional metaphysical connection of subject \u201cthe things\u201d + predicate \u201cthe qualities of the things\u201d, the categories, between language and thinking that we have seen in our discussions of Reason defines language in terms of thinking. Thinking is the human activity of representing objects in this view, and thus language has been seen as a means for conveying information about objects. \u201cIn-form-ation\u201d results from our providing a \u201cform\u201d in order to \u201cinform\u201d regarding what we call \u201cdata\u201d. This provision of a form is what we call \u201cclassification\u201d, a providing of definitions or the limits and horizons of things. Traditional metaphysics places thinking as \u201creason\u201d (reason, \u201clogic\u201d which has its root in \u201c logos\u201d which in Greek is \u201clanguage\u201d, \u201cspeech\u201d) as the determining factor (the \u201c-ation\u201d or \u201c atia\u201d in Greek,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cthat which is responsible for\u201d) in the relation between language and thinking. Reason provides the \u201cform\u201d in a calculative way so that the data (the content) can be structured so that it may \u201cinform\u201d. This is shown in our current conception of language as an \u201c instrument of expression\u201d in the \u201cservice of thinking\u201d. The common view believes that thought uses language merely as its \u201cmedium\u201d or a means of expression, an instrument. Thought is seen as logic, reason in this view.\nWe assume that language is a tool used by human beings to communicate information. We think that the same fact can be expressed in many different languages. We think a competent speaker is in control of language and can use it efficiently to convey data to his/her audience. In the quest for efficiency in communication, we have devised artificial languages that give us more control over language. Symbolic logic, computer programming languages, and the technical languages of the sciences are set up as systems in which each sign can be interpreted in only one way. Each sign points clearly to what it represents so that the sign itself becomes completely unobtrusive. The perfect language in this view is a technique for perfect representation. We have discovered that language in algebraic calculation.\nMartin Heidegger\nThere are two major schools of thought on language and its relation to knowledge: the \u201cstructuralist\u201d or \u201canalytical\u201d school which has been described up to now, and the \u201ccontinental\u201d school. The \u201ccontinental\u201d school\u2019s foremost representative is Martin Heidegger: \u201cLanguage is the house of being. In its home humans dwell\u201d is a quote that captures Heidegger\u2019s understanding of language. But what does the quote mean? How is language a \u201chouse\u201d and how through its use does it create a \u201chome\u201d?\nThe conception of language as a mere means of exchange of information undergoes an extreme transformation in our modern technological age that is expressed in the definition of language as \u201cinformation\u201d. The analytic school of thought on language offers a prime example of a \u201cmetaphysical-technological explanation\u201d of language stemming from the \u201ccalculative frame of mind.\u201d This view believes that thinking and speaking are \u201cexhausted by theoretical and natural-scientific representation and statements,\u201d and that they \u201crefer to objects and only to objects.\u201d Language, as a tool of \u201cscientific-technological knowing\u201d\u2013which \u201cmust establish its theme (thesis, theory) in advance as a calculable, causally explicable framework\u201d\u2013 is \u201conly an instrument that we employ to manipulate objects.\u201d We refer to this as an algorithm: the world is looked upon as a calculable, causal framework that gives us a problem that must be solved.\nThink of this in terms of our computers and our other tools of \u201cinformation technology\u201d, particularly the speed reading technologies and applications that are becoming available: the principle of reason must establish the \u201cframe\u201d or \u201cposition\u201d in advance so that data can be controlled through calculation in order to inform. This frame transforms the manner in which things are approached.\nHeidegger notes the influence and understanding of language by analytic philosophy in our modern technological age in the following way:\nOf late, the scientific and philosophical investigation of languages is aiming more resolutely at the production of what is called \u201cmetalanguage.\u201d Analytic philosophy, which is set on producing this super-language, is quite consistent when it considers itself metalinguistics. That sounds like metaphysics -not only sounds like it, it is metaphysics. Metalinguistics is the thoroughgoing technicalization of all languages into the sole operative instrument of interplanetary information. Metalanguage and sputnik, metalinguistics and rocketry are the Same.\nHeidegger is speaking this in the late 1950s, but the connection to today\u2019s information technology illustrates the truth of his statement. Given the logical bent of analytical philosophy, the modern mathematical and symbolic logic or \u201cLogistik\u201d is metaphysics. Logistics was, for Heidegger, the \u201cunbroken rule of metaphysics\u201d establishing itself everywhere; and modern epistemology (\u201ctheories of knowledge\u201d) acquire a \u201cdecisive position of dominance.\u201d \u00a0It was a matter of grave concern for Heidegger to see that logistics was being considered everywhere \u201cthe only possible form of strict philosophy\u201d on the grounds that its procedures and results are deemed productive for what he called \u201cthe construction of the technological universe.\u201d (Have a look at the etymological roots of \u201clogistics\u201d on dictionary.com). This must be thought about in relation to what we understand as \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d or AI: how does or will our understanding of what reason and language are determine the nature of what is called \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d and of the machines that will use it? In the age of cybernetics, human beings will be the materials that will be ordered and disposed of i.e. human resources, human capital.\nHeidegger\u2019s negative characterizations of logistics abound: It is a \u201clogical degeneration\u201d of traditional categorical logic of Aristotle, and its development is a sign of the \u201cdecay of philosophy,\u201d an indication of its \u201cdissolution\u201d and \u201ccompletion.\u201d At another point, Heidegger states: \u201c Technique is the metaphysic of the age.\u201d\nLanguage and Concepts:\nHow does language determine what we call our \u201ckey concepts\u201d, the manner in which we are to approach what we call knowledge? If we think about what we call \u201cdead\u201d languages for a moment, we will notice that they are called \u201cdead\u201d because they are no longer subject to changes in meaning. Any \u201cliving\u201d language will have changes in meaning and interpretation according to the historical time in which it occurs. As the poet T. S. Eliot wrote:\n\u201cWords strain,\nCrack and sometimes break, under the burden,\nUnder the tension, slip, slide, perish,\nDecay with imprecision, will not stay in place,\nWill not stay still.\u201d\nOur modern attempts to fixate language into an unambiguous tool for communicating information and representing beings/things illustrates our desire to fulfill the revealing of truth as representation, to follow the correspondence theory of truth and the principle of reason. There is \u201ctruth\u201d (according to Heidegger), but how we understand what this truth is is relative to the historical situation in which it occurs; it is not a \u201csubjective\u201d truth, but a communal truth: that is, it is not based on personal knowledge but is the knowledge that we all share. In our current situation, this is the global \u201crevealing\u201d through technology and this revealing drives us to realize the \u201cglobal village\u201d or \u201cinternationalism\u201d along with what we call \u201cinternational mindedness\u201d. The \u201csystem\u201d which results from the \u201cframing\u201d that is the technological requires no individual thinker or thinking. In science, time and place are not important and scientists from disparate locations can carry out their work with the certainty that their \u201caccounts\u201d will be correct when properly following the method established within the framing. This is because the language which they use is fixated.\nIf Heidegger is correct, the same fact cannot be expressed in many different languages because beings and \u201cinformation\u201d present themselves differently according to different cultural contexts. The quest for a universal, unambiguous language can only succeed in creating stillborn languages. These languages are locked into a particular interpretation of the world and the things in it (representational revealing) and are incapable of responding creatively to new experiences. Artificial languages (and one might say artificial intelligence since it will be based on these languages) are not more \u201cobjective\u201d than natural languages\u2014they are just narrower and more rigid because their goal is certainty and efficiency.\nLanguage cannot be merely a tool that we use because we can control it: we owe our own Human Being to language. For the Greeks, we are the zoon logon echon, the animal capable of speech, language. Language is fundamental to our revelation of the world; it is an essential part of what enables us to be someone, to be a human being and notice things in the world in the first place. Language has the power to reveal our world and transform our existence. But the lucid and creative moments are few both in individuals and in societies; the rest is inauthentic and derivative. Every day \u201cidle talk\u201d is a pale, dull reflection of the \u201ccreative meanings\u201d that are first revealed and achieved in poetry.\nLanguage as Representation:\nWhere does the understanding of language as representation come from? As the \u201cdoctrine of the logos\u201d in Aristotle is interpreted as assertion or statement, logic is the doctrine of thinking and the science of statement (or the making of statements\u2014propositions, the creation of \u201cpictures\u201d), that is, logic (the principle of reason) provides the authoritative interpretations of thinking and speaking that rule throughout the technological. More specifically, logistics has as its basis the modern interpretation of the statement or assertion as the \u201cconnection of representations\u201d (the correspondence and coherence theories of truth).\u00a0 It is in this sense that Heidegger regards it as another manifestation of the \u201cunchecked power of modern thinking\u201d itself.\u00a0 Heidegger depicts the connections between logic and modern technology in very dramatic tones:\nWithout the legein (the saying) of [Western] logic, modern man would have to make do without his automobile. There would be no airplanes, no turbines, no Atomic Energy Commission. Without the logos, of logic, the world would look different.\nThe general form of modern metaphysical thinking is thus a \u201cscientific-technological manner of thinking.\u201d This thinking, this world-picture, threatens to \u201cspread to all realms\u201d thereby magnifying the \u201cdeceptive appearance which makes all thinking and speaking seem objectifying.\u201d This thinking and speaking finds its full realization in algebraic calculation. It is this form of objectifying thinking that strives to \u201crepresent everything henceforth only technologically-scientifically as an object of possible control and manipulation.\u201d With it, language itself takes a corresponding form: it becomes \u201cdeformed into an instrument of reportage and calculable information\u201d. However, while the form that language takes is thus instrumental, in such a form of thinking, language itself exerts its own influence insofar as it is \u201ctreated like a manipulable object to which our manner of thinking must conform.\u201d Language itself allows itself to be treated in such a way. Language and reason are, in the end, inseparable. They allow themselves to create our box, what we call our \u201cmindset\u201d.\nThe traditional metaphysical manner of thinking in our age is a \u201cone-track thinking,\u201d (in Heidegger\u2019s words) and this \u2018one track\u2019 can be understood and associated with technology.\u00a0 It is a \u201cone-sided thinking\u201d that tends towards a \u201cone-sided uniform view\u201d in which \u201c[everything] is leveled to one level,\u201d and \u201c[our] minds hold views on all and everything, and view all things in the same way.\u201d Our manner of thinking is the box. (*A link can be made to the uniformity of our understanding of number and its correspondence to Newton\u2019s view of the uniformity of matter in the AOKs Mathematics and Natural Sciences.)\nThere is a kind of language that, as the expression of this form of thinking, is itself one-tracked and one-sided. One \u201csymptom\u201d of the growing power of the technological form of thinking is in our increased use of designations consisting of abbreviations of words or combinations of their initials. Our text messaging and our love of acronyms is a technological form of language in the sense that these herald the ordering in which everything is reduced to the univocity of concepts and precise specifications. This reduction and ordering also leads us to view all activities we engage in to be leveled to one level: the student who is asked to create a work of art either in words or other media, sees their activity as nothing more than their being in a shopping mall or at a supermarket. The activity ceases to have any priority in importance. In this view, \u201cspeed reading\u201d will come to flourish since we cannot learn from texts anything other than \u201cinformation\u201d and this learning must be done as \u201cefficiently\u201d as possible.\nSuch interpretations are the \u201ctechnological\u201d; they are a given only \u201cinsofar as technology is itself understood as a means and everything is conceived only according to this respect (technology understood as \u201ctools\u201d).\u201d If our way of thinking is one that values only that which is immediately useful, then language is only conceived and appreciated from this perspective of its usefulness for us. More importantly, this suggests it is the essence of technology as framing that somehow determines the \u201ctransformation of language into mere information.\u201d We refer to this framing\u00a0of information as \u201cthe box\u201d that inhibits our thinking.\nIf the essence of modern technology is framing, then there is also a \u201clanguage of framing.\u201d [All] ordering finds itself channeled into calculative thinking and therefore speaks the language of framing. Speaking is challenged to correspond in every respect to framing in which all present beings can be commandeered. \u2013Heidegger\nIt is within framing (the \u201cform\u201d, the \u201cposition\u201d), then, that \u201cspeaking turns into information.\u201d We can look at the computer as one manner in which modern technology controls the mode and the world of language as such.\u00a0 We can infer that the computer is one crucial way in which this language of framing speaks.\n\u201cTo compute\u201d, obviously, means to calculate. With the construction of artificial intelligence, calculating, thinking and translating machines, speed reading applications, the computer is made possible insofar as its activities take place in the element of language and are made possible by the element of language. The term \u201ccomputer\u201d should not be taken as merely talking about calculators and computers. Machine technology itself is \u201cthe most visible outgrowth of the essence of modern technology\u201d (Heidegger) and that ours is the age of the machine (and the Age of Information) is due to the fact that it is the technological age, and not vice versa.\u00a0 More importantly, framing (the form) itself is not anything technological in the sense of mechanical parts and their assembly. In TOK we wish to explore our \u201ckey concepts\u201d and language within a knowledge framework, a system. Thus, the language of framing cannot itself be reduced to anything technological in this narrow sense. The computer and other informational tools intrude by regulating and adjusting through its hardware and software and their functions how we can and do use language. Think of our smart phones and other assemblages that are linked to our computers and the manner of their linkages and how they assemble information and how this information must be assembled if it is to be communicated.\nIf there is a transformation of language in the computer that speaks the language of framing, then the question is what is the essence of language itself that it allows for its transformation into a technological language, into information? The essence of language is defined from the essence of language: It is a Saying that shows, in the sense of letting-appear. The possibility of a technological language lies here, for it is itself a Saying-Showing that is limited to the mere making of signs for the communication of information. Let us now examine some of the historical background for this development of language.\nHistorical Background\nSt. Augustine in his autobiography Confessions gives us the common understanding of how language comes about:\nWhen they [my elders] named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out.\u00a0 Their intention was shown by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something.\u00a0 Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires. (Augustine, Confessions, I. 8)\nHere, Augustine speaks of language as \u201csigns\u201d.\u00a0 They are a \u201cpointing out\u201d, a \u201cdirecting of the gaze or glance\u201d and from them, the thing that is pointed out comes to stand for us as what it is in the saying so given and becomes \u201cgrasped\u201d or \u201ccaptured\u201d by us. But notice that in Augustine\u2019s description there are a number of steps involved in the \u201cgrasping\u201d of the thing that is \u201cpointed out\u201d. First there is the pointing, then there is the bodily movement, then there is the sound uttered, then there is the notice of the \u201cdisposition\u201d made when the sound is uttered, and all of this occurs within a social context; there is the \u201cdialogue\u201d. From this follows the \u201cgrammatical\u201d structure of language, \u201cthe placing of the signs in their proper places in various sentences\u201d which allows one to \u201cexpress their own desires\u201d.\nAugustine is speaking of language as \u201crepresentational\u201d: the picture created is a word or a sign that stands for or represents a thing by virtue of that word or sign\u2019s meaning. Each word means just one thing, and it does so by virtue of a meaning that we can think of or understand.\u00a0 Language is, then, the communication of meanings from one person to another in the package of a sign: to communicate with you, I \u201cframe\u201d my intended meaning within the appropriate sign, and then give you the sign in speech or writing, whereupon you \u201cdecode\u201d (interpret) it again, supplying the meaning for the sign I have given from within the same frame.\u00a0 To speak language, then, is to imbue dead signs with life, to breathe air into the otherwise mute forms of signs. Language is thought of as the breath of life animating lifeless form; language is the soul of meaning infusing and animating the bodies of signs. Hence Aristotle discusses language as the \u201cshowing\u201d of the soul\u2019s \u201cdispositions\u201d:\nNow, whatever it is [that transpires] in the creation of sound by the voice is a showing of whatever dispositions there may be in the soul, and the written is a showing of the sounds of the voice.\u00a0 Hence, just as writing is not identical among all [human beings], so too the sounds of the voice are not identical.\u00a0 However, that of which these [sounds and writing] are in the first place a showing are among all [human beings] the identical dispositions of the soul; and the matters of which these [dispositions] form approximating presentations (pictures) are likewise identical.\nAristotle construes language as a kind of showing (in pictures), but taken in the view of the history of Western metaphysics, Aristotle\u2019s pictures imply that language is a mere instrument (tool) for the expression of inner intentions or thoughts (dispositions).\u00a0 Within the tradition of Western thinking, this picture will imply that the relationship between signs and the thoughts they express is purely arbitrary, or to use the term favored by logical positivist philosophers, \u201cconventional\u201d; language is a system of arbitrary correlations (conventions) of signs to common meanings. Notice, though, that Aristotle insists that the \u201cdispositions\u201d themselves are the identical common meanings.\nIt is important to note here that Plato wrote \u201cdialogues\u201d; Aristotle wrote treatises. If one reads Plato\u2019s dialogues in the same manner as one reads an Aristotelian treatise, one will fail to understand the dialogue. This reading of Plato in the same manner that we read Aristotle is one of the fates that have befallen us within the English-speaking community. British and American thinkers of previous generations read Plato as if they were reading a treatise of Aristotle and by this, failed to understand the dialogue of Plato that they were reading.\nThe traditional picture of language found in Augustine, Aristotle, and the logical positivists, also has deep connections with the metaphysics of \u201csubjectivity\u201d (Descartes, Kant).\u00a0 In this traditional picture, the sign stands for an object (subjectum ), but it is also the sign for a concept or image in the speaker\u2019s mind (the frame), an abstraction.\u00a0 The concept, or mental image, is a representation in the speaker\u2019s mind or brain.\u00a0 Even though we can exchange signs in communication, we can never be sure, in the traditional picture, that we are successful in communicating the mental representations, concepts, or images that go with them (the predicates).\u00a0 The connection between a particular sign and the mental image that it evokes is the connection (or lack thereof) between something public and communicable, and something essentially private and incommunicable. Mathematics as \u201csymbolic language\u201d or \u201csigns\u201d overcomes this sense of arbitrariness in the public realm and is one of the reasons for its dominance in the realm of what can be called \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nHow can we rethink language and meaning, outside the traditional picture, in a way that reveals its essence as a showing (aletheia), rather than portraying it as a conventional correlation of signs to meanings, a mere instrument for the expression and communication of thoughts and dispositions?\u00a0 To rethink the essence of language, we must attempt to \u201cbring language as language to language.\u201d\u00a0 But how is this to be done?\nTo recapitulate: in the traditional view, language turns out to be \u201cthe eternally self-repeating labor of spirit to make articulated sound capable of being an expression of thought.\u201d Language is what humans do to make sound able to express thought: it is the infusion of articulated sound with the spirit of meaning or intention.\u00a0 It is an action. This way of \u201cbringing language to language,\u201d this labor of the spirit, the infusing of sound with meaning, has been the intellectual development of mankind.\u00a0 But because it construes language as a human doing, as a labor of soul upon body, this traditional way of thinking of language remains trapped within the metaphysics of our age and fails to reveal the essence of language. According to Heidegger: \u201c[this] way to language goes in the direction of man, passing though language on its way to something else: the demonstration and depiction of the intellectual development of the human race.\u201d Heidegger continues:\n\u201cHowever, the essence of language conceived in terms of such a view does not of itself show language in its essence: it does not show the way in which language essentially unfolds as language; that is, the way it comes to stand; that is, the way it remains gathered in what it grants itself on its own as language.\u201d\nTo determine what language is, we need to determine what pertains to language as language.\nWe list what pertains to language in order to understand what is essential to language, what is at the root of everything that happens in, and through, language.\u00a0 One of the things that pertains to language as language is the speaker.\u00a0 \u201cTo speech belong the speakers.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 In speaking, we presence things; we make present the objects of our concern and our common interest by \u201cpointing them out\u201d. Think of this in relation to your Exhibition.\n\u201cIn speech, the speakers have their presencing.\u00a0 Where to?\u00a0 Presencing to the wherewithal (purpose) of their speech, to that by which they linger (the \u201cthings\u201d that are present-at-hand), that which in any given situation already matters to them.\u00a0 Which is to say, their fellow human beings and the things, each in its own way; everything that makes a thing a thing and everything that sets the tone for our relations with our fellows.\u00a0 All this is referred to, always and everywhere, sometimes in one way, at other times in another.\u201d (Heidegger \u201cThe Way to Language\u201d).\nWhat else belongs to the essence of language?\u00a0 We can run through the things that belong to language \u2013 the speaker, what is spoken, also the unspoken \u2013 but we do not thereby think their unity.\u00a0 Their unity, the unity of the essence of language, remains hidden to us. What we are saying here becomes obvious, though hardly pondered in its full scope, when we indicate the following.\u00a0 To speak to one another means to say something to one another; it implies a mutual showing of something, each person in turn devoting himself or herself to what is shown.\u00a0 To speak with one another means that together we say something about something, showing one another the sorts of things that are suggested by what is addressed in our discussion, showing one another what it is that is addressed allows the addressed to radiate of itself.\u201d To speak, then, is not to talk to someone else; it is to participate in the \u201csaying\u201d (logos) that is a showing.\nThis \u201cshowing\u201d, according to Heidegger, is older and more essential than the definition of language as a system of signs. \u201cWhat unfolds essentially in language is saying as pointing.\u00a0 Its showing does not culminate in a system of signs.\u00a0 Rather, all signs arise from a showing in whose realm and for whose purposes they can be signs.\u201d This showing (aletheia) is not simply something that we do, but a self-showing of that which shows (a revealing of what we are as human beings), a manifesting in which language itself speaks.\u00a0 When we think of language as this self-showing, we can begin to understand it as something to which we ourselves belong and with which we ourselves may come into a more or less direct relationship:\n\u201cIf speech as listening to language lets itself be told the saying, such letting can be given only insofar \u2013 and so near \u2013 as our own essence is granted entry into the saying.\u00a0 We hear it only because we belong to it.\u00a0 However, the saying grants those who belong to it their listening to language and hence their speech.\u00a0 Such granting comes-to-stand in the saying; it lets us attain the capacity of speech.\u00a0 What unfolds essentially in language depends on the saying that grants in this way.\u201d (Heidegger \u201cThe Way to Language\u201d).\nWhen we think language essentially, as a self-manifesting showing that points, we are well on the way to bringing language as language to language. We experience language, then, as a possibility or a granting, an essence that allows manifestation (aletheia), rather than as something we do, make, or control. Thus, language as the saying (legein, logos) holds its own in the realm of truth. Think of this from your own experiences of when you are in a country in which you have no knowledge of the language. How does the experience of language show itself?\nIn a world in which language and speaking has become the mere exchange of information,\n\u201cthe framing\u2026sets upon human beings \u2013 that is, challenges them \u2013 to order everything that comes to presence into a technical inventory (standing reserve, resources or \u201cdisposable\u201d), [and] unfolds essentially after the manner of appropriation (a \u201cgrasping\u201d and an \u201cowning\u201d); at the same time, it distorts appropriation, inasmuch as all ordering sees itself committed to calculative thinking and so speaks the language of framing.\u00a0 Speech is challenged to correspond to the ubiquitous orderability of what is present.\u00a0 Speech, when posed in this fashion, becomes information.\u201d (Heidegger \u201cThe Way to Language).\nAll that remains of language in information is \u201cthe abstract form of writing that is transcribed into the formulae of a logic calculus\u201d whose clarity \u201censures the possibility of a secure and rapid communication\u201d (our text messaging and our public discourse as media bytes). The principles transforming language are technological-calculative. It is from the technological possibilities of the computer that the instruction (command) is set out as to how language can and shall still be language. Such instruction (command) spells out the absolute and overriding need for the clarity of signs and their sequences; the algorithm dominates. The fact that the computer\u2019s structure conforms to linguistic tasks such as translating (i.e. whether the command/instruction is in Chinese or English does not matter) does not mean that the reverse holds true. For these commands are \u201cin advance and fundamentally bound up\u201d with the computer. With the \u201cinexorability of the limitless reign\u201d of technology, the insatiable technological demand for a technological language, its power increases to the point that the technological language comes to threaten the very essence of language as Saying-Showing. It is \u201cthe severest and most menacing attack on what is peculiar to language,\u201d for language is \u201catrophied\u201d into the mere transmission of signals, according to Heidegger.\nMoreover, when information (in the form of command) is held as highest form of language on account of its univocity, certainty and speed, then, we have a \u201ccorresponding conception\u201d of the human being and of human life. Norbert Wiener, a founder of Cybernetics, said that language \u201cis not an exclusive attribute of man but is one he may share to a certain degree with the machines he has constructed.\u201d \u00a0This view is itself possible only when we presuppose that language is merely a means of information. This understanding of language as information represents, at the same time, a \u201cthreat to the human being\u2019s ownmost essence.\u201d (Heidegger) The fact that language is interpreted and used as an instrument has lead us into believing that we are the masters of the computer, but the truth of the matter might well be that the computer takes language into its management and masters the essence of the human being creating a fundamental change in human ontology (human being-there-in-the-world).\nThese assessments of the metaphysical-technological interpretation and form of language are indisputably critical. Why? What is at stake? Why should this be important for us?\nThe gripping, mastering effect technological language has over our very essence as human beings (ontology) makes \u201cthe step back out of metaphysics difficult.\u201d (Heidegger) Language itself \u201cdenies us its essence\u201d and instead \u201csurrenders itself\u201d to us as our \u201cinstrument of domination over beings.\u201d (Heidegger) It is extremely difficult for us in the modern age to even understand a non-instrumental concept of language. The interpretation and form of \u201clanguage as information\u201d and of \u201cinformation as language\u201d is, in this sense, a circle determined by language and in language, within \u201cthe web of language.\u201d (Heidegger) Hence, Heidegger has referred to language as \u201cthe danger of all dangers\u201d that \u201cnecessarily conceals in itself a continual danger for itself.\u201d \u00a0In fact, \u201cwe are the stakes\u201d in the \u201cdangerous game and gamble\u201d that the essence of language plays with us.\nShare this:\nFacebook\nLoading...\nCT 1: Basic\u00a0Concepts\nTheory of Knowledge: Key Concepts:\n\u201cThe following 12 concepts have particular prominence within, and thread throughout, the TOK course:\nevidence, certainty, truth, interpretation, power, justification, explanation, objectivity, perspective,\nculture, values and responsibility. Exploration of the relationship between knowledge and these concepts can help students to deepen their understanding, as well as facilitating the transfer of their learning to new and different contexts.\u201d\u2013Theory of Knowledge Guide, 2022\nIntroduction\nThe understanding of key concepts and terms is crucial to success in TOK. It is from our understanding lit. a \u2018standing under\u2019 or \u2018what stands under\u2019 or \u2018grounds\u2019 and provides a base to the key concepts that our knowledge is \u2019produced\u2019 or \u2018brought forward\u2019. It is the questioning of these grounds regarding whether or not they are truly grounds that is the foundation of the Theory of Knowledge course. Below are pr\u00e9cis of the basic concepts used in TOK. Each would require a separate blog in order to explore them in their full possibilities of meaning.\nInitially in the West, it was understood that words and their meanings were historical in nature while language itself was ahistorical. From language (logos) and its grammatical rules arose what we understand as \u201clogic\u201d: while grammar related to \u201cright speaking\u201d, \u201clogic\u201d related to \u201cright thinking\u201d. Both language and \u201clogic\u201d were considered ahistorical until the thinking of the French philosopher Rousseau. It was Rousseau who first pronounced that language and reason were historical and that human beings themselves were historical animals. We ourselves dwell within this stunning paradigm shift with our belief in the \u201cmodification\u201d theories of evolution from Charles Darwin and others.\nPhilosophical English is Latinate in origin and the Latin is, usually, a translation of the original concept from the Greek. So, for example, the Greek word \u201c logos \u201d is translated by the Latin \u201c reor \u201d or \u201c ratio \u201d and from this human beings come to be understood as the \u201c animale rationale \u201c, the \u201crational animal\u201d. The Greeks determined human beings to be the \u201c zoon logon echon \u201c, the animal capable of speech or discourse, the speech that related human beings to their world and to other human beings. It was this speech which distinguished human beings from other living beings. You and I are capable of reading this blog; Fido, the dog, cannot. These different definitions of the Greeks and the Latins have given rise to many various interpretations of what human beings are and illustrate the difficulty of not only translation, but also of trying to determine the historical meanings of our basic concepts. Concepts are the grounds (the principles, the beginnings, the archai) from which our understanding derives, and the results we achieve and the conclusions we reach regarding things are given beforehand in the\u00a0 manner in which we approach the things of the world e.g. physics must report itself mathematically since it is the mathematical that determines its beginnings and the logos from which it originates.\nBasic Concepts\nBelow are given some basic approaches to how we may determine the nature of our basic concepts and how we have come to de-fine or \u201cset the limits\u201d or \u201chorizons\u201d to our understanding of them. An \u201chorizon\u201d is that open space within which something dwells and its limits define what that something is.\nCertainty relates to the belief that what we hold is truly the case regarding some thing be it an object, situation or condition, and that what it is is its actuality or reality. Certainty relates to the correspondence theory of truth and its establishment and grounding through the principle of reason. For certainty to be held, that about which an assertion is \u201ccertain\u201d about must be shared or \u201crendered\u201d to others i.e. experiments must be repeatable, hypotheses must be supported by evidence and handed over to others. This rendering has been called logos from which the concept of \u201clogic\u201d is derived. Reason is, and has been, understood as logic. Certainty results when the reasons are considered sufficient reasons for some thing being as it is and they are are handed over to others. Without the handing over, verification cannot take place and so the assertion remains merely \u201csubjective\u201d as an assertion.\nThe requirement of certainty is founded upon \u201cdoubt\u201d. If we do not doubt or if we are not skeptical regarding assertions that are made we would not need certainty. The requirement for certainty in knowledge comes to the fore in Descartes\u2019 Cogito ergo sum: while I may not be certain of objective truth, I am certain that it is I who is doubting and it is I who is doing the thinking. Doubt is the first step to thought for Descartes and as such it is a way of being in the world, an ontology. Opposed to this view was \u201ctrust\u201d. The Greeks trusted in the goodness of the world initially and then doubted assertions made regarding that world. This trust in the world allowed the Greeks to have moral certainty regarding the virtues of various human actions within the world and to establish a hierarchy of what was best for human beings. We, today, have no such hierarchy because we have no such certainty. We are exhorted to appeal to the \u201cfact-value distinction\u201d, that assertions of fact cannot be the same as assertions of value.\nIn our self-knowledge we may have psychological certainty regarding the way things are and this certainty is based on resoluteness and will. If one examines the views of the followers of Donald Trump in the USA, we can see that psychological certainty can sometimes be false but that does not affect the belief in the certainty of things that his followers hold and their relation and importance to those followers. Those who attack the followers of Trump do so on the basis of the principle of reason and its realization in the correspondence theory of truth. This is sometimes called epistemic certainty, that certainty which stems from what is understood as \u201cknowledge\u201d. However, whether the views are those of the \u2018right\u2019 or of the \u2018left\u2019, the drive to certainty produces \u2018intolerance\u2019 towards what is outside of those viewpoints. This intolerance is a reflection of the belief that all \u2018values\u2019 are subjective and that reason and science cannot provide us with the \u2018objective\u2019 certainty of those values. While it was initially hoped that \u2018tolerance\u2019 would be the product of this viewpoint, the opposite is what occurs in fact. Followers of Trump accept the QAnon belief that Democrats are pedophiles and Satanic cult worshippers. Such views are modifications of those held by the Germans of the Jews in the 1930s which ultimately led to the European Holocaust.\nCulture: The word \u201cculture\u201d is a relatively new word in our language arriving in the 19th century. As with all words, their meaning is to be determined from the social contexts and conditions from which they arose. Why and of what are we speaking when we use the word \u201cculture\u201d? Culture is a very general term and indicates the thinking and actions that social groups share and these, in turn, determine the thoughts and actions of the individuals within those groups. In some instances, it is referred to as a \u201cmindset\u201d. What are these \u201cmindsets\u201d and from where do they originate?\nIn 19th century German philosophy, the word weltanschauung arrived from two words: welt or \u201cworld\u201d; and anschauung meaning \u201cview\u201d, \u201cview of\u201d, \u201coutlook on the world\u201d. The world Weltbild also arrived, meaning \u201cworld-picture\u201d or \u201ca picture of the world\u201d. These two words, like our words \u201cculture\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d, do not mean the same thing. A \u201cworld-picture\u201d is usually associated with science or a science such as \u201ca physicist\u2019s world-picture\u201d or the \u201cmechanistic world-picture\u201d, while a \u201cworld-view\u201d can be pre-scientific or scientific. A \u201cworld-picture\u201d is usually a theoretical view of the external world while a \u201cworld-view\u201d is \u201ca view of life\u201d, a view of our position in the world and how we should act. Adherents to the same \u201cworld-picture\u201d may hold different \u201cworld-views\u201d and enter into war using the weapons supplied by their common \u201cworld-pictures\u201d, as is the case with many conflicts in the world today. A world-picture is only one constituent of a world-view.\nA world-view may be personal, individual, expressing one\u2019s own particular life experiences and opinions or it may be total, extinguishing all personal opinions. We can see variations of these among populist movements operating in various countries throughout the world.\nThe modern world-picture in the West involves mathematical science, machine technology, the reduction of art to an object of experience, human activity as culture and as the realization of \u201cvalues\u201d (civilization), the concern in politics for a \u2018cultural policy\u2019, an atheism that co-exists with the secularized Christianity and intense religious experience. We conceive of the world as picture and we are \u2018in\u2019 the picture or we conceive of the world as text, something that requires interpretation. The world is captured within a frame. Things as a whole are now taken in such a way that they are beings only insofar as they are presented by human beings, the representer and producer.\nWhat is called the age of humanism arrives simultaneously with the world conceived as picture. The English poet William Blake captures it in his poem \u201cThe Tyger\u201d: \u201cWhat immortal hand or eye/ Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\u201d. A picture requires a frame, in the case here, a system. Ancient and medieval human beings did not have a world-picture. They did not consider themselves as subjectum nor did they consider themselves the centre of beings and that the world they experienced needed to be explained and assessed in terms of human beings and with a view to human beings. The whole picture and anything in it is within the control of human beings so we can start with a clean slate and remake everything anew.\nCulture and civilization are two words that are used interchangeably at times. They are not the same. A culture provides the open space that allows the artefacts of civilization to come into being. We speak of the ancient Egyptian civilization and we can recognize the artefacts that have come down to us from it. Archeologists then search for the \u2018culture\u2019 that allowed the civilization to come into being, Egyptian mathematics, religion and politics for instance.\nWe can speak of technological civilization and technological culture in the following way. The instruments and gadgets of technological civilization are brought into being by the technological culture which provides the open space for their realization and production. There are no computers and hand phones without the technological culture that requires them, and in the future, they will be looked upon as evidence of technological civilization.\nExperience: \u2018Experience\u2019, like all basic words, changes its meaning over history. What counts as \u201cexperience\u201d at a given period depends on a prior interpretation of the world that is not itself derived from or vulnerable to experience. Such an interpretation is derived through language and what is shared among human beings. We believe we know that what we have \u2018experienced\u2019 in our privacy is true for us, and we seek verification from others to justify our interpretation and understanding of those events from others whether in formal settings such as controlled experiments or in the informal settings of social chat groups. But those interpretations are based on an interpretation of the world and the events in it that is prior to our own personal experience and knowledge.\nThere are many different types and kinds of events that we call \u201cexperience\u201d. For example, many Americans might say \u201cthat was quite an experience\u201d when they speak about the Trump administration in the future and this would be referring to their own internal \u2018feelings\u2019 with regard to various events that occurred in their country. The strife and divisiveness brought about by different world views will produce quite different interpretations of the experience of the last few years.\nExperience can refer to things/events both internal and external. Externally we can \u2018go forth\u2019 and travel, or learn, hear of, find out. We can also undergo something similar to the example provided above and learn from such an experience.\u00a0 We usually call such knowledge learned from experience \u201ccommon sense\u201d and this type of knowledge is distinguished from the knowledge gained by \u201ctheoretical experience\u201d or science. The Greeks called theoretical knowledge episteme and they distinguished it from techne or \u201cknow how\u201d or \u201cknowing one\u2019s way in and around\u201d something. The knowledge gained from everyday experience was called phronesis and this kind of knowledge assisted in living within communities among other human beings. Mature individuals have knowledge from phronesis; those who are not mature do not. This knowledge has evolved into what we call \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d today, but the Greeks saw \u201cemotion\u201d as the way in which we disclose the world about us and not as something primarily subjective and individual.\nWe first encounter the world passively 1: we come across something without going in search of it. In active experience, we \u2018go forth\u2019 to look for something.\nWe go to something to see (perhaps with artificial aids such as microscopes) what happens to it under varying conditions, either waiting for the new conditions to arise or intervening to produce them. The word \u201cexperiment\u201d is derived from the word \u201cexperience\u201d: we intervene in something to see what happens, if we do such and such, only now we do so in \u2018anticipation of regularity, e.g. when so much \u2013 then so much\u2019. The modern experiment essentially involves \u2018exact\u2019 measurement. Objects are shorn of their essences and regarded as mere individuals conforming to mathematical regularities. These regularities determine in advance what counts as objective. Scientists do not conduct exact experiments to discover whether nature conforms to mathematical regularities; they do so because they presuppose a projection of nature as mathematical. Experiment in this sense is quite different from \u2018experience\u2019: \u2018science becomes rational-mathematical, i.e. in the highest sense, not experimental\u2019. \u2018Experiment\u2019 and \u2018experience\u2019 were once contrasted with the medieval practice of examining authorities and previous opinions. Now they are contrasted with mere observation and description, guided by no mathematical \u2018anticipation\u2019.\nThe issue between competing scientific theories, for example, cannot always be settled by \u2018experience\u2019: One cannot say that Galileo\u2019s doctrine of the free fall of bodies is true and that of Aristotle, who holds that light bodies strive upwards, is false, for the Greek conception of the essence of body, of place and of their relationship depends on a different interpretation of beings and therefore engenders a different way of seeing and examining natural processes. This is an instance of the general idea that our \u2018mode of access\u2019 or way of knowing as a manner in which we \u2018experience\u2019 a type of entity, e.g. atoms or historical figures, varies with our prior conception of their being i.e. our understanding of what, how and why they are as they are. \u2018The truth of a principle can never be proved from its result for the interpretation of a result as a result is conducted with the help of the principle, presupposed, but not grounded\u2019. Our interpretations of what we call knowledge is based on the principle of reason but it is not grounded in every case.\nThe Greek fundamental experience of the being of beings, which underlay and gave rise to both the subject-predicate form of their language, its grammar and their conception of a thing as a subject with accidents or qualities, indicates the priority of the understanding of the being of beings that first determines what we believe knowledge to be and how we experience the world and thus our arrival at what our understanding of experience may be.\nExplanation: An explanation is a statement to others which describes the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d of things, their causes, conditions and contexts, and the results or consequences of what we have determined to be \u201cfacts\u201d. The statement or account must make something clear, bring it to light; and because it deals with \u201ctruth\u201d by bringing to light, it may establish rules or laws or bring to light already established rules and laws in relation to the object or phenomenon under discussion or examination.\nIn dealing with the question of \u201chow\u201d, an explanation makes something clear or easy to understand. It is a \u2018telling\u2019 and \u2018a showing\u2019 or a reason for or a cause of something. It is related to the Greek logos or speech. You use it in your Exhibition; and the word \u201cex-hibition\u201d itself means \u201ca showing forth\u201d, a \u201cbringing out of hiding\u201d and that which is responsible for the bringing out of hiding. To bring something out of hiding is to reveal it and this is what the Greeks meant by \u201ctruth\u201d.\nWhat is responsible for the bringing out of hiding is the principle of reason. We begin our statements with \u201cbe-cause\u201d, \u201cthe cause is\u201d, so that the statement becomes a \u201cshowing forth\u201d of the \u201cwhy\u201d. The statements make the \u201cex-hibition\u201d become an \u201cex-position\u201d such as an experiment in science or an interpretation of a poem or a work of art.\nEvidence: Evidence is the requirement of the principle of sufficient reason to \u201cjustify\u201d, \u201cexplain\u201d or \u201crender an account of \u201d things, conditions and situations in order to establish and ground their truth or their correspondence to \u201creality\u201d for being what, how and why they are as they are. Evidence is the demand that things give an account of themselves for being what and as they are in order to justify assertions and judgements made regarding them. Whether it is the assertions and judgements you make regarding the objects in your Exhibition, or your assertions or thesis statements of your essay, your demands of your teachers or your parents, \u2018sufficient reasons\u2019 have to be given to account for things and situations as they are given to you in your day-to-day lives.\nWe may speak of e mpirical evidence as that \u201cinformation that verifies the truth (which accurately corresponds to reality) or falsity (inaccuracy) of a claim.\u201d As we have written elsewhere, the \u201cdata\u201d which is placed in a \u201cform\u201d so that it may \u201cinform\u201d and become \u201cinformation\u201d, is carried and made renderable to others and for others through the principle of reason. In the empiricist view, one can claim to have knowledge only when based on empirical evidence: the thing must be \u201cbrought to presence\u201d before one. \u00a0Think of this in relation to your Exhibition. You must \u201cex-hibit\u201d, or \u201cbring out of hiding\u201d and \u201chold to view\u201d so that it will be able to stand and be seen by others.\nIn our writing on David Hume, we have shown that he uses the principle of reason to question the principle of reason in empirical observations. Evidence does not give certainty but it does provide confidence in our beliefs that things are as we believe them to be; it provides justification for our believing that things are the way that they appear to be for us. Evidence provides for us our interpretation of what we call facts.\nInterpretation: What we commonly mean by \u201cinterpretation\u201d is to provide an \u201cexplanation\u201d for some thing that appeals to reason and to common sense. An interpretation is meant to bring some thing to presence in order for it to show what, how and why it is as it is. In Group 1 and Group 6 subjects, you are asked to provide an \u201cinterpretation\u201d of a work of art, whether a novel, a poem or painting for instance, and in doing so name it as \u201csuch-and-such\u201d or \u201cso-and-so\u201d. In the Human Sciences attempts are made to find fixed, permanent interpretations of social life which attempt to understand what is present at all times and in all places when living in communities, while in the Natural Sciences \u201cexplanations\u201d are looked for through experiments.\nOur lives are pervaded by interpretations both of ourselves and of other entities and things. Our \u201cCore Theme\u201d seeks to interpret how we understand ourselves, while our \u201cOptional Themes\u201d seek to understand other entities in the world around us. Our everyday interpretations or awareness of things is prior to our systematic interpretations undertaken in the Human Sciences and prior to our explanations provided by and given in the Natural Sciences. You need to find your way to the library or the science lab and interpret the contents in those places as books or science equipment before doing any science or reading. When you walk into a classroom, you do not first see uninterpreted black marks on the white board or hear the sounds of your classmates arriving. You perceive these things right away as printed or spoken words even if you cannot understand them. That you understand speech as speech or a textbook as a book does not mean that your interpretation is unreliable nor that it creates the meaning of what is interpreted. Your understanding of what the things are about you is bound together with your interpretation of them. Understanding is global and general; interpretation is local and particular.\nHermeneutics is a special kind of \u201cinterpretation\u201d. In Plato\u2019s Ion Socrates refers to the poets as the \u201cinterpreters\u201d of the gods. Hermeneta is Greek for \u201cinterpretation\u201d, the disclosing of that which was previously hidden. Interpretation is conjoined with what we understand \u201ctruth\u201d to be. Formally, hermeneutics wa s the study of how interpretation occurs and is intertwined with \u201cmethod\u201d. It is the art of understanding written texts; but in it, all things are understood as written texts. The Irish writer, James Joyce, gives us a beautiful example of hermeneutical activity and what we understand as art, and in doing so, of what understanding and interpretation indicates in the \u201cProteus\u201d section of his novel Ulysses:\nJames Joyce\n\u201cIneluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.\u201d\nDilthey, the founder of the modern Human Sciences, expanded the methodology of hermeneutics so that it became the study of the methods of the sciences themselves. When we look at ourselves as knowers, as we attempt to do in our Core Theme, what we are really doing is interpreting ourselves through the \u201cshared knowledge\u201d that comes to us through our culture. What we are is concealed to us through this shared knowledge, and so what is required is a \u201cdeconstruction\u201d of this shared knowledge. In interpreting ourselves we are interpreting a text that has been overladen by centuries of \u201cinterpretations\u201d and \u201cmisinterpretations\u201d.\nHermeneutics originally focused on how the Bible was interpreted, as well as other religious texts. The word itself is associated with Hermes, the messenger of the gods, and pneuma or \u201cbreath, in-spiration\u201d so that the word implied an \u201cinspired hearing\u201d or an openness to what the messages of the gods were.\nSome questions that arise from the inherent circularity of interpretation are: How can I learn what art is except by studying works of art? and How can I recognize a work of art unless I know what art is to begin with? Our implicit prior knowledge of what art is enables us to recognize clear cases of works of art. When we ask the question: Is it art?, how we interpret the work before us will determine the answer to this question. Whether the work is \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cgreat\u201d depends on other factors such as \u201chow deep a life it portrays\u201d, how does it illuminate the truth of that which it tries to bring to presence before us. We learn about what language is not by speaking about it and turning it into an \u201cobject of study\u201d, but through conversing with it and in it. To do so, we must already know what language is beforehand. We cannot get to hear the message of the messenger unless we already know something about it ahead of time.\nJustification: The requirements of the principle of sufficient reason necessitate that reasons be rendered to others for assertions made regarding the \u201creality\u201d or \u201cfacts\u201d of an object, situation or condition. Human beings are the \u201crational animals\u201d; to be \u201cirrational\u201d is, by definition, to be less than human. We believe that we can \u201cjustify\u201d our scientific observations of the world through mathematical calculation, and from these calculations make \u201cpredictions\u201d of events that will occur in the future. It is this \u201cpre-dictive\u201d power (lit. before \u201cspeech\u201d) that gives calculative reasoning its dominance since the predictive power provides security and certainty with regard to the way thing are. This security and certainty enhances our \u201cpreservation of life\u201d and allows us to empower ourselves towards \u201cenhancement of life\u201d through a recognition of life\u2019s potentialities.\nTo \u201cpre-dict\u201d is to make an assertion prior to that speech which renders reasons. When results are justified through reason, we believe that we have achieved a correspondence between our minds and the objects, conditions or situations under questioning. To justify is to indicate \u201cthat which is responsible for\u201d the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of the \u201cjudgement\u201d made in the assertion. As the philosopher Kant indicated, \u201cJudgement is the seat of truth\u201d, or that upon which truth is grounded or based. \u201cReasons\u201d bring that which is being spoken about to light. Without such reasons, the thing being spoken about remains in the dark, hidden. \u201cEvidence\u201d or that which is experienced must be provided and the correspondence between that which is \u201cexperienced\u201d, the evidence and the thing, situation or condition must correspond. For example, reasons provide the relations between a criminal and his crime and \u201cjustifies\u201d the assertion of guilt. When one asserts a position that Democrats in the USA are really lizard-like aliens preying on children for their blood (just one of many QAnon beliefs) evidence must be provided for making such a statement. When one asserts that \u201cthe election was stolen\u201d, one must provide corresponding evidence to show that that was the case. Believing that a situation or condition is the case is not the same as \u201cjustifying\u201d that belief, as many courts throughout the USA have asserted. Conspiracy theorists, in general, lack the corresponding evidence and reasons for their assertions to be taken as true. Their beliefs are irrational, without reasons.\nThe type of \u201cjustification\u201d required by reason is, some believe, not possible when making assertions about morals or ethics because moral judgements are \u201cvalues\u201d and these must be distinguished from assertions made about what we call \u201cfacts\u201d: i.e. there are no \u201cmoral facts\u201d. \u201cValues\u201d are what we human beings create through our willing in the world and through our determination of what things are and how they are. This separation of statements of fact from statements of values is known as the \u201cfact-value\u201d distinction. Efforts have been made to make morals subject to the same calculations that are used for scientific evidence such as Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism, \u201cthe greatest happiness for the greatest number\u201d. This inquiry on facts and values is discussed in more depth in the writings on Darwin and Nietzsche in this blog.\nTo \u201cjustify\u201d clearly has relations to its root word \u201cjustice\u201d. How does our understanding of the word \u201cjustice\u201d relate to justifying and justification? With the modern view of what human beings are given to us by Descartes and Kant, human being is that being before whom all other beings are brought before and required to give their reasons for being what they are as beings. This is the domineering, commanding stance of human being before whom all other beings are brought before and \u201cjustified\u201d as to what they are as beings. This \u201cjustification\u201d is that which is responsible for something being defined as what it is, how it stands in its truth. To justify is to argue for or defend. Our reasons for justifying our mathematical calculations, for instance, are that these calculations give the best explanation of our observations and experiences (experiments).\nOur calculations secure our our standing in our being-in-the-world and provide the potential for the all-important \u201clife enhancing\u201d or \u201cquality of life\u201d activities that are the purposes and ends of our arts. Our calculations give our domination and control, our mastery of nature, and their \u201ccorrectness\u201d is demonstrated in the predictability of outcomes. There is a \u201cjustification\u201d provided by the mind\u2019s correspondence to the object in question and in the mind\u2019s representations of that object in the mathematical. These justifications are shared in the language of the principle of reason through the belief in the schemata of the technological framing of the things in this world.\nObjectivity: At the core of the questioning regarding the IB\u2019s approach to knowledge is the question of \u201cobjectivity\u201d. Our ideas regarding objectivity and of our environment as object is central to how we have come to understand ourselves and our world around us. The division of our being-in-the-world into one apprehended as subject-object through the thinking of the French philosopher Rene Descartes, marking that point where human beings become the centre of their worlds. is the great paradigm shift in the history of thought in the West. When we consider the nature that is the object of natural sciences and of technological exploitation, we believe that we have some knowledge regarding beings and things. Is this the case? Philosophers and thinkers have argued that we do not have knowledge of the things themselves; what we have knowledge of is our own representations of those things. The dominance of technology and its rationalism is held together in our modern world with a susceptibility to superstition for human beings seem to desire more than what is given to them in their rationalism and technology.\n\u201cObjectivity\u201d has its roots in the Latin ob- and jacio : jacio \u201cto throw\u201d, ob \u201cagainst\u201d. What is \u201cthrown\u201d and what is that \u201cagainst\u201d which it is thrown? The things of the world must be brought to presence and made to stand in permanence so that we can make judgements regarding them. As the philosopher Nietzsche once said: \u201cOnly that which has no history can be defined\u201d.\u00a0To define is to make judgements regarding the things of our world. But are not all things historical? Things are brought before us to give us their reasons as to their \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhy\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d. It is human beings who determine what qualifies as a thing and what does not. This is made most explicit in the philosophy of Kant (\u201cThe mind makes the object\u201d) but we can also find it in the philosophy of the English philosopher John Locke who determined that the things of Nature were of no value in themselves unless they were taken possession of and worked on by human beings. The key with regard to \u201cobjectivity\u201d is that human being is made the centre of the world. The two central features of modernity are that human beings are the centre of beings as a whole, the \u201csubject\u201d to which they are all referred, and the beingness of things/beings themselves is conceived as the being-represented as the producible and explainable.\nThe following links provide greater depth regarding the question of objectivity:\nCT 1: Knowledge and Reason as Empowering and Empowerment\nDarwin and Nietzsche Part IV: Metaphysics as \u201cLogic\u201d: The Grounds of the Principle of Reason\nPerspectives: The following links deal with perspectives and perspectivism in greater detail:\nCT 1: Perspectives (WOKs)\nDarwin/Nietzsche Part VII: On Aristotle, Algorithms and the Principle of Contradiction and the Overturning of the True and Apparent Worlds\nPower: The word \u201cpower\u201d is one of the most general concepts that are used in TOK, and because of this generality becomes quite obscure when a more precise definition is required. Power indicates what something is in its \u201cpossibilities\u201d, its \u201cpotential\u201d to be something that it is not already, how something is in its manner of being-in-the-world, what something actually is in its factual \u201creality\u201d. When, for instance, we speak of money as \u201ccongealed energy\u201d , we are speaking of it as having as its basis its roots in \u201cpower\u201d. The old saying \u201cMoney is the root of all evil\u201d would more properly be said as \u201cPower is the root of all evil\u201d, something which is caught most beautifully in the films of The Lord of the Rings. The German philosopher Nietzsche sees all being and beings as \u201cwill to power and nothing besides\u201d, including ourselves as human beings.\nAll \u201cpower\u201d originates in Nature. The word \u201cnature\u201d comes from the Latin natura which in turn comes from nasci, \u201cto be born, to originate\u201d.  (Lord of the Rings fans will recognize that this is the word given to the Ring in the language of Mordor). Natura means \u201cthat which lets something originate from itself\u201d. We can see some connections here to what we mean by \u201ccreativity\u201d, for example in Shakespeare\u2019s statement that \u201cthe art itself is nature\u201d. When we speak of \u201cthe nature of things\u201d we mean what things are in their \u201cpossibility\u201d and how they are regardless of whether they actually are or not. In Christian thought, human beings in their \u201cnatural state\u201d are viewed as what is given to human beings in their createdness as beings which is turned over to their freedom. The \u201cnature\u201d if left to itself brings about the total destruction of the human being through the passions. Nature must be suppressed. It is in a certain sense what must not be.\nAnother view, the modern view, says that it is through the unleashing of the drives and the passions that the natural state of human beings is to be achieved. This modern view is given to us most clearly in the thinking of Nietzsche who makes the \u201cbody\u201d the key to our interpretation of the world and brings about a harmonious relation of the \u201csensible\u201d and the elements of the natural. This new relation is realized through our technology which brings the elemental (earth, fire, water, light) into our power and by this power gives us the ability to make ourselves capable of the mastery of the world through a systematic world domination. It is from within technology that the systematic articulation of the truth at any given time about \u2018beings\u2019 as a whole is given and this articulation is called \u201cmetaphysics\u201d. Nietzsche will say \u201ctechnology is the highest form of will-to-power\u201d; Heidegger following Nietzsche will say \u201cTechnique is the metaphysic of the age\u201d.\u00a0 Technology is the attempt to overcome the separation of \u201cspirit and nature\u201d that dominates Western thinking and is one of the reasons why this thinking arose in the West and not elsewhere.\nWhen we attempt to arrive at an understanding and definition of the concept of \u201cpower\u201d, we can begin by going back to Aristotle and noting that he describes the essence of nature as \u201cmovedness\u201d, \u201cmotion\u201d, or kinesis. What is the essence of movement? We view all movement as requiring a \u201ccause\u201d or agency. For Aristotle, what we call \u201cnature\u201d is taken as\u00a0 \u201ccause\u201d understood as aitia or aition in the sense of \u201corigin\u201d. By aition Aristotle means \u201cthat which is responsible for the fact that some thing is what it is\u201d. Aition is a common suffix in English and we can understand many of our common words according to this understanding: \u201ceducation\u201d from educare \u201cthe leading out\u201d and that which is responsible for the leading out; \u201cinformation\u201d that which is responsible for the \u201cform\u201d that \u201cinforms\u201d. This aition becomes later understood as \u201csufficient cause\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d.\nFor Aristotle, however, aitia is not only understood as the \u201ccause\u201d of motion; it is also understood as the control present over the movement as such. The movement present in the seed becomes a tree, not something else; the movement in the fertilized human embryo becomes a human being, not a cat. This domination or control was called Necessity by the Greeks, what we might sometimes refer to as \u201cthe laws of Nature\u201d. Movement is not merely to be understood as change of place. A tree my remain still while being in motion as is shown in its leaves changing colour, etc. For the Greeks, movement was an emergence into being present, a flower blossoming for example.\nThe power within the things that are by nature is distinguished from the \u201cartifacts\u201d which are made by human beings. The things of nature have the power within themselves while artifacts such as a chair or desk have their power given to them from outside of themselves. The things of nature are in movement towards a completion, an end which may or may not occur. The artifacts made by human beings are complete, finished and have been brought to presence by human work. We speak of a \u2018work of art\u2019.\nPower must be understood as a means and not an end, just as money cannot be an end in itself but as a potential means to achieve ends. Seeing power as an end in itself is similar to confusing the piano to the sonata or the palette to the painting. The attractiveness of power lies in its dynamic potential and we moderns see this potential as limitless, quite different to previous civilizations, and this perhaps accounts for our insatiable fascination for the \u2018gigantic\u2019 and our desire for speed and efficiency in all facets of our lives.\nWhen we speak of the \u201cpower of words\u201d, we mean their power to create illusion and error. Currently, the role of fantasy and imagination which denies the reality of fact, the disbelief in the sciences, the destruction of language as a conveyor of truth, the belief that merely holding an opinion is \u201cfreedom of thought\u201d, these are all expressions of the powerlessness of the people who believe in their need to find something which allows them to face the reality of the world whether it be the social reality of politics or the physical reality given to us in our sciences. Their belief finds itself present in their desire to submit themselves to a collective, any collective where the real needs of love and recognition may be found but they are found only in ersatz form.\nResponsibility: Ethics is the area of knowledge where the idea of responsibility is\u00a0 a basic concept. Ethics relates to our actions and behaviours in communities, our speaking with and to others, and our ability to choose what our actions will be towards others. The concepts of ethics, morals and values are concepts that are sometimes used interchangeably in TOK, but are they, in fact, the same things? We speak of \u201cethical responsibility\u201d and \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d but we do not have similar terminology for \u201cvalue responsibility\u201d? Are we not \u201cresponsible\u201d for the choices we make of what we \u201cvalue\u201d?\u00a0 Different human beings value different things. On what ground do they value those things? Our lack of clarity with regard to these concepts stems from our desire to have it both ways: we wish for the \u201cfreedom\u201d we believe we have in our \u201csubjectivity\u201d while at the same time holding on to the \u201cpermanence\u201d of what we believe \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cobjectivity\u201d give to us believing as we do that \u201cfacts\u201d are \u201cvalue-free\u201d which, as many of the posts here attempt to point out, is not true.\nResponsibility is literally \u201cthe ability to respond\u201d because one has the power or potential to do so and is able to affect an outcome. It involves \u201cchoice\u201d and it involves our relations with others in our communities. The failure to act is also an action and usually involves our concern for our own self-interest.\u00a0 Responsibility is conjoined with duties and obligations towards both ourselves and others within our communities. In the West, the parable of the Good Samaritan and the question of \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d are questions and examples that are constantly with us when we consider our actions. The answers to these questions are at the core of the IB program and how the IB identifies what its student should be, the IB\u2019s wishes for the way-of-being of its graduates.\nWhen Donald Trump responded to a question from a reporter that he \u201cbore no responsibility\u201d for his administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he demonstrated both moral and ethical falsehoods regarding the concept of responsibility. Firstly, as the leader of the most powerful nation on earth, he certainly had the power, the ability to muster the resources available to him and direct them to fighting the virus; and secondly, as President he had sworn an oath to protect the American people\u00a0 and so was under an obligation to do so. His response was so inadequate as to be seen as a sign of his overall incompetence and unfittedness for the office he held. The only true freedom human beings have is the ability to think and to not do so is both \u201cunfree\u201d and to be less than fully human.\nWe can see many of these themes regarding responsibility in that most ethical play of Shakespeare\u2019s: Macbeth. The play is Shakespeare\u2019s shortest because Macbeth is a man of action, \u201ca man of few words\u201d and, consequently, a man of few thoughts. The play is not about \u201cambition\u201d; Shakespeare is not speaking against ambition but he is, most emphatically, speaking against \u201cthe illness should attend it\u201d, about what happens when people aspire to positions for which they are not fitted. Macbeth is the great soldier, the saviour of his country, but what makes Macbeth a great soldier, something for which he is truly \u201cfitted\u201d, are not the same virtues that are required in a king. The \u201cvirtue\u201d of some thing is what that thing is fitted for, its \u201cgood\u201d. It is the virtue of a thorough-bred race horse that it be capable of running fast; this particular type of horse is not good if it cannot do so. Virtue is conjunctive to ethics, morals and values and their relation to what human beings are fitted for in that in the play both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth must release themselves from their humanity: they must become \u201cinhuman\u201d, like the Weird Sisters, in order to \u201ccatch the nearest way\u201d to their desires to rule Scotland. Their descent into darkness begins with a denial of truth, and their subsequent rise is filled with fraud, deception and lies. For Shakespeare, moral and ethical responsibility are \u201cnatural\u201d and comprise what being a human being truly is.\nTruth: Aletheia and truth: How we understand and interpret what \u201ctruth\u201d is is essential for understanding who and what we are as human beings and what we think the world about us is. Truth is what is sought when we begin to use our \u201cmaps\u201d and journey towards understanding the entities that are in our areas of knowledge.\nAletheia is Greek for \u2018truth; truthfulness, frankness, sincerity\u2019. Alethes is \u2018true; sincere, frank; real, actual\u2019. There is also a verb, aletheuein, \u2018to speak truly, etc\u2019. The words are related to lanthanein, with an older form l ethein, \u2018to escape notice, be unseen, unnoticed\u2019, and lethe, \u2018forgetting, forgetfulness\u2019. An initial a- in Greek is often privative, like the Latin in- or the Germanic un-. (The \u2018privative alpha\u2019 occurs in many Greek-derived words in English: \u2018a-nonymous\u2019, \u2018a-theism\u2019, etc.) Alethes, aletheia are generally accepted to be a-lethes, a-letheia, that which is \u2018not hidden or forgotten\u2019, or he who \u2018does not hide or forget\u2019. (These characteristics/meanings of truth can all be applied to Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth and doing so will provide an approach or an opening to an understanding of that play).\nWe reach the \u2018essence of truth\u2019, the \u2018openness of the open\u2019, from two directions: from \u2018reflection on the ground of the possibility of correctness (adaequatio, \u2018truth as correctness\u2019 or \u2018correspondence\u2019)\u2019 and from \u2018recollection of the beginning (aletheia )\u2019 Aletheuein is \u2018to take out of hiddenness, to uncover; aletheia is \u2018uncovering\u2019; and alethes is \u2018unhidden. This uncovering allows that which is to be perceived.\nThis has three implications: 1. Truth is not confined to explicit assertions and discrete mental, primarily theoretical, attitudes such as judgments, beliefs and representations. The world as a whole, not just entities within it, is unhidden \u2013 unhidden as much by moods (emotion as a way of knowing) as by understanding. 2. Truth is primarily a feature of reality \u2013 beings or things and entities, their being and world \u2013 not of thoughts and utterances (reason and language as ways of knowing). Beings, things, entities are, of course, unhidden to us, and we disclose them \u2018to unconceal; -ing; -ment\u2019, they can have an active sense: \u2018 alethes means: 1. unconcealed said of beings, 2. grasping the unconcealed as such, i.e. being unconcealing\u2019. But beings, etc. are genuinely unconcealed; they do not just agree with an assertion or representation. 3. Truth as \u2018unconcealment\u2019 explicitly presupposes concealment or hiddenness. Human being and being is in \u2018untruth as well as truth\u2019. This means that \u2018falling\u2019 human being misinterprets things. (\u2018Falling\u2019 has the character of being lost in the publicness of the society of which one is a member and of the clinging to the understanding of the world that that society has put forward, or being absorbed in the shadows of the Cave as Plato says in his Allegory. (Macbeth\u2019s first soliloquy: Act I sc. vii and the imagery/metaphors associated with \u2018leaping\u2019 and \u2018falling\u2019; his second soliloquy \u201cIs this a dagger that I see before me\u2026\u201d where the dagger is \u2018revealed\u2019 to him as the \u2018instrument\u2019 that he will use to kill Duncan rather than as the last warning sign at that last moment where Macbeth still has a choice.)\nWilliam Shakespeare\nUntruth\u2019 is not plain \u2018falsity\u2019, nor is it \u2018hiddenness\u2019: it is \u2018disguisedness\u2019 of the truth. In Shakespeare\u2019s plays Julius Caesar and Macbeth, \u2018untruth\u2019 is still not \u2018falsity\u2019, but \u2018hiding, concealing\u2019. What conceals is no longer human being, but being itself. The prophecies of the witches for example in Macbeth provide an example of this concealing hiddenness that disguises.\nThere are two types of unconcealing: (a) of the open, the world or beings as a whole; (b) of particular beings within this open space. The first type (a) involves concealment: everything was hidden before the open was established, and concealment, persisting in that the open, reveals only certain aspects of reality, not its whole nature. It is not possible for human beings to have knowledge of the whole. Each area of knowledge provides a \u2018field\u2019 or an \u2018opening\u2019 in which the beings that it studies are illuminated and hidden simultaneously.\nThe second type (b) involves a concealment that we overcome \u2018partially and case by case\u2019. Plato, in assimilating truth to light, and of the light to Love indicates the \u2018openness\u2019 that is necessary for things to be revealed in their full \u2018unconcealment\u2019 (Stage 4 of the Cave where the human being is outside of the Cave; the journey outside of the Cave occurs \u2018within\u2019 the human being and the Cave). We choose, like Macbeth for instance, the idea of hiddenness or darkness over the light and \u2018unhiddenness\u2019 (thus the many metaphors of darkness and disguise, hiddenness and forgetfulness in the play; after the killing of Duncan, Macbeth loses all sense of \u2018otherness\u2019 and becomes a tyrant), and thus the privative force of a-letheia: the light is constant \u2013 never switched on or off (Jean Paul Sartre\u2019s play No Exit as a reversal of this but also a denial) \u2013 and reveals everything there is to anyone who looks. We lose the idea of the open (and the comportment of Love), which must persist throughout our unconcealing of beings. For Plato, morality is purely internal; and it is here in the revealing that morality, ethics and ontology are given substance (as they are, for instance, in Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth ).\nIn Plato, aletheia \u2018comes under the yoke of the idea\u2019. Idea, from the Greek idein, \u2018to see\u2019, refers to the visual aspect of entities or things. The ascent of the prisoners out of the cave is a progressive opening of their vision to this idea and the idea of the Good from which all ideas spring (although we cannot speak of the Good as an \u2018entity\u2019 in the sense of a \u2018thing\u2019 or \u2018object\u2019 whose idea it is). Hence aletheia is no longer primarily a characteristic of beings in themselves: it is \u2018yoked\u2019 together with the soul, and consists in a homoi\u00f6sis, a \u2018likeness\u2019, between them which is generated through Beauty (or Eros). This can be understood as a triad (or triangle): the soul + the idea + Beauty. Homoi\u00f6sis has since become adaequatio (in the Latin interpretation of the word, \u2018correctness\u2019 or \u2018coherence\u2019) and then \u2018agreement\u2019; and since Descartes, the relation between soul and beings has become the subject-object relation, mediated by a \u2018representation\u2019, the degenerate descendant of Plato\u2019s idea. Truth becomes correctness, and its \u2018elbow-room\u2019, the open, or the experience of Beauty and of eros, is neglected. (\u2018Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\u2019).\nHomer\nSome counterclaims to this version of truth: It is not certain that alethes comes from a- and lanthanein. Even if it does, it hardly ever means \u2018unhidden\u2019 in Homer, Hesiod (the earliest authors), and later authors, but has three main senses: the correctness of speech and belief (epistemological); the reality of being (ontological); the genuineness, truthfulness and conscientiousness of an individual or character (\u2018existential\u2019). These three aspects of aletheia are united in Plato (and also for Shakespeare). The ascent from the cave is an ascent of being, of knowledge and of existence. Throughout the history of philosophy, it is assumed that if Plato regards truth as correctness of apprehension, he has jettisoned its other senses; while if another sense reappears, this is because Plato is indecisive and \u2018ambiguous\u2019. The three senses are fused together in Plato. Interpreting truth as unhiddenness would not save it from modern subjectivity: unhiddenness must be unhiddenness to someone, but the nature of this unhiddenness is pre-determined.\nPlato says that the things we \u2018make\u2019 by holding up a mirror are not beings that are \u2018unhidden\u2019, and that the things painters make are not alethe (Republic, 596d,e). But perhaps this may be a joke of Plato\u2019s since he himself has written a book, a dialogue, which is a \u2018mirror\u2019 of the being of Socrates, or an idealization of the being of Socrates. How is it that the things in mirrors and in paintings are not \u2018unhidden\u2019? How are we to understand how it can be said that to make things by holding up a mirror, we must take \u2018making\u2019 as Techne in the Greek sense? Are things no more hidden in a mirror than in their being in the world? To discuss this at length would be to have to examine the nature of the Platonic dialogue and particularly the dialogue Phaedrus which is the dialogue on writing, and this cannot be done here. In the allegory of the Cave the shadows, too, require light, but in their revealing the things that they are, they are not fully \u2018shown\u2019.\n(Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Act 3 sc. 2 may be of help here: \u201c\u2026 let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance that you o\u2019erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold, as \u2019twere, the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.\u201d) Plato\u2019s (and Shakespeare\u2019s, through his use of personification) point is that things in a mirror are not real, not alethe in the ontological sense, but that their revealing requires a special human beholding, a beholding that takes place in the open, that the mimetic art is directed to us and to the Forms themselves and what is created are the \u2018images\u2019 and the outward appearance of these entities.\nValues: The word \u201cvalues\u201d comes to prominence in the 19th century in the writings of the German philosopher Nietzsche. \u201cValues\u201d are what human beings create in their willing and are, therefore, \u201csubjective\u201d. The word \u201cvalues\u201d has come to dominate our speech regarding morals and ethics. Even the Pope uses the word \u201cvalues\u201d when discussing what human behaviour should be. The consequences of using such a word unthinkingly are many. Values indicate that there are no \u201cmoral facts\u201d or universal principles of action that are appropriate to all human beings at all times and in all places. In the human sciences, we speak of the \u201cfact/value distinction\u201d and this distinction has become a principle for the thinking in that area of knowledge if it is to call itself a science.\nThe following links address the concept of \u201cvalues\u201d and how it shapes our everyday thinking and being-in-the-world:\nCT 1: Self-Knowledge and Ethics\nDarwin and Nietzsche: Part 3: Truth as \u201cCorrectness\u201d: Its Relation to \u201cValues\u201d\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nMay 2021 Prescribed Titles\u00a0Deconstructed\nA few notes of warning and guidance before we begin:\nThe TOK essay provides you with an opportunity to become engaged in thinking and reflection. What are outlined below are strategies and suggestions, questions and possible responses only for deconstructing the TOK titles as they have been given. They should be used alongside the discussions that you will carry out with your peers and teachers during the process of constructing your essay.\nThe notes here are intended to guide you towards a thoughtful, personal response to the prescribed titles posed.\u00a0 They are not to be considered as\u00a0the\u00a0answer and they should only be used to help provide you with another perspective to the ones given to you in the titles and from your own TOK class discussions. You need to remember that most of your examiners have been educated in the logical positivist schools of Anglo-America and this education pre-determines their predilection to view the world as they do and to understand the concepts as they do. The TOK course itself is a product of this logical positivism.\nThere is no substitute for your own personal thought and reflection, and these notes are not intended as a cut and paste substitute to the hard work that thinking requires. Some of the comments on one title may be useful to you in the approach you are taking in the title that you have personally chosen, so it may be useful to read all the comments and give them some reflection.\nMy experience has been that candidates whose examples match those to be found on TOK \u201chelp\u201d sites (and this is another of those TOK help sites) struggle to demonstrate a mastery of the knowledge claims and knowledge questions contained in the examples. \u00a0The best essays carry a trace of a struggle that is the journey on the path to thinking. Many examiners state that in the very best essays they read, they can visualize the individual who has thought through them sitting opposite to them. To reflect this struggle in your essay is your goal.\nRemember to include sufficient TOK content in your essay. When you have completed your essay, ask yourself if it could have been written by someone who had not participated in the TOK course. If the answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d, then you do not have sufficient TOK content in your essay. Personal and shared knowledge, the knowledge framework, the ways of knowing and the areas of knowledge are terms that will be useful to you in your discussions.\nHere is a link to a PowerPoint that contains recommendations and a flow chart outlining the steps to writing a TOK essay. Some of you may need to get your network administrator to make a few tweaks in order for you to access it. Comments, observations and discussions are most welcome.

Being an \u201celement\u201d, it is presumably part of a compound that includes other \u201celements\u201d. In TOK we begin by looking to and at ourselves and attempt to arrive at some propositions as to \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d we are both as human beings and as members of a community. We attempt to look at various things and how we express and make intelligible those things to others. We do this through language in one of its many forms. In order to do so, we must have some prior understanding of what some \u201cthing\u201d is. This includes all the things that are. They must have some being in some way by the very fact that we are discussing them. It is in the manner of their being that acceptance and rejection are possible. The denial of some thing, what we call skepticism or \u201calternative facts\u201d, contradicts itself and is therefore impossible; we can deny the name that is given to it, but we cannot deny the existence of the thing itself. The refutation of skepticism is the refutation of every kind of relativism. This refutation appeals to the principles of non-contradiction and the principle of identity; and it appeals to \u201clogic\u201d and thus to \u201cdiction\u201d, to speaking back and forth and to speaking \u201cagainst\u201d ourselves. The speaking \u201cagainst\u201d ourselves implies that we have some prior apprehension of the \u201ctruth\u201d of the thing that is under discussion. The thing itself must have made itself manifest prior to our beginning of our discussion about it to begin with.\nIn our usual day-to-day lives we must have trust in some form in some things; if we do not, we are not capable of being fully \u201chuman\u201d i.e. we are considered \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201cdelusional\u201d and such persons are considered \u201cmentally ill\u201d. Without some element of trust we could not function. We sometimes call this trust \u201ccommon sense\u201d. When we drive our automobiles over the Golden Gate Bridge, we place our trust in the knowledge of the engineers who have designed the bridge and in the men and women who constructed it so that we can believe that using the Bridge will not cause us to plummet into the Bay. Trust and belief go hand in hand. Through this trust and belief, we \u201caccept\u201d and submit ourselves to its outcomes. The knowledge claims we submit ourselves to involve \u201ccommon sense\u201d as well as the theoretical knowledge of our sciences which have been revealed to us through science\u2019s mathematics.\n\u201cDoubt\u201d has always been present in the act of thinking. For the ancient Greeks where philosophy began in the West, this doubt was encapsulated and contained within a being-in-the-world of trust: while one doubted the propositions or statements that were made or put forward regarding things, the things themselves and \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u2019 they were, nevertheless, were over-arched by a recognition that Nature (all things) were Good and the purpose of doubt was to establish that relation between the thing and the Good through the use of logos or \u201cspeaking\u201d about them. The essential difference between ancient and modern thought was initiated by the French philosopher Descartes who began by \u201cdoubting\u201d all things and everything until he arrived at the conclusion that what couldn\u2019t be doubted was that he himself, the thinking \u201cI\u201d, could not be doubted. Cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore, I am.\nThe Greeks defined human being as the zoon logon echon, the animal capable of speaking, of using the logos. In later Latin, the logos was translated as ratio which means \u201crelation\u201d, and human beings became defined as the animale rationale, the animal capable of establishing relations to things and to others through \u201creason\u201d, through speaking. \u201cLogic\u201d was determined as the doctrine of \u201cright thinking\u201d and \u201cright speaking\u201d, the science of thinking and its rules. Logic was the \u201clawfulness\u201d of thinking, the acts and procedures of thought, what we nowadays call \u201cmethod\u201d. These rules and procedures were founded on grammar, the rules of speaking properly about things. These rules of grammar can be seen today with our programming languages for our computers and other electronic devices. With Descartes, we focus on the doubt involved in the thinking of the \u201cI think\u201d, but perhaps a better way of stating his principle is \u201cI am, therefore, I think\u201d, and within this thinking and being is the element of doubt or skepticism about being itself.\n\u201cKnowledge claims\u201d are assertions made in speech regarding the truth of something.  In the world at the moment, \u201ctrust\u201d in many knowledge claims that are made is an element that is quite rare whether it be in the assertions of \u201ccommon sense\u201d or in the assertions contained in the theories of the sciences and the arts. The USA is today going through one of its most turbulent moments in its history because the trust that in the past had  been placed in its institutions and leaders has now been placed in doubt. The lack of trust in science by many members of its communities, for instance, created a Covid-19 response  that has baffled many in other countries of the world who, in the past, had looked to America for leadership on matters involving the application of the practical sciences. This admiration has now turned to pity as the wounds of the country are primarily seen as self-inflicted. They are not seen as, for example, the wounds suffered by Germany before it accepted Nazism as those wounds were brought about by others through the Treaty of Versailles.\nThe protests against systemic racism in America\u2019s streets have brought to light the shallowness of its mythology surrounding its \u201cfounding fathers\u201d and their definitions of a \u201cpeople\u201d that excluded African slaves and the indigenous peoples of the continent. \u201cThe desire to have it both ways\u201d, which is so much of the American character, is revealed in the desire to recognize some \u201cinalienable rights\u201d (the lack of the right to property, for example, was overlooked) in order to create a leisure class based on the enslavement of Black people. As it so often does, greed overruled morality (virtue, if you like) in their writing of their Constitution. Perhaps we are seeing the flowering of a seed which from the outset was rotten to its core. The US Constitution and its Bill of Rights are examples of the less than \u201cnoble lies\u201d required for the establishment of the State.\nThe Greek philosopher Plato placed democracy just above tyranny when listing the best order of regimes. Monarchy was the best; tyranny was the worst. This ranking was based on how a regime regulated its polis or community with regard to the place of virtue in that community when that community created its laws. Because democracy was based on the fulfillment of the common, lowest appetites and instincts of its members and not the growth of virtue of its members, Plato thought that it would inevitably devolve into tyranny (as was the case in his own Athenian polis ). The USA\u2019s founding fathers chose the economic well-being provided by the labour of its slaves above the morality of recognizing slaves as \u201chuman beings\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d, and thus the systemic racism of the USA which is present today was born and allowed to flourish in the country throughout its history. Democracy, according to Plato, neglects the education to \u201cvirtue\u201d of its citizens within it or domestically, and appeals to an imperialism in the State without in its relations to its neighbouring states because of its avariciousness. Democracy inevitably devolves into tyranny through time because it is unable to develop a sense of \u201cotherness\u201d among its inhabitants i.e. it is not able to establish the virtue of \u201cfriendship\u201d among its members. \u201cFriendship\u201d is established through logos or \u201cspeech\u201d. Friendship is only possible when \u201ctrust\u201d is present. While there may be \u201chonour\u201d among thieves, there is no \u201cfriendship\u201d. This is discussed in greater detail in the blog regarding knowledge and politics: https://mytok.blog/2019/11/22/ot-5-knowledge-and-politics-part-1/\nIn literature, Shakespeare provides us with two great tragedies, Hamlet and Macbeth, in which the issue and the question of trust and the consequences of its lack are most beautifully given. When Hamlet in his anagnorisis, his moment of insight that gives him self-knowledge and  illumination, is able to say: \u201cThere\u2019s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, \u2019tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come\u2014the readiness is all\u201d he is able to trust in the purpose and meaning of his life and in the purpose and meaning of the world about him and in doing so is able to overcome his fear of death (indicated by the use of the impersonal pronoun \u201cit\u201d) and is finally able to act. Unfortunately, this illumination comes too late for him.\u00a0It is his overriding doubt and skepticism that is Hamlet\u2019s undoing.\nIf Hamlet can say \u201cthere is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so\u201d prior to his moment of illumination, the play Macbeth gives the lie inherent in that statement. Macbeth is a character who desires the power and recognition of kingship, but his character is \u201cunfit\u201d for that position. In order to become king, Macbeth must turn against the light given to him regarding who and what he is: he is a great soldier, brave and heroic, the saviour of his country, but he is not a king. He chooses darkness over the light and in this choosing descends int0 tyranny and madness. To become king, Macbeth must lose his fullness of \u201cthe milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way\u201d. His choice of evil is the loss of his humanity. He recognizes this in his anagnorisis:\nI have lived long enough. My way of life/ Is fall\u2019n into the sere, the yellow leaf,/ And that which should accompany old age,/ As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,/ I must not look to have, but, in their stead,/ Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath/ Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.\nMacbeth Act v sc. iii,\nThe tragedy  illustrates the great danger inherent in language as the means of creating, invoking, and sustaining trust. Human beings are the animal that uses language to reveal truth to themselves and to others. But language can also, of course, be used to deceive; deception creates distrust.. When language is used to deceive, things are \u201ccovered over\u201d, \u201chidden\u201d rather than revealed. For Plato, the things become \u201cnon-beings\u201d like the witches themselves who \u201clook not like the inhabitants o\u2019 the earth,/ And yet are on \u2018t\u201d i.e. they are \u201cnot real\u201d, and in not being real, they are not to be \u201ctrusted\u201d. The motifs of \u201cequivocation\u201d, \u201ccovering\u201d, \u201chiddenness\u201d that run throughout the play \u201cilluminate\u201d how the play as a whole becomes darker and darker as it goes on illustrating Scotland\u2019s descent into darkness under the tyranny of Macbeth. Such darkness is only enabled with self-delusion and this is made clear in Macbeth\u2019s misinterpretations of the three prophecies provided by the three witches. Macbeth creates a world of fear and divisiveness because his is a mind that sees \u201cdaggers\u201d.\n2. Within areas of knowledge, how can we differentiate between change and progress? Answer with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nThe key concepts to be brought to light in title #2 are the differentiations between \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cprogress\u201d. All \u201cchange\u201d is related to \u201cmotion\u201d of some kind and \u201cmotion\u201d is related to \u201ctime\u201d. Things that change are distinguished from those things that are at \u201crest\u201d, those things that do not \u201cmove\u201d. Things that change are said to be in time, while those things that do not change are outside or beyond time. For example, the \u201cinalienable rights\u201d spoken of in the US Constitution are beyond \u201cchange\u201d in that they are considered timeless and beyond the tinkering of human beings. They are \u201cideals\u201d to be aspired to, to \u201cprogress toward\u201d. \u201cIdeals\u201d originate in Plato\u2019s \u201cideas\u201d, those beings that were beyond change and gave rise to the things that are. The things that are dwell in time and space, and \u201cchange\u201d is relative to location.\nOur understanding of motion or change is of something without an aim, without an end or a goal. It is chaotic, without purpose, order or reason. The sciences, for example, \u201cmove forward\u201d or \u201cprogress\u201d when their discoveries call for a revision of their basic concepts. The work of Newton as opposed to Aristotle and of Einstein and Heisenberg as opposed to Newton are examples of this. These are sometimes called \u201cparadigm shifts\u201d for they result in a change of human beings in their relations toward the world they inhabit. The practical applications of the results of those sciences\u2019 discoveries do not shift or change the paradigm itself. The latest computer model or technological gadget is available through the nano-technology that quantum physics has given to us. The whole of our Information Age and our Atomic Age is made possible by the discoveries of those physical sciences which in turn are made possible by the \u201cprogress\u201d in the theoretical insights prior to their applications. The labeling of these historical epochs is an indication that these are global phenomenon and not simply restricted to the origins of those discoveries which occurred in the West.\nWhat is considered the Age of Progress begins in the West with the greatest paradigm shift: when human beings, the animale rationale, become placed or elevated to the centre of created things. With this shift, the Age of Humanism begins. Humanism and the Age of Progress go hand-in-hand and begin when human beings\u2019 view their relationship to nature as one of conquest and domination and not one of reverence; human beings take their fate into their own hands. To attempt to understand the USA and North America, for instance, first begins with a recognition that they are the only societies that do not have a history from before the Age of Progress; and because of this they have become the world leaders in embracing change as progress since their relationship to the land about them was one of conquest and domination. Sometimes novelty is confused with progress, but our fascination with the \u201cnew and improved\u201d is counter-balanced by the old lament of \u201cthey don\u2019t make \u2019em like they used to\u201d. While change itself is perceived to have no goal or end, progress does and it seeks its end in \u201cperfection\u201d.\nThere is no question that there has been \u201cprogress\u201d in some areas. No one who has had a sick loved one is not grateful for the progress in the medical sciences, for instance. How can we not be grateful for the eradication of a disease that has killed human beings? It is hard for me to consider as sane those who do not see progress in this area. Our current attempts to find a vaccine to counteract the Covid-19 virus is another example of how our beliefs in the scientific method will allow us to, at some point, bring this disease under control. But in looking at the progress of the medical sciences and of the arts and sciences, we must also consider what has been lost in our acceptance of our technological fate. To speak of fate is to speak of something over which we have no control or choice. Is there really any choice other than the desire for change and progress if one wishes to live in society at the moment?\nCan we rightly speak of \u201cprogress\u201d in the arts or are the various movements in the arts simply changes in techniques and content which merely bring about novelty of some kind? In the arts, \u201cchange\u201d is obvious, but is it \u201cprogress\u201d in the sense that it has an end or goal in view? All artists attempt to make us \u201csee anew\u201d and to seek out new possibilities in the things that are.  Is this seeking out of new \u201cpossibilities\u201d for their own sake \u201cprogress\u201d as we are trying to understand it? Does a painting by Picasso exhibit progress over a painting by Titian, for example? Picasso himself lamented that he was not a greater artist than the Old Masters because he allowed himself to succumb to the temptations of popularity and money which, in turn, caused him to produce simply \u201cnovelty\u201d, sub-standard works, for which he was well-paid and lauded by the public.\nOur approach to art, our seeking for its purpose and meaning, now focuses on the artist as the creator and producer of the work of art rather than on the work of art itself. When I taught the novel The Catcher in the Rye some of my students wished to claim that its hero, Holden Caulfield, suffered from bi-polar disorder and this caused him to view the world as he did. I related to the students some of the biographical facts of Salinger\u2019s life: that as a soldier in the US Army he was among the first to land at Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-Day, took part in the battle of the Hurtgen Forest in Germany, and that he was among the first American soldiers to liberate the Dachau concentration camp. All of these events occurred while he was writing the novel. Such experiences would challenge any faith in the belief in the moral \u201cprogress\u201d of humanity. But my question  to the students was; does the novel speak to the truth about the human condition and about our human experience, and is this truth, this illumination and uncovering, constrained by the fact that we can label it with the concept of \u201cbi-polar disorder\u201d? I mentioned to the students a comment made by the psychiatrist R. D. Laing that \u201cInsanity is a sane reaction to an insane world\u201d, and if this is so, if there is some truth in Laing\u2019s comment, is not the artist that we might consider insane not revealing to us a view of our world that we would rather not see nor have to deal with? Canadian writer Margaret Atwood in a talk at which I was present said, \u201cWe like our artists to have tortured souls\u201d. Has not our \u201cAge of Progress\u201d simply brought an age of  mass meaninglessness? Has our \u201ctechnological progress\u201d been able to bring about a corresponding progress in our morality and, thus, in our humanity and in our human being-in-the-world?\n3. \u201cLabels are a necessity in the organization of knowledge, but they also constrain our understanding.\u201d Discuss this statement with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nThe first question we ask ourselves with Title #3 is: what is a label? Labels are language attached to an object which provide information or act as a symbol to indicate what that thing is. To label some thing is to first make an assertion about the thing and then to place it in a classification which provides a structure and a system. It is an assertion of what a thing is and, at the same time, what it is not; and it provides the horizon and delimitation from within which the thing is to be viewed. The determination of what the thing is and where it should be placed, its classification, how the thing comes to a stand, comes first and the label is later applied For labels to be applied, assertions must first be made. For an assertion to be made, the object must be present to us in some way, and the \u201chow\u201d of our disposition towards the object and over the object is determined ahead of time. All of our areas of knowledge are designated by labels and you know ahead of time what to expect (and what is expected of you) before you enter a physics class or a Language A class.\nLabels, too, are things and they provide us with a means of organizing information or data so that it can be easily accessible. These means of organizing and organization are sometimes referred to as \u201ctaxonomies\u201d.  Taxonomy\u00a0is the practice , the action, of identifying different things, classifying them into categories, and naming them; labeling is a naming. All things, both living and non -living, are classified into distinct groups with other similar things and given a scientific name or an identifying label. Given the abundance of information regarding things which are ready-to- hand for our disposal necessitates the requirement of a system of organization. For example, without the Dewey-Decimal System, a library would be a chaos of books.\nWe have all experienced the frustration that occurs due to the mislabeling of things whether it be something as simple as going to the supermarket and not finding the item we are looking for in the place where we believe it should be,  or doing research online and not finding the information we are seeking in an effective and efficient manner because it has not been properly defined and labeled. More ominously and dangerously, inadequate labeling creates confusion and may be used to obfuscate things so that we are unable to distinguish between the truth and non-truth of the things that are asserted. The QAnon movement is an example of the misuse of labels in providing information.\nThe constraints involved in \u201clabeling\u201d are that they occur after the essence and the content of a thing has already been determined; the definitions of things will, also, be pre-determined under their structures and systems. In the Human Sciences, for instance, the definition of \u201cwhat\u201d human beings are has already been determined; \u201cwho\u201d human beings are creates problems for the analysis of the data because it is not so numerically pliable. We can see the constraints of our labeling most clearly and powerfully in the manner in which our information technologies consider what \u2018knowledge\u201d is. \u201cKnowledge\u201d is \u201cinformation\u201d. The word \u201cinformation\u201d may be broken down thus: \u201c- ation\u201d that which is responsible for, the \u201cform\u201d, so that it may \u201cinform\u201d.  Labels may in fact be a necessity for the organization of all the possible \u201cinformation\u201d available to us, but whether or not this information is \u201cknowledge\u201d is an entirely different matter. The constraint determined by labeling is that a definite mode of questioning is already pre-delineated in our areas of knowledge. Through this manner of questioning, the answer is already given in advance i.e. a definite range of answers is already demarcated. No matter how far these areas of knowledge may be developed, they will never get beyond what they have already decided about their object of study and what knowledge of it consists in.\nArt and artists constantly engage against the status quo established by our labeling and try to get us to see and understand common things, the ready-to-hand things, differently. In our labeling, how the thing which we are seeing may be used is at the heart of our pre-determination of what the thing is. To the left is a picture of a painting by the artist Andy Warhol, one of over 50 which he created, of the label of Campbell\u2019s Tomato Soup. Other paintings by Warhol are of different types of soup. It would seem that Warhol wishes us to reflect on the label itself as art and to consider the significance of its use and our demeanor towards its use. Is he making a statement regarding life and its everydayness?\nFountain\nThe attempt to disassociate the object from its use is made even more startlingly (and controversially) in the work entitled \u201cFountain\u201d by Marcel Duchamp, a French artist from the earlier 20th century. Both Warhol\u2019s and Duchamps works are done with some irony and humour. We, of course, are aware that the object is used for male urination, but does the \u201cfountain\u201d refer to its use or to its shape as an object? The constraint of our labeling of things is to limit the manner in which we see them; and artists are continually challenging us to see the things about us in a different light and in a different manner to disassociate an object from its use.\nAnother example of the constraints imposed by labeling is provided in the painting by Rene Magritte. The Treachery of Images (French: La Trahison des images) is a 1929 painting by\u00a0surrealist\u00a0painter\u00a0Ren\u00e9 Magritte. It is also known as This is Not a Pipe and The Wind and the Song. In discussing the painting, Magritte said: \u201cThe famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it\u2019s just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture \u201cThis is a pipe\u201d, I\u2019d have been lying!\u201d Again, the tone is one of irony and humour, although there is a seriousness to it by calling it \u201cThe Treachery of Images\u201d. The images, representations, language, labels that we attach to things can, indeed, be treacherous.\n4. \u201cStatistics conceal as much as they reveal.\u201d Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nYou are probably familiar with the phrase \u201cThere are lies, damned lies, and statistics\u201d which is falsely attributed to the American writer Mark Twain, although he has been noted as using the phrase. The original source is unknown. What the phrase speaks to is our propensity to believe in the persuasive power of numbers, particularly in the Human Sciences\u2019 use of\u00a0statistics,\u00a0their use to bolster weak\u00a0arguments, or to believe that the thing that they are attempting to describe has been fully revealed in its truth through the numbers. It is also sometimes colloquially used to doubt the statistics used to prove an opponent\u2019s point. Statistics are means to provide evidence to support an assertion about what something is.\nWe can see from the title itself that \u201cconcealing\u201d and \u201crevealing\u201d are essential elements of what we mean by \u201ctruth\u201d, the \u201cactual\u201d, the \u201creal\u201d;  and that to have \u201cknowledge\u201d of some thing, that thing must be \u201crevealed\u201d to us in some way and come to a stand whether as a correspondence between the images in our minds and the objects or things outside of us, or in the coherence of the logical steps necessary to make an assertion and, at the same time, a judgement regarding the thing, or in the recognition of the possibilities or potentialities for the thing\u2019s practical use to meet our own ends. The attempt to point to the \u201cactual\u201d, the \u201creal\u201d is what the use of statistics in the search for knowledge is all about and why it is given pre-eminence as a means of providing evidence. This is due to the Human Sciences attempt to mirror the rigour of the Natural Sciences with regard to its statements and judgements about what is. The difficulty, though, is that the object under study in the Human Sciences is much more complex than the object under study in the Natural Sciences.\nFor example in Economics, during the crash of the housing markets in 2008, some statisticians attempted to use Heisenberg\u2019s probability equations to measure the risk involved for the banks in various investments, even though they were warned by the quantum scientists that this could not be done as \u201cmacro\u201d materials do not behave in the same way as sub-atomic materials behave. However, the obscurity and technical nature of the data given to the CEO\u2019s of the banks by these statisticians impressed the CEOs and ultimately was one of the factors causing them to make the bad judgements that caused their banks to collapse. One of the difficulties with statistics is that in them we will sometimes see what we wish to see. The judgement of the object under study will be pre-determined prior to and during the analysis of the data. \u201cObjectivity\u201d is not possible since the observer is bound by his/her methods and means of analysis to understand the object in a certain way. The Human Sciences and the statistics used within them are the products of Western white European culture.\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic at the moment, statistics are proving to be most useful in both the containment and treatment of the disease. The fiasco that has occurred in the USA\u2019s response to the pandemic is not a result of the statistics (and science\u2019s use of those statistics), but of those who would rather \u2018deny\u2019 the \u201cfacts\u201d and the \u201creality\u201d of the disease that the statistics reveal. Such a denial is not a \u201cskepticism\u201d as we spoke of in title #1 because it is not based on reason, but it is an irrational denial which views the science skeptically based on various private needs. While one may question the validity and truth of the conditions and the reality that the statistics \u201creveal\u201d, attempting to \u201cconceal\u201d the reality of the disease and its effects is not what most of us would call a \u201csane\u201d response.\nWhen considering statistics we need to ask the basic 5Ws and H questions: who did the study? what are the statistics attempting to measure and reveal? where did the study take place? when did the study take place and who was asked? (was the study timely?) how were the subjects asked and what form was the asking? why was the study conducted in the first place and to what is the study being compared? Asking and answering these questions when you are working through the examples that you are using to write about and support the assertions that you are making with regard to this title will help you to construct your response.\n5. \u201cAreas of knowledge are most useful in combination with each other.\u201d Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nOur word \u201ctechnology\u201d comes from two Greek words: techne and logos. There is no single word in Greek that would be equivalent to \u201ctechnology\u201d as we understand it and the fusion of these two words came about sometime in the 17th century. The word literally means \u201cknowing and making\u201d and it indicates the co-penetration of the arts and sciences that is the most clear characteristic of our modern age. The \u201cknowing\u201d is the logos and the techne is the \u201cmaking\u201d. It is our manner or mode of viewing the world, the things about us including other human beings, and it is the manner of how we view ourselves: what we are and who we are. How we view works of art today has come to be understood as aesthetics. The word comes from the Greek aisthesis meaning what we understand as \u201csense perception\u201d or \u201csensory apprehension\u201d or \u201cempiricism\u201d, and it indicated the view that examines the work of art as an \u201cobject\u201d in much the same way that the sciences approach the objects of their areas of study and knowledge. The process of viewing is called \u201ccreative projection\u201d and we are engaged in a \u201cproject\u201d. We focus on \u201cspecialization\u201d in our studies, but this \u201cspecialization\u201d is really the manner of viewing of the object of study or the object at hand as it reveals itself to us in our areas of knowledge.\nFor example, if you wish to enter \u201cMed School\u201d you will probably need to have one year of Biology with lab, one year of General Chemistry with lab, one year of Organic Chemistry with lab, one semester of Biochemistry, one year of Physics with lab and one year of English. These pre-requisites indicate what we believe is \u201cuseful\u201d to know with regard to what we consider \u201cthe study of medicine\u201d to be, and they are clearly combinations of our various areas of knowledge in some cases. This is the logos side of \u201ctechnology\u201d; and since the object of study is other human beings, it illustrates what we have come to define human beings as being. For someone involved in medicine, these fields of study are what will bring human beings to \u201clight\u201d for them. But is this all that human beings are?\nThese initial pre-requisites are what universities will require you to study. The techne side, the \u201cknow how\u201d of bringing about the end of good health, will require other subjects in order for you to complete your study. While it is nature that ultimately decides what \u201cgood health\u201d will be in a patient, the doctor is a facilitator, an abettor, in that her techne, her \u201cknow how\u201d,  will enable nature to take its proper course and bring about \u201cgood health\u201d. The \u201cart\u201d of the doctor is \u201cin another, through another, and for another\u201d. She is not a \u201ccreator\u201d or a \u201cmaker\u201d of good health, but a facilitator helping nature achieve its proper end.\nClearly, our approach to medicine is quite different than the Greek approach where it was called \u201cthe art of medicine\u201d, and the Greek philosopher Aristotle was fond of using analogies to medicine when discussing various subjects because his father was a doctor. The two great differences are our modern knowledge of chemistry and its combination with other sciences, and our understanding of what and who human beings are.\nLogos is that aspect of our human being which defines us whether we understand ourselves as the living creature that is capable of speech (the zoon logon echon of the Greeks) or the living animal capable of reason (the animale rationale of the Latins). What we have come to determine \u201cknowledge\u201d to be is through a logos of some kind which we believe reveals a \u201ctruth\u201d of some kind. The \u201cusefulness\u201d of such knowledge is determined by our techne or \u201cknow how\u201d; \u201cknow how\u201d is that knowledge which allows us to put knowledge to use. \u201cKnow how\u201d requires a combination of our areas of knowledge. In choosing your examples for this title, it is more than likely that you will focus on how this \u201cknow how\u201d brings about the realization of our desires or ends.\nBecause we are human beings that have \u201cneeds\u201d (what the Greeks understood as eros ), the meeting of these needs and aims or goals requires action in order to bring them about. Our actions are what we understand as our \u201cethics\u201d. They are not the \u201cprinciples\u201d of our actions;  the \u201cprinciples\u201d are already encased in our understanding of what we are as human beings. What we need is what we \u201cvalue\u201d and what we value is not something abstract or ideal that we strive to achieve in our actions but is something we have pre-determined as the purpose for our actions themselves. The latest enhancement of our technological gadgets is a striving for a perceived \u201cperfection\u201d that is the aim itself. Truth itself is One. The revealing of the things that are is what we call \u201cknowledge\u201d; knowledge and truth are integral to each other. This was understood by the Greeks as the threefold: Nature, the world of human beings, and the \u201cspeech\u201d of human beings. It was through speaking that human beings came to understand their world and their place in it. It was our speaking to others and to ourselves, the logos, that required the combination of various areas of study. A glance at the titles of the works of Aristotle indicate this. These titles were not given by Aristotle himself but by later scholars.\n6. \u201cAvoiding bias seems a commendable goal, but this fails to recognize the positive role that bias can play in the pursuit of knowledge\u201d. Discuss this statement with reference to two areas of knowledge.\nThe title focuses on \u201cbias\u201d and its positive role in the \u201cpursuit of knowledge\u201d. What is the \u201cknowledge\u201d which comes about or can come about through the \u201cslanted view\u201d of things that bias produces? When I sit in my garden, I can see the greenness of the foliage of the plants and at the same time hear the songs of the birds in the trees present there. To be able to do so requires something more than merely sense perception as a way of knowing. I am able to take in the otherness of seeing and hearing. To try to account for these things as sensation only is insufficient. Something else must be present to hold these two different things together as a single experience. That something else is what we call thought.\n\u201cBias\u201d as a view of things presupposes that assertions that are made about things, what the things are, are merely \u201copinions\u201d and that those assertions may also be \u201cfalse\u201d. The title seems to suggest that what is initiated as a \u201cslanted view\u201d could, eventually, result in an outcome that is not in itself slanted or biased. Such a view is present in many people in the USA today. The USA\u2019s Constitution and Bill of Rights initiated the \u201csystemic racism\u201d that is at the core of the American ethos. That the \u201cpeople\u201d referred to in these documents happened to be the white, European immigrants which made up the ruling class of the day and not the Native Peoples or African-American slaves is obvious to anyone who views the situation and history of the USA dispassionately. When results are favourable to the ruling class of the day, the \u201cbias\u201d inherent in their position of privilege and its viewing devolves into \u201cprejudice\u201d.\nThe Greek word for such a viewing was pseudos which did not indicate that the viewing was \u201cfalse\u201d but rather that the knowledge of the thing under discussion would remain \u201ccovered over\u201d or \u201chidden\u201d and the thing itself would not be encountered in its truth. The result would be \u201cillusory\u201d or \u201cnot real\u201d as the Greeks understood reality. It should be remembered that for Socrates, the opposite of knowledge was not \u201cignorance\u201d but \u201cmadness\u201d. Has the lack of knowledge in America reached the stage where its \u201cintentional ignorance\u201d has become madness?\nBias relates to how we view things, how our opinions may be formed. The desire to view without bias is what we would call \u201cobjectivity\u201d, a \u201cpure\u201d viewing unattended by moods or motives towards the thing that is being studied. Since we are \u201chistorical beings\u201d such a viewing is not possible. Our viewing will be determined by what we have come to \u201cvalue\u201d as a community. The \u201cbias\u201d inherent in the manner we view the world determines a priori the manner in how we will question the things that are and what knowledge of those things will be. It goes without saying that our \u201cbiases\u201d have produced many positive results. But we must reflect on the question: \u201cAt what cost?\u201d\nIn approaching the question of \u201cbias\u201d in viewing and questioning, I am going to discuss the common statement or belief \u201cLove is blind\u201d as an example. This is a modern view of love and it is related to our belief that \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the beholder\u201d. But what then is \u201cbeholding\u201d? I am going to put forward the view that love is not blind but that love is what allows us to see and recognize both ourselves (as self-knowledge) and the other, whether the other is other human beings or other things outside of ourselves.\nThe root cause of racism, for example, is an excessive love of \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d at the expense of all others who are not \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d. How does one go beyond the necessity of loving one\u2019s own to the wider loving of that which is not one\u2019s own? When love of one\u2019s own lacks moderation, it becomes something evil. Evil is, at its root, a lack of light or a denial of the light as light, and we do evil by sinning or acting against the light and by denying what is \u201crevealed\u201d in the \u201clighting up\u201d of things when they reveal themselves as what they are. This is shown in Shakespeare\u2019s play Macbeth where Macbeth denies the reality of what is \u201clit up\u201d for him in order to satisfy his lust for power. The play is not an anti-ambition diatribe, but an exhibition of the evil of \u201cthe illness should attend\u201d ambition (in Lady Macbeth\u2019s words). The play is a profoundly moral play. When Macbeth succumbs to evil and murders Duncan, his mind becomes \u201cslanted\u201d to one that only sees daggers and he brings himself and Scotland to destruction.\nWe have all had experiences with con artists and scam artists. They require hiddenness because what they do is evil. At the same time, we require privacy and hiddenness from those who would wish to do us harm. These paradoxes are some of the wonders of the human condition where it is not given to us \u201cto have it both ways\u201d. Even the dialogues of Plato are written in such a way that they will speak to those who can hear them and be silent to those who cannot and should not. In Western philosophy, the dialogues were read in similar fashion to Aristotle\u2019s treatises and this has prevented a proper understanding of them even up to today. Written discourses, such as this blog, speak to everyone and are unable to keep themselves silent from those who should not hear them. This is the case because all speech is \u201cpolitical\u201d in some fashion for it is directed to another human being about some thing and we are all beings in communities of some kind.\nIn Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave, the keepers of the fire which help create the shadows of the things made by the technites on the walls of the cave could be said to be analogous to our modern universities where their research or \u201cpursuit of knowledge\u201d is determined by corporate interests (bias) and where taxpayer money which pays for the universities is viewed as \u201cexternalities\u201d (to use the Economics term). There is no \u201cpure\u201d research in the \u201cpursuit of knowledge\u201d but only \u201cvested interests\u201d. Free thought and research is too expensive. Nevertheless, there are many positive results from this \u201cbiased\u201d research in the pursuit of knowledge. The current anti-science movement in many parts of the globe is a symptom of the reality of the nihilism and meaninglessness brought about through our technological world-view. There is a turning away from the facts so that we may affirm what is contradicted by the experience of living (climate change, for instance). But such a condition is one of madness, is it not?\nTo return to the issue of bias and the assertion that love is not blind, to define love, is to say that it is consent to the fact of authentic otherness. We love otherness not because it is other, but because it is beautiful. Plato places the tyrant  (Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, for example) as the worst human being, the most inauthentic human being, because in his self-serving \u201cotherness\u201d has completely disappeared for him. Donald Trump in the USA could also serve as an example; all his actions are self-serving, and many more Americans see this self-serving as the best way in which they will realize their \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d.\nIn the modern age, beauty has become radically subjectivized so that our belief is that \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the beholder\u201d. Our loves are determined by a vast complex of necessities and chances which constitute our desires. In all of our scientific explanations of things, we are required to discount the \u201cother\u201d as beautiful. The language I am using here is that the world before us is beautiful and our appropriate response to it is love and trust. However, over time trust was replaced by doubt as the methodological prerequisite for an exact science. It we confine ourselves to anything simply as an object, it cannot be loved as beautiful. The key difficulty is that in loving the beauty of the world as it is, how does this effect the desire to change it? With regard to our title and \u201cbias\u201d, it can be maintained that one knows more about something by loving it. In our age, reason is exalted above understanding (through the philosopher Kant and the creative projection of the imagination and intuition) and this is a reversal of the world shown to us in Plato\u2019s Cave.\nWhen we say that \u201clove is blind\u201d, this is quite the opposite of the view held in the past. In the past, love was seen as the way by which human beings were brought out of self-engrossment to find joy in the world. Today, the \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d is the self-engrossment in the satisfaction of our desires and wants: the end of love is the orgasm, not the child that results from it. Children are one of life\u2019s ways of making us recognize otherness. (The Macbeths, for example, have no children). It is through the recognition of authentic otherness that we recognize our authentic selves and in doing so find our freedom. Our desires for self-assertion and empowerment attain the opposite goals.\nThe father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, gave love a cup of poison to drink (to continue our allusions to Macbeth) when he emphasized sexuality as the peak of what love is. We are given our sense of the beauty of the world in the flame of desire that we feel when we see another human being. Our bias tends to see other human beings as objects to be used in our own self-engrossment in realizing our \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d. When the beauty of other human beings is perceived only in terms of the sexual and this instinctual urge is determinative of our way of viewing other human beings, we see how bias becomes a habit of thought, an ossified way of viewing the world which, when we act under it or within it, destroys our capacity for empathy and recognition of other human beings as being authentically other, seeing a human being as a \u201cwho\u201d and not a \u201cwhat\u201d.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nAOK History: Thoughts on Systemic Racism in North\u00a0America\nThe recent killings of African-Americans by the police in a number of cities in the USA has prompted a great social uprising demanding change captured in the slogans \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, and \u201cDefund the Police\u201d. It is believed that these police killings are a result of a \u201csystemic racism\u201d inherent in all aspects of African-American lives, and there is a demand for change in these systems and institutions with the elimination of their oppression of\u00a0 the day-to-day lives of African-Americans, as well as women and members of the LGBTQ community. Here we will attempt to give some thought to how this \u201csystemic racism\u201d arose and from what and where are its origins.\nFor someone such as myself who remembers the social upheavals of the 1960s in the USA, I had, at first, perceived the current protests as simply another event in a long line of events where African-Americans protested against their oppression and that these protests would be either brutally crushed or simply allowed to wallow and eventually fade away due to the short memories of those of us who dwell within the technological society.\nBut these protests appear to be different from the protests of the 60s. For one, they appear to have the support of the white majority in the country. In the 60s, the protests were fragmented with the whites protesting the war in Vietnam while the African-Americans expressed their anger and outrage over the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. This fragmentation is not present in the current protests going on not only in North America but around the world. They appear to have evolved into a \u201cmovement\u201d rather than merely a protest and this movement has gathered a significant amount of momentum..\nAfrican Slave Trade\nTo begin to give thought to the history of North America is to note two basic facts: the history of North America begins with the genocide of its Native aboriginal peoples; and secondly, North America itself, for whites, has no history from before the Age of Progress. While the genocide against the Natives peoples was already well underway, the first 19 or so African slaves reached what were then the British colonies in Point Comfort, Virginia, near Jamestown, in 1619, brought by British privateers who had seized them from a captured Portuguese slave ship. This was over 150 years before the American Revolutionary War and the Constitution which resulted from it. In a somewhat incredible irony (based on superstition, perhaps), the slaves were usually baptized in Africa before embarking, the irony being that enslaving a human being is perhaps the most un-Christian action that a human being can do to another human being.\nThe \u201csystemic racism\u201d that is seen not only in North America but around the world wherever white Western Europeans be they English, Spanish, Portuguese, French or Dutch, through their imperial adventures, was established when they arrived at the various shores of lands that were alien to them. Their subjugation of the aboriginal inhabitants of those lands required a \u201cmorality\u201d, a racism, that was the product of a perceived \u201csuperiority\u201d either in their Christian faith or the result of what they perceived as the superiority of their \u201ccivilization\u201d which found its concrete realization in the superiority of their weapons. The views of those conquered peoples by their conquerors were those of \u201csavages\u201d and \u201cbarbarians\u201d. One can update this racism with a look at how America has treated those who have come under the oppression of its imperialism and its building of its empire. It should not be forgotten that the price to be paid for the realization of the American Dream at home is in the human blood shed by the victims of American imperialism abroad.\nThe view of Nature held by the Native peoples of North America, for instance, was quite different from that held by the white conquerors who came with Hobbes and Locke and the Protestant or Roman Catholic Christianity embedded in their consciousness. The vastness and intractability of the land created a fear that could only be overcome through a meeting with it being a relationship of conquest. This innate fear remains present even today and manifests itself in multivarious ways in the North American psyche.\nThe early settlers of North America were unique Europeans. They brought with them the Calvinist Protestantism (Puritanism) which was a break from the traditional Christianity of Europe, and they also brought with them the new revolutionary philosophies of Hobbes and Locke as well as those of Rousseau from France which were breaks from the contemplative tradition of ancient Greece given to Medieval Europeans from the writings of Aristotle and Plato.\nRousseau\u2019s conflict with the English philosophers remains embedded within the consciousness of North Americans even today. Many of the commentaries on the need to change American society from today\u2019s protesters speak of the USA\u2019s failure to uphold the \u201csocial contract\u201d with regard to its African-American communities and peoples. There is no questioning of the goals of the overall deeper drives that provide the stimulus for the calculating technological reasoning and its conquering of the necessities of Nature,\u00a0 but rather, for a just participation in the society of which this conquering relationship is a primordial given. The desire is for the upholding of the promise held in the originating liberalism that would provide the equity, justice and liberty to allow participation in that drive and the benefits that result from technological mastery.\nTo understand North America it is necessary to understand the connections between the new physical and moral sciences of Newton and others and their acceptance by the Protestants that first came to what was a new land. The differences between ancient and modern science can be found in the writings on The Natural Sciences in this blog. The Natural Sciences: Historical Background Both Max Weber and the Marxist historians, for instance, have demonstrated the practical connection between the early Protestants and property as primarily due to the \u201cworldly asceticism\u201d of those Protestants. But the deeper connection lies in the metaphysical connections between the new sciences and the new Christianity of those Protestants.\nJefferson\u2019s Bible\nThe new physical sciences of Bacon, Galileo and Newton were accepted by the Calvinist Protestants because these sciences were a critique of Medieval Aristotelianism and thus of the Roman Catholicism which based some of its doctrine on the principles of Aristotle\u2019s understanding of nature. The new sciences critiqued the teleology of Aristotle\u2019s science as causing human beings to view the world in a way in which it was not. The theologians criticized Aristotle\u2019s science as a misleading road to \u201cnatural theology\u201d that led human beings away from the Divine Revelation in the person of Jesus Christ and the reality of His Crucifixion. The tension between these two views existed within the framers of the American Constitution with Deists such as Jefferson, Washington and Franklin on the one hand and the practicing Protestant Founders on the other. The picture of Jefferson\u2019s Bible illustrates that his Christianity would not sit well with most of today\u2019s Christians in the USA.\nHow Locke made the Hobbesian view of nature compatible with the English speaking Protestantism of the early days of America is a subject that requires too much detail for this post. Suffice it to say that his doctrine of \u201ccomfortable self-preservation\u201d as the highest end for human beings is hardly compatible with any notion of Christianity. The idea of \u201ccomfortable self-preservation\u201d became re-worded as \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d in the final Declaration of Independence replacing Locke\u2019s original word \u201cproperty\u201d.\nModern African-Americans have chosen the Rousseauian side of the tension between \u201cnatural law\u201d\u201d and \u201cpositive law\u201d that was present in America from its beginnings, but the atheism of Rousseau would hardly find a place for the majority of them at the present time. At the heart of the current protests is the cry for the fulfillment of the \u201csocial contract\u201d realized in the American Dream for all the citizens of the USA regardless of race.\nTo try to explore the reality of \u201csystemic racism\u201d and to provide some notes on its origins and its ultimate flowerings, it is necessary to speak of \u201cliberalism\u201d. In liberalism, freedom and reliance on technique are indissolubly linked, such that technology becomes the very ontology of American lives and defines who and what they are. This ontology itself is prior to any \u201c-isms\u201d and determines how those \u201c-isms\u201d are understood and interpreted by the people who hold them up as \u201cideals\u201d. This ideal of what human beings are is encapsulated in the word \u201cfreedom\u201d. This technological world-view is the common horizon that embraces both sides of what is currently understood as \u201cthe left\u201d and \u201cthe right\u201d. The \u201ctheory\u201d and the \u201cpractice\u201d within these \u201c-isms\u201d are indistinguishable and this must be understood if one is to gain access to the roots of who, what and how North America has become what and how it is.\nThe \u201csystemic thinking\u201d is prior to the systems and the institutions which are created from it and we must try, in this particular case, to understand how \u201cracism\u201d has become embedded in the systems and institutions that have been created in North America and that have since come to prominence around the world through the English-speaking and European empires and their victories in past historical wars and in the two great Wars of the 20th century. This is difficult for white people because that systemic thinking, in its commandeering, controlling and dominating stance towards the environment as \u201cobject\u201d and in the novelty which it creates, prevents any reflection on its roots because it is primarily whites who have benefited from that thinking and its results and they have come to perceive that they must somehow be given the evolving truth of things. African-Americans wish to be a part of that hope and that truth, and to also benefit from that technological dominance that has made human beings the masters of nature. But the acceptance of the viewing comes at a cost.\nThe two most important documents relating to the establishment of American society and its institutions are its \u201cDeclaration of Independence\u201d and its \u201cConstitution\u201d. The American Constitution begins: \u201c We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\u201d Clearly, \u201cthe People\u201d referred to \u201courselves and our Posterity\u201d i.e. the white founders. The African slaves, the Native Peoples, and women were not considered to be \u201cthe People\u201d. The desire for \u201ca more perfect Union\u201d indicates the divisiveness present from the very beginnings of what is known as the USA.\nThe clarification of who gets to be a \u201cperson\u201d and who doesn\u2019t was at the core of the establishment of the \u201csystemic racism\u201d that is the bulwark of white societies and their economies. Determining a subservient order for those with darker skin allowed the American founding generation (and the generations after) to define \u201call men\u201d and \u201cthe people\u201d as \u201cwhite men.\u201d As a result, they guaranteed white men the rights and liberties promised by the Constitution while preserving a thriving economy based on racial oppression. It remains a matter of debate whether or not the American Civil War was due to \u201ceconomic\u201d factors rather than the freeing of the slaves of the South or whether the freeing of the slaves was itself an \u201ceconomic factor\u201d. Subsequent American history would suggest the former rather than the latter, and that the War was not undertaken with such \u201cnoble\u201d motives as the subsequent mythology provides. It was a war over the price of commodities.\nIn \u201cThe Declaration of Independence\u201d, the attempt to hold together the permanence of \u201cnatural law\u201d with the changeableness of \u201cpositive law\u201d is clearly in evidence: \u201c\u201dWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d The \u2018men\u2019 who are \u2018created equally\u2019 are, of course, the bourgeois landowners and slave owners who framed the Declaration. The \u201cpursuits\u201d were meant to be enjoyed by a \u201cleisure class\u201d founded upon the labour of the slaves.\nThe key to how the Declaration and the Constitution came to be written was in the replacing of Locke\u2019s concept of \u201cproperty\u201d with \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d. Locke\u2019s original concept of property related to the body: each human being possessed a body through which it undertook \u201cwork\u201d and in doing so made \u201cworthless nature\u201d amenable to human needs. If all \u201cmen\u201d had a right to property, and primarily the property that was their own bodies, then slave-holding would, prima facie, be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d. White slaveholders and the States that benefited from slave holding would not agree to this, so as the Montpelier Organization notes: \u201cThe answer lies in the idea of compromise: the founders compromised their morals (many were recorded as being opposed to slavery), and power (in some cases, states bowed to slaveholding counterparts in order to ensure the Constitution would be ratified), in the name of economics. Slavery, when all was said and done, was both profitable and convenient for many white Americans\u2014and not just in the South.\u201d https://www.montpelier.org/learn/slavery-constitution-lasting-legacy The entry continues: \u201cAs lifelong bondage of enslaved African Americans became more financially viable, the indentured servitude of whites (their terms only lasted five to seven years), was phased out. The system proved itself so lucrative that law and legal precedent began to leave future governments leeway for prioritizing economy over morality.\u201d Current events in American politics continue this compromise of morality to economy both with regard to the suppression of African-Americans and to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTwo examples from literature illustrate how difficult it is for whites to gain some illumination of self-knowledge to recognize how they have benefited from systemic racism. The Nigerian writer, Chinua Achebe, accused the writer,\u00a0 Joseph Conrad, of being \u201cracist\u201d in his great novella \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d: https://polonistyka.amu.edu.pl/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/259954/Chinua-Achebe,-An-Image-of-Africa.-Racism-in-Conrads-Heart-of-Darkness.pdf, and also https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/11/06/the-trouble-with-heart-of-darkness. Today, statues of King Leopold II of Belgium are being torn down because of his imperial racist past. While there is no doubt that Conrad speaks out against, and condemns, this imperial racism in the novella, Achebe points to Conrad\u2019s almost unconscious racism in Conrad\u2019s use of symbols, motifs and metaphors in the novella which de-humanize the Africans that are presented there. A small point in Conrad\u2019s defense, the descriptions Conrad uses are for all human beings, regardless of color, and of the thin veneer that is \u201ccivilization\u201d separating us from the brutes; but the Africans are, nevertheless, still portrayed as brutes.\nA second example is Mark Twain\u2019s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a source and inspiration for Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d. Twain\u2019s novel is now the most censored book in North America (although this censoring is done with the best of intentions) as it uses language and terms denigrating African-Americans (the use of the \u201cn-word\u201d, for instance). But the novel, in illustrating Huck\u2019s education and growth, demonstrates the need to overcome what had become \u201csivilization\u201d as it was understood in the America of Twain\u2019s time (and remains in our time), and that included the recognition of the \u201chumanity\u201d of African-Americans in the character of Jim. The core theme of the book is the search for a \u2018higher morality\u201d than that present in the America of his day and our day. Twain\u2019s warning that \u201cThose attempting to find a moral\u201d in his book \u201cwould be shot\u201d is part of his effort through his humour. If these two literary geniuses, Conrad and Twain, are to be labelled \u201cracist\u201d, it is difficult to see how we mere mortals can possibly avoid being called the same. It represents the long journey ahead for those of us who must attempt to overcome the \u201csystemic racism\u201d in our views of the world.\nUnder the future \u201ctechnology of the helmsman\u201d, the skin color of the \u201chuman resources\u201d and \u201chuman capital\u201d will be a matter of indifference. The corrosiveness of the nihilism that is at the heart of our technological calculative reasoning embraces both the American \u201cRight\u201d and the American \u201cLeft\u201d within a common horizon greater than either. The American \u201cRight\u201d, those who would probably call themselves \u201cRepublicans\u201d and the roots of whose thinking reach back to Locke, appear to be longing for some lost \u201cgolden age\u201d which they do not specify exactly, though its paraphernalia seems to relate to the \u201clost cause\u201d of the American Confederacy and its symbols of white supremacy and which is prior to the 20th century\u2019s various migrations to America of people of colour, These Rightists adhere to the freedom of the individual to hold property and for the enforcement of the laws that have currently been institutionalized even though those laws prevent individuals from other races from ever attaining that property and the sense of feeling ownership for those laws created for the community. But both sides do not doubt the central fact of the North American dream which is to be realized in progress through technological advance.\nThis leads to a number of questions: do not the institutions as they exist and produce those benefits come from the same calculative rationality? are the benefits possible without those stifling institutions? can those institutions exist as participatory democracies since centralization and uniformity are part of the essence of technology? The spontaneity of freedom is made possible through the conquering of the spontaneity of nature. Both share the deeper assumptions that have made technological society possible.\nNevertheless, as I have written elsewhere, at the present time liberalism and its \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cideals\u201d are all we have, and it is our duty to ensure that the institutions and their laws which have been and are being created are directed in such a way that all human beings can enjoy the benefits of the dynamic technology that were originally envisioned in the writings of the philosophers who were the founders of what we call \u201cmodernity\u201d.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nAOK History:\nHistory: Is it a science or an art?\nHistory is different from the other Human Sciences, or indeed other sciences in general, in that the knowers or researchers cannot directly observe the past in the same way that the object of research can be observed and studied in the Natural Sciences. \u201cHistoriology\u201d is the study of history in general, the search for what its essence is, what its purpose is. \u201cHistoriography\u201d, that is, a study of the writings of history, is not a study of all of the past, but rather a study of those traces or artifacts that have been deemed relevant and meaningful by historians; and this choosing of artifacts and evidence is the most important aspect of the study of history as it attempts to aspire to \u201cscientific research\u201d. This is where the importance of \u201cshared knowledge\u201d comes into play; what we call our \u201cshared knowledge\u201d is \u201chistory\u201d and what we choose to select is determined beforehand by our culture.\nWe must distinguish between \u201cshared knowledge\u201d or culture, what is commonly called history, and \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d as independently acquired knowledge. By shared knowledge we mean the scientific or philosophic knowledge that a human being takes over from former generations or from others, what we would call \u201chistory\u201d; personal knowledge is that knowledge, whether it be scientific or philosophical in nature, that a mature scholar acquires in his unbiased discourse which is as fully enlightened as possible regarding its limits and horizons with an awareness of its presuppositions within any area of knowledge i.e. what you are attempting to learn to do here in TOK .\nIn the modern, this distinction between personal and shared knowledge tends to lose its crucial significance due to our belief in progress. In TOK, it appears that we tacitly assign the same cognitive status to both shared and personal knowledge and this impacts how we understand history and what we feel its importance is to our futures. What we deem to be \u201chistorical\u201d first appears and coincides with ratio, calculation, and thought understood as ratio and calculation. What is chosen to be called \u201chistory\u201d arises with a pre-determined understanding and definition of what human being is (the animale rationale) and this, in turn, determines what \u201cwill be held to account\u201d in the selection of what is deemed to be important in relation to that understanding of human being.\nThe question of whether history is an art or a science is as old as \u201chistoriography\u201d itself. Aristotle in his Poetics distinguishes between the poet and the historian and the philosopher and the historian. The historian presents what has happened while the poet is concerned with the kind of things that might, or could, happen: \u201ctherefore poetry is more philosophic and more serious than history, for poetry states rather the universals, history however states the particulars\u201d. (Poetics 1451a36-b11) History might be called pre-philosophic in that it concerns itself with particular human beings, particular cities, individual kingdoms, or empires, etc. The historian must choose between the important and the unimportant things when writing her report, and in her choices illuminate the universal in the individual event so that the purpose of her recording is meant to be a possession for all times. You have done much the same in your Exhibition (if you have done it correctly). The presentation is analogical.\nThe availability of those relevant traces of the past and their relevance and meaning may be influenced in many ways by factors such as ideology, perspective or purpose, but this is a \u201cmodern\u201d version of how we examine things. As knowers we seek to clarify the past and to determine whether or not what is claimed is true. In doing so, we will face problems of reliability and attitudes, and may consider the purpose of historical analysis and the issue of the nature of historical truth. \u201cHistorical truth\u201d is bound together with our understanding of truth as \u201ccorrectness\u201d and \u201ccorrespondence\u201d arising as it does from ratio and calculation.\nThe spirit of historicism (the understanding of time as history) permeates every aspect of every text and every approach to the study of and knowledge of the things of our world, and it is particularly present in the IB program. Plato viewed time as \u201cthe moving image of eternity\u201d, an infinite accretion of \u201cnows\u201d; we tend to view time as the \u201cprogress\u201d of the species towards ever greater perfection, much like how we view the latest models of our technological devices and gadgets as being more \u201cfitted\u201d towards accomplishing our ends and purposes. Our \u201cevolution\u201d and \u201cadaptation\u201d, we believe, are signs of our progress and growth as a species as we move towards ever greater \u201cperfection\u201d, both moral and physical. It is sometimes called \u201cthe ascent of man\u201d, but such a concept of human being, as an \u201cascending\u201d creature, is only possible within the technological world-view.\nWhen we speak of History as an area of knowledge, we are speaking of \u201chuman history\u201d not the history of rocks or plants or other objects that are also part of our world. These are covered in the Group 4 subjects as part of the Natural Sciences. History as an area of knowledge deals with human actions in time whether by individuals or communities so it is considered a \u201chuman science\u201d for the most part, and the approach to the study of it is a \u201cscientific\u201d one. This attempted approach to the study of history is the same as that carried out in the Natural Sciences wherein history is looked at \u201cobjectively\u201d and demands are made of it to give us its reasons. We seek for the \u201ccauses\u201d of events. This approach has given rise to one of the complaints against history and how it is studied nowadays: we can only learn about the past; we cannot learn from it. Nor do we today feel that we need to. This dearth of knowledge of history is most in evidence in America, and this is not surprising as America is the heartland of technological dynamism.\nThe spiritual crisis of our \u201ccivilization\u201d, our \u201cculture\u201d, and thus our history, is that the historical moment of technological mastery of the earth comes forth from the same science which gives us the historical sense or historicism. In the past reason, virtue and happiness were united as giving to human beings purpose and meaning for their actions. The \u201cage of progress\u201d realized its goal of freedom in the democratic equality of all human beings. But what evidence is there for the equality of all human beings when the evidence from the biological sciences would clearly suggest that human beings are not equal when it comes to what are considered the most important matters and traits? Not all human beings are \u201cfit\u201d for the ends which our culture aspires to. The question of this \u201cfittedness\u201d is the dark question of \u201cjustice\u201d in our time. Josef Stalin\u2019s cynical statement that \u201cOnly the winners get to write the history\u201d equates \u201cwinning\u201d with the ever-evolving process of \u201ctruth\u201d and its realization of the \u201cempowerment\u201d of those who can claim to be \u201cvictorious\u201d.\nModern science has shown us that the \u201cvalues\u201d of rationalism are not finally sustained in the whole of the things that are; that is, Nature is finally not rational and it is only human beings that give to nature its \u201crationality\u201d and, thus, its Being. Reason is only an instrument and it is used to provide meaning and purpose to our willing, to our desiring and creating, our knowing and making. The \u201chappiness\u201d sought for for all human beings is only achievable through the \u201clowering\u201d of the understanding of what that \u201chappiness\u201d is; and its foundations are not to be found in \u201creason\u201d and \u201cvirtue\u201d (which only the few are capable of) but in the instincts and their \u201cliberation\u201d (which is a real possibility for the many). \u201cHappiness\u201d as it is understood in its modern form is only possible where \u201cnobility\u201d and \u201cgreatness\u201d are forgotten or are not important as ends and have been replaced by \u201crecognition\u201d or \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d. Human beings know that they create their own \u201cvalues\u201d, and this is upheld by both the nihilists of the political right and the democratic libertarians of the political left.\nHistory: The Absolutist and Relativist Approaches:\nKnowledge Questions: What methods do historians use to gain knowledge? What is unique about the methodology of history compared to other areas of knowledge?\nOn what criteria can a historian evaluate the reliability of their sources? If our senses are sometimes unreliable, does this mean that eyewitness testimony is an unreliable source of evidence? Have technological developments enabled us to observe the past more directly? What challenges does archive-based history emphasize about how knowledge is shared and preserved? Is there less emphasis on collaborative research in history than there is between researchers in other areas of knowledge? How do the methods and conventions of historians themselves change over time?\nHistory deals with memory and time or temporality, the past, present and future. The knowledge questions and issues that arise in the study of history rest in two mutually exclusive positions with regard to the writing of history (historiography) and the \u201cre-searching\u201d or study of history (historiology). The two positions are commonly referred to as the absolutist position and the relativist position. The discussion below attempts to illustrate both positions.\nAccording to relativism, all human thought is historical and hence unable to grasp anything eternal or \u201cunhistorical\u201d; there is no permanence to things or to thoughts. Plato views time as \u201cthe moving image of eternity\u201d. According to Plato (an absolutist), philosophizing means to leave the cave where things may be viewed in their \u201cabsolute\u201d truth beyond opinion. To we moderns, all philosophizing and thinking essentially belongs to the \u201chistorical world\u201d or the cave, what we call our \u201cculture\u201d, \u201ccivilization\u201d, and involves opinions based on these contexts. This belief is what is called historicism and it is a recent arrival on the historical scene (early 19th century) but it continues to gain preeminence in our thinking and viewing of the world as it erodes what we have come to believe during the age of progress. The two most prominent thinkers of historicism are the German philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger; and while these thinkers are reviled in the English-speaking West, their thought permeates many aspects of the shared knowledge in the West through its interpretations and applications by lesser thinkers.\nHistory always concerns \u201cindividuals\u201d whether those individuals be individual groups, individual human beings, individual achievements, individual \u201ccivilizations\u201d or the one \u201cindividual process\u201d of human civilization from its beginnings to the present, and so on. In the IB, Group 3 subjects are called \u201cIndividuals and Societies\u201d and History is listed as a Group 3 subject although it is given a special distinction as an Area of Knowledge in TOK. History can be our \u201cpersonal history\u201d or our \u201cshared history\u201d, and both provide knowledge of some type. The historical sense shows us that we create history, whether by \u201cjust doing it\u201d as far as our own actions are concerned or by living in a society along with others and sharing their beliefs, customs, etc. The outcomes of our personal and social/political actions are matters of chance so we study history so as to control the outcomes making chance as ineffective as possible. History is determined by the technological and its rendering is \u201ca giving an account of\u201d or \u201cgiving an account for\u201d.\nHistory and the approach to it is most closely related to inductive argumentation similar to experimentation in the natural sciences. Things are explored through what is called research, and an attempt is made to arrive at the \u201ctimeless\u201d philosophic questions regarding the incident, individual or event chosen in order to get at its \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhy\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d. This method is possible because of the positivism that lies at the ground of how we view the world: we no longer discern any difference between historical and philosophical questions. The concepts which we use are viewed as entirely historical in that they are seen as products of our own individual societies and their historical backgrounds. Technology and The Human Sciences Pt 2: Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx\nIs the study of history relevant? What is the purpose of its study? Many people today hold the relativist view that the standards that we use to make judgements in history are nothing more than the ideals adopted by our society or our \u201ccivilization\u201d that are embodied in its way of life or its institutions. But, according to this view, all societies have their ideals, cannibal societies (indigenous societies, if you like) no less than \u201ccivilized\u201d ones, fascist societies as well as democratic ones. If the principles of historical choice are sufficiently justified by the fact that they are accepted by a society such as is understood by the pragmatists, are the principles of fascism or fanaticism or cannibalism as defensible or sound as those of democracy or \u201ccivilized\u201d life?\nIf there is no standard higher than the ideal(s) of our society,\u00a0 are we unable to take a critical distance from that ideal? But the mere fact that we can raise the question of the worth of the ideals of our own society shows that there is something in human beings that is not in slavery to society, call it \u201cfreedom\u201d if you will, and that we are able (and obligated) to look for a standard with reference to which we can judge the ideals of our own as well as any other society (c.f. Plato and the Cave). All societies are caves. This standard that we are driven and obligated to search for, according to Plato, is the Good, the \u201cbest society\u201d or regime, \u201cthe good life\u201d, the \u201cgood human being\u201d, etc. One of the purposes of the study of history is its aid in helping us to discover what these are through the \u201cshared knowledge\u201d that has been handed down and over to us.\nOur modern study of History teaches us that we can become wise in all matters of secondary importance, but that we must remain ignorant in the most important matters: the historian cannot have any knowledge regarding the ultimate principles of his/her choices i.e. regarding their soundness or unsoundness other than blind preferences. Our inability to gain any genuine knowledge (of the absolutist type) of what is good or right or to recognize all preferences as equally respectable leads to the position that only unlimited tolerance is in accordance with reason; but this leads to an \u201cabsolutist\u201d position from a position that rejects all \u201cabsolutist\u201d positions.\nAbsolutist positions, so it is said, are based upon the false premise that human beings can know the good. The Chinese, for example, wish to tell the Japanese what needs to be included in their textbooks regarding Japanese behaviour and atrocities during WW 2. With the relativist position, the Japanese are correct in rejecting this intrusion. Japanese citizens cannot know what behaviours occur when societies become imperial, including their own. What, then, is the purpose for studying history? What \u201ctruth\u201d can we learn from it? What standards need to be applied to it? Parallel studies can be made with regard to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or to the history of African-Americans. Clearly, Americans are being given different views of their imperial wars and their domestic oppression of their people than the views of those who are suffering from those imperial wars and that oppression. The current Covid-19 pandemic and the protests over police killings of African-Americans illustrate that the \u201ctruth\u201d and the \u201cfacts\u201d of science and history are now being put to the test as they clash with the desires and views of the political populists.\nThe relativist position has a respect for individuality and a respect for diversity. Tolerance is one ideal or \u201cvalue\u201d among many and is not intrinsically superior to its opposite: intolerance. But it is practically (in practice) impossible to leave this at the equality of all choices or preferences. If this equality of choices is the case, then genuine choice is nothing but resolute or deadly serious decision. Such decision is more akin to intolerance than to tolerance. One sees these outcomes of these decisions in the world\u2019s daily news events or in the discussions that you may be having in your TOK classes.\nThe relativist position is a late product from the \u201cage of progress\u201d and it is also a consequence of the thinking contained in \u201clogical positivism\u201d. The \u201cbelief in progress\u201d was the belief that the current age is superior to all previous ages in that the evolution of the \u201chistorical process\u201d showed a \u201cprogression\u201d to the current historical situation which was far superior to previous civilizations, much like the human species in its evolution is \u201csuperior\u201d to the apes from which it evolved; this superiority rests in reason. The past was only a preparation for the present. The positivists\u2019 approach began as an overturning of the idealism of Hegel in favour of a realism that looked at \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201creality\u201d, and that life itself delivers evidence of this progress so that the \u201cwinners of history\u201d are somehow in touch with an\u00a0 \u201cevolving truth of history\u201d and therefore get to write the history. That which is new is superior to that which is old.\nWe are in need of historical studies to familiarize ourselves with the complexity of these issues.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nCT 1: Knowledge and the Knower: Historical\u00a0Background\nCT 1: The Knower: Ontological\nWe will approach the topic of the historical background of who we are as knowers from two different perspectives: the ontological, which defines what human beings are; and the ethical which illustrates how human beings behave or act or how human beings have acted historically. From these approaches we hope to get a better understanding of who we are and who we think we are regarding what we consider \u201cknowledge\u201d.\nBecause the IB Program is a product of Western history and experience, this understanding of the historical background of \u201cthe knower\u201d will be Western understanding. It should be supplemented by someone with knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads as well as other Eastern texts which I myself do not have.\nThe understanding of ourselves for those of us in the West begins with the Greeks. For the Greeks, knowledge was of three areas: physics, ethics and \u201cspeaking\u201d. These three broad episteme roughly corresponded to our asking the 5 Ws and H questions: \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d we are as human beings, \u201chow\u201d we are in our manner of being or action, \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d we are in our historical and geo-political existence, and \u201cwhy\u201d we are as we are being that unique being that takes it own existence in hand. This taking our existence in hand is what we mean by \u201cexperience\u201d.\nLanguage, \u201cspeech\u201d, has a most important role along with \u201cthe world\u201d and human being itself. Language is the discussions we hold with one another as well as our discussions we have with ourselves concerning ourselves. \u201cSpeech\u201d is the way we behave, a natural pre-scientific view of the world which illuminates who we are and what we are as human beings. This is why the Greeks defined human being as the zoon logon echon, the living being that can speak and so defines its being in and through such speaking.\nThe Greek word for language, speech is logos. It became translated as \u201clogic\u201d after Aristotle and the Latins equated it with ratione, the \u201crational\u201d so that human being came to be defined as the animale rationale, the rational living being. \u201cLogic\u201d was originally conceived as all speaking, and it was connected with the study of grammar. As grammar became the study and rules of \u201cright speaking\u201d, logic became the study and rules of \u201cright thinking\u201d.\nLanguage was understood as speaking to each other about something, of some thing. This speaking about something was of the revealing of that thing, of bringing that thing to light. In such revealing, the thing becomes defined and determined or ordered. Logic as the science of speaking is the revealing of something, allowing the world and human existence and things in general to be seen. This uncovering of things that are \u201chidden\u201d is what is understood as \u201ctruth\u201d. This uncovering found its height in mathematical knowledge. What is important here is to understand that the essence of human being, what human beings are is the revealing of things in the world.\nWe have an understanding of ourselves as \u201cpersons\u201d. From where do the concepts of \u201cperson\u201d, \u201cpersonal\u201d, and \u201cpersonality\u201d arise? Originally, \u201cperson\u201d comes from \u201cp ersona \u201d the Latin word for \u201cmask\u201d or \u201cwhat is before the face\u201d. It originates from Greek drama where actors wore masks to indicate their roles in the performance they were about to perform. Personalitas originally designates the \u201crole\u201d that a persona indicates or illustrates, but it has the sense of the word \u201cdignity\u201d implied in it so that the designation of a \u201cpersonality\u201d was someone who was distinguished and dignified by the \u201crole\u201d that they played in events or in the society or community of which they were a member. It was considered an honour and a duty of a citizen to perform in the Greek dramas as these were more \u201creligious\u201d in nature and not merely as educational and a source of entertainment. A \u201crole\u201d is a particular way and manner of being a human being and it is very much related to its origins in Greek drama. In the words of T.S. Eliot in his \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\u201d: it is \u201cTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet\u201d. What \u201croles\u201d do we think we play in our society today?\nFor the Romans, particularly Cicero, a persona is someone who possesses a high degree of the quality of what a human being is as such: the animal rationale. \u201cDignity\u201d is thus grounded on ratio, the animal possessing reason and the capability of discourse. The concept of the persona and of the human being are closely linked and are grounded in the determination of human being. This concept of the animal rationale is still with us today in, for example, the Roe vs. Wade decision regarding abortion by the U.S. Supreme Court wherein the Supreme Court determined that foetuses were not \u201cpersons\u201d in the whole sense.\nSt. Augustine 5th Century\nWith the arrival of Christianity, human being comes to be determined as a \u201cmixture of body and soul\u201d in the writings of St. Augustine in the 5th century. This determination rested, too, on the notion of human being as the animal rationale. In the Christian determination, the human being, the persona, was\u00a0determined as an individual soul whose goal and salvation\u00a0 lie in gaining eternal life as an individual. God is determined as the essential unity of the three personae: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. (Augustine) Here we find the beginnings of the shift in the concept of the persona in the direction of the individual, that he or she is their own goal and purpose in their search for certainty and surety regarding one\u2019s individual salvation.\nIn the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas determines human being as the \u201cperson\u201d who is \u201crational\u201d by nature (in essence) and is incorporated in an individual body. Thomas\u2019s understanding signified the individual self-sufficiency of a rational being: the independence of the human being, the persona, comes to the fore. The emphasis here stresses the \u201cfree will\u201d and responsibility of the individual in their choices and decision-making, their morals and ethics.\nRene Descartes\nThe French philosopher Rene Descartes takes up the concepts of human being that were handed over to him to develop an entirely new concept of the \u201cpersonality\u201d: ego cogito, ergo sum, the basic principle of modern philosophy: \u201cI think, therefore, I am\u201d. The ego cogito is essential for within it human being is determined through its self-certainty which corresponds to an understanding of truth as \u201ccertainty\u201d.\u00a0 The ratio that was historically involved in all determinations of human being receives the particular form of self-certainty (\u201cI know because\u2026.) on the basis of which certainty about anything else first becomes possible. This means that the ego in Descartes\u2019 principle is the subject lying at the root of everything. The human being determines itself now wholly in and from itself and no longer needs Church doctrine; the essence of human being is determined according to its capacity for self-determination, its \u201cfreedom\u201d to choose, its freedom to make promises and to enter into contracts.\nImmanuel Kant\nThe German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, determined the next stage historically in his distinguishing the difference between human beings and things (Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals) and with respect to the determination of the human being according to three elements, one of which is the \u201cperson\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0( Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone). For Kant, a thing can certainly exist in itself but its independence, its \u201cfreedom\u201d, is only ever a mere means. In contrast, a being that is rational \u2014 for Kant, reason is the power of the principles\u2013 can never be a mere means. Because it has reason, it is its own end. The three elements of human being in Kant, are the \u201canimal\u201d that is humanity, the \u201chumanity\u201d that is humanity (together with the \u201canimal\u201d giving the animal rationale), and \u201cpersonality\u201d as a rational and responsible being. Kant distinguishes between the reason that is thinking and apprehending, and the reason that is \u201caccountability\u201d, that is, responsibility, the ethical. This distinction is important for we all know of many human beings who think according to the principle of non-contradiction but who are not at all responsible. The human being, however, is responsible in that it is free to act according to principles. These principles are ethical or as Kant says \u201cpractical principles\u201d, praxis. For Kant, the highest is the categorical imperative; the categorical imperative was an improvement on the Golden Rule: \u00a0Act as you would want all other people to act towards all other people. Kant\u2019s categorical imperative demands us to act according to the maxim that you would wish all other rational people to follow, as if it were a universal law. For Kant, autonomy/freedom to decide constitutes the modern personality.\nKant further identifies \u201cpersonality\u201d with \u201ccharacter\u201d. For Kant, \u201ccharacter\u201d is the mode and manner that a cause is a cause (see the etymology of the word \u201ccharacter\u201d). Kant distinguishes two types of causes: those of intelligible character and those of empirical character. This is in contrast to Hume. Kant needs these two types of character for his determination of human being as a responsible being. A \u201cresponsible\u201d being must have free will as the cause of his actions. This free will is not found in the human world. In this world, the empirical world, human will is not free; it is conditioned, that is, its character is empirical. \u201cPersonality\u201d is equivalent to character\u201d. Personality is a being that is and acts according to its own responsibility. For Kant, all other determinations of personality derive from this.\nThe Knower: Ethical\nFrom where does our emphasis on personal knowledge and \u201cexperience\u201d arise in the West for it was not part of the thinking of the ancients at the beginning of Western thinking although phronesis was a way of knowing held in high esteem by both Plato and Aristotle? During the period which is called the Renaissance, a great paradigm shift occurs in what was called \u201cknowing\u201d, and this was the result of changes in how the world as Nature was understood, and thus how human beings were understood,\u00a0 and how human beings understood themselves. The French philosopher Rene Descartes is primarily responsible for this change, and the change is based on what our understanding of knowledge and truth are.\nWith this paradigm shift brought about by Descartes and others before and after him, what is called \u201chumanism\u201d comes to the fore with its focus on human beings\u2019 central place in Nature and in the whole of things. This change occurs during the 15th and 16th centuries with the change in the understanding of the \u201cperson\u201d. Humanism could also be said to find one of its origins in the arrival and grounding of algebra in mathematical thinking. In the search for certainty and surety of human beings\u2019 salvation and redemption as a \u201cpersonal\u201d event in the Protestant Reformation within Christianity, and in the arrival of modern science in the\u00a0 experiments of Galileo, and in the philosophy of Rene Descartes where human \u201csubjectivity\u201d is grounded and where Nature itself is understood differently from previous interpretations, we have a great paradigm shift of how human beings understood themselves and their place within the world.\nEnglish-speaking teachers of philosophy and theory of knowledge have rarely paid attention to the two most comprehensive thinkers, the great anti-theological/atheist thinkers of the West: Jean Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche.\u00a0 There are a number of reasons for this and to go into all of them would require far more writing than this post would or could bear. Many of them will be touched upon in other areas of these writings. How has the thought of Rousseau been received and understood by English-speaking teachers of philosophy and Theory of Knowledge?\nBertrand Russell\nIf one is familiar with the English-speaking tradition of philosophy (I will say, for the moment, the materialist, empirical, \u201cthe analytical school\u201d), Rousseau has been called an \u201cunsystematic poet\u201d, a man quite incapable of the sustained and disciplined thought necessary to the true philosopher. This account can be seen from the writings of Jeremy Bentham right up to the writings of Karl Popper. Bertrand Russell\u2019s account of Rousseau in The History of Western Philosophy, where Rousseau is dismissed as a self-indulgent poet, is filled with Russell\u2019s contempt and anger for the man \u2018whose thought is so filled with contradictions of such an obvious nature that they could be discovered by any high school student of average ability\u2019. These, shall I say, misreadings of Rousseau have caused a lack of serious attention to this thinker which has resulted in the darkening of our self-understanding and the dimming of our understanding of ourselves as knowers and the consequences of this dimming for life and thought.\nThe ascendancy of the English-speaking peoples (and the IB Diploma Program is but one outgrowth or flowering of this ascendancy) has been with us historically from the Battle of Waterloo to the victories in the two great wars of the 20 th century. It was achieved under the rule of various species of \u201cbourgeois\u201d. The members of this elite class felt their right to rule was self-evident since it was not seriously questioned at home and they were successfully extending their empires around the world. The constitutional liberalism, empowered by technological progress, was justified by various permutations and combinations of John Locke\u2019s contractualism and utilitarianism. English-speaking political philosophy, understood as the theory of living well within communities, has largely been concerned with emendations to Locke\u2019s account. But why be concerned with Rousseau who in many respects agreed with Locke?\nRousseau is the primary instigator of that period which has come to be called the Romantic Period. Because of Rousseau\u2019s influence, what we know as \u2018German Idealism\u2019, the philosophies of Immanuel Kant, Hegel, and Marx get their initiation. This is because within Rousseau we come upon the presence of the concept \u2018history\u2019: the temporal process in which beings are believed to have acquired their abilities. By History is not meant \u2018historiography\u2019. Historiography is our study of the written account of human history and is included in our Part 3 subjects, the Human Sciences, or as a distinct area of knowledge in itself here in TOK. The meaning of \u2018history\u2019 used here is ontological: it is a realm of being in which human beings dwell. We call this realm \u201ctime\u201d.\nIn the writings of Kant, for instance, English-speaking philosophers were deflected from the true intent of his writings by his statement that David Hume, the British philosopher, had awoken him from his \u201cdogmatic slumber\u201d and so they looked at him from within their own philosophical tradition and have, up till now, tried to make him part of their own philosophical tradition. But Kant\u2019s chief encounter was with the philosophy of Rousseau and there are far more references to Rousseau in his work than to Hume. (This is not to deny Rousseau\u2019s debt to Hobbes and Locke, both of whom established the history of English philosophy, but Rousseau is profoundly critical of that debt).\nCharles Darwin\nFor the English-speaking peoples, \u2018history\u2019 becomes part of our \u2018shared knowledge\u2019 in the discoveries and writings of Charles Darwin. While the historical sense was present in English writings well before Darwin, the historical sense becomes central through the writings of Darwin because it was at the heart of the most important activity of the 19 th century\u2014Natural Science. It is said that Darwin\u2019s main contribution to our shared knowledge was not \u2018evolution\u2019, but how evolution took place: through \u2018natural selection\u2019. Darwin\u2019s chief concern, however, was not Natural Selection, but the question of Creation or Modification. (See Life and Letters, vol. II p. 371). \u201cModification\u201d, in Darwin\u2019s sense, is a synonym for History understood as the temporal process in which beings acquire their abilities, that beings ultimately have no essence. Darwin\u2019s thinking is not possible without, first, the thought of Rousseau. Once History becomes part of our shared knowledge, what happens to the ahistorical political science of Locke who has provided the foundation of our English-speaking political and social institutions?\nJohn Locke\nLocke\u2019s contractualism is ahistorical. The American statesman, Thomas Jefferson, reveals this when he says in the American Declaration of Independence: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d. Jefferson\u2019s Constitution is an attempt to bring together both Locke and Rousseau. Being \u201cendowed by one\u2019s Creator\u201d and possessing \u201cinalienable rights\u201d are ahistorical principles. Shifting Locke\u2019s \u201cright to property\u201d to the right of the pursuit of happiness is possibly the result of Thomas Paine\u2019s, a student of Rousseau\u2019s, influence on Jefferson. Locke himself was an atheist even though he wrote a book entitled The Reasonableness of Christianity. While being a man of sobriety or seriousness, he was not without a sense of humour nor without a sense of irony. These contradictions are part of the everyday reality of American and other English-speaking political and social institutions today.\nJohn Rawls\nThe attempt to hold together history and ahistorical contractualism (that which is beyond time or permanent and that which is within time as motion or change) has made English-speaking political philosophy become thin to the point where it has become the sheer formalism of the analytical tradition. One can find an attempt at this formalism in John Rawls\u2019 book A Theory of Justice. As a cautionary note, I would say that even though our academic curriculum and our manner of knowing is dominated by the perspectivism of historicism, our freedom from historicism in our practical affairs has preserved us, so far, from the great crimes of National Socialism and communism (I am referring to our \u2018internal\u2019 politics, our domestic politics, and not to our misguided imperial adventures of the 20 th and 21 st centuries nor to the behaviour of our corporate institutions abroad. That this preservation from the crimes of fascism and communism is slowly breaking down appears to be the chief concern of our new TOK guide for 2022).\nThe attempt to maintain contractualism, our being in societies, our politics, our ethics, freed from any ontological statements (our being-in-the-world and our understanding of ourselves as beings in this world), fails because it requires that science be taken in phenomenalist (empirical) and instrumentalist (the analytical school) senses. It may be possible to attempt this when discussing the small results of academic technological scientists (the attempt to make the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis substantive, for instance), but it is quite impossible to assume it about the results of a great synthetic scientist such as Darwin. \u00a0When Darwinism is taught at school, it is not taught as a useful hypothetical tool only of interest to those who are going to be specialists in the Group 3 and Group 4 subjects. As Darwin well knew, the discussion of Creationism and Modification is an ontological one, despite the clever chat by analytical philosophers. His Holiness, the Pope\u2019s, acceptance of evolution and the Big Bang theories retain the sense of purpose in the \u201ccreatedness of Nature\u201d (what is called \u201cteleology), that there is meaning to creation, but whether or not this is sufficient ontologically is quite another matter. That these theories ultimately clash and contradict with His Holiness\u2019 beliefs in not discussed in depth (to my knowledge).\nWhat is the issue: you cannot hope to successfully combine an ahistorical political philosophy, an ethical philosophy if you will, with a natural science which is at its heart historical.\nWith the idea of History/Modification we are led back to Rousseau. Science views Nature as non-teleological, that is, it is a product of accident, chance not purpose. Nature has no goal in and of itself. It seems that when there is a great outpouring of scientific activity\u2014in the case spoken of here that of the 19 th century\u2014there is always a great philosopher who in his thought of the whole has made a breakthrough against all previous thought. By \u201cbreakthrough\u201d I am not speaking about the \u201cprogress of truth\u201d: breakthroughs can also lead into errors. This great breakthrough occurs in the thought of Rousseau. This is\u00a0 what we mean by a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d. A true paradigm shift is very rare in history and it occurs within human being-in-the-world.\nRousseau first stated that what we are, our essence as human beings, is not given to us by what the Ancients understood as Nature but is the result of what human beings were forced to do to overcome chance or to change nature (in the modern sense of what we understand nature to be). Life is experienced as a problem to be solved. Human beings have become what they are and are becoming what they will be (the \u201cempowerment\u201d of human beings) through their solutions to \u201cthe problem that is life\u201d. We are the free, undetermined animal, the perfectly malleable animal, that can be understood by a science which is not teleological (i.e. by a science that sees no final purpose in the things that are).\nRousseau understood the difficulties and the ambiguities of his thinking of human being as an historical animal far better than say, one of his followers, Karl Marx. Rousseau\u2019s battling with the contradictions that appear in the discoveries of his thought is what has led English-speaking commentators to dismiss him, for the most part, in their tutorials at Oxford and Harvard. The contradictions are the result of Rousseau\u2019s refusal to avoid the ambiguities which he was given to think.\nFriedrich Nietzsche\nThe greatest critic of Rousseau is the German philosopher Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, Rousseau is the epitome of the \u2018last man\u2019, the \u2018secularized Christian\u2019 who is responsible for the \u201cdecadence\u201d of European thought over the last three hundred years. But Nietzsche accepts from Rousseau the belief in the fact that we are historical, that we acquire our abilities in the course of time in a way that can be explained without purpose. Nietzsche claims that he is the thinker who understood the \u2018finality of becoming\u2019 in an historical way. But one deeply wonders how Nietzsche failed to recognize how much of his thought on the finality of becoming had been worked through by Rousseau. Was Nietzsche moved by an anger that clouded his openness to the whole?\nKarl Popper\nThe understanding that human beings acquire their abilities (their \u201cempowerment\u201d) through the course of time expresses itself in what we call \u2018historicism\u2019. Historicism is the fate of all Areas of Knowledge in our time. The attempts to refute historicism from within the tradition of English-speaking liberalism (Karl Popper\u2019s The Poverty of Historicism, as an example) while well-intentioned are feeble. This is reason itself why we should read Rousseau carefully so that we can attempt to know what it is that behooves us to know when all thought is touched with the deadening hand of historicism. \u00a0This becomes even more pressing as we become enamored with the word \u201cempowerment\u201d, the word of Nietzsche, and how this \u201cempowerment\u201d will unfold in the nihilism that is our future.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nOT 4: Knowledge, Religion and\u00a0Mathematics\nThe Principles of\u00a0Pythagorean Mathematics\u00a0Applied to Ethics/Actions\nWe will be discussing how mathematics, in particular how Pythagorean geometry,\u00a0 provides the principles for our actions; in other words, how mathematics determines our ethics. In doing so, we shall examine some considerations of the differences between what is called calculative thinking and what is called contemplative thinking.\nThe Greeks initially thought that mathematics is \u201cwhat can be learned and what can be taught\u201d. What we call mathematics is the axiomatical theoretical viewing and projection of the world which establishes the surety and certainty of the world through calculation. Axioms provide the principles or the archai, which in turn determine the laws which, in turn, lead to the calculative results. Calculative thinking based on the principle of reason (nothing is without reason) determines that the things of the world are disposables and are to be used by human beings in their various dispositions towards the world. This commandeering challenging of the world and the beings in it to demand of them to give us their reasons for being as they are is what we have come to call knowledge. This under-standing is that upon which all of our actions are based although we attempt to separate theory from practice. This surety or certainty that beings are as we say they are through calculation arises through the viewing and use of algebraic calculation in the modern world, the mathematical projection. The results of what is and has been achieved through this calculative thinking are what we have come to determine what knowledge is in our day and what is best to be known and how it is to be known. The axiomatic viewing or theory of mathematics, what provides the theory, is not separate or distinct from the praxis required to carry it out. The theory is not something left behind as the journey for results/knowledge becomes undertaken. The theory permeates each and every stage of the journey or search, what we call the methodology.\nEthics are based on what Aristotle called phronesis: our careful deliberation over what best actions will ultimately bring about the best end result. We call this end result our happiness or what Aristotle called our eudaimonia, our \u201cgood spirits\u201d. But how can happiness be the end result of what is, essentially, a hubristic way of viewing and being in the world?\nWe shall reflect on this question by examining the passage below from Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear.\nCORDELIA\nWe are not the first\nWho, with best meaning, have incurr\u2019d the worst.\nFor thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;\nMyself could else out-frown false fortune\u2019s frown.\nShall we not see these daughters and these\nsisters?\nKING LEAR\nNo, no, no, no! Come, let\u2019s away to prison:\nWe two alone will sing like birds i\u2019 the cage:\nWhen thou dost ask me blessing, I\u2019ll kneel down,\nAnd ask of thee forgiveness: so we\u2019ll live,\nAnd pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\nAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\nTalk of court news; and we\u2019ll talk with them too,\nWho loses and who wins; who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out;\nAnd take upon\u2019s the mystery of things,\nAs if we were God\u2019s spies: and we\u2019ll wear out,\nIn a wall\u2019d prison, packs and sects of great ones,\nThat ebb and flow by the moon.\nEDMUND\nTake them away.\nKING LEAR\nUpon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\nThe gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught\u00a0thee?\nHe that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,\nAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;\nThe good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,\nEre they shall make us weep: we\u2019ll see \u2019em starve\nfirst. Come.\nExplication of the Passage from King Lear\nTo attempt a summary and explication of the whole of the greatest work in the English language is impertinent. \u00a0But a brief introduction is necessary to provide some context with which to understand the play as it appears in the scene above.\nAt this point in the play, Lear and Cordelia, supported by French troops, have lost the civil war for Britain to Edmund\u2019s forces. Lear, as King, has been ultimately responsible for this civil war. At the beginning of the play, he has disowned his \u2018truthful\u2019 daughter, Cordelia, and fallen victim to the flattery and machinations of his two eldest daughters, Goneril and Regan. He has divided the kingdom in two giving each sister control of half, his intention being to avert future strife. Lear wishes to retain the appurtenances of a king, the appearances of a king, while retaining none of the responsibility: Lear is satisfied with the appearances rather than the realities of things. It is this satisfaction with the appearance of things that leaves Lear open to the machinations of his two daughters, Goneril and Regan.\nPythagorean Circle\nLear\u2019s responsibility is, chiefly, a moral one. Goneril and Regan soon work together to remove from Lear the power and possessions that he once held. Lear becomes an O, a nothing, and there is a pun here indicating both his reality and his suffering. In his nothingness, Lear becomes mad and rages against the ingratitude shown by his daughters and the injustice that he sees in the nature of things and in the created world as it is. This scene quoted above is Lear\u2019s anagnorisis or moment of enlightenment, the moment in tragedies when all tragic heroes recognize the errors of their ways and the consequences of their hubris which is at the root of their previous actions.\nLear ends up houseless and homeless and wanders on a heath in the heart of a terrible storm, the inner and the outward man caught up in a terrible disunity. Lear\u2019s physical, mental and spiritual sufferings soon drive him mad. The storm\u2019s effect is a purification of Lear: Lear removes his clothing; his ego, his \u201cI\u201d, is destroyed in the madness; he no longer focuses on himself but is able to see the \u2018otherness\u2019 of human beings and to feel compassion and pity for them (in the characters of Edgar as Poor Tom and the Fool) because he sees himself and his humanity in them. Lear\u2019s life as a king has been one of a tyrant for whom all sense of \u2018otherness\u2019 has been forgotten. Edgar, too, has become a \u2018nothing\u2019 due to the machinations of his bastard brother Edmund in the parallel plot of the play. Lear has gone from King to nothing and he is ready for re-birth. His ego has blinded him to understanding what his true relationship to his god is: initially he looked upon this god and his power as being something which he, Lear, himself possessed. Lear believed that only he himself possessed the truth and that that truth lay in his power.\nThe play King Lear is a play about the consequences of not knowing who we truly are, as individuals and as a species. Lear, focused as he is on his ego, his Self, is willingly duped by machination in the play; he is willingly duped by flattery as this flattery is recognition of his social prestige. His suffering and madness bring him to a true understanding of his relation to the god and to other human beings, and this relationship is Love. Love is, as Plato describes it, \u201cfire catching fire\u201d. It is recognition that in the most important things, all human beings are equal in that all are capable of the capacity for Love. It is not without reason that in our art and poetry, Love has been described as a homeless, houseless beggar.\nMany critics suggest this play is atheistic; Lear has lost his faith in God. The above passage suggests that such is not the case: what Lear has come to understand is his true relationship to God, the true relationship of all human beings to God. Lear has lost the illusion of what he had once understood as God and what his relationship was to that God. It is this illusion that is the trap cast for those who believe that they are in possession of the truth or that truth is of their own creation or doing, their power. The God in King Lear is absent: He will not perform some miracle preventing the hanging of Cordelia by the Captain later in the play. Cordelia has been a symbol of truth throughout the play, and in her death we see the literal destruction of truth among human beings. Good does not triumph over the evil of human actions in this play and we, too, by our very silence, are made complicit in the death of Cordelia.\nThe play King Lear shows that the purpose of suffering is to allow the de-creation of our selves, the de-struction of ourselves. For the Pythagoreans, the study of geometry served an identical purpose: the purification of our selves through a contemplative understanding of the things that are. For the Pythagoreans, mathematics was a religious activity. When we stand on the outside of the sphere above (the circumference) and are subject to its spinning, we suffer the ups and downs of Fate. There is a wheel of fortune motif that runs throughout the play: Fortune is personified in the passage through the alliteration and personification of \u2018false fortune\u2019s frown\u2019 to illustrate that it is, in this case, one of human making: even with the best of intentions one can incur the worst: good does not triumph over evil in this sphere but is subject to the same necessity as are rocks and stones. To decreate one\u2019s Self is to have the Self replaced by an assimilation into the divine; it is to become one of \u2018God\u2019s spies\u2019, to see all with God\u2019s eyes and to see all for God. When a human being sacrifices the Self, his most treasured possession, for assimilation in God, \u201cthe gods themselves throw incense\u201d upon this sacrifice. We believe our Self to be our most precious possession; the renouncing of this possession is not easy, nor is it pleasant: it is done through suffering.\nThe centre of the sphere is simultaneously both in time and space and out of time and space. The Self as center here is indifferent to the size of the prison, the size of the circle, what can be encountered through \u2018experience\u2019 and novelty. For Lear, imprisonment is a liberation, not a restriction.\u201dSuffering (affliction), when it is consented to and accepted and loved, is truly a baptism\u201d (Simone Weil, \u201cThe Love of God and Affliction\u201d). Baptism is a spiritual re-birth. The spiritual rebirth for Lear is clear from this passage as well as from Act III onwards in the play. The attempted suicide of Gloucester due to his suffering is a counterpoint to this: suicide is a sin against the gods because we falsely believe that our self is our own and of our own making and that we can do away with it as we would with any other possessions that we may have. Gloucester\u2019s realization of this results in his finding Edgar again and having \u2018his heart burst smilingly\u2019 when he meets his final end. Contrary to our view, in the world of Shakespeare some kinds of suffering have a purpose.\nOur personal knowledge is our \u2018sphere of influence\u2019 on our world and on the other human beings who inhabit our world. It is what we have come to call our empowerment. That sphere should be seen as composed of wheels within wheels with our actions the spokes of the wheels. The spokes reach out to the circumferences of the wheels: from the diameter, the right angled triangle cannot exceed that circumference. The sphere created by the circumferences may be large or small; most of our lives are spent in our attempts to enlarge this sphere. In it we are \u2019empowered\u2019 to carry out our activities, but the prison of ourselves is still a \u2018prison\u2019 beginning with our bodies and our egos which are placated by the social prestige and recognition which comes from this fulfillment. We become the \u2018poor rogues\u2019 and \u2018gilded butterflies\u2019 that Lear and Cordelia will chat with, the partisans and politicians of the court. The outer edges of the sphere in its spinning indicate the fates of those who are ruled by Fortune: \u2018who loses and who wins; who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out\u2019. It is the fate of all of us who are dominated by the wish for social prestige, recognition. This fate and our desire for this fate is part of the \u2018mystery of things\u2019: to see this we must remain at the centre of the sphere where we are not moved by the wheel\u2019s or the sphere\u2019s spinnings, nor are our desires dominated by the wish for social prestige and recognition.\nLear, through his madness and suffering, has been re-born (see other sections of the play particularly Lear\u2019s awakening when he sees Cordelia as an angel, a mediator, and in the play she is, from the beginning, representative of truth). His self, ego, I has been destroyed. In this scene, Lear demonstrates the friendship that is the love between two unequal yet equal beings. Lear\u2019s \u2018kneeling down\u2019 when asked for his blessing in order to ask for forgiveness is the recognition of this equality. It is no longer the view of the Lear who said \u201cI am a man more sinned against than sinning\u201d, a false view of Lear\u2019s at the moment of its occurrence in the play for it is the view of most of us with regard to our own sufferings.\nIt is with a great and terrible irony that after this speech of Lear\u2019s, the following occurs:\nEDMUND\nCome hither, captain; hark.\nTake thou this note;\nGiving a paper\nGo follow them to prison:\nOne step I have advanced thee; if thou dost\nAs this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way\nTo noble fortunes: know thou this, that men\nAre as the time is: to be tender-minded\nDoes not become a sword: thy great employment\nWill not bear question; either say thou\u2019lt do \u2018t,\nOr thrive by other means.\nCaptain\nI\u2019ll do \u2018t, my lord.\nEDMUND\nAbout it; and write happy when thou hast done.\nMark, I say, instantly; and carry it so\nAs I have set it down.\nCaptain\nI cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;\nIf it be man\u2019s work, I\u2019ll do \u2018t.\nThe Captain\u2019s final words are a statement for all of us motivated by social prestige. Human crime or neglect is the cause of most suffering. On the orders of superiors, we carry out acts that we believe are \u201cman\u2019s work\u201d i.e. they are not the work of Nature but we ascribe the moral necessity for our actions to Nature: \u201cI cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats\u201d. We believe that we are compelled to commit immoral actions because we believe Nature imposes its necessities upon us; and, at times, Nature does indeed do so. But if we live with a thoughtful recognition that there are simply acts which we cannot and must not do, we are capable of staying within these limits imposed by the order of the world upon our actions. Such words as the Captain\u2019s have been used by human beings to justify to themselves and to others the reasons for their actions from the committing of petty crimes to genocides. They see their crimes as performing a duty, just following orders.\nThe root of all crimes is, perhaps, the desire for social prestige whether that is achieved through position, money or recognition. For the Captain, it is Edmund who will determine what \u2018happy\u2019 will become for him by his giving to the Captain \u2018noble fortunes\u2019; and the Captain believes it. He will achieve his noble fortunes through the committing of an ignoble act. One would need to look far across the breadth and depth of English literature to find two more contrasting views of humanity in a work than that which is presented here in these two brief, sequential scenes from King Lear. Human beings are capable and culpable of both forms of action: we have an infinite capacity for Love and forgiveness as well as a finite capacity for committing the most heinous crimes; only Love is both beyond and within the circle, and all human action is done within the circle (or the realm of Necessity).\nContemplation and Calculative Thinking: Living in the Technological World\nThe passages from King Lear give us an entry to understanding a practical alternative way of being-in-the-world to the current conditioning or \u2018hard-wiring\u2019 of our way of being under the technological world-view operating as it does under the principle of reason. This alternative way involves contemplative thinking as opposed to calculative thinking. This contemplative thinking is open to all human beings: it is not a special mental activity for the few. It is an attitude toward things as a whole and a general way of being-in- the-world. It is the attitude that Lear proposes for himself and Cordelia on how they will spend their time in prison: while they will still be in the world, they will not be of the world. While they will be involved with the \u201cpoor rogues\u201d and \u201cgilded butterflies\u201d, the world of these rogues and butterflies will not be their world.\nWhat does this mean for us? It suggests that we are in the technological world, but not of this technological world; we are here in body but not in spirit. We avail ourselves of technological things but we place our hearts and souls elsewhere. This detachment involves both a being-in and a withdrawal-from. Like Lear and Cordelia, we let the things of the technological world go by, but we also let them go on. Like Lear and Cordelia, the detachment is both a \u201cno\u201d to the social and its machinations, but it is also a \u201cyes\u201d to it in that it lets that world go on in their entertaining of it.\nWhat is Calculative Thinking:\nCalculative thinking is how we plan, research, organize, operate and act within our everyday world. This thinking is interested in results and it views things and people as means to an end. It is our everyday practical attitude towards things. Contemplative thinking is detached from ordinary practical interests.\nH. L. Mencken\nCalculative thinking is not computational. It does not require computers or calculators and it is not necessarily scientific or sophisticated. It would be better understood in the sense of how we call a person \u201ccalculating\u201d. When we say this we do not mean that the person is gifted in mathematics. We mean that the person is designing; he uses others to further his own self-interests. Such a person is not sincere: there is an ulterior motive, a self-interested purpose behind all his actions and relations. He is engaged with others only for what he can get out of them. He is an \u201coperator\u201d and his doings are machinations. His being-in-the-world may be said to rest on the principle attributed to H. L. Mencken: \u201cNo one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.\u201d\nCalculative thinking is, then, more of a general outlook on things, our \u2018way of life\u2019. It is an attitude and approach that the things are there for what we can get out of them. People and things are there for us to exploit. This general outlook is determined by the disclosive looking of technology and its impositional attitude toward things.\nThere is no lack of calculative thinking in our world today: never has there been so much planning, so much problem-solving, so much research, so many machinations. TOK itself is a branch and flowering of this calculative thinking. But in this calculative thought, human beings are in flight from thinking. The thinking that we are in flight from is contemplative thinking, the very essence of our being human. In this flight, we are very much like Oedipus who, after hearing the omen from the oracle at Delphi and its prophecy, rashly flees in the hope that he can escape his destiny. As with Oedipus we, too, are blind and unable to see in our flight from thinking and our rash attempts to \u201cchange the world\u201d.\nWhat is Contemplative Thinking:\nContemplative thinking, on the other hand, is the attention to what is closet to us. It pays attention to the meaning of things, the essence of things. It does not have a practical interest and does not view things as a means to an end but, much like Lear and Cordelia, dwells on the things for the sake of disclosing what makes them be what they are. Contemplative thinking allows us to take upon ourselves \u201cthe mystery of things\u201d, to be \u201cGod\u2019s spies\u201d in the two-way theoretical looking of Being upon us and of ourselves upon Being. To be God\u2019s spies we must remove our own seeing and our own looking, that looking and seeing that we have inherited as our \u201cshared knowledge\u201d, and allow Being to look through us. This seeing and looking is not a redemption that is easily achieved. The pain-filled ascent in the release from the enchainment within the Cave to the freedom outside of the Cave or Lear\u2019s suffering and de-struction on the heath in the storm are indications of just the kinds of exertions that are required. King Lear in his anagnorisis has arrived at the truth of what it means to be, as such, and of his place in that Being. Contemplative thinking is a paying attention to what makes beings be beings at all, but it is not a redemption which can be cheaply bought.\nThe word \u201ccon-templation\u201d indicates that activity which is carried out in a \u201ctemple\u201d. It is a communing with the divine. The temple is where those who gather receive messages from the divine. Lear and Cordelia\u2019s prison is, as such, a \u201ctemple\u201d to Lear. Within a temple, one receives auguries. An augury is an omen, a being which bears a divine message which must be heard by those to whom it is spoken. In and through this hearing one is given to see the essence of things and to \u201cgive back\u201d those essences to Being. Contemplation is the observing of beings just as they exist and is an attending to their essence. It is a reserved, detached mode of disclosing that expresses itself in gratitude, the giving of thanks. This attention is available to all human beings who through their love, like Lear and Cordelia, are open to the otherness of beings without viewing those beings as serving any other purpose than their own being. \u00a0For human beings, it is the highest form of action directed by what the essence of human being is. As the highest form of human being itself, it must be available to all since it is our very nature as human beings.\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLoading...\nOlder posts"}, {"Url": "https://quora.com/can-there-ever-be-a-basis-for-religious-knowledge-that-can-be-independent-of-the-culture-and-historical-context-that-produces-it", "CluewebURLHash": "C957729806A5FCDEF7277487D985C22B", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Can there ever be a basis for religious knowledge that can ...", "Snippet": "Yes, it is possible for spiritual\ue000 knowledge\ue001 to be infused into\ue000 the\ue001 world\ue000 independent\ue001 of\ue000 cultural\ue001 conditions and historical context.

How can diversity be embraced not only in shaping a school community but also as a resource to make instruction more accessible for all learners?\nSchool of Education and Social Policy assistant professor Edd Taylor is exploring questions like these as he examines how the consideration of diversity might improve both teaching and learning. He emphasizes the importance of understanding diverse student populations and the resources they bring to the classroom. \u201cPeople typically talk about diversity as a goal rather than a resource,\u201d he explains. \u201cA resource is a unique way to think about it.\u201d\nMathematics in a cultural context\nTaylor has focused his work on how mathematics learning, specifically, is shaped by the shared understandings of one\u2019s culture. In part, he explores the different paths that students take to comprehend mathematics and how well they express that knowledge in the classroom. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to separate issues of culture and learning,\u201d he says. For example, culture and language can have a tremendous impact on the way a child learns to count. \u201cPractices within a culture affect understanding,\u201d he explains.\nAs part of his research, Taylor studied elementary students\u2019 understanding of mathematics in a lower-income African-American community. These students often stopped at the corner store after school to purchase snacks. Based on their use of money in this setting, Taylor found that the children showed a variety of mathematical understandings. Among these was knowledge of place value, or breaking up numbers into smaller numbers. He noted that when the shopping task became more difficult, peers or adults provided help. For example, the store clerk might support the child by suggesting an item that could be purchased with the amount of money the child had.\nInterestingly, when the children were tested in conventional classroom methods of understanding place value such as using blocks, they demonstrated significantly less proficiency or even none at all. \u201cIt seemed they didn\u2019t have place value knowledge, but they did have it,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cSome assessment tools may greatly underestimate the knowledge that students possess. In particular, tools or artifacts that are used in students\u2019 everyday lives may better capture student understanding,\u201d he explains. As a result, he emphasizes the importance of using assessment tools that consider a student\u2019s knowledge base.\nEquity in mathematics education\nThe issue of equity in mathematics education extends to virtually all levels of the field, and Taylor is addressing a wide range, studying the issues as they appear all the way from elementary school to the PhD level. He has devoted some time to examining mathematics doctoral programs, which he sees as an especially crucial piece of the puzzle. \u201cMath education doctoral programs must change so their graduates, math educators and future math teachers, understand the content knowledge and the methods to teach mathematics in ways that are appropriate for all students,\u201d he explains.\nTaylor is concerned about the lack of a diverse teacher workforce compared to the rich diversity of students in public school classrooms. \u201cTeachers are not necessarily familiar with their students\u2019 cultures,\u201d he notes, adding that this deficit is largely unaddressed in mathematics education doctoral programs. In order to reach all students, teachers must understand how culture impacts learning and plan instruction that takes this relationship into account. According to Taylor, reaching those who will be teaching future teachers \u2014 mathematics education professors \u2014 is among the best ways to improve teacher preparation so that graduates have a better understanding of the influence of culture on learning.\nTaylor is part of an organization whose goal is to do just that. Diversity in Mathematics Education (DiME) explores the role of diversity in the teaching and learning of mathematics and, especially, how to guide future generations of math educators. Along with DiME, Taylor facilitated a professional development program and study that worked with a group of 20 teachers to identify and integrate the diversity of their students in their mathematics instruction.\nThe study explored how teachers might draw on their students\u2019 everyday understandings in the classroom. First, parents were contacted to find out how mathematical concepts were already being used at home. Then, Taylor and his group looked for ways to incorporate this prior knowledge, such as familiarity with sports, into classroom lessons. The teachers learned to integrate the understandings behind \u201cat-home math\u201d into their instruction. For example, instead of using football merely as the context for a problem, the numbers inherent to football, like series of sevens and threes, would be used.\nThe next DiME conference, which Taylor is co-organizing, will be held at Northwestern University this summer. Taylor looks forward to convening with other professors as well as PhD students who not only understand mathematics but also recognize the importance of equity in mathematics education. The conference will provide opportunities for sharing and discussing research, information on obtaining funding and securing publications, and areas of service such as mentoring and supporting doctoral students.\nLinking culture and learning\nCurrently, Taylor is examining religious practices and mathematics understanding. He is researching two communities that tithe, or give 10 percent of their income to the church, to see whether children who participate are developing an understanding of rational numbers such as percents, fractions and ratios. His preliminary findings have shown that many of the children have good understanding about how much to tithe. However, Taylor is also discovering that this knowledge does not necessarily transfer to the classroom. While the children may be able to calculate 10 percent of their allowance in the cultural context of tithing, for example, they are not always able to show this in a formal way in the classroom when asked to calculate 10 percent of a number. Taylor hopes to identify ways for teachers and parents to help children link this knowledge.\nIn the future, Taylor looks forward to investigating issues related to identity, including how students see themselves as young mathematicians. Overall, he points out that students must be understood as part of their larger community and that the connection between culture and learning must be addressed if mathematics is truly to become accessible to all learners.

Experts say he has some justification for his position.\nA flare for burning excess methane, or natural gas, from crude oil production is seen at a well pad in Watford City, N.D., Aug. 26, 2021. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown)\nBy: Louis Jacobson\nNovember 9, 2021\nPresident Joe Biden faced an awkward moment during the international climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, when he was asked at a press conference about inflation back home, including gasoline prices.\n\u201cIf you take a look at gas prices and you take a look at oil prices, that is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil,\u201d Biden said Nov. 2 at the United Nations\u2019 COP26 summit. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what happens on that score sooner than later.\u201d\nOPEC is the group of 13 primarily Middle Eastern and African oil exporters that act collectively to set production levels; it has been joined recently in decision-making by Russia and some other non-member nations.\nOne reason for the awkwardness is that Biden was at a conference that aimed to reduce carbon emissions, including from oil, yet he felt obligated to call for greater output by oil-producing nations.\nThe administration\u2019s request for greater production \u201cis a recognition that oil is by far the leading energy source for the U.S. and global economy today, even with aspirations for a rapid transition to a lower-carbon future,\u201d said Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University\u2019s Center for Energy Studies.\nExacerbating the awkwardness is that the U.S. is itself a major oil producer. In fact, the U.S. is the world\u2019s biggest, accounting for about 20% of the world\u2019s output. So we decided to take a closer look at the reasons for the current high price of oil and what the U.S. can do about it. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nAre OPEC and Russia to blame?\nAt the root of the price increases for gasoline, as with so many other products, is the coronavirus pandemic. Since the initial economic wallop from the virus in the spring of 2020, demand for gasoline has risen steadily as business activity has increased. Yet supply hasn\u2019t been able to recover as quickly, thanks to delays in restoring drilling capacity, higher transportation costs, and sluggish production increases.\nAs a result, prices of crude oil have risen consistently in recent months, though they are still about 40% below their peak levels of July 2008.\n(PolitiFact)\nThese higher prices ultimately show up in the prices Americans pay for refined oil products like gasoline.\n\u201cHigher prices at the pump matter,\u201d Finley said. By his calculations, he said, just this year\u2019s increases are costing each American household an additional $1,000.\nSo how do Russia and OPEC play into this? Together, they account for just over half of global production, so experts agree that they can do the most to increase supply, which would result in lower prices at the pump.\nAfter cutting production aggressively in the early days of the pandemic, the OPEC-led group has been gradually, but not fully, restoring production. Since July, OPEC and Russia have agreed to raise production by 400,000 barrels per day every month, less than the U.S. and other oil importers like China, India, and Japan have been seeking.\nOPEC and Russia have \u201cjust increased production at a slower, \u2018cautious\u2019 pace instead of doing so on the timetable that Biden would like,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nOn Nov. 4, two days after Biden\u2019s press conference, OPEC and Russia met and chose not to accelerate production, foiling Biden and the other importers.\nCouldn\u2019t the U.S. increase oil production on its own?\nIt\u2019s theoretically possible for the U.S. to produce more oil, but it would be politically and practically difficult, experts said.\nOne obvious obstacle is the pressure Biden is facing from his allies in the environmental movement. Biden campaigned on curbing climate change and promoting electric vehicles, so encouraging more production now would contradict his longstanding position.\nAnother obstacle is that U.S. producers can\u2019t ramp up production as quickly as OPEC can.\n\u201cThe reason why the administration is asking OPEC and Russia to increase is because they have spare production capacity as the result of their previous cuts, which can be brought to the market quickly,\u201d Finley said. \u201cHere in the U.S., producers must decide to increase drilling and completing new wells, which could take months to add appreciable volumes.\u201d\nFor producers, that means making a bet that prices will stay high enough to justify the added investment.\nDe Haan agreed. \u201cI do not believe the U.S. has a lever to raise production quickly enough, he said. \u201cMore like a slow steady growth that should net some notable rise in production in three to six months from now.\u201d\nAnother factor is that Biden can\u2019t simply flip a switch and boost U.S. production.\n\u201cIncreasing domestic production isn\u2019t a policy decision. It is a private sector response,\u201d said James H. Stock, a professor of political economy at Harvard University. \u201cIn principle, yes, it could ramp up quickly to offset quite a bit of the oil price increase, but that is a decision by private entities.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s unclear how effective Biden could be at influencing that decision, De Haan said.\n\u201cThe White House has demonized the sector, enacting executive orders designed to slow growth of oil production, and that\u2019s definitely had a role,\u201d he said.\nTo make more supply available, a president has the power to release stored oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But that option is typically reserved for emergencies and short-term supply disruptions that threaten the economy.\nThis article was originally published by PolitiFact, which is part of the Poynter Institute.

Not for the reason Biden thinks\nSeptember 17, 2021 / 2:57 PM / CBS/AP\nInflation report: Higher food and gas prices\n03:19\nPresident Joe Biden has called for an investigation into persistently high gasoline prices. With the average price of gas\u00a0 around the U.S having climbed to $3.17 a gallon, Mr. Biden suggested that pandemic \"profiteers\" might be to blame.\n\"There's lots of evidence that gas prices should be going down \u2014 but  they haven't,\" he said Thursday. \"We're taking a close look at  that.\"\nYet experts say there's little evidence of anything nefarious behind the higher fuel cost. Although gas prices have atypically remained elevated after Labor Day, when prices at the pump usually fall following the peak summer  driving season, analysts blame other factors, including lower global production and supply disruptions in the U.S.\nExperts think gas prices \u2014 which a year ago averaged $2.18 nationally for a gallon of regular, according to AAA \u2014 will drop later this year. In the meantime, here are the main reasons they say gas prices have surged.\nSupply disruptions\nGasoline isn't immune to the supply-chain issues that have plagued every conceivable good in the time of coronavirus.\nStorms and hackers have shuttered production and transport of gasoline this summer, with Hurricane Ida temporarily closing most oil production in the Gulf of  Mexico and several big  refineries. The hurricane comes after a cyberattack in May took out a major fuel pipeline to the East  Coast for nearly a week.\nJeffery  Born, an energy markets expert at Northeastern University,  said current  gasoline prices are partly a result of production and  refining capacity  that was knocked offline by Hurricane Ida and partly a result of other shortages \u2014 even a  shortage of tanker drivers.\n\"In  short, I think  we are having supply-chain problems,\" Born said. \"I'm  sure Joe wants  prices to come down \u2014 you and I do, too. I'd also like to  be 20 pounds  lighter tomorrow.\"\nTom  Kloza, chief analyst for the Oil Price Information Service  consulting  firm, said Hurricane Ida and lingering effects on production  and  refining are causing summer-like prices to \"linger for longer,\"   especially east of the Rockies. He predicted that pump prices will soon   ease in the West, Southwest and Rocky Mountain states.\nHigh demand\nAnother factor is that Americans are driving more than we were one year ago.\nPhil  Flynn, an energy analyst at the Price Futures Group and a critic of Mr. Biden's energy policy, said prices reflect demand that came back  stronger than expected from the pandemic and lower U.S. oil production,  compounded by events like the hurricane.\n\"I'm not seeing any profiteering or bad actors,\" Flynn said.\nMeanwhile, Apple's mobility index shows Americans are driving at rates nearly 50% above their pre-pandemic level\u2014even higher than the index's levels last September.\nLow production\nEnergy  economist Philip Verleger said gasoline prices are being propped up by  U.S. independent producers and OPEC members limiting their oil  production, by the cost of blending ethanol into gasoline and by lower  gasoline inventories.\nThere  already are some signs retail gasoline prices have peaked, with the  Energy Information Administration reporting last week that gasoline  prices are likely to decline in coming months. It forecast that prices  would average $3.14 a gallon in September before falling to $2.91 in the  last three months of the year, as driving declines in the winter months  and refining operations come back online after being damaged by the  hurricane.\nMr. Biden joins a rich tradition of presidents who express frustration with high gasoline prices. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump tweeted at OPEC, the Saudi Arabia-led cartel of oil producers.\n\"Oil prices getting too high,\" Trump tweeted. \"OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!\"\nMr. Biden  tried that approach himself last month, when he urged OPEC members to  increase oil output just as concern was rising that higher energy prices  could slow the U.S. economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Production  cuts made during the pandemic should be reversed as the global economy  recovers in order to lower prices for consumers,\" Mr. Biden said at the  time.\nIn:\nGas Prices\nFirst published on September 17, 2021 / 2:57 PM\n\u00a9 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

Let\u2019s examine why.\nFirst, why are prices at the pump so high in general? There are several factors at play here that all have had an impact since last November:\nThe loosening of COVID restrictions globally in recent months has led to a rapid recovery in global demand for crude oil that has exceeded the expectations of all of the \u201cexperts\u201d on the subject, leading to a tightening of global crude markets;\nStrong discipline among the OPEC+ nations related to their agreement to limit exports has also played a major role in tightening the relationship between global supply and demand;\nThe U.S. election has also obviously played a big role here. Since last November 3, the average price per gallon of regular gasoline in the U.S. has skyrocketed by 75 cents. The markets clearly see the Biden/Harris administration as one that will work to inhibit U.S. oil production, which will also have the effect of tightening the global market, and traders have responded by driving up the price of crude oil;\nRefinery maintenance and the changeover to summer gasoline blends. This is a factor that I tend to write about every year at this time. Gas prices have continued to rise even as crude prices have dropped over the past week mainly due to the fact that March and April are the time of year in which many U.S. refineries are taken offline for annual maintenance a nd all refiners are switching from manufacturing a handful of winter blends of gasoline to the dozens of summer blends required by the EPA. This changeover invariably raises the costs of both refining and transportation of gasoline, and that is always worked into gas prices during these months.\nTo sum up: We\u2019ve seen a confluence of factors since November that have driven up the price for crude oil now combined with the higher costs associated with the annual conversion over to summer blends of gasoline. Since gas prices at the pump tend to follow the price of crude on almost a linear basis, none of this is really surprising.\nBut what about California? According to AAA, the current average price for regular in the Golden State stands at $3.885 per gallon, while in Texas it is $2.626, about a 47% difference. This differential is almost entirely due to politics around climate change.\nCalifornia is a state that is rich in underground oil resources, but over the past two decades, the state government of California has pursued a policy agenda designed to inhibit drilling and production within its borders as part of an overall program to try to ratchet down emissions via command-and-control regulations. In more recent years, the state government has implemented emissions regulations that far exceed current federal regulation and implemented mandates requiring a rapid phasing-out of gas-powered cars and replacing them with electric vehicles (EVs).\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\nBest Tax Software Of 2022\nBest Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022\nIncome Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\nCalif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver look out into the crowd of supporters ... [+]\nASSOCIATED PRESS\nThese policy choices have very predictably led to higher gasoline costs and higher costs for gasoline powered cars in California. As I detailed in yesterday\u2019s piece, the Biden/Harris administration is now aggressively pursuing the same kinds of policy choices at the national level, with the help of congressional Democrats. Thus, California essentially serves as the proverbial canary in the coal mine for the rest of the country.\nFinally, is America energy independent? The clear answer to that is no: The U.S. is not now and has never really been energy independent in modern times. The goal most presidential administrations have pursued has been to enhance the country\u2019s \u201cenergy security\u201d by making it less reliant on imports of crude oil from other nations.\nHowever, the policy choices being pursued by President Biden and congressional Democrats will inevitably serve to weaken America\u2019s state of energy security as they are implemented and serve to inhibit U.S. oil production. This is a conscious choice being made as part of the effort to speed up the energy transition.\nThe Estrella, a crude oil tanker operated by Lundqvist Rederierna AB, left, and Nansen Spirit, a ... [+]\n\u00a9 2020 Bloomberg Finance LP\nThe U.S. had arguably achieved its highest level of energy security in half a century across the first three years of the Trump administration, thanks to massive increases in production from shale formations around the country. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting crash in domestic oil production last year did great harm to that dynamic, and the new policies being put into place by the current administration will serve to dampen any potential recovery.\nPresident Biden\u2019s Day 1 executive orders to cancel the cross-border permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and suspend the program for oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters were just initial shots across the bow. His order to raise the estimate for the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d by over 700% will inevitably result in regulatory actions that will raise the cost of producing oil in the U.S., as will the coming effort by the Biden EPA to convince the courts to allow it to regulate carbon as a \u201ccriteria pollutant,\u201d a topic I\u2019ll address in more detail in the coming days.\nAll of these actions and more to come will increase the costs of not just oil and gasoline, but all forms of non-renewable energy for consumers, will make the country increasingly reliant on foreign oil imports and thus will render the country less energy secure than before. These outcomes are entirely predictable and are in fact features of the Biden/Harris plan, which is in part designed to make EVs and renewables more competitive by raising the cost of fossil fuels and other more traditional forms of energy. That\u2019s not a value judgement: it\u2019s just reality.\nSo, gasoline prices are indeed high and destined to go higher, for a variety of reasons. Everyone would be well-advised to plan accordingly.\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

The purpose of this post is to explain why this increase is occurring.\nGasoline prices are composed of four main components: 1.) supply and demand for oil in a global market, 2.) taxes levied by federal, state and local government, 3.0) distribution and market costs, such as the costs incurred by local gas station owners, and 4.) the cost of refining crude oil to turn it into gasoline.\nThe largest component of the price of gasoline is the price of oil, which made up 52 percent of the price at the pump in January 2021. This is followed by taxes that represent 21 percent of the price, distribution and marketing costs at 15 percent, and refining costs at 12 percent. The cost of distribution varies with seasonal changes as refineries retool to switch from winter grade to summer grade gasoline, perform regular maintenance on their facilities, and fix any break-down of equipment. It also varies as global markets change (e.g. the coronavirus pandemic) and as government taxes increase.\nCurrently, several refineries have been down due to freezing weather that hit Texas and a number of other oil and gas producing states that also have refineries. During mid-spring, refineries also close for maintenance and switchover to summer fuels required to meet air quality standards that is a result of normal operations. With limited refinery capacity in the United States, the removal of some refineries from the production of gasoline results in higher prices. Along with refinery outages, gasoline prices increase due to higher prices for oil on world markets because of increasing world demand, and production quotas by OPEC+ countries (OPEC and its partners) and geopolitical events such as the Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels attacking a major Saudi Arabian oil port on the Persian Gulf (Ras Tanura) with drones and missiles on March 7. The result is the gasoline price increases we have seen over the past several weeks.\nLowering world oil demand or increasing world oil supplies would lower oil prices, but the United States can neither affect the oil demand of other countries nor can it increase the supply of oil from other oil producing countries.\u00a0 It can increase its own oil supplies, which are coming back to production after the downturn during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent freeze. However, President Biden\u2019s policies of placing a moratorium on drilling on federal lands in order to review drilling policy will put a damper on future U.S. oil production. And, the signal that Biden sent to markets with the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline on his Inauguration Day is a strong indication that producing oil and gas in America is going to become more difficult during his administration.\nBesides reducing oil demand or increasing oil supply, U.S. gasoline prices can be lowered by lowering refining costs, decreasing gasoline taxes, or decreasing marketing and distribution costs, but as the figure above shows, these components of the cost of gasoline are small compared to the price of oil.\n1) \u00a0 \u00a0 Supply and Demand for oil\na) World Oil Demand Growth :\u00a0 World crude oil and liquid fuels demand increased after the height of the coronavirus pandemic and is 8 million barrels per day greater than production. Demand has recovered in China and India and is on the upward spiral in the United States and Europe. U.S. petroleum demand, as measured by total petroleum products supplied, was 19.4 million barrels per day in January 2021, according to the latest monthly statistical report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a 4 percent increase from December and a decrease of only 2.3 percent compared with January 2020. If world demand for oil rises faster than oil companies can produce the crude, oil prices will go up, which is what is occurring now.\nb) Domestic Supply: According to the EIA, the United States produced 3 million barrels per day of crude oil natural gas liquids in January 2021, down from 17.9 million barrels per day in January 2020 before the pandemic \u2014 a 26 percent decline. Only a small portion of federal lands are leased to oil and gas drilling. More domestic oil could be produced if the federal government permitted it and if its regulatory procedures were commensurate with state regulation that is more conducive to exploration and drilling. This is exasperated by President Biden\u2019s moratorium on drilling on U.S. federal lands to review domestic policy mentioned above.\nc) OPEC Production Restraints: \u00a0 OPEC and its partners have restricted the production of oil in order to increase prices which fell when demand bottomed out during the pandemic. OPEC and its allies indicated that they will rollover current production cuts to the end of April. Russia and Kazakhstan were the only exceptions and were allowed to increase production by 130,000 and 20,000 barrels per day, respectively, due to \u201ccontinued seasonal consumption patterns\u201d. Saudi Arabia also extended its voluntary output cut of one million barrels per day, which was due to expire at the end of March, through the month of April. OPEC+ appears to be responding to the uncertainty around the demand outlook by taking a more cautious approach. Further, OPEC+ does not believe that U.S. oil production will be able to respond to the higher price environment any time soon. Forecasters are looking at $75 or $80 a barrel oil in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of this year.\nOPEC exporting nations possess much of the world\u2019s known conventional oil reserves, and as such, have excess production capacity. However, in order to maintain favorably high oil prices to fund their governments and sustain their production capabilities, these nations agree on production targets that curtail the supply of oil from member states.\nIn addition, oil prices are buoyed due to unrest in the Middle East. Recently, Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels attacked a major Saudi Arabian oil port on the Persian Gulf (Ras Tanura) with drones and missiles. Despite Saudi authorities indicating the strike caused no casualties or damage, oil prices increased after the market opened in New York following the attack. Brent crude added more than 2.5 percent, rising above $71 a barrel. Prices surged to their highest level since May 2019, due to rising demand as the global economy reopens from shutdowns caused by the coronavirus and supply curtailments in many producing countries.\nSaudi Arabia responded by dropping bombs on Yemen\u2019s rebel-held capital San\u2019a. The coalition blamed the Biden administration for the attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels after a decision to remove them from U.S. terror lists. The price of Brent crude was down to $68.76 a barrel, after hitting a high of $71.38 a barrel. It was the first time the global benchmark has traded above $70 since January 2020. The Houthis stepped up aerial attacks on Saudi Arabia following the inauguration in January of President Biden, who pledged to end the six-year-old civil war in Yemen and recalibrate Washington\u2019s relationship with Riyadh .\u00a0 Much has happened to world and U.S. oil markets since the advent of the Biden Administration.\nd) Oil Imports and North American Oil Supplies: Petroleum is a globally-traded commodity. On net, the United States exported more oil and petroleum products than it imported in 2020 and in the first month of 2021 due to hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling greatly increasing U.S. oil production. The United States still imports some crude oil and petroleum products due mostly to geography and type of crude oil, since U.S. refineries are set up to use heavier crude oil. For example, the United States purchases crude oil from Canada, its largest foreign supplier, and sells Canada a small amount of crude oil produced in Alaska. The United States also purchases crude oil from Mexico and sells Mexico gasoline in return.\nCanada, our neighbor and ally to the North, has the third largest reserves of oil in the world at 170 billion barrels. It currently sells us about 4 million barrels per day and could easily sell us more if the transportation infrastructure were in place to move it to U.S. refineries. However, with the Biden administration shutting down construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, more expensive forms of transportation such as rail are moving some of this oil to U.S. markets. Because Canadian crude is currently land-locked, its price is much below that of Brent crude, making more expensive rail transportation economic.\nU.S. crude oil that is land-locked in North Dakota and at Cushing, Oklahoma storage terminals also is lower priced than foreign overseas oil. Ships could be used to move this lower priced oil to East Coast markets where overseas oil is used if the 1920 Jones Act were repealed. The Jones Act requires that shipments from one U.S. port to another be carried on vessels built in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and operated by a U.S. crew.\n2) \u00a0 \u00a0 Federal and State Taxes\nThe second main cost of the price of gasoline is federal and state taxes. In January 2021, federal, state and local taxes accounted for 21 percent of the price of gasoline. The federal tax on gasoline accounts for 18.4 cents per gallon, while the volume-weighted average state and local tax is 36.8 cents per gallon as of January 2021. This amounts to a 55.2 cent nationwide average tax on gasoline that governments get each time you pump a gallon.\n3) \u00a0 \u00a0 Distribution and Marketing Costs\nThe third component of the price of gasoline is the retail dealer\u2019s costs and profits, which constituted a combined 15 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in January 2021. From the refinery, most gasoline is shipped first by pipeline to terminals near consuming areas and then loaded into trucks for delivery to individual stations. Ethanol (currently about 10 percent of a gallon of gas) must also be transported by truck or train since it cannot be transported by most pipelines prior to delivery due to its affinity to absorb water.\nEven though many gas stations are branded as Shell, Exxon, BP or another major oil company, the major oil companies actually own less than 5 percent of gas stations. They have largely left the retail business. The vast majority of gas stations are actually independent businesses that purchase gasoline for resale to the public. In addition, some retail outlets are owned and operated by refiners.\nThe price at the pump reflects both the retailer\u2019s purchase cost for the product and the other costs of operating the service station. It also reflects local market conditions and factors, such as the desirability of the location, ease of access for bulk fuel transport and the marketing strategy of the owner.\n4) \u00a0 \u00a0 Refining Costs\nThe last cost to factor into the price of gasoline is the refining process, where crude oil is \u201ccracked\u201d and formulated into its chemical components and made into gasoline. In January 2021, refinery costs comprised 12 percent of the retail price of gasoline. This figure varies regionally because different parts of the country require different additives and processing steps in their gasoline formulations. The figure of 12 percent would also vary over different months, owing to seasonal changes in refinery operations. For example, in the spring when refineries need to retool to produce summer-blend gasoline and to meet summer gasoline demands, the cost of refinery operations is higher.\nCurrently, gasoline production is at a low because refineries have been affected by the low demand from the coronavirus pandemic and the freeze experienced last month throughout parts of the south and Midwest, which points to the lack of excess refining capacity in this country.\u00a0 As a matter of fact, China will surpass the U.S. in refining capacity this year for the first time in history.\nConclusion\nGasoline prices are high and increasing because world oil demand growth is outpacing oil supply output, thereby increasing oil prices and gasoline prices. This is mainly due to the lower oil production because of the lowered demand from the coronavirus pandemic and the supply cuts by OPEC+. Further exasperating world markets are the geopolitical factors occurring in the Middle East, combined with uncertainties of government policies in the United States, the world\u2019s largest oil producer. Gasoline prices are further being boosted because of lack of available refining capacity due to the recent freeze and lowered demand from the coronavirus pandemic. President Biden\u2019s policies are not helping in that he has killed the Keystone XL pipeline that would bring lower priced oil from Canada and lower transportation costs from the Bakken fields of North Dakota and surrounding states. He has also placed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling on federal lands that could affect future production."}, {"Url": "https://metro.co.uk/2021/09/20/why-are-gas-prices-so-high-in-the-uk-and-are-they-rising-15287056", "CluewebURLHash": "CD88BA42E7B6A1483F6EE9269A92F089", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why are gas prices so high in the UK?

This week, the average weekly price of retail gas hit an all-time high \u2026\nSteven Porrello Published October 14, 2021 1:48 pm EDT\nImage source: Getty Images\nIt\u2019s official: we\u2019ve broken another national record.\nThis week, the average weekly price of retail gas hit an all-time high of $1.45 per litre. That\u2019s around $.40 more than it was this time last year, and $.10 to $.20 more than it was just this past summer.\nThat last fact has left many Canadians scratching their heads. Under normal circumstances, gas prices fall in the winter (when we all hibernate) and rise in the summer (when we take vacations). But this year is far from normal. What\u2019s going on with retail gas? Let\u2019s take a deeper dive.\nThe short answer: Crude oil\nThough many factors influence the price of retail gas, perhaps none impacts it so much as crude oil. And, right now, the world is facing a crude oil shortage.\nRecall that, last year, crude oil providers were in a bit of a bind. The world was closing up, and, in the midst of travel bans and lockdowns, many countries simply didn\u2019t need crude oil. Consumers weren\u2019t driving, factories weren\u2019t operating, and commercial flights were little more than a thing of the past. The demand for crude oil was so low, in fact, that oil providers were practically giving barrels away, with the price dipping below zero for the first time on record.\nIn order to limit lost revenues, OPEC+ decided to cut daily output in April 2020 by an astonishing 10 million barrels a day. Since then, OPEC+ hasn\u2019t revamped its oil production to pre-pandemic levels, despite the fact that demand for oil is growing more and more.\nWhy doesn\u2019t OPEC+ just make more oil?\nThat\u2019s the question many politicians, from the United States to India, even to Canada, are asking right now. OPEC+\u2019s answer? It\u2019s not a wise business move.\nFearing that the pandemic isn\u2019t quite over just yet, OPEC+ is taking a gradual approach to introducing more crude oil to the world. In November of this year, OPEC+ plans to add 400,000 barrels of crude oil per day. That may seem like a lot, but in actual fact, it\u2019s very little. Canada alone consumed around 2.5 million barrels of crude oil per day pre-pandemic, and the United States, the world\u2019s largest consumer of crude oil, consumes around 20 million daily.\nThough many countries are pressuring OPEC+ to reconsider their plans, they\u2019re not budging. And, unless they do, we could be in for a very expensive winter.\nWhat can you do?\nWell, for one, you may as well get used to higher gas prices. At least for now. From the looks of it, gas prices will continue to rise at least until the end of the year, possibly into next year, too. I would start moving some expenses around in your budget, especially if you drive a car or truck that consumes a lot of gas.\nAt a more practical level, you could practice fuel-efficient driving habits. Driving slower, for instance, in-vehicle that\u2019s properly maintained (oil changes, clean air filter, tires at the right level) could help you save a few liters here and there, while carpooling and limiting how much you drive could help you save even more. Now might be a good time to download apps, such as GasBuddy, which will tell you where you can find the cheapest gas in your area.\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019d also look at some of Canada\u2019s best rewards credit cards and cashback cards. If you can\u2019t beat rising gas prices, you may as well profit from them. Certain rewards cards will give you more cashback for gas purchases, which could help you in the long run, especially if gas gets more expensive.\nJust Released! 5 Stocks Under $49 (FREE REPORT)\nStop Trading.

Prices also spiked earlier this month following the Colonial Pipeline shutdown, although that shutdown proved short-lived.\nSome have blamed President Biden and his policies for the rise in gas prices, with Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson even going so far as to claim on television that the president \u201capproves of\u201d the shutdown and higher prices.\nNow, the ranks of those implicitly blaming Biden for the higher gas prices have been joined by his predecessor as president, Donald Trump.\n\u201cWith Memorial Day Weekend coming up, tomorrow people start driving in the biggest automobile days of the year. I\u2019m sorry to say the gasoline prices that you will be confronted with are far higher than they were just a short number of months ago where we had gasoline under $2 a gallon,\u201d the former president wrote Thursday, on this \u201cFrom the Desk of Donald J. Trump\u201d website that he now uses as a Twitter substitute. \u201cRemember as you\u2019re watching the meter tick, and your dollars pile up, how great of a job Donald Trump did as President. Soon Russia and the Middle East will be making a fortune on oil, and you will be saying how good it was to have me as your President.\u201d\nTrump concluded the post with \u201cWasn\u2019t it great to be energy independent, but we are energy independent no more. Shame, shame, shame. Other than that, have a great Memorial Day Weekend!\u201d\nAs has often been the case regardless of social media platform, the former president is being misleading.\nPer a GasBuddy chart, the only time in Trump\u2019s presidency when the average price of gas was under $2 a gallon was in the spring and early summer of 2020. Those were the opening months of the pandemic when most Americans were stuck at home, very few cars were on the road, and demand for gasoline collapsed. That was the result of the pandemic, not any action by any particular president.\nConversely, prices have begun to rise this year for the opposite reason: With the pandemic receding, demand is rising again, and more cars are on the road.\nMeanwhile, Politifact has disputed the notion that the U.S. became \u201cenergy-independent\u201d under Trump. The nation continues to import oil from overseas.\nMany who observe politics are tempted to blame higher gas prices, or credit lower ones, to whoever happens to be president at the time. But in reality, presidents are usually at the mercy of global market forces when it comes to what Americans pay at the pump.\nStephen Silver, a technology writer for The National Interest, is a journalist, essayist and film critic, who is also a contributor to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philly Voice, Philadelphia Weekly, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Living Life Fearless, Backstage magazine, Broad\u00a0Street Review and Splice Today.

Gas prices are currently the highest they have been in seven years, sitting at a national average of $3.14 per gallon for regular gasoline on Friday. In California, the cost of regular gasoline is more than a dollar higher than the national average, at $4.31 per gallon. The national average price is up nearly 40 percent since January. After the very low prices of 2020, these costs are a major burden, especially as many people have tighter budgets in the wake of the pandemic.\nThe high price of crude oil is the main driver of rising gas costs. Some of the main influences on prices are the quick rebound in demand as COVID restrictions wind down, the stalling of production increase talks between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, and anti-production policies here at home.\nPrices have increased dramatically partly because demand has rebounded faster than supply as COVID restrictions end. According to Price Futures Group senior marketing analyst Phil Flynn, the reason that oil futures are currently booming is this imbalance of supply and demand. This is likely to continue for some time: \u201cU.S. oil production is sputtering and OPEC seems reluctant to add too many barrels even if it is clear that the global oil market is begging for more.\u201d\nOPEC has been slow to reach agreement on production increases. On July 5, the organization and its ally countries known collectively as OPEC+ left the market in a state of uncertainty when they postponed production talks with no established resumption date. The United Arab Emirates is seeking a production increase that other member states oppose. The outcome of OPEC talks will determine how much of the nearly six million barrels of capacity that it\u2019s holding in reserve will be made available. If OPEC members suddenly broke rank and started producing at their actual capabilities, the supply crisis would quickly turn to a supply glut with its own set of concerns.\nAlthough OPEC is an important factor in the price of oil, gone are the days where the U.S. was powerless over the supply, and therefore the price, of oil. The U.S. has been responsible for the majority of the global increase in oil supply in the last decade. The U.S. accounted for an increase of 9.77 million barrels per day during the period from 2010 to 2019, which amounts to 80 percent of the global increase. So our national policy holds more sway over global oil supply than it did in previous decades.\nPolicies like carbon taxes raise the price of gas by design, so we should be wary of Democrats who bemoan the impact of higher prices on American consumers and especially the poor on one hand and make policy decisions to raise those prices on the other.\nPresident Biden\u2019s policy decisions have only slowed supply recovery. His administration has suspended oil and gas leases in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWAR) pending review to \u201cdetermine whether the leases should be reaffirmed, voiced, or subject to additional mitigation measure.\u201d The suspension of these leases and the push to limit drilling on federal lands in general mean that new supply from that quarter is unlikely in the near future.\nAnd Biden\u2019s cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline means natural gas from Canada has to compete for rail space with oil and gas, which is increasing both the demand and cost for transporting it by rail.\nWhile high gas prices have many causes, they are ultimately a case of out-of-sync supply and demand and of policy choices that go against the best interests of American consumers.\nAlan Cross \u2022 9 months ago\nWhy are gas prices rising?

Similar schemes are in place in Wales and Scotland.\nEnglish councils also have access to a \"discretionary fund\" for extra payments, including to people living in other council tax bands.\nIn Northern Ireland, where there is no council tax system, the government has been given money to make payments, but political uncertainty has meant the cash hasn't yet been released.\nConfusion over council tax rebate timing\nPoorest could miss out on \u00a3150 council tax rebate\nUnder a separate scheme, in October, customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a \u00a3200 rebate on their energy bills which they will have to repay at \u00a340 a year for five years, from April 2023.\nEligibility is also being expanded for the Warm Home Discount, which offers low income households a \u00a3150 one-off annual discount on their electricity bill between October and March.\nAll the big energy firms have hardship funds, and customers can also get advice from organisations such as Citizens Advice, Turn2Us or the StepChange debt charity.\nHow do energy prices affect the cost of living?\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that UK households are facing a \"cost of living catastrophe\".\nPrices are rising by 7% a year in the UK - the highest rate for 30 years - partly as a result of rising fuel and food costs. A National Insurance increase in April also left millions facing higher tax bills.\nThe Bank of England has put up interest rates to their highest level for 13 years to try to slow price rises, but has warned that inflation could be over 10% by the end of the year.\nWhy are prices rising so quickly?\nFour things that are going up in price and why\nWhat can I do to save on fuel costs?\nIn the past, consumers have been encouraged to shop around when bills rise.\nHowever, at the moment, better offers - especially fixed deals - are not available to new customers.\nPeople already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. A few firms, including British Gas and EDF, are offering new fixed price deals to some existing customers, which may be worth considering.\nOtherwise, households are being encouraged to save money by improving energy efficiency.\nThe Energy Saving Trust says several small changes could help many people off-set some of the recent rises in energy costs."}, {"Url": "https://bbc.co.uk/news/business-58090533.amp", "CluewebURLHash": "67D5F38344C40F8F770B5B7F1CCFC560", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Gas prices: Why are they so high and what is the energy ...", "Snippet": "\ue000Why\ue001 are \ue000gas\ue001 \ue000prices\ue001 \ue000so\ue001 \ue000high\ue001?

What caused the UK shortage as wholesale costs rise to record levels\nMillions of households across the UK are facing a spike in their energy bills due to rising wholesale prices and a supply shortage\nTap to unmute\nBy Alannah Francis\nSeptember 21, 2021 7:22 am (Updated 7:23 am)\nEnergy firms are facing closure as a result of record highs in wholesale energy prices and a gas supply shortage.\nThe challenges faced by both giant and small fuel firms is expected to have a knock on effect on consumers, with millions of households across the UK braced for a spike in their energy bills.\nAs part of its efforts to address the issue and concerns, the Government is holding emergency talks with suppliers and Ofgem, while reassuring consumers that they will be safeguarded against the difficulties confronting the energy industry.\nWhy are gas prices so high?\nCurrent high prices in the UK are a reflection of high gas prices globally.\nAs countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and reopen their economies, the demand for global gas has risen. Coupled with a cold winter, this has resulted in a gas market with reduced capacity.\nEnergy firms buy gas and electricity wholesale and with higher demand and limited supply, prices have shot up to record levels. Prices for wholesale gas are up\u00a0250 per cent since January, according to industry group\u00a0Oil\u00a0&\u00a0Gas UK.\nScheduled maintenance projects rescheduled from 2020 to 2021 because of the pandemic, lower than usual gas supply from Russia and less liquified natural gas reaching Europe because of increased deliveries to Asia have also contributed to spikes in wholesale energy prices and uncharacteristically low supply.\nHow will this affect consumers?\nMore than 22 million households are connected to the gas grid and in 2020, 38 per cent of the UK\u2019s gas supply was used for domestic heating and 29 per cent for electricity generation, meaning any effect of sharp rises in prices will be widespread.\nMillions of households could see their energy bills rise by at least \u00a3139 a year and some households face losing their current energy suppliers altogether.\nIf your energy supplier goes out of business, the energy regulator will move you to a new supplier and ensure your supply isn\u2019t disrupted.\nIn addition to a rise in household energy bills, many are worried the crisis could exacerbate food shortages and even affect essential medical supplies.\nAmid fears that price rises could leave some families forced to choose between food and fuel, the Government has sought to assure households that they will be protected and support will be available for those who face financial difficulties in heating their homes and paying their energy bills.\nWhat effect is this having on energy firms?\nMajor energy firms have called for the Government to lift the price cap, which limits the rates suppliers can charge for default tarriffs and safeguards consumers against sudden rises in costs.\nSmaller energy companies have said they risk going out of business, with four having already gone bust.\nPeter McGirr, chief executive of small energy firm Green, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI feel that without any support mechanism being put in place by Government, it\u2019s unlikely we will see the winter through.\u201d\nHow is the Government planning to address rising gas prices?\nThe Government has said that it does not anticipate any increased risk of supply emergencies this winter. But it is working with gas suppliers to monitor the issue and is looking into providing state-backed loans to energy companies to help them survive.\nBusiness secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has held emergency talks with leaders in the energy industry and regulator Ofgem to discuss solutions to the problems energy firms are facing.\nThe Government has also said its energy price cap will protect millions of customers from increases in global gas prices this winter. It has committed to supporting low income and fuel poor households with energy bills through the Warm Home Discount, which provides recipients with a \u00a3140 discount on their bills, winter fuel payments and cold weather payments.\nTopics\nEnergy\nEnergy Prices\nGas"}, {"Url": "https://businesstelegraph.co.uk/why-are-natural-gas-prices-so-high", "CluewebURLHash": "0F14D1F1C5B81C2673569F394FE479CE", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why are natural gas prices so high? - Business Telegraph", "Snippet": "US natural gas prices have surged to more than $4 per million British thermal units, the highest since late 2018, a rare rally in a market that has been weighted by oversupply since the shale gas production boom started a decade ago.

Justin Jacobs looks at what\u2019s driving the spike.\nOur second item is an interview with the chief executive of Nexans, one of the world\u2019s biggest cable makers, who argues that blackouts will become a growing problem if the US and Europe do not rapidly refresh their creaking power grids.\nAnd with another heatwave set to drive up air conditioning use across central parts of the US, we chart how energy costs weigh heavier on certain groups of Americans.\nThanks for reading.\nNatural gas prices feel the heat\nUS natural gas prices have surged to more than $4 per million British thermal units, the highest since late 2018, a rare rally in a market that has been weighted by oversupply since the shale gas production boom started a decade ago.\nWhat\u2019s fuelling the spike in prices?\nHigh temperatures are driving strong demand as Americans crank up their air conditioners to beat the heat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal agency, said last month was the hottest June on record in America, as a climate change-fuelled 1,000-year heat event baked the Pacific Northwest.\nAnd there\u2019s more hot weather on the horizon as a \u201cheat dome\u201d moves over Texas \u2014 as your Houston correspondent can attest to \u2014 and much of the US Midwest this week. (See more from Amanda below on the uneven toll the heat is inflicting on American communities.)\nTypically, power producers would start switching away from gas and towards coal at these prices, taking some of the steam out of the rally. But as analysts at the energy investment bank Tudor Pickering & Holt point out, \u201ccoal generation has failed to pick up materially and gas\u2019 share of the thermal stack has remained resilient\u201d.\nAt the same time, supply has not surged on the higher prices in the way it has in recent years, when growth-hungry producers were quick to drill on any hint of higher prices. This reflects the new reality of a slower-growing US gas market, which has been transformed by a wave of consolidation (now happening in oil as well) and shareholder pressure to keep a lid on output.\n\u201cThe market is searching for a price that will back off sufficient power sector demand or entice enough price-elastic supply to come down the pipe,\u201d analysts at Energy Aspects, an industry consultancy, wrote in a note.\nFor now, that search seems to have found that prices are headed higher. The Henry Hub forward curve, the main price benchmark, is above $4 through the end of the winter, which would mark the longest sustained period above that price level since 2014.\nWhat would be the fallout of one of the biggest natural gas price rallies since the shale boom began? A few areas we\u2019ll be watching:\nWhile coal burning has not picked up yet in the ways some analysts had expected, it almost certainly will if these natural gas prices persist. The Energy Information Administration, a federal forecaster, expects coal\u2019s share of US power generation to jump back to 24 per cent this year, from 20 per cent last, on higher natural gas prices. It could reverse a trend towards lower carbon emissions from the power sector and set back the Biden administration\u2019s climate efforts.\nIt will be another tailwind for US oil and gas producer finances, along with $70 a barrel oil, after last year\u2019s epic bust. While it might be obvious to point out that natural gas producers will see a boost to their profits from higher prices, many often underestimate how much they can lift even predominantly oil-focused producers\u2019 bottom line.\nHigher natural gas prices could also feed another data point into the great inflation debate. American industry has grown accustomed to some of the lowest energy costs in the world. Energy Aspects, the consultancy, says it does not expect manufacturers to pull back demand at these prices as the economic reopening gathers pace, but argues that increased energy costs \u201care likely to be passed on to end-use customers instead.\u201d\n(Justin Jacobs)\nPressure on ageing power grids fuels blackout fears\nEurope and North America face the prospect of serious and persistent blackouts in the coming years if countries fail to quickly rewire their ageing power grid infrastructure, according to the head of one of the world\u2019s biggest cable manufacturers.\nPower lines on both sides of the Atlantic built in the wake of the second world war are already well past their sell-by date. Now, as countries electrify sectors from transport to heating in order to tackle climate change, grids risk becoming overwhelmed.\n\u201cThe issue we have is that this power grid is 50 years [old],\u201d Christopher Gu\u00e9rin, chief executive of French cable maker Nexans, told ES. \u201cSo, each year that goes by, you have a [growing] risk of power outages \u2014 blackouts \u2014 in cities.\u201d\nMaking ever greater demands of today\u2019s creaky American and European energy infrastructure, he said, is like forcing\u00a0a clapped out car to drive at ever greater speeds \u2014 something is bound to go wrong eventually.\nGrids from Milan to Houston have already experienced significant disruption this year.\nPer capita power demand has jumped from 1.4 megawatt hours (MWh) in 1975 to 3.5 MWh in 2019. As countries look to electrify their economies, that is set to climb again to 3.8 MWh by the end of the decade and 4.4 MWh by 2040, according to Nexans.\nIn the US, the Department of Energy has estimated that power outages already cost the economy up to $70bn annually. President Joe Biden has blamed \u201cchronic under-investment\u201d in the country\u2019s grid infrastructure and proposed spending $100bn to upgrade the system as part of plans to shift America to carbon-free power by 2035.\nBut it is still unclear how much of Biden\u2019s wish list, which includes tax credits for renewables and transmission lines, will make it into a bipartisan infrastructure package set to be finalised this week.\nAmerica\u2019s rewiring plans \u2014 coupled with similar efforts under way in Europe as part of Brussels\u2019 Green Deal programme \u2014 is good news for cable makers like Nexans and its Italian rival Prysmian.\n\u201cWhen you analyse the Europe Green Deal investment, when you analyse Biden\u2019s \u2018Build Back Better\u2019 plan, when you go into the details of what Xi Jinping is doing in China in regards to the carbon neutrality objective in 2060\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. when you sum all that, we are at the beginning of a huge electrical revolution,\u201d said Gu\u00e9rin.\nThe market for wire and cables today sits at around $100bn \u2014 about a quarter of which is in the US. By 2030 that figure is set to rise by more than half to $156bn, said Gu\u00e9rin.\nOver the coming decade, Nexans plans to divest the parts of the company not focused on electrification \u2014 shedding the 45 per cent of its business that makes cables for sectors like automotive and telecoms \u2014 in a bid to focus all of its resources on capturing this rising demand.\n\u201cAll countries need to massively invest in the renewal of their power grid,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be massive in the next 20 years.\u201d\n(Myles McCormick)\nData Drill\nMany US households are facing escalating energy costs as a heat dome gathers across the country, but these costs will not be felt equally. A report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that black households are nearly twice as likely as their white counterparts to be severely burdened by energy costs. Low-income households and elderly households also shoulder a disproportionate toll.\nPandemic lockdowns, job losses and wage cuts have exacerbated the problem. A survey conducted by Indiana University researchers found that one in five respondents could not pay their energy bills last summer. While many states implemented utility moratoria, most have expired and millions of Americans are now being faced with overdue bills. The National Energy Assistance Directors\u2019 Association (NEADA) estimates Covid-19 utility debt to be as much as $40bn.\nAs customers and organisations like the NEADA push policymakers to cancel utility debt and expand federal and state aid programmes, there are signs of progress. In May, Senator Jeff Merkley introduced a bill that would cancel utility debts for low-income households.

A gallon of regular costs an extra $.10 or more over what it did one week ago in nine states (Kentucky, Indiana, Florida, Michigan, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, Illinois and Delaware) and Washington, D.C., according to AAA. California drivers almost always face the highest gas prices in the nation, and they're paying well over $4 a gallon right now \u2014 an average of $4.44, at last check, compared to $3.21 a year ago.\nFor drivers, high gas prices today are not just painful, but probably quite confusing as well. The summer road trip season is over, and commuting is still down compared to pre-pandemic times.\nThat should mean that demand for gasoline remains fairly low. Indeed, demand at gas stations has fallen for the last two weeks, \"in line with expectations for autumn,\" a blog post from the GasBuddy app reported on Monday. And when demand is low and on the decline, prices are generally supposed to fall as well \u2014 or at least not climb.\nAd\nPaying less towards your mortgage each month frees extra cash in your budget.\nYou could save thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan and reduce monthly payments.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 52% of the retail price of gasoline is based on how much wholesale crude oil costs. The rest of the cost comes from refining the oil, plus taxes and distribution and marketing.\nCrude prices are high for a variety of reasons, though industry experts say it's mainly because OPEC+ \u2014 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, consisting of Saudi Arabia and 12 other oil-production nations, plus their allies \u2014 have decided to keep output limited.\nThe White House has been pressuring OPEC+ to increase oil production, which was scaled back dramatically in 2020 and still is below pre-pandemic levels. A Biden administration official said that it has instructed oil-producing countries to \"do more\" to address rising crude prices, and that it is \"using every tool at our disposal to address anti-competitive practices in U.S. and global energy markets to ensure reliable and stable energy markets,\" Reuters reported.\n\"While we need to take steps to address short-term supply issues, we need to also keep our eye on the long term and the impact of the climate \u2014 the crisis that is \u2014 we are in the middle of and ensure that we are continuing to encourage the production and rise of renewables and the clean energy industry,\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a recent press briefing.\nLast week, after OPEC+ decided it would not raise production beyond an already agreed-upon level, oil prices hit a seven-year high. So it does not come as a surprise that retail gas prices in the U.S. followed by hitting a seven-year high as well.\nThe last time gas prices were consistently this high in the U.S. was 2014. That year, gas prices reached their peak in June with an average of $3.77 per gallon nationally. Prices steadily decreased through the fall of 2014 into winter, however, which is how things normally go.\nUnfortunately for drivers, 2021 is not a normal year in many ways, and that includes gas price trends.\nAd\nYou never know when you might find yourself financially strapped - the good news is you have options.\nA Personal Loan can help you mitigate losses and get back on track.

Even in a cheap fuel haven like Alberta, prices are peaking as high as $1.26 per litre in Edmonton and $1.28 in Calgary. In B.C., the average price is an incredible $1.38 per litre, breaking $1.40 in Vancouver.\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nSo, the National Post called up Dan McTeague with GasBuddy.com and a semi-obsessive expert on all things petroleum. Below, the surprisingly complex backstory to why your Honda just got way more expensive to run.\nSUV Review: 2022 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum\nBlame it all on a production slowdown in the U.S.\nDespite our oceans of oil in Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada still gets much of its gasoline from U.S. refineries. ExxonMobil just slowed operations at its Joliet, Ill., refinery to carry out some seasonal maintenance. Same deal at a BP refinery in Whiting, Ind. Then a Texas-to-Oklahoma fuel pipeline sprung a leak, necessitating a temporary shutdown. All of these events barely merited a mention in the news, but they\u2019re collectively costing consumers millions in pricier gas. Much of the Canadian gasoline market is subject to the Chicago wholesale price for gasoline. At the beginning of October, it was $0.56 CDN per litre. Now, it\u2019s shot up to $0.65 CDN. And, of course, the end cost is significantly higher for Canadian drivers once taxes, transport costs and profit are all tacked on.\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nThe Joliet refinery in 2005. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images\nThe Americans have been particularly thirsty for gasoline lately\nA leaky pipeline and some routine maintenance are \u201crelatively mundane factors,\u201d as GasBuddy noted in a blog, but they\u2019ve been helping to spike prices for the simple reason that Americans suddenly need a lot more gas. U.S. consumers are demanding 257,000 more barrels of gasoline, per day, than this time last year. The country\u2019s economic growth is at three per cent and unemployment is continuing the plunge it began in 2010. It all makes for more cars and trucks on the road, and greater stress on the U.S. fuel supply. This time last year, the U.S. Midwest had 49.5 million barrels of gasoline on hand. Now, it\u2019s down to 45.5 million barrels. \u201cThis is the lowest we\u2019ve been in a very, very, very long time,\u201d said McTeague. The result is that the U.S. is similarly getting hammered by higher gas prices, although not nearly as badly as in Canada. Right now, California is home to the highest gas prices in the United States. Still, if Leonardo DiCaprio knows where to look, he can fuel up his Range Rover for the equivalent of 91 cents CDN per litre.\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nThe U.S. economy is doing great!

By the beginning of November, that was down to as low as 77 cents. Naturally, a devalued currency means it costs Canada just a bit extra to bring all of its gas and diesel over the border. Although, according to McTeague, the absolute maximum effect this would have at the pump would be to raise prices by four cents; a fraction of the 16 cents on average that Canadian prices have risen since early October.\nA stack of pipes in Germany.

That ruptured pipeline mentioned earlier is already fixed, and major refineries will soon wrap up their seasonal maintenance. However, this is all happening just in time for consumers to get hammered with the effects of higher global prices on crude oil.

Data from the US Energy Information Administration, which found gas prices rising throughout 2021, hitting levels not seen since the middle of the last decade. Prices continued to spike throughout October, hitting an average of $3.40 a gallon on November 22:\nThe reasons for the price spike are textbook supply and demand from an economics textbook: Americans have gotten back to driving more this summer as the pandemic has moderated, and a combination of domestic supply interruptions and trouble in energy markets overseas have made crude oil more expensive.\nDemand is up as Americans take to the road again\nAs with so many other aspects of everyday life, the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed how Americans travel. Lockdowns and the uncontrolled early spread of the virus led to canceled travel and a sharp reduction in commutes.\nBy summer 2021, however, Americans were back on the road. The number of vehicle miles traveled measured by the Federal Highway Administration plummeted in spring 2020, but in the last few months, highway traffic was back up to what would normally be seen in midsummer:\nThat increase in the amount of driving Americans are doing also means an increase in demand for fuel for cars.\nUS oil production and refining haven't kept up\nIn addition to that ramp-up in demand, there have been some big supply constraints as well.\nThe Energy Information Administration noted in mid-September that Hurricane Ida shut down a large swath of the US's oil drilling and refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico in late August.\nWhile rigs and refineries have quickly come back online since, crude oil inventories remain low, suggesting an ongoing lack of supply. EIA wrote that as of late September, oil stored at Cushing, Oklahoma, one of the main crude depots in the US, was down 40% from the start of the year.\nOther EIA data shows that crude oil inventories across the country remain subdued:\nA crunch in domestic oil supply and stockpiles coupled with a rise in demand leads to higher gas prices.\nEnergy markets around the world are in a crunch\nIn addition to domestic oil supply slowing down, oil and energy markets overseas also aren't helping matters on the supply front.\nOPEC and other major oil-exporting countries have repeatedly agreed to only modest increases in production, despite oil consumers like the US and India pushing for higher exports, according to CNBC. The cartel most recently agreed to increase production by just 400,000 barrels per day in December, after President Joe Biden directly called for more production to ease rising prices. But it's a delicate balance, as shown by some cartel members' response to Biden and other world leaders tapping their strategic oil reserves: a reported pause in ramping up production .\nIt also shows how the cartel of oil exporters still holds a huge amount of power in global oil markets, even as the US has vastly increased production over the last decade and countries around the world begin the process of moving toward greener energy sources.\nBroader energy markets have been facing supply shortages as well. European natural gas and electricity prices have skyrocketed, and traders expect higher oil and other energy prices for months to come. Russia, a key provider of natural gas to the EU, has held back on increased deliveries to the West, keeping prices volatile and high.\nPut together surging demand from the US reopening with supply crunches both domestic and global, and it should be no surprise that gas prices are spiking.\nKeep reading\nMore:"}, {"Url": "https://thebalance.com/why-are-gas-prices-so-high-3305653", "CluewebURLHash": "42030D4AFFB85B40190DF63ACFE6662F", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "The Price of Gas: Why It Goes Up and Down", "Snippet": "High gas prices are created by high crude oil prices.

The price for a gallon of regular gas was $2.58 on January 6, 2020. It plummeted 31% to $1.77 by the end of April 2020 and then rose 24% to $2.20 a gallon on July 13, 2020, where it held steady for the remainder of the year. Through 2021, prices steadily increased, rising 46% to end the year at $3.28. By March 2022, gas prices had risen above $4.10, their highest since July 2008. 1\nA combination of factors, including the response to the coronavirus pandemic, created this extreme volatility.\nKey Takeaways\nOil costs account for 43% of gas costs, so when the price of crude oil goes up, so does the price of gas.\nMany factors affect oil and gas prices, including seasonal demand, commodities speculation, and the value of the U.S. dollar.\nTo potentially lower gas prices over time, consumers and governments could prioritize fuel efficiency, alternative fuels, and public transit.\nWhat Impacts Gas Prices?\nHigh\u00a0gas prices\u00a0are created, in large part, by high crude oil prices. Oil costs account for 43% of the price of regular gasoline. The remaining 57% comes from distribution and marketing, refining, and taxes. These inputs don't change as frequently as oil prices do. 2\nTwo grades of oil are benchmarks for other oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is the benchmark for U.S. oil prices. Brent North Sea oil is the benchmark for global oil prices.\nWhen oil prices rise, you can also expect to see the price of gas eventually rise at the pump. A $10 rise in oil prices (per barrel) translates to a $0.25 increase in gas prices (per gallon) over the long term. 3\nGas prices and underlying oil prices are determined by three factors: supply and demand, commodities traders, and the value of the dollar.\nSupply and Demand\nLike most of the things you buy,\u00a0supply and demand\u00a0affect both gas and oil prices. When demand is greater than supply, prices rise, and vice versa. For example,\u00a0the exploration of new U.S. shale oil reserves\u00a0increased the oil supply in 2014, and gas prices\u00a0fell, but that boom\u00a0reversed when\u00a0low prices put many producers out of business.\nSeasonal demand also affects oil and gas prices. Normally, gas prices rise every spring. The demand for gas increases in the summer as families hit the road to go on vacation. Regulations also require a shift to summer-grade gasoline, which is more expensive to produce. 4\nCommodities Traders\nTraders of commodities, such as gasoline, wheat, and gold,\u00a0also cause high gas prices. They buy oil and gasoline on the commodities futures markets. Those markets allow companies to buy contracts of gasoline for future delivery at an agreed-upon price. But most traders have no intention of taking ownership. Instead, they plan to sell the contract for a profit.\nBoth gas and oil prices are affected by the ups and downs in these\u00a0futures contracts. 5 The price depends on what buyers\u00a0think the price of gas or oil will be in the future.\nWhen traders think that gas or oil prices will be high, they often bid them up even higher. Normally, that occurs in the spring as traders start buying oil futures contracts in anticipation of the summer price rise.\nIn this way, commodities traders create a self-fulfilling prophecy, which leads to an asset bubble. Unfortunately, the one who pays for this bubble is you, at the gas pump.\nThe Value of the Dollar\nGas and oil prices also rise when the\u00a0value of the U.S. dollar declines. Oil prices rose between 2002 and 2008 because the dollar depreciated significantly during that time. 6\nOil contracts are all denominated in U.S. dollars.\nOil prices fell between late 2014 and 2016, partly for this reason. 7 A strong dollar allowed the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to make more money while keeping supply constant.\nHistory of Gas Prices\nHere's how different situations\u2014from conflict on the world stage to engineering mishaps\u2014have affected the price of gasoline.\n2011\nIn May, fears about unrest in Libya and Egypt sent oil prices up to nearly $127 per barrel. 8 Even after\u00a0oil prices\u00a0dropped, the price at the pump\u00a0stayed high. Why? Commodities traders were concerned about refinery closures due to the record\u00a0Mississippi River floods.\n2012\nIn February, concerns about potential military action against Iran \u2014by either Israel or the U.S.\u2014caused\u00a0high oil prices. At the same time, some U.S. oil refineries were closing. 9 Additionally,\u00a0oil and gas prices\u00a0tend to rise every spring, in anticipation of increased demand during the summer.\nAs a result, the price for a gallon of gasoline was above $3.50 by February 13, several weeks earlier than in 2011. By late March, the national average had jumped to $3.91 per gallon. The price of WTI oil exceeded $100 per barrel. 10\nPrices were high in August as a result of Hurricane Isaac, which\u00a0hit the U.S. Gulf Coast region\u00a0on August 28, 2012. 11 In anticipation of the Category 1 hurricane, refineries in the area shut down production. As a result,\u00a0crude oil production\u00a0lost nearly 1.3 million barrels per day, which caused the national average price of gas to increase.\n2013\nIran started making threats regarding the Strait\u00a0of Hormuz in March 2013. 12 Almost 20% of the world's oil flows through that narrow checkpoint bordering Iran and Oman.\nIn anticipation of such a crisis, oil traders bid up the price, which reached $118.90 per barrel on February 8. 13 Gas prices soon followed, rising to $3.78 per gallon by February 25. Prices\u00a0rose again in\u00a0August as oil prices hit a 15-month high that summer. That spike was\u00a0created by political unrest in Egypt. 14\n2014\nGas prices rose in\u00a0April because the price for WTI oil\u00a0rose to $104\u00a0per barrel. 15 New pipelines from the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub pushed inventories to the lowest levels since November 2009. 16\nThe price of imported Brent oil rose to\u00a0$111 per barrel in May. 8 This spike was caused by the\u00a0Ukraine crisis as well as unrest in\u00a0Nigeria and Iraq, two significant oil producers.\n2015\nIn 2015, California experienced the highest gas prices in the country for the first time, with an average annual price of $3.16. Midwest\u00a0refinery problems sent California's oil elsewhere. Since it doesn't have major pipelines from other regions, California had to wait for tankers with imported oil to arrive.\n2016\nGas prices rose when OPEC\u00a0cut production in November. Members agreed to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day in January 2017. In response, traders bid up oil prices in December 2016.\nGas prices rose for 14 consecutive days\u00a0after the OPEC meeting. The national average of $2.23 per gallon was up 20 cents, compared to the same time period the previous year.\n2017\nOn August 25, Hurricane Harvey\u00a0hit Texas, wiping out 5% of the nation's oil and gas production. Gas prices\u00a0rose from $2.37 per gallon to $2.68 per gallon in a matter of weeks. By September, the U.S. Department of Energy had released 5.2 million barrels of oil from the\u00a0Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 17\nIn November, OPEC agreed to keep production cuts through\u00a02018.\u00a0At a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing nations in December 2018, they again cut production.\n2018\nThanks to increased shale oil drilling, the U.S. became the world\u2019s largest oil producer. 18\nIn May, global oil prices reached $80 per barrel following the U.S. decision to pull out of the\u00a0Iran nuclear agreement\u00a0and reinstate sanctions. Production in Iran dropped from 3.84 million barrels per day (Mbpd) in January to 2.6 Mbpd in December 2018. 19 In addition, Venezuela faced limited production. Gas prices reached $2.90 per gallon in October.\n2019\nOil prices entered a bear market in 2019. The price of WTI oil peaked at $66.24 per barrel on April 23, 2019. It fell to $52.41 on October 3, 2019. One reason was that U.S. oil production had increased to a record of 12.8 Mbpd by late 2019. It was also the first time since at least 1948 that the U.S. exported more oil than it imported.\n2020\nIn January 2020, governments began shutting down travel and businesses to stem the COVID-19 pandemic. By April, much of the world's population had been told to stay at home. Demand for oil fell by 5,600 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020. 20\nA drop in demand was worsened by a supply glut. On March 6, Russia announced that it would increase production to offset falling prices. 21 To remain competitive, OPEC also increased production. As oil-storage facilities filled up, oil and gas prices plummeted.\nOn April 12, 2020, OPEC and Russia agreed to lower output in order to support prices. 22 It wasn't enough, however. By April 20, 2020, the price for a barrel of oil had fallen below zero to about negative $37. 23 Traders were willing to pay someone else to take delivery of the oil, since they couldn't store it.\n2021\nIn early 2021, the rollout of vaccines and a decrease in lifestyle restrictions drove up demand for gas as more people began to resume pre-pandemic activities. Oil production remained depressed throughout the year, exacerbating the upward pressure on oil and gas prices. 24 By mid-May, the price of gas surpassed $3 a gallon for the first time since 2014.\nIn the second half of the year, inflation increased at its highest rate in decades under the pressure of supply chain constraints like labor shortages. 25 Gas closed out the year at $3.28.\n2022\nGas prices jumped even higher in early 2022 on the news Russia, one of the world's biggest oil producers and exporters, was amassing troops along its border with Ukraine. Despite attempts at diplomacy, the oil market's fears were confirmed when Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The invasion prompted the U.S. and its allies to impose tough economic sanctions on Russia, including a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports. Subsequently, gas prices jumped to decade highs, surpassing $4 nationally and topping $5.69 in California.\nFactors That Force High Gas Prices To Drop\nThe April-to-September vacation-driving season often causes an increase in gas prices. Prices tend to fall in the winter because transportation needs and production costs are lower. This price decrease even offsets an increase in home heating oil usage for winter in northern areas of the U.S.\nGas prices usually drop when supply increases. There are a lot of ways that could happen; for example, OPEC could decide to release more oil, or shale oil producers could find another large deposit or adopt new technology.\nPrices also fall as the dollar's value rises. OPEC can allow supply to expand, since they'll remain profitable with a rising dollar.\nMost important is the impact that all of these factors have on commodities traders. If they believe that oil and gas prices will fall, they won't bid up futures contracts. They may even find another investment, which would allow prices to decline further.\nHow Can We Reduce Gas Prices?\nThe most immediate thing we can do is to reduce our usage of gas by driving less or increasing fuel efficiency. One easy way to improve fuel efficiency is to keep tires inflated.\u00a0Keeping the engine properly tuned can improve a car's gas mileage by 4%. 26 Urban dwellers can\u00a0use public transit. Others can move closer to work in order to reduce commuting time.\nFor the long term, we can change our need for oil and gas by switching to alternative-fuel\u00a0vehicles. 27\nCould these actions reduce the high price of gas? Maybe, if they are sustained over a long period of time.\nThe best way for consumers to\u00a0lower gas prices\u00a0is to reduce\u00a0demand\u00a0for gas and oil for a sustained period.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWho controls gas prices?\nAlthough many politicians would like to take credit for falling gas prices\u2014and blame their rivals for rising prices\u2014gas prices are mostly affected by market forces. Legislation and policy can have an effect on gas prices, but no one person or entity controls prices.\nWhat state has the highest gas prices?\nCalifornia, Hawaii, and Nevada usually have the highest average fuel price in the U.S., while southern states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas often have the cheapest prices. 28\nHow do gas prices affect the U.S. economy?\nGas prices can have a significant impact on the economy. When consumers spend more or less on fuel, they have more or less to spend on other goods and services, so it can have effects on demand throughout the economy. Further, gasoline prices are based on the price of crude oil, and fluctuations in the price of crude oil can have effects on inflation. Increases in crude oil prices often precede recessions. 29\nArticle Sources"}, {"Url": "https://deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/5/11/22430433/gas-prices-rise-why", "CluewebURLHash": "2F5E4909274AC0C24E3DE4E3B35EA8AD", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Gas prices 2021: Why are prices so high right now ...", "Snippet": "Why are gas prices so high?\ue000 A recent ransomware attack led to a shutdown at the Colonial Pipeline\ue001 ,\ue000 which helps with the supply of gasoline across the country,\ue001 according to CNN .

By the end of August, AAA warned, the price for a gallon of gas is expected to rise by another dime or two. While in Utah, the Beehive State saw a 6 cents a gallon spike in a matter of week, AAA reported, one of the highest rises in the country during that period.\nWhy are gas prices going up?\nAccording to experts, the answer for why the cost to fill up is so high is no more difficult to understand than lessons learned in a basic economics class \u2014 supply and demand.\n\u201cRobust gasoline demand and more expensive crude oil prices are pushing gas prices higher,\u201d said spokesperson Jeanette McGee in AAA\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cWe had hoped that global crude production increases would bring some relief at the pump this month, but weekend OPEC negotiations fell through with no agreement reached.

And what can be done about it? Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian\nS o n j a v a n R e n s s e n\nMon 14 Apr 2014 03.30 EDT\nLast modified on Fri 11 Apr 2014 12.56 EDT\n26\nW e're spending more and more on energy with no end in sight, regardless of what shade of green we plan for our future. Can we do anything about it? Gas prices are not easy to control, but politicians do set energy taxes and levies, and decide on how investment in low-carbon power generation, the power grid and energy efficiency is spent.\nUnderstanding what makes up our energy bills is key to holding politicians and energy providers to account. Here are the five reasons your gas bills are high and rising.\n1. High gas prices\n\"In the last 10 years, commodity prices are probably the single biggest thing that has affected energy bills in the UK,\" says energy consultant Matt Brown. Most of the money households fork out for energy is spent on gas for heating, some 60%. But in the UK's gas-driven power sector, the gas price has also become the main driver of the electricity price.\nEnergy bills have gone up as the UK shifted from being a net exporter to a net importer of gas in the last decade, and gas prices rose in tandem with oil prices. The two fuels are typically drilled for together and their prices remain closely linked, despite Brussels' efforts to create more of an open market for gas.\n2. Green levies and other taxes\nThat said, the relative importance of gas prices is going down. The most recent increases in electricity bills across Europe are primarily due to higher taxes and levies, including support for renewable energy, according to research from the European Commission.\nCalculating just how strong a price driver this is, however, is difficult. European electricity industry association Eurelectric is working on a yet-to-be published study whose first findings show that the energy part of UK household electricity bills went down by 4% from 2008-12, not up by 6% as the commission calculates. Instead, Eurelectric attributes much more of the total increase in bills to taxes and levies. Suddenly the \"big six\" energy firms no longer look like the biggest problem; it could be government.\nIn truth the figures differ because countries do their accounting differently. The UK counts renewables subsidies towards a bill's energy component while Spain, for example, adds it to grid costs. Note that, even with Eurelectric's revised numbers, taxes and levies make up just 15% of a UK household electricity bill compared to nearly half in Germany. This is also due to the UK's low VAT rate on energy \u2013 5% compared to 20% across most of Europe. Despite the controversy, UK households pay below average bills in Europe.\nAnd the finger is still pointing in the other direction: Ofgem has called for a full-scale competition enquiry into the energy sector because energy retailers increased their profits nearly fivefold from 2009-12 with \"no clear evidence\" of them becoming more cost-efficient. Are we paying them too much for our energy?\n3. Investment in the grid\nBills need to cover repairs, replacements and upgrades to the grid as well as low-carbon generation. Ofgem interim partner Martin Crouch does not see this as a cause of rising bills and expects network costs will be \"staying flat in real terms\".\nYet further investment is needed to link up offshore wind farms and better connect the UK to the European mainland. The latter would foster competition, bolster security of supply and enable imports of cheaper power from the likes of Germany, which has a surplus of renewables and a coal-driven power market. \"The UK would profit from the EU internal electricity market if it had enough interconnections,\" says Katharina Grave, a consultant with Ecofys.\nImporting green power from elsewhere could well be cheaper than subsidising expensive new domestic projects such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant too. Once built, it is due to get more subsidies than German photovoltaic (PV) solar projects do today.\nGrid-related costs make up about a fifth of the average UK household electricity bill today. Although Crouch and others expect this to hold steady because costs are spread over decades, further expenses may trickle down to consumers through energy producers who will pay for the bulk of offshore and international connections.\nMost grid costs relate to hardware, such as building new cables to carry electricity, but part of it includes the cost of technology including smart meters, which will enhance efficiency and curb the rise of total costs.\n4. Our outdated energy market\nSmart meters bring with them an opportunity to consume at times of day when electricity is cheaper (\"demand response\") and to produce our own electricity. Welcome to the era of the empowered consumer.\nFor the first time, customers will be able to select their energy provider on criteria beyond price per kilowatt hour and how green they claim to be. Technological change gives households the opportunity to demand a whole new kind of energy package. Yet consumers are held back by the way the electricity market currently operates.\n\"How markets are structured is not keeping up with reality and this is artificially and totally unnecessarily driving up prices,\" says Jessica Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, executive director of the Smart Energy Demand Coalition. The UK's plans for a market which will reward energy producers for their capacity to produce rather than what they actually provide risks shutting consumers out and simply providing a \"\u00a36bn subsidy for the big six\", she says.\nAnd yet the UK has gone farther than any other European country in making \"demand response\" possible. Some say it needs a higher electricity price to achieve more.\n5. Failure to be energy efficient\nHouseholds are spending more on energy even though they are consuming less. Energy efficiency improvements are inadequate to offset rising prices. Yet the perceived costs of doing energy efficiency threaten the future of the UK's energy efficiency programme overall. \"The one thing that will benefit consumers will be savagely cut,\" says Eoin Lees, founder of the UK's Energy Saving Trust.\n\"Energy efficiency is by far the most effective way to cut energy bills,\" argues Ed Matthew, founder of Transform UK, which is running an energy bills campaign. \"Renovating buildings needs to become one of the UK's priority infrastructure investments.\"\nSonja van Renssen is a Brussels-based writer for Energy Post\nThis article is part of the Guardian's #bigenergydebate series.

Prose\nPennsylvania State Capital Bureau\nView Comments\n0:09\n0:25\nGas prices across the country are at the highest levels since 2014, according to AAA and GasBuddy .\nIn Pennsylvania, drivers are paying about $1 more per gallon\u00a0compared to this time last year.\nThe costs are linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, global oil production and increasing demand, according to experts.\nHere's what else you need to know.\nWhy are gas prices going up?\nBoth the growing cost of crude oil and a recent decision from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other allies are playing a role in\u00a0higher\u00a0prices ,\u00a0according to AAA.\nIt's out of the norm for this time of year, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, explained.\nUsually gas prices\u00a0decline slightly in the fall,\u00a0he said, but this year, the pandemic is continuing to have\u00a0long-term effects on consumers.\n\"There's been a lot of imbalances created by COVID,\"\u00a0De Haan said. \"And this is simply one of them.\"\nWhen COVID first hit in March 2020,\u00a0the drop in gas demand caused a drop in prices, he explained. As a result, oil companies started to flatten production and implement mass layoffs.\nNowhere to labor: The U.S. oil industry has lost hundreds of rigs in a 'historic and troubling' year\nFast forward about a year later, with the\u00a0arrival of the vaccines and a return to travel, and De Haan said they\u00a0started to see consumer confidence and gas\u00a0demand go back up.\nNow, \"demand for gasoline since then has reached near-normal levels,\"\u00a0De Haan said. \"It's still slightly below \u2014 and I think a lot of that is because people are still working from home \u2014 but we're still in the midst of the pandemic.\"\nThough demand is\u00a0\"nearly normal\" again, oil production is \"lagging severely behind\" De Haan said.\nRising prices: Gas prices keep rising across the country to highest levels since 2014\n\"Part of the reason is because the depth of the crisis last year,\" De Haan said. \"Oil companies let millions of people go. Not only did U.S. oil producers\u00a0slow production down, but OPEC did as well. And since then, they've been slow to increase production again.\"\nIn talks last week, OPEC+ discussed the issue of increasing global oil production. The group decided to continue their \"gradual approach\" to restoring production, according to the Associated Press, adding\u00a0400,000 barrels per day in November.\nA previous agreement, which was not implemented, would have produced about 800,000 barrels per day, according to AAA.\nWhat does that mean for Pa. drivers?\nThe average price of gas in Pennsylvania is $3.47, according to AAA, above the national average of $3.32\u00a0and up 5 cents from a week ago.\nAverage gas prices across Pennsylvania\u00a0as of Oct. 18:\nAllentown/Bethlehem/Easton, $3.454\nAltoona, $3.458\nBloomsburg/Berwick, $3.463\nChambersburg/Waynesboro, $3.465\nEast Stroudsburg, $3.469\nErie, $3.630\nGettysburg, $3.450\nHarrisburg, $3.457\nJohnstown, $3.434\nLancaster, $3.451\nLebanon, $3.448\nMercer County, $3.547\nPhiladelphia, $3.474\nPittsburgh, $3.452\nReading, $3.460\nScranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton, $3.473\nState College, $3.422\nWilliamsport, $3.487\nYork, $3.471\nIn addition to the rising national trend, consumers might see prices vary based on\u00a0\"price cycling,\"\u00a0De Haan said.\nThat's when one gas station\u00a0might raise\u00a0prices by about 20 cents to 40 cents,\u00a0causing other local gas stations to follow suit.\nAfter several stations have raised their prices, that first station might drop prices by about a penny\u00a0each day,\u00a0leading to a chain reaction in the opposite direction.\n\"They keep undercutting each other, a penny or two every day,\" \u00a0De Haan said. \"Until the station is losing money, and that's when the station then will hike prices back up. And then the\u00a0price war is happening all over again.\n\"Price cycling basically means that prices shoot up every seven to 12 days on average. But it also means that right after prices go up, they start to come down as well.\"\nFact check: Rising gas prices due to high demand and low supply, not Biden's policies\nWhat's next?\n\"There's so many COVID-related bottlenecks that develop relatively quickly,\"\u00a0De Haan said. \"That it's just really impossible to know what could happen tomorrow.\"\nHe encourages drivers to shop around on their next trip to fill up the tank because prices can fluctuate from station to station.\n\"Those sorts of price discrepancies always provide an opportunity for motorists to spend a little bit less,\" De Haan said.\nContact Rashika Jaipuriar at rjaipuriar@gannett.comand\u00a0follow her on Twitter @rashikajpr.\nJ.D.

In this OIES Comment, we analyse the drivers behind this pricing fluctuation, and offer an outlook for the coming winter. In order to avoid the distorting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we compare the year to date (January-August) 2021 with the same period in 2019. On the global LNG market, the supply-side increase in nameplate export capacity was offset by outages at a number of export plants. By contrast, LNG demand outside Europe surged. This meant that growth in supply simply did not keep pace with the increase in demand. With Europe as the \u2018balancing market\u2019 for global LNG, its role as the absorber of excess volumes in 2019 was reversed in 2021, as European LNG imports declined. On the European market, the decline in LNG imports was accompanied by a decline in European production and pipeline imports from regional suppliers, most notably Russia. Yet demand remained at the same level as 2019, and the gap was met by net storage withdrawals. Therefore, we conclude that with both the global LNG market in general and the European market in particular noticeably tighter, the ongoing price rally is driven by fundamentals, with an added \u2018fear premium\u2019 that the forthcoming winter could be as cold as that in 2020/21. If that proves to be the case, the current price levels will persist, and even rise, while a milder winter could see the market turn slightly more bearish.\nBy: Mike Fulwood , Jack Sharples\nDownload Publication\nCategories:\nGas , Gas Programme\nTags:\nGlobal LNG market; European gas market; Gas prices\nCopyright \u00a9 1982-2019 The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies\n57 Woodstock Road\nOxford OX2 6FA\nUnited Kingdom"}, {"Url": "https://qz.com/2061514/why-is-natural-gas-so-expensive-right-now", "CluewebURLHash": "3AD63C7299EF9B3335B15D106654827A", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000Why\ue001 is natural \ue000gas\ue001 \ue000so\ue001 expensive right now? \u2014 Quartz", "Snippet": "Meanwhile, \ue000high\ue001 \ue000gas\ue001 \ue000prices\ue001 are also a problem outside the electricity sector.

Gas stockpiles in the US are at least 7% below average; in Europe they\u2019re more than 20% below average. Norway has agreed to increase gas exports to Europe.\nSeveral factors came together to drain natural gas supplies: A prolonged, cold winter in 2020 in both the US and Europe; low gas prices and general economic uncertainty during the pandemic that induced many drillers to idle production; Hurricane Ida in August, which temporarily knocked out gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico; low exports from Russia; fierce competition for shipments of liquefied natural gas with buyers willing to pay top dollar in Asia; and below-average electricity generation from hydropower dams in the western US and European wind farms, which forced grid operators to fill the gap with gas.\nWhat high gas prices mean for companies\nSeven retail electricity providers in the UK have already been forced out of business this year by high gas prices, as they\u2019re forced by existing contracts and legal price caps to sell power to customers at a rate far below what they paid for it. On Sept. 20, the UK continued negotiations with Bulb and other leading providers about a potential bailout to prevent more companies from going bust \u2014especially if they are forced to pick up new consumers that jump from foundering competitors.\nMeanwhile, high gas prices are also a problem outside the electricity sector. The US fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings, which uses natural gas as a key ingredient, closed two plants in the UK; a fertilizer shortfall could cause food prices to rise, as well as limit supplies of industrial CO2, a fertilizer byproduct that is used in carbonated beverages, slaughterhouses, and other food processing applications. Expensive gas also likely points to higher prices for plastics.\nIn a Sept. 20 research note, Bank of America analysts said they expect gas production to pick up in response to the higher prices, and projected them to fall back toward $4 by the end of this year. But they warn that one severe winter storm could easily throw the market off balance yet again.\nTip: tap card to advance \ud83d\udc49\nThe most pressing question\nHow do we get to net zero emissions?\nThe question will define the global economy for the next century. The IPCC estimates (pdf) we need to invest at least $1.6 trillion per year through 2050 to put the planet on a safe climate trajectory. We\u2019re spending about 20% of that figure today. And that\u2019s just for the energy sector.\u00a0 The climate economy means almost every aspect of our global system\u2014agriculture, transportation, energy, construction\u2014will need to be rethought and redesigned to reduce and then remove greenhouse gases from the equation.

These claims have been in circulation since January and particularly allege Biden's cancellation\u00a0of the Keystone XL pipeline significantly impacted gasoline, \"ensur(ing)\u00a0a huge increase in gas prices for millions of us.\"\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the posters for comment.\nFact check: False claim says Biden's American Families Plan would extend high school by 4 years\nWhile it's true gasoline prices have risen significantly since Biden took office on Jan. 20 the upward trend predates Biden's time in office and is related to COVID-19 and market factors, not who occupies the White House.\nPandemic's effect on supply and demand\nAs with any commodity, the price of gasoline is determined by the simple balance of supply and demand:\u00a0a high supply and low demand means low prices, while a low supply and high demand mean prices rise.\nDelivery: Mon - Fri\nThe most important driver of this fluctuation is crude oil, from which gasoline is derived. This fossil fuel typically accounts for\u00a0between 50% and 60% of the price at the pump, said Jeanette McGee, a spokesperson for AAA.\nIn 2020, crude oil prices became extremely cheap,\u00a0so much so it was being traded at negative prices, McGee told USA TODAY. Brent crude oil,\u00a0for example, a blend supplying most of Europe, was being sold at $9 a barrel, its lowest price in decades, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported .\nThe primary reason for this\u00a0drop in crude oil prices was the pandemic, said McGee and Mark Finley, a fellow at Rice University's Center for Energy Studies.\n\"The pandemic drove the world's oil market to become massively oversupplied, inventory dramatically increased and prices collapsed,\" Finley told USA TODAY.\nIn response\u00a0to the low demand due to reduced travel and lockdown restrictions, Finley said major oil-producing countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia and member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, decided to cut down on their own oil production.\nBut the cut meant oil producers weren't ready to meet the demand for crude oil once it renewed this year thanks to easing of COVID-19-related restrictions.\nFact check: Both Biden and Harris commemorated veterans on Memorial Day, despite false claims\n\"This year, demand has so far increased more quickly than production rates, which means the United States had to draw more on its gasoline storage inventories, which has contributed to prices going up,\" EIA spokesperson Chris Higginbotham said\u00a0in an email to USA TODAY. \"We expect oil producers in the United States and globally to increase their production levels through 2022, which we expect to contribute to lower crude oil prices, and lower gasoline prices.\"\nGas price uptrend predates Biden\nWhile presidential actions\u00a0and policies can have some impact on the crude oil market, they don't have as\u00a0much influence over gasoline prices as one might think.\n\"Some of (a president's) decisions can impact or contribute\u00a0to market changes, which can then impact (future) crude oil, but they don't dictate gas prices,\"\u00a0said McGee. \"If you go back and look at historical data, whether it was Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden, (gas prices) go up and down no matter who's in office.\"\nU.S. gas prices\nJan 2019 Apr Jul Oct Jan 2020 Apr Jul Oct Jan 2021 Apr 1.80 2.00 2.20 2.40 2.60 2.80 $3.00\nBiden \nsworn in \nJan. 20\nU.S. average\nSource:GasBuddy.com Get the data Created with Datawrapper\nDuring former President Donald Trump's term, the\u00a0national average for gasoline had gone up to nearly $3 a gallon in May 2018 and hovered close to that price until fall 2018, according to data maintained\u00a0by AAA. The cost rose yet again to nearly $3 a gallon in May 2019 before\u00a0dropping slightly below\u00a0$2 per gallon when state and local governments mandated lockdowns in March 2020.\nGas prices slowly crept from\u00a0$2.20 per gallon in September 2020 to $2.40 by the time Biden took office in January 2021. McGee said elections\u00a0typically drive gasoline prices up.\nThis upward trend\u00a0was expected to continue due\u00a0to pandemic recovery, reduced crude oil supply and the approach of summer \u2013 historically considered a peak travel season \u2013 but arrived sooner due to the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, the East Coast's major fuel supplier.\nFact check: Video of Biden discussing Jesus, the American Revolution and airports is missing context\n\"We have expected gas prices to hit $3 a gallon around Memorial Day, but with the (Colonial) pipeline offline, it actually jumped the national average to $3 and more prior to Memorial Day,\" said McGee.\nKeystone XL, other Biden policies don't affect today\u2019s gasoline costs\nMany critics point to Biden's decision on the Keystone XL pipeline as fueling the gas price spike, but experts say there's no such connection.\nThe extension of the Keystone pipeline, first proposed in 2008 by TC Energy based in Calgary, Canada, was rejected by former President Barack Obama in November 2015 but later approved by Trump in March 2017. Biden then\u00a0suspended the project in January. And on June 9, TC Energy announced it was\u00a0terminating\u00a0the project.\nEven if construction wasn't halted, the Keystone XL pipeline wasn't in operation and therefore wouldn't have an impact on current gas prices,\u00a0said Finley of Rice University.\n\"That was something that would impact down the road,\" he said.\nDavid Dismukes, economist and executive director of Lousiana State University's Center for Energy Studies, agreed, telling USA TODAY the pipeline would have had a \"longer-run impact in providing a diversity of supply for refineries in the Gulf Coast.\"\nSimilarly, other energy policies\u00a0rolled out by President Biden, such as postponing oil lease sales, have a long-term, but not short-term, effect.\nFact check: Online post misses the mark on gas prices, job growth, inflation\n\"If you look at some of the actions taken by the administration with regard to offshore drilling, drilling on federal lands, the outlook for fossil fuel energies in general, those are impacting the price of crude and expectations about crude oil,\" said Diskmukes. \"(Biden's policies do) have an impact, but that's not what you're seeing at the pump right now.\"\nOur rating: False\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim President Joe Biden is to blame for the current higher gas prices. The upward trend in gas costs we see now began months before Biden took office. Because of reduced demand amid the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, oil companies had to cut back on the amount of crude oil produced. Now with restrictions being lifted and more travel happening, the demand has increased, which, coupled with lagging supply, has led to increased gasoline prices. Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and other energy policies enacted by Biden have a long-term effect on crude oil supply but no present impact on gasoline prices.\nOur fact-check sources:\nAmerican Automobile Association, accessed June 9, National Average Gas Prices\nJeanette McGee, June 9, Phone interview with USA TODAY\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, Jan. 5, Crude oil prices briefly traded below $0 in spring 2020 but have since been mostly flat\nMark Finley, June 9, Phone interview with USA TODAY\nChris Higginbotham, June 9, Email interview with USA TODAY\nUSA TODAY, May 12, What you need to know about the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, gas prices, shortages\nUSA\u00a0 TODAY, Nov. 6, 2015, Obama administration rejects Keystone pipeline\nUSA TODAY, March 24, 2017, Trump grants Keystone permit, declares 'a great day for American jobs'\nAssociated Press, June 9, Keystone XL pipeline nixed after Biden stands firm on permit\nAssociated Press, Jan. 20, Keystone XL pipeline halted as Biden revokes permit\nDavid Dismukes, June 9, Phone interview with USA TODAY\nAssociated Press, Feb. 12, Interior postpones March oil leases onshore and offshore\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

As the virus began to spread across industrial Wuhan in the early weeks of 2020, shutdowns immediately began to affect businesses around the world who source materials from the Chinese region. Soon national quarantines halted many manufacturing, production and trade activities around the globe. With businesses scrambling to sustain themselves during this unprecedented time, they\u2019re also looking ahead to the post-COVID-19 environment. What will happen to the international ties that exist within businesses of all sizes \u2013 including foreign suppliers, employees and customers? Though it may seem difficult to believe in the current state of quarantine and closure, it is likely that these types of overseas connections will actually grow.\nHow can this be? Many are calling for fewer foreign partnerships in an effort to reduce the likelihood of future supply chain interruptions and support national employment. Such appeals have been a constant response since the Smoot-Hawley tariffs enacted around the Great Depression.\nShortly after closures began in China, a whopping 94% of Fortune 1000 companies began experiencing disruption in supply chain management before most formal North American lockdown procedures were put into place. Understandably, this triggered an immediate call for a removal of production from the region in order to prevent similar future stoppages. And while some organizations diverted operations at least partially away from the area, it does not mean that all activities will now become localized. In fact, the best recovery tactic for businesses may be to diversify their overseas suppliers, vendors and other relationships to ensure they can produce, regardless of any future localized delays or stoppages.\nWhy international partnerships exist\nThere are numerous reasons to partner with an international vendor, the most obvious of which is a cost-saving benefit. However, this is not necessarily the biggest benefit as it was in past decades. A combination of rising wages in emerging markets and lower employee benefits in the US has led to a smaller gap in labor fees. Still, it\u2019s mostly cheaper to source or manufacture items overseas and if that option were not available, prices would rise and be put onto the consumer, an option that companies would not favor, especially given the current economic climate.\nAdditionally, foreign partnerships allow for growth in ways that may not be available locally including sourcing international talent and scaling operations to increase output. Access to specialized or skilled staff in other parts of the world is a huge benefit to any company as they would not be limited to potential applications available only in their immediate area. Likewise, some overseas facilities have the capability of producing or creating on a larger level due to resourcing or accessibility.\nIn recent years, even small and newer businesses are seeking to include an international component in order to take advantage of these benefits. In a competitive landscape, such partnerships allow organizations to deliver rapidly and operate in a more agile way.\nAccessing global customer bases\nOne of the biggest \u2013 yet least discussed \u2013 benefits of international sourcing is gaining access to a new audience. For example, many US car manufacturers produce vehicles in Asia in part because they sell a great deal to consumers in surrounding countries. Similarly, European and Asian car makers have US or Canadian based production in North America to more easily access that market. Because effortlessly reaching more customers is so important to businesses of any size, it\u2019s unlikely that this practice will change.\nDemographic shifts have also long played a part in a business\u2019s need for accessing other markets. US and other developed countries have an increasingly aging population and businesses are looking abroad for other consumers.\nThe lasting effects of the US-China trade way\nMany are quick to point out that the US-China trade war was already causing companies to consider a movement away from the country due to rising tariffs. Yet many chose to shift to other Asian or South American locations which could quickly handle the tasks needed with existing infrastructure. Although global trade did decrease during the height of the trade war, nearly $19 trillion in goods still moved internationally in 2019.\nBecause of the sheer volume, businesses will likely diversify their overseas relationships, rather than sever them. Already there is evidence of foreign contracts moving from a single source like China to Vietnam, Mexico, India and many more. Such transfers mean that rather than disappear, international business relationships will likely increase in numbers and local businesses could find themselves working with multiple new foreign partners.\nBehavior during past crises\nCOVID-19 isn\u2019t the first unexpected crisis to hit supply chains. The 2011 Japanese tsunami affected multiple factories, including two regional operations which produced nearly the complete global supply of BT, a sealant vital to electronics. The reliance on a single location demonstrated the need for expansion, not isolation. However, reconstructing supply chains and heeding the lessons of past challenges is not easy and change can be costly and time-consuming. During past closures some businesses made a concentrated effort to diversify their international partners, while others did not, taking the risk that the disruption was isolated. Despite the significance of the current pandemic, it is likely that a number of businesses, particularly smaller operations with fewer resources, will not adjust their international patterns.\nThe 2008 financial crisis\nGlobal partnerships were a major factor in the eventual market recovery from the 2008 Financial Crisis. Prices for goods were able to stay low and countries could essentially support each other through mutual growth. Indeed, a reduction in international relations and partnerships would have been detrimental to all businesses and make it significantly more difficult for each single organization to recover and regrow, as it would lead to material shortages and price increases.\nOf course, the COVID-19 is already more damaging than the 2008 crisis in many ways. Still, if the pandemic \u00a0mostly resolves by mid-2020,the IMF projects 5.8% global growth by 2021, assuming economic activity returns to normal patterns. Of course, even short-term forecasts are largely unreliable as the situation is rapidly evolving around the world.\nSummary\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues across the globe, businesses are looking towards their new reality once quarantines are lifted. Because supply chains and other international relationships have caused delays for local businesses, many are calling for a change in process in order to avoid future stoppages. As is the case in many past economic downturns, some are seeking a form of protectionism and a move away from the current state of global importing and exporting. Though understandable, there are numerous benefits to these worldwide endeavors such as the ability for companies to conduct their operations for less money, on a larger scale and with access to both more talent and customers. Though the US-China trade war did cause some businesses out of China, many simply relocated to other regions in order to diversify their operations. In fact, such changes are likely to be more widespread once the pandemic subsides. The past financial crisis has shown that international partnerships are a vital part to reinvigorating the global economy and serve many benefits. As such, once the local closures are lifted, businesses can expect to work with more overseas partners \u2013 not fewer."}, {"Url": "https://impakter.com/post-covid-19-business-new-solutions-g30-proposal", "CluewebURLHash": "5AA4EFE6220B26B15E1DF30FBB6CE69E", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Post COVID-19: A Changed Business Landscape Requires New ...", "Snippet": "\ue000Post\ue001 COVID-19: \ue000A\ue001 Changed \ue000Business Landscape\ue001 Requires New Solutions \u2013 the G30 Proposal. by Claude Forthomme - Senior Editor. 1.03k.

We now know that once this pandemic is done and vaccines permit a return to normalcy \u2013 hopefully by the second part of 2021, we still risk another pandemic in the near future. The Group of Thirty, a.k.a. G30, a major and historic reference for policymakers around the world, has just analyzed the situation and come up with a set of solutions that disappointingly fails to take into account the dramatic changes in the business landscape.\nIn the case of mobile medical trailer manufacturers they have seen an increased in the production on mobile units because doctors have been visiting their patients in their homes.\nThe world of business is not likely to go back to the way it was pre-Covid. Teleworking is \u201cin\u201d like never before and a return to previous methods of work is highly unlikely. According to a recent survey of managers conducted by job recruitment firm Upwork, nearly 42 percent of the U.S. workforce is working from home.\nThe change is striking:\u00a0 Only 12.3 percent of the US workforce teleworked before the pandemic. And lasting: Roughly 27 percent is still expected to work remotely by December 2021. \u201cBusinesses say remote work continues to be going better than anticipated and it\u2019s even improved since the start,\u201d wrote Upwork chief economist Adam Ozimek.\nAlso consider using a virtual office as with one of those you can use a different address and also a really impressive one like a London postal address. See this service as it\u2019s easily the best virtual address available in London so works great and is the best that we have found so far.\nWith thousands of businesses bankrupted and jobs lost \u2013 especially among the small businesses dependent on large downtown offices and metroplexes, like bars and restaurants \u2013\u00a0 a new way to create jobs and boost labor is urgently needed. Moving away from fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy, green and sustainable industries, are the obvious areas of growth. And the solution to new job creation.\nAre big corporations and the major banks behind this move?\nTo find out, it helps to turn to what the Group of Thirty (G30), an independent global body composed of senior economic and financial leaders from the public and private sectors and academia is saying.\nOn 14 December 2020, the G30 released its latest report, Reviving and Restructuring the Corporate Sector Post-Covid: Designing Public Policy Interventions. As Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Chairman of the G30 commented:\n\u201cWe are past the emergency phase of economic policy response to Covid-19, and policymakers will increasingly have to make hard choices so that we do not hamper industry restructuring, and lay the foundation for job creation suited to new realities. This report led by Mario Draghi [former head of the European Central Bank] and Raghuram Rajan [former head of the Reserve Bank of India] aims to inform such choices, so that we come out of Covid-19 fitter and stronger.\u201d\nBefore examining their proposal, it helps to know who the G30 is and why we should listen to them.\nWho is the Group of Thirty?\nThe G30 was not born yesterday. A Rockefeller Foundation initiative launched in 1978, the G30 is headquartered in Washington, with the goal of providing a forum where commercial bankers and central bankers can meet behind closed doors. The G30 also organizes invitation-only events, including \u201coccasional lectures\u201d and seminars.\nChristine Lagarde at G30; Source: G30 website\nMembership is composed of some 30 members, mostly male (there are only five women, as of now), active or former top managers of large international financial institutions and central banks, with almost a third of them representing U.S. institutions.\nYou find a broad range of major figures, from economists Paul Krugman, Lawrence Summers, Kenneth Rogoff and Janet Yellen to central bankers who left their mark, like Mike Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England and now UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance or Raghuram G.Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and Professor of Finance, Chicago Booth School of Business.\nCentral bankers that participate in G30 meetings do not follow the usual transparency and anti-corruption rules that otherwise govern their relationships with commercial bankers. As a result, the Governor of the Federal Reserve Board has never attended because of stringent transparency requirements for its officials \u2013 though the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (with similar powers) is usually a member. Indeed, at the present time, John C. Williams, the current President, is a member.\nSo what is the issue here?\nThe G30 is anything but transparent. No minutes are taken at its meetings, members do not meet the press to report on what was discussed. Yet, over the past forty years, the G30 has regularly issued reports on banking supervision, central banking, and a range of related subjects. Recommendations have been invariably favorable to the business interests of the large international banks which dominate the G30 and unfailingly called for neo-liberal, \u201clight-touch regulation\u201d.\nUnsurprisingly, in 2017, the G30 ran into trouble with the EU Ombudsman because Mario Draghi, then President of the European Central Bank, was a member. This happened even though Draghi by then had made a name for himself as the savior of the Euro, and will probably go down in History for his statement in 2012 that the ECB would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the Euro:\nThe investigation of the Ombudswoman, Emily O\u2019Reilly, responded to a complaint lodged by Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), a lobbying watchdog. The investigation not only concerned Draghi\u2019s membership but also \u201cthe involvement of senior ECB people in the work of the G30\u201d.The problem was this: As the G30 issues public reports on ECB-related subjects, the concern was that the wider European public would get the impression that the ECB-President subscribed to the G30 views and recommendations.\nBy 2018, the scandal had been resolved with the decision that no future ECB President could be part of the G30.\nO\u2019Reilly: Interactions with the G30 should be as transparent as possible and not based on membership which undermines the transparency steps @ECB has made in recent years https://t.co/h4FASjNbTp pic.twitter.com/eks42KZDcd\n\u2014 European Ombudsman (@EUombudsman) January 17, 2018\nAnd indeed, the current ECB President, Christine Lagarde is not a member.\nThe G30 Proposal\nSo, according to the G30, what should governments do to recover from the pandemic depression and ensure it never happens again?\nIn the foreword to the G30 proposal, it is acknowledged that \u201cpolicymakers around the world acted rapidly and boldly in their initial policy responses to the pandemic\u201d. But \u201cin the face of these structural changes and a growing corporate solvency crisis, governments now need to alter their responses.\u201d The aim of the report is to provide \u201ca guide to policymakers as they consider how best to intervene to support the corporate sector, addressing three pivotal questions: Which companies to assist, and why? Who decides which companies to assist? And how to assist them?\u201d\nThe report identifies the following problems that make the initial response (focused on providing funds to solve the liquidity crisis) unsustainable:\nInadequate targeting of support, which fails to sufficiently tailor the policy response to the situations of different firms\nAn excessive focus on credit provision, which risks overburdening firms with debt, promoting inefficient use of resources, and engendering future problems\nExcessive direct government decision-making and suboptimal use of private sector expertise that could be used to better direct support\nA level of public spending that would be unsustainable over the potential duration of the ongoing economic crisis.\nThe solutions have to be long-term. The G30 proposal is meant to \u201cencourage the development of policy actions that support long-term economic resilience and growth, and broad-based improvements in living standards, while minimizing the costs to the public.\u201d And it is acknowledged that \u201cwithout assistance from advanced economies, and sovereign debt relief, some developing countries would struggle to create the fiscal resource envelope to allow them to respond to the crisis.\nTen core principles shape their recommendations. As you will see, they are a reflection of the G30 neo-liberal worldview and unshakable belief in private sector efficiency, regardless of the costs to the environment or social justice. Here they are:\nAct urgently to tackle the growing corporate solvency crisis: No time should be lost, we are on a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d; one can certainly agree with that;\nCarefully target public support to \u201coptimize the use of resources and help economies emerge fitter and stronger\u201d; again, one can only agree with the proposition that \u201cresources should not be wasted on companies that are ultimately doomed to failure or which do not need public support\u201d nor should firms that are already doing well \u201creceive unjustified windfalls\u201d;\nAdapt to the new business realities, \u201crather than trying to preserve the status quo\u201d; fine and good and there is even talk of allowing for \u201ccreative destruction\u201d as some firms \u201cshrink or close and new ones open, and as some workers need to move between companies and sectors, with appropriate retraining and transitional assistance\u201d;\nMarket forces should generally be allowed to operate, but \u201cgovernments should intervene to address market failures that create substantial social costs\u201d, particularly the \u201clongstanding difficulty in funding SMEs effectively\u201d; this is standard neoliberal fare that allows for government intervention when there is a clear \u201cmarket failure\u201d;\nPrivate sector expertise should be tapped to \u201coptimize resource allocation, where possible\u201d; why only the private sector? Because, according to the report,\u00a0 \u201cGovernments are usually less able to pick winners and losers\u201d; this overlooks the key role of the public sector in funding research \u2013 for example, DARPA Federal funding in the 1950s and 1960s that boosted the development of the American tech industry and Silicon Valley;\nCarefully balance the combination of broader national objectives with business support measures: This means that \u201cstrategic changes, such as the greening of the economy or digitalization\u201d should not be done \u201cagainst the need to avoid imposing excessive constraints on struggling businesses or too narrow an allocation of support into too few business sectors or specific firms\u201d \u2013 in short, don\u2019t pursue \u201cgreening\u201d or \u201cdigitalization\u201d if it\u2019s going to cause \u201ccreative destruction\u201d: this is in direct contradiction with principle no. 3 above; and besides, how do you ever find the \u201cright\u201d balance?\nMinimize risk and maximize upside potential for taxpayers, while \u201censuring stakeholders\u2019 share in losses and do not receive unjustified windfalls\u201d, governments should adopt \u201cstaged deployment of funding\u201d, and find a \u201cdirect upside, such as through a share of future profits\u201d: This is tantamount to telling politicians to do nothing; no surprise perhaps, as in the neoliberal worldview, governments cannot be allowed any role in setting economic objectives or engaging in any economic planning such as the Green New Deal;\nBe mindful of moral hazard issues without undermining the core objectives \u2013 this refers to the \u201cdanger of \u201cbailing out\u201d owners and managers who took too much risk, which could also create moral hazard problems, through the expectation of future rescues\u201d; the irony in this advice coming from big bankers whose banks were bailed out in the Great Recession of 2008 \u2013 creating in the economy a whole new beast, the Too Big To Fail corporation, is particularly juicy;\nGet the timing right in the staging and longevity of interventions: Since the report acknowledges we are dealing with \u201cunknowns\u201d, policymakers are advised to \u201cmove quickly but design their programs to reflect this uncertainty\u201d; good luck with that;\nAnticipate potential spillovers to the financial sector to preserve its strength and \u201cenable it to help drive the recovery\u201d \u2013 in other words, don\u2019t forget to support the banks! And to drive the point further home, \u201cpolicy choices should avoid actions that would significantly weaken the financial sector, such as forcing banks to make bad loans as a way of supporting the economy.\u201d Yes, help the banks but don\u2019t ask them to help the economy.\nEven if one can agree with these (very classical) recommendations (and I don\u2019t), most of them are not actionable: How does one get the \u201ctiming right\u201d or achieve a \u201cbalance\u201d? Overall, the objective appears to be to discourage governments from intervening in the economy.\nBut the most astonishing part of the report is what is not said in it.\nNot a word about sustainability, nothing about environmental and social justice issues \u2013 even though this pandemic is hitting the poor and ethnic minorities harder than anyone else. Even though that is precisely what is going to change in our world and if we don\u2019t do something about it, the next pandemic will be even worse.\nActually, the report acknowledges that \u201cpolicies designed to support broader national objectives such as digitalization, environmental sustainability, or the promotion of new or strategic industries\u201d are outside its scope. \u201cWe note\u201d write the report authors, \u201cthat some of these measures could be incorporated into the targeting or design of responses to the corporate solvency crisis, but do not discuss these in detail.\u201d\nSo these policies that will be the very key to a strong COVID-19 recovery, launching us into a new world, better able to withstand the next pandemic are not to be discussed?\nOne may well ask what is the point of this report.\nBut what is most worrisome is the stature and reputation of the people who are part of the G30 and stand behind this report. If our policymakers listen to them (and many are likely to), the world will continue, unchanged as before the pandemic, on its path of self-destruction. Perhaps we should ask the UN Secretary-General what Mike Carney, his UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, is doing in the G30?\nUpdate 23 December 2020: Financial journalists seem to have picked up on one aspect of the G30 proposal: The notion that \u201czombie\u201d companies cannot expect COVID-19 recovery assistance. Because zombie businesses feed on debt, subsidies, and money at no cost. For example, the Italian newspaper SOLE 24 Ore writes today about it, noting that the G30 conducted a survey in 11 countries, finding that \u201c a stronger presence of \u201czombie firms\u201d creates excess production capacity and, consequently, produces lower averages of markup, product prices, investments and productivity.\u201d\nThis is certainly a good point \u2013 but not enough. Recovery from COVID-19 requires much more, a longer-term vision that addresses the real challenges arising from the pandemic. Reliance on classic neoliberal solutions that (sort of) worked in the past won\u2019t work for a world battered by COVID-19 and climate change.\nEditor\u2019s Note: The opinions expressed here by Impakter.com contributors are their own, not those of Impakter.com.

Like all essential businesses, Dell Technologies is working through this challenge to implement the most effective approach for protecting as many stakeholders as possible. And, it\u2019s critical that we partner with customers to put their business continuity, remote working and digital services into practice.\nAs we began creating our company's return to site strategy, it became clear that the workplace impact would not be a temporary one, and organizations that seize this opportunity to change how they work will outpace their peers. This concept compelled us to create a formal Customer Playbook that serves as reassurance that our plan \u2013 and business \u2013 are strong, as well as providing guidance on how to leverage these strategies to strengthen their own businesses.\nHave you read?\nHow to navigate the transition to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic\nHere are the 5 ways your working life will change after the pandemic\nThe great sustainable reset: The new world of work after the pandemic\nEmerging opportunities\nAs governments at local and federal levels start to lift restrictions and ask employees to \u201creturn to work,\u201d we must remember: we are already at work. Our team members who are required to be in a facility or in the field are steadfast in their support of our customers. Meanwhile, the remaining 90% of our workforce continues to be productive working remotely.\nWe know coming out of this crisis that many of our team members won\u2019t need to return to corporate sites, at least not on a full-time basis. While every industry and every business is different, it\u2019s critical that organizations reinvent and redefine \u201cwork\u201d in the new world. We must change how we think about spaces, cybersecurity, meetings, travel, events and policies, and we mustn\u2019t forget the ways employees find balance through their family, volunteer work, hobbies and more. We need to evolve the dated mindset that being in an office full-time is an actual business imperative.\nAs we rethink where business is done, it creates the opportunity for organizations of all sizes to advance and achieve their goals and experience a more flexible culture, reduce their carbon footprint, enhance diverse talent recruitment and make new investments in innovation.\nHow does this paradigm shift enable us to do all of this?\nBusinesses should start with an honest accounting of how a reduced on-site workforce with more flexible workplace conditions can help the business execute on its strategy. We\u2019ve aligned our business objectives with our evolving workforce in the following ways:\nUse our values to develop new ways of working, with high levels of engagement and productivity.\nCreate a stronger customer and team member experience by investing time and money on the things that matter most.\nStart from the top, with a leadership team and ethos culturally committed to increasing our work-from-home footprint and team member flexibility and choice.\nBe a leader in workplace flexibility with a goal of 50% (or greater in countries with the right infrastructure) of our team members in flexible work arrangements.\nAdvance progress against our 2030 Moonshot goals by reducing our carbon footprint and opening new opportunities to bring in diverse talent.\nAlthough this is specific to our own approach and goals established before the pandemic arrived, we\u2019re confident it\u2019s a strong framework for customers to consider as they adapt their own goals, along with the right technology to accelerate innovation and growth.\nOf course, to achieve these goals, we must prioritize the safety and wellbeing of our team members at every step. This includes planning our return to site in a way that prioritizes flexibility and will require fine-tuning as we learn through the process. The way we\u2019re approaching our strategy is focused on health first, through graduated return to site for different functions based on need and flexible schedules.\nThis strategy takes a conservative approach and relies strongly on data and science to determine safety and readiness, align to local government regulations and follow health and hygiene guidance. It also ensures we support our customers and partners, focus on teams who need to be on-site for enhanced productivity, and enables employees to return to the office while taking into consideration the future state of work.\nOnce the conditions are right, organizations should focus on four key pillars to ensure a smooth transition of team members back onsite while cementing the conditions for greater innovation and flexibility:\nReturn to site risk assessment \u2013 Evaluate the infection rates, active cases, recovery and scaled increase trends of the country/specific location to determine how safe it is for team members to return to site.\nPre-opening readiness \u2013 Assess and prepare for team members to return to site while ensuring hygiene, social distancing, and infrastructure all support team member health and productivity.\nPhased return to site \u2013 Start with those team members who are physically required to be onsite, and gradually move to those functions and people who prefer to come to their place of work; as well as accommodating those who don\u2019t feel comfortable to return.\nCommunication \u2013 Develop transparent and frequent communications, with a feedback loop, to team members and communities.\nWe\u2019re rarely afforded the opportunity to make such dramatic changes to our businesses in such a short period of time \u2013 even rarer still is the ability to do so in a way that will better prepare our teams for the changing digital landscape while helping us achieve organizational goals around sustainability, diversity and innovation. Although it\u2019s not a change that anyone asked for, it\u2019s the change that will help us create more flexible, sustainable businesses that put people first.\nLicense and Republishing\nWritten by\nMark Pringle, Senior Vice President of Corporate Real Estate, Global Facilities and Environment, Health and Safety, Dell Technologies\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum."}, {"Url": "https://weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/3-actions-business-prepare-post-pandemic-future", "CluewebURLHash": "52DB4FD347EF9B547C8EFE5845EE33CD", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "3 \ue000actions for business to prepare for\ue001 a \ue000post\ue001-pandemic ...", "Snippet": "3 actions for \ue000business\ue001 to prepare for a \ue000post\ue001-pandemic future.

In the midst of significant uncertainty, there are four things we can do: 1)\u00a0boost confidence in trade and global markets by improving transparency about trade-related policy actions and intentions; 2)\u00a0keep supply chains flowing, especially for essentials such as health supplies and food; 3)\u00a0avoid making things worse, through unnecessary export restrictions and other trade barriers; and 4)\u00a0even in the midst of the crisis, think beyond the immediate. Government support today needs to be delivered in a way that ensures it serves the public interest, not vested interests, and avoids becoming tomorrow\u2019s market distortions. OECD is working with other IOs to support governments through timely and objective evidence and analysis to inform policy choices.\nThis document is an update of the 10 April 2020 version available on the OECD dedicated COVID-19 digital hub: http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/.\ncopy the link link copied! In a challenging and uncertain situation, trade is essential to save lives \u2013 and livelihoods\nCOVID-19 is a humanitarian crisis on a global scale. The virus continues to spread throughout the globe, placing health systems under unprecedented stress in the battle to save lives. The human scale of this tragedy is set to worsen as the virus spreads to lower income countries with weaker healthcare systems.\nIn the March 2020 OECD Interim Economic Outlook, the downside scenario saw global growth halved to 1.5%. That was optimistic. The most recent estimates in the June 10 OECD Economic Outlook suggest an unprecedented collapse in the first half of 2020 \u2013 an almost 13% decline in global GDP (Figure 1). Moreover, the costs to the global economy from support packages, through central banks and fiscal actions, are very significant and likely to have long-lasting and complex effects on management of sovereign and corporate debt. Yet notwithstanding these efforts, most major economies now look set to enter recession, and more serious scenarios cannot be discounted.\nA further challenge is the uncertainty about COVID-19, including in terms of the scale and pace of infection; how long and widespread shutdown measures will prove necessary; the prospects for treatments to better manage symptoms, allowing health services to focus only on the most serious cases; and the risk of \u201csecond wave\u201d infections as the virus moves around the globe. The virus is proceeding in waves, with countries succumbing \u2013 and set to recover \u2013 at different times. What is clear is that the virus and its aftermath looks likely to be with us for some time.\nAgainst this background, there is a clear need to keep trade flowing, both to ensure the supply of essential products and to send a signal of confidence for the global economy. Trade is essential to save both lives and livelihoods.\nBut keeping trade flowing requires co-operation and trust \u2013 for example, that the market will supply essentials, that countries will not impose export restrictions, and that imports do not pose health risks. This is a particular challenge at a time of trade tensions, where the international trading system was already subject to an increased number of new restrictions and distortions, from tariff increases among major traders, to significant government support in key sectors. Efforts at dialogue to manage and prevent tensions through ongoing negotiations are now complicated by mobility restrictions. But in the context of the severe economic strain from COVID-19, it is more important than ever to avoid escalation of the current trade tensions.\ncopy the link link copied!\nFigure 1.

Despite considerable uncertainty, there are four actions that can be taken now\ncopy the link link copied! First, boost confidence in trade and global markets by improving transparency\nA strong, shared, transparent information base is critical in underpinning sound national policy responses and the international co-operation to keep trade flowing. It will be critical that countries honour their commitments to notify trade-related measures taken in response to COVID-19 to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The OECD is sharing information on trade-related country actions on COVID-19 with WTO colleagues, and assessing the likely impact of these actions to help support policy makers dealing with the crisis.\nBuilding on our annual Monitoring and Evaluation of Agricultural Policies we are tracking and assessing the impact of country measures in relation to agrifood production and trade in response to COVID-19. We are bringing this information to AMIS (Agricultural Market Information System), where we work with other international organisations and governments to ensure accurate, up-to-date information on market developments and country policies in critical commodities for the global food system. 1\ncopy the link link copied! Second, keep global supply chains going, especially for essentials\nAn important priority is keeping the key supply chains for essential goods for the crisis \u2013 including medical supplies, food products and ICT goods and services \u2013 open and functioning. However, we are starting to see a number of challenges to keeping these supply chains going related to the business of trade. For example\nCancellation of passenger flights linked to travel bans has limited the availability of air cargo (Figure\u00a02) while urgent shipping of essential goods has increased demand, resulting in increases in the price of air cargo (compared to October 2019 air freight costs are up by about 30% between the People\u2019s Republic of China (hereafter \u201cChina\u201d) and North America and by over 60% on some important Europe-North America routes) (Curran, 2020 [1]) Delivery times have also increased. This matters for some time-sensitive medical supplies, but also for some high value food trade.\nImportant shipping ports reported year-on-year drops in cargo between 10% and 20% in February (Baschuk, 2020 [2] ). Over 50\u00a0countries have changed port protocols, ranging from port closure and quarantine measures to additional documentation requirements and examination. That said, some countries have also set up \u201cgreen lanes\u201d at ports of entry and border crossings, to accelerate the processing of cargo shipments.\nAt the time the virus struck, large numbers of shipping containers were in Chinese ports, and restrictions on their movement have led to a shortage that has seen the price of containers rise (in some cases considerably), with flow-on effects for the price of cargo, including food products.\nLockdowns are also impacting the availability of labour to unload ships at ports (notably in countries where this is less automated) or raised costs due to increased protective measures for workers.\nMore generally, all supply chains are being affected by the need to ensure additional health and safety measures for all participants in the supply chain (which affect costs and time).\nLimits on mobility of people and lockdowns are affecting a variety of trade processes, from physical inspections of goods for SPS, to testing and certification for TBT, to changing how anti-dumping investigations are conducted.\nAll of these are adding to the time and costs of international trade on products that matter. They will require co-ordinated action amongst governments \u2013 and with the private sector \u2013 to find solutions to the logistical constraints affecting the ability to get essential products where they are needed most.\nAn immediate issue is facilitating medical supplies necessary to tackle COVID-19, many of which are produced across a number of countries and for which trade is the means of ensuring global supply. For example, at the onset of the crisis, China was the main manufacturer of surgical masks, accounting for about one-half of world capacity. Yet in January, this was not enough to meet demand; China stopped exporting masks and imported 56\u00a0million masks in the first week of January; masks were also donated to China by some countries. In the midst of the crisis, Chinese demand was estimated at 240\u00a0million masks per day (more than ten times its manufacturing capacity). China increased production from around 20\u00a0million masks per day to around 116\u00a0million per day at the end of February and is now exporting masks to other countries. 2\ncopy the link link copied!\nFigure 2. Sea and air cargo are dropping sharply\nSource: OECD, drawing on data from Innovative Solutions in Maritime Logistics (www.isl.org/en/containerindex) and International Air Transport Association (www.iata.org ).\nKeeping the trade in essential medical supplies flowing means removing barriers such as tariffs on medical goods essential for combatting COVID-19 (e.g.\u00a0several countries maintain tariffs of up to 10% on COVID test kits) (Evenett, 2020 [3]) as a number of countries have already done. It means expediting certification procedures to allow new products to be traded as soon as possible and ensuring that technical requirements are science-based and do not unnecessarily restrict trade. Finally, it means enhanced trade facilitation to keep goods moving as quickly as possible \u2013 including identifying key actions needed to ensure smooth customs procedures with limited human intervention (see below).\nThere are particular issues with keeping food supply chains flowing. In addition to the impacts of reduced air and sea cargo possibilities, are additional challenges related to the risk of food loss and waste through delays to handling difficulties, and the sudden collapse in demand from restaurants and hotels. There is also a need to ensure that food supply flows to quarantined areas, and that appropriate biosecurity arrangements are in place, requiring changes to how food is produced, consumed and distributed \u2013 while also ensuring that COVID-19 related sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements remain science based and not unnecessarily restrictive. While at present global food markets remain well-balanced and cereal stocks are high (AMIS, 2020 [4] ), it will be important to continue to closely monitor developments, given accumulating risks such as the lack of seasonal labour for planting and harvesting crops.\nIn the short term, there are some practical things we can do to keep trade flowing and to increase how trade can support the fight against COVID-19, including:\nSpeeding up border checks for medical products and food and minimising the need for physical interaction between Customs and other border officials and traders at borders, by digitising processes to the extent possible. Also important will be efforts to expedite standard formalities to leave room for any necessary additional COVID-19 controls. Efforts to boost international co-operation on risk management will also be important in tackling the virus and facilitating movement of goods, as will continued assistance for lower income countries.\nMaking it cheaper and easier for people to stay connected to jobs, markets \u2013 and each other \u2013 by: reducing tariffs on information and communication technology goods and measures affecting access to digitally enabled services; temporarily increasing de\u00a0minimis thresholds to cut delays in cross-border e-commerce; and keeping trade moving without physical contact through enacting regulations to enable e-payments, e-signatures and e-contracts.\nHelping medical researchers co-operate on COVID-19 through enabling data flows. Access to detailed health information is critical to finding a cure for COVID-19. Yet health data are often subject to strict localisation requirements and cross-border data flow restrictions. Governments could enable processing and cross-border transfer of sensitive data to monitor epidemics, and promote the use of restricted access and secure sandboxes to pool health data on COVID-19.\ncopy the link link copied! Third, avoid making things worse\nThere are many unavoidable costs in the current pandemic; all the more reason to avoid actions that add to costs for traders and consumers. Chief among these is the need to avoid export restrictions on essential goods, such as medical equipment and, especially, food products. Currently, more than 60\u00a0countries 3 have restricted exports of essential goods and increasingly agriculture and food products.\nThe lesson of the food price crisis of 2007-08 is that export restrictions are a recipe for self-inflicted harm, undermining food security for everyone. Experience has shown that export restrictions temporarily lower domestic prices and raise availability, but they also discourage domestic production and so any benefit tends to be short-lived. Critically, by diverting supplies from world markets, they put upward pressure on international prices, which harms other countries \u2013 in particular those most dependent on international markets for food. Export restrictions risk undermining confidence in international markets and can precipitate hoarding and panic buying, further accentuating problems in import-dependent countries. Ultimately, nobody benefits.\nThere is currently no supply problem in global agriculture and food markets; indeed, at present, stocks are strong and prices look set to stay low. However, if governments engage in export restrictions or if individuals, firms or countries engage in panic buying or hoarding there is a risk of creating an avoidable problem now.\nWhile there is not an immediate threat to global supplies of basic foodstuffs, there is the potential for specific food supply chains to be severely disrupted, including from lack of seasonal workers for planting or harvesting key crops, logistics constraints, and additional SPS and technical measures. Vigilance will be required to ensure that crisis- or policy-induced risk factors do not cause disruptions in supply, in particular if the containment measures related to COVID-19 are long-lived.\nThe global market situation for medical supplies is very different; there is a critical need to increase the overall global supply of essential medical supplies for combatting COVID-19 such as ventilators and masks. Governments need to invest urgently in boosting production capacity, including in co-operation with the private sector, for local, regional and global markets.\nSome governments are taking measures designed to ensure supply for their own population that have the effect of limiting supply for others. Export restrictions often take the form of special licensing requirements or outright bans on the export of certain products. Other measures include guaranteed purchase or requisitioning of goods. These are difficult issues. While governments rightly are concerned to protect their own populations, the effect on other countries \u2013 and thus on global efforts to contain the virus and prevent damaging second- or third-wave recurrences \u2013 can be severe.\nSome countries are not able to produce their own medical supplies in sufficient quantities \u2013 or cost effectively. This is especially the case as the virus starts to take hold in lower income countries, where the priority for limited health budgets should not be building domestic manufacturing capacity. For these countries \u2013 as has been the case for others that have experienced the virus to date \u2013 trade is essential.\nIndeed, areas already isolated due to the virus would have been worse off if they had to rely on the local economy to guarantee supplies of medical equipment, food and other necessities and even those countries with production capacity in medical equipment have struggled to meet demand. In the height of COVID-19 outbreaks, even countries with significant manufacturing capacity may not be able to fully utilise it due to labour shortages, or mobility restrictions. Moreover, even domestic manufacture of equipment can rely on imported inputs; the danger of beggar-thy-neighbour policies is that you are also your neighbour\u2019s neighbour.\nBut if countries are to avoid these policies, they need to be sure that global markets will indeed supply the needed goods. Transparency and global dialogue and co-operation are essential in building the confidence in global supply. If export restrictions on medical supplies cannot be avoided entirely in the current political context, agreements to place strict conditions on their temporary use are vital.\nMore broadly, to maintain confidence in global markets and co-operation, there is a need to avoid further escalation in ongoing trade tensions. With firms rocked by the collapse in demand and the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and associated containment measures, now is also not the time to impose further costs, including through unnecessary policy uncertainty. Imposing additional costs on firms and consumers through tariffs not only causes hardship for those already suffering from lost income due to the crisis, but also risks increasing the size of the government assistance needed to support those same firms and consumers. A positive step in boosting confidence and reducing burdens would be for governments to commit not to impose new tariffs or trade restrictive measures.\nWhile trade was one of the first victims of the global economic crisis in 2008, new trade restricting measures affected only about 1% of world imports. At that time, G20 leaders committed to refrain from protectionist measures and to uphold the rules-based trading system, and WTO trade rules created some certainty for businesses and stabilised the system by placing a ceiling on tariff measures. While there are some differences, as well as similarities, in the current crisis (see Box), the uncertain economic environment going into today\u2019s crisis increases the need for a commitment to rules-based trade.\ncopy the link link copied!\nLessons from the Global Economic Crisis?\nAs policy makers confront the significant challenge of COVID-19, many are asking whether there are lessons from the experience of the global economic crisis, and to what extent the crises may be similar. Some examples of the similarities and differences are below.\nDifferences\nNot just about confidence effects, economic activity is being shut down.\nWidespread across many sectors, simultaneously and sometimes instantaneously\nRequires large government investments \u2013 especially in the health sector, but also in social protection given widespread job losses\nMobility restrictions limit some of the automatic stabilisers/offsetting actions (informal work, share economy) and impose additional costs\nParticular issues with medical equipment and biosecurity for food.\nMore services-driven, given the limitations on physical contact and widespread closure of key service sectors (tourism, travel and entertainment).\nThis crisis is having a disproportionate impact on MSMEs.\nGreater disruption to production leading to pressure on supply chains.\nSimilarities\nThis crisis is coming in waves, as knock-on effects from problems in one sector or country rebound and create new problems in other sectors (e.g. between the financial sector and the real economy) or countries. Second- and third-order effects of policy actions can be unpredictable but important.\nThis will also be an employment crisis, with significant implications for supporting workers in mass unemployment\nThe crisis is having staggered effects globally, with Africa likely again to be last to experience (but also least equipped).\nGovernments are facing the challenge of having to act rapidly and at a large scale across a wide range of policy areas.\nGovernments have to think immediate term, and longer term at the same time.\ncopy the link link copied! Fourth, look beyond the immediate: Policy actions now could have a long life\nWhile countries are necessarily focused on ensuring the health and economic security of their people today, the OECD can play a particularly important role in looking ahead and, in light of past and current experiences, contribute to helping governments ensure a recovery that is robust, widespread, and sustainable. Some key issues, and areas of OECD work, are highlighted below.\ncopy the link link copied! How government support is designed matters\nGovernments are \u2013 necessarily and rightly \u2013 providing huge amounts of support to prevent the COVID-19 crisis from destroying livelihoods, businesses and production capacity. But once the waters ebb, governments will need to take a careful look at the measures in place to ensure that they have not become sources of unfair competition and distortions in the global economy. While this is tomorrow\u2019s problem, the way such support is designed now will affect the shape of the global economy to come, and whether that economy benefits \u2013 and is seen to benefit \u2013 everyone.\nSupport granted today will have an important impact on the global level playing field. OECD work on a range of sectors, most recently on industrial sectors such as aluminium and semiconductors, shows that high levels of government support are having important effects on production levels and global competition. This work has highlighted new trends towards non-transparent and significant government support provided through the financial system in the form of below-market loans and government equity. Given that these tools will be important and widely used in the crisis \u2013 equity positions in particular can be an effective way for governments to support ailing firms in the short term \u2013 how governments approach this support, and its unwinding (or not) will be critical to the future shape of competition in the global economy. There will be a need to consider carefully which sectors the state needs to be involved in for longer, and where it should exit as soon as possible. The current crisis may well result in a longer-lasting change in the role of the state in the economy \u2013 which will also have implications for the development of any new trade rules to address government support. Given that experience across a range of sectors, from agriculture to fossil fuels, suggests that any form of support, once given, can be hard to remove, there is significant potential for a wide range of support to persist and exacerbate concerns about unfair competition in the global economy.\nHow support is provided will also have important implications for the distribution of the gains from interconnected markets at the national level. A significant concern from the last crisis was that bailouts benefitted large corporations more than ordinary people. This exacerbated existing trends towards greater inequality of wealth, income and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 of opportunity within countries around the world (OECD, 2017 [5]). It will be critical to ensure that support given now is \u2013 and is seen to be \u2013 targeted at the public interest, rather than vested interests, and at public welfare, rather than corporate welfare.\nThese elements are mutually reinforcing. The scale of public investments needed during and after the crisis \u2013 from health systems and social protection, to access to education and digital networks \u2013 underscores the need for support to firms and sectors to be as efficient as possible to maximise available public resources. Well-designed support will also be less market-distorting and give rise to fewer concerns about the impact on international competition. Fairness \u2013 in both the national-level distribution of benefits and in global competition \u2013 is essential for maintaining public support for trade and the open markets needed to get through and emerge from the crisis.\nEven now, as governments are in crisis mode, there is a need to pay attention to the design of essential support. There is a wealth of experience on minimising the competitive distortions from support on which to draw, including in relation to government-invested firms. Some key principles include that support granted is:\ntransparent \u2013 including with regard to the terms of any support through the financial system;\nnon-discriminatory amongst similarly affected firms and targeted at those experiencing the most disruption, while avoiding rescue for those who would have failed absent the pandemic;\ntime bound, and reviewed regularly to ensure that it is hitting its target and remains necessary; and\ntargeted at consumers, leaving them for to decide how to spend any support, rather than tied to consumption of specific input and final goods and services.\nOngoing OECD work on the government support and market-distortions will include a focus on providing insights to help inform governments\u2019 choices on the design of support in the crisis.\ncopy the link link copied! Firms and governments will need to re-think resilience in global supply chains\nThere is a live debate over the impacts of COVID-19 on the structure of global production and global supply chains. For some, COVID-19 argues for supply chains to be re-nationalised, or at least shortened, to reduce risks from global exposure. From this perspective, firms may need to re-think sourcing decisions, resulting in re-ordering of global production, with potentially far-reaching implications especially for developing countries. Equally, it is argued that governments will need to reconsider the list of strategic goods for which there is a requirement for domestic production, or impose new sourcing constraints on businesses. Government procurement practices may also be revisited.\nYet there is a danger of making quick assumptions about what is necessary to ensure resilience. Internationally, diversified production is often a source of resilience and adjustment for firms in an adverse environment, while experience in the agrifood sector has shown that self-sufficiency of supply is not the same as security of supply. There will also be a need for both firms and governments to think again about how best to ensure the resilience of supply chains. This will require a better understanding of the strengths and vulnerabilities of key supply chains in the current crisis and looking again at resilience toolkits in light of this. For firm strategies, this can mean re-examining, for example, the structure of businesses globally including in relation to redundancy capacity and inventory stocks. For governments there will be a need to consider the trade and investment policy environment that can best support resilience; for example, the availability of digital infrastructure to reduce productivity hits in pandemics or improvements to trade facilitation practices to minimise scope for disruptions related to face-to-face processes. Governments may also need to consider special arrangements for specific supply chains for strategic goods such as medical equipment; however, this should not necessarily be equated with re-shoring of production. For face masks, for example, it would be very costly for each country to develop a production capacity matching the current crisis demand and encompassing the whole value chain; an alternative, effective and more cost-efficient solution may involve development of strategic stocks or upstream agreements with companies enabling rapid conversion of assembly lines during crises.\nThe OECD will be supporting governments in their consideration of these issues through investigation of the consequence of COVID-19 on sourcing decisions of firms and the resilience and vulnerabilities of particular global supply chains, including by drawing on the insights gained from the OECD Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) database.\ncopy the link link copied! Doing more on trade and health to be ready for the next time\nThe current crisis offers an opportunity to develop readiness for future pandemics. In addition to national measures to ensure supply, there may be scope for an international agreement to provide greater predictability and certainty on availability of key supplies in international markets and build confidence that trade will keep flowing to support the management of future pandemics.\nA possible agreement among countries could include elements such as:\nEnsuring transparency: AMIS, created in the wake of the food price crisis of 2007-8 for governments to share information on markets, policies and stocks for key commodities has underscored the value of timely information and transparency in preventing crises induced by panic buying, hoarding or export restrictions. Ensuring transparency in relation to trade-related measures related to medical supplies, such as through sharing information with the WTO, can play an important role in maintaining confidence in global supply.\nCutting tariffs on essential medical products \u2013 countries could explore a WTO, including plurilateral, initiative to remove tariffs on a to-be-agreed list of essential medical supplies (similar to the agreement reached on Information Technology products).\nDisciplines on export restrictions \u2013 this could range from agreement to prohibit export bans for certain kinds of goods, or to codify strict conditions on their use, building on the current G20 agreement that states that: \u201cemergency measures designed to tackle COVID-19, if deemed necessary, must be targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary, and that they do not create unnecessary barriers to trade or disruption to global supply chains, and are consistent with WTO rules\u201d 4.\nUpfront investments in co-operative solutions \u2013 the creation of stockpiles of essential medical supplies could include co-operative arrangements for creation of such stockpiles, including on a regional basis.\nAddressing the needs of the most vulnerable countries \u2013 measures, for example in relation to export restrictions and creation of regional stockpiles, could include specific exemptions or assistance to address the needs of the poorest countries.\nAnalysis by the OECD and other international organisations on trade-related issues and impacts in the context of the current pandemic could help inform possible discussions among governments on a trade and health initiative.\ncopy the link link copied! Decisions on trade matter now, but also for ensuring that trade can help support recovery\nWith COVID-19 hitting countries at different times and rates, access to global demand via open markets and continued trade will be important for supporting and sustaining economic recovery.\nThere is thus a need to consider how to keep trade flowing in the current crisis and to ensure it can help underpin global recovery. This means both actions and decisions today and with an eye to the future.\nOECD analysis will help inform governments as they consider the priorities for action, both nationally and \u2013 critically \u2013 as they act together to build a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient global economy.\ncopy the link link copied!\nForthcoming Policy Briefs\nThis is the first in a series of Policy Briefs on trade issues related to COVID-19.

It captured the biblical\n    sense of shock that many of us felt in the face of such a sudden, extreme,\n    and swiftly accelerating crisis. We \u201chave been coasting along for more than\n    half a century,\u201d he remarked, and all at once \u201cwe are facing the fragility\n    and vulnerability of the human situation.\u201d\nNow, a few months on, Rabbi Sacks\u2019 comparison with revelation still seems\n    fitting, but for a different reason, and one that matters for thinking\n    about a world after COVID-19.\nThis crisis is alarming, in part, because it has several new and unfamiliar\n    features. A global medical emergency caused by a virus we still do not\n    fully understand. A self-inflicted economic catastrophe as a necessary\n    policy response to contain its spread.\nAnd yet as time has passed, it has also become clear that much of what is\n    most distressing about this crisis is not new at all. Striking variations\n    in COVID-19 infections and outcomes appear to reflect existing economic\n    inequalities. Remarkable mismatches between the social value of what \u201ckey\n    workers\u201d do and the low wages they receive follow from the familiar failure\n    of the market to value adequately what really matters.\nThe happy embrace of disinformation and misinformation about the virus was\n    to be expected, given a decade of rising populism and declining faith in\n    experts. And the absence of a properly coordinated international response\n    ought to have come as no surprise, given the celebration of \u201cmy country\n    first\u201d global politics in recent years.\nThe crisis then is a revelation in a far more literal sense\u2014it is focusing\n    our collective attention on the many injustices and weaknesses that already\n    exist in how we live together. If people were blind to these faults before,\n    it is hard not to see them now.\nWhat will the world look like after COVID-19? Many of the problems we will\n    face in the next decade will simply be more extreme versions of those that\n    we already confront today. The world will only look significantly different\n    this time if, as we emerge from this crisis, we decide to take action to\n    resolve these problems and bring about fundamental change.\nDANIEL SUSSKIND is a fellow in economics at Balliol College, Oxford University, and author\n    of A World Without Work (Allen Lane, 2020).\nJames Manyika\nThe world after COVID-19 is unlikely to return to the world that was. Many\n    trends already underway in the global economy are being accelerated by the\n    impact of the pandemic.\nThis is especially true of the digital economy, with the rise of digital\n    behavior such as remote working and learning, telemedicine, and delivery\n    services. Other structural changes may also accelerate, including\n    regionalization of supply chains and a further explosion of cross-border\n    data flows.\nThe future of work has arrived faster, along with its challenges\u2014many of\n    them potentially multiplied\u2014such as income polarization, worker\n    vulnerability, more gig work, and the need for workers to adapt to\n    occupational transitions. This acceleration is the result not only of\n    technological advances but also of new considerations for health and\n    safety, and economies and labor markets will take time to recover and will\n    likely emerge changed.\nWith the amplification of these trends, the realities of this crisis have\n    triggered reconsideration of several beliefs, with possible effects on\n    long-term choices for the economy and society. These effects range from\n    attitudes about efficiency versus resilience, the future of capitalism,\n    densification of economic activity and living, industrial policy, our\n    approach to problems that affect us all and call for global and collective\n    action\u2014such as pandemics and climate change\u2014to the role of government and\n    institutions.\nOver the past two decades, in advanced economies, responsibility has\n    generally shifted from institutions to individuals. Yet health systems are\n    being tested and often found wanting, while benefits from paid sick leave\n    to universal basic income are getting a second look. There is potential for\n    a long-term shift in how institutions support people, through safety nets\n    and a more inclusive social contract.\nAs history has shown, choices made during crises can shape the world for\n    decades to come. What will remain critical is the need for collective\n    action to build economies that deliver inclusive economic growth,\n    prosperity, and safety for all.\nJAMES MANYIKA is chairman and director of the McKinsey Global Institute.\nJean Saldanha\nIn The Pandemic Is a Portal, Indian author Arundhati Roy writes,\n    \u201cHistorically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and\n    imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a\n    gateway between one world and the next.\u201d\nThe way multilateralism operates will have to change to reflect this very\n    different world. The COVID-19 pandemic has been testing the limits of\n    global cooperation. Support for developing economies in particular remains\n    inadequate. They were hit early by the global economic downturn, including\n    through record capital outflows and tightening financial conditions. Facing\n    the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II, these economies are\n    experiencing unprecedented pressure on their already limited fiscal\n    capacity to tackle urgent public health and social needs.\nChoices made now will have far-reaching consequences. Reliance on more of\n    the same is untenable and ignores the scale of human suffering unleashed by\n    the pandemic.\nA fitting UN-led reform agenda must include the IMF in addressing the\n    structural problems that have driven debt vulnerability across developing\n    economies. Such an agenda must shift development finance away from\n    market-friendly reforms and incentives for private investment. It must\n    abandon the dogma of austerity. Furthermore, rich countries must finally\n    meet their official development assistance commitments.\nPower imbalances in global institutions must also be corrected to give fair\n    recognition to the needs and rights of the two-thirds of the world\u2019s\n    population who reside in the Global South.\nIf the international community fails to respond decisively now, the 2030\n    Agenda and the Paris Agreement will be fatally derailed. A new\n    multilateralism\u2014in which reform of the Bretton Woods institutions will play\n    a key role\u2014is needed now and must be based on a vision of development that\n    puts human rights, gender equality, and climate at its center.\nJEAN SALDANHA is director of the European Network on Debt and Development.\nSharan Burrow\nThe world after the first wave of COVID-19 must be more inclusive,\n    resilient, and sustainable. Today, we live in a world in which inequality\n    between and within countries has grown as a result of businesses\u2019 race to\n    the bottom and working poverty among a vast portion of the global\n    workforce. Too many countries suffered the external shocks of COVID-19\n    without universal social protection, robust public health systems, a plan\n    to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, or a sustainable real economy\n    with quality jobs.\nThe Bretton Woods conference occurred while a war was still raging and\n    helped formed the basis of a postwar social contract. Similarly, we need to\n    craft an ambitious reconstruction plan while working to end the pandemic.\n    International support is a matter of collective survival and an investment\n    in the future of health, the global economy, and multilateralism. The\n    choice is ours, and the actions of the IMF and the multilateral system will\n    be a deciding factor.\nOur goal for recovery should be full employment and a new social contract.\n    Public investment in the care economy, education, and low-carbon\n    infrastructure can form the backbone of stimulus that reduces inequality.\n    Wage policy, collective bargaining, and labor market regulation can revive\n    demand and income while putting an end to a business model that allows\n    companies to take no responsibility for their workers.\nDebt should be addressed through a relief process focused on the United\n    Nations Sustainable Development Goals and enduring economic growth for\n    every country. Shortsighted fiscal consolidation hindered debt management\n    and reduction after the global financial crisis and would again leave us\n    even less able to deal with future health and economic crises.\nShared prosperity can be the fruit of a COVID-19 world marked by shared\n    ambition and global solidarity.\nSHARAN BURROW is general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation.\nSergio Rebelo\nCOVID-19 will leave a lasting imprint on the world economy, causing\n    permanent changes and teaching important lessons.\nVirus screening is likely to become part of our life, just like security\n    measures became ubiquitous after 9/11. It is important to invest in the\n    infrastructure necessary to detect future viral outbreaks. This investment\n  protects economies in case immunity to COVID-19 turns out to be temporary.\nMany economies adopted versions of Germany\u2019s Kurzarbeit (short\n    work) subsidy during the pandemic. This policy keeps workers employed at\n    reduced hours and pay, with the government compensating some of the\n    shortfall in wages. By keeping matches between firms and workers intact,\n    the economy is better prepared for a quick recovery. It is important to\n    improve the implementation of these policies and make them a permanent part\n    of our economic recovery tool kit.\nRemote work is likely to become more common. We had some evidence that\n  working from home is at least as productive as working at the office .\n    However, many companies were reluctant to embrace remote work. Now that\n    many have tried it with good results, remote work might be here to stay.\nThe pandemic crisis has accelerated the pace of digital transformation,\n    with further expansion in e-commerce and increases in the pace of adoption\n    of telemedicine, videoconferencing, online teaching, and fintech.\nCompanies with international supply chains are dealing with shortages and\n    bottlenecks. We are likely to see many of these companies reshore some of\n    their production. Unfortunately, this trend will not create many jobs\n    because most of the production is likely to be automated.\nGovernments will be bigger after playing the role of insurer and investor\n    of last resort during the crisis. Public debt will balloon, creating\n    financial challenges around the world.\nThe most important lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is the importance of\n    working together on problems that affect the entire human race. We are much\n    stronger united than divided.\nSERGIO REBELO is a professor of international finance at the Kellogg School of Management\n    at Northwestern University.\nIan Bremmer\nThe global order was in flux well before the COVID-19 crisis. Coronavirus\n    has accelerated three of the key geopolitical trends that will shape our\n    next world order\u2026 which will await us on the other side of this pandemic.\nThe first trend is deglobalization; the logistic\n    difficulties brought to light by the current crisis are already pointing to\n    a shift away from global just-in-time supply chains. Yet as economic\ndifficulties mount, the inevitable growth of nationalism and \u201cmy nation first\u201d politics will push companies to localize business operations that favor\n    national and regional supply chains.\nThe third trend, China\u2019s geopolitical rise, has been more\n    than three decades in the making. But while China has successfully\n    transformed itself into an economic and technological superpower, no one\n    expected it to become a \u201csoft power\u201d superpower. This crisis can change\n    that, if China\u2019s crisis diplomacy continues and the perception endures that\n    Beijing has been far more effective than the rest of the world in its\n    response to the outbreak.\nOf course, just because China appears to be faring better doesn\u2019t mean it\n    actually is. There\u2019s a reason people take Chinese numbers with a grain of\n    salt. This general distrust was further fueled by the initial Chinese\n    cover-up of the outbreak, which enabled its global spread.

Here\u2019s what they said:\nMichael Beer: Organizations will develop trust-based cultures with employees\nThe coronavirus challenge demands an organization-wide, honest conversation that enables truth to speak to power about the corporate response to the challenge. Think of it as a new strategic initiative facing huge execution challenges. These require senior management to get the best information they can about barriers to execution, and it requires trust and commitment. That comes about when everyone in the organization knows that senior management wants to hear from lower levels about barriers to execution that might include their own leadership.\nThe coronavirus challenge, like any crisis, provides senior management a huge opportunity to develop a trust-based culture rapidly\u00a0or, conversely, if not handled with an organization-wide honest conversation, to undermine their ability to develop a trust-based culture for years to come.\nMichael Beer is the Cahners-Rabb Professor of Business Administration, Emeritus, co-founder and director of TruePoint Partners, and the Center for Higher Ambition Leadership.\nRyan W. Buell: Businesses will help customers be more helpful\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19 reminds us how our wellbeing is interconnected, and the flurry of heartwarming responses people have exhibited in the face of this crisis reveals our tremendous willingness and ability to help one another. These truths will persist when life goes back to normal.\nForward-thinking leaders can run better organizations by creating conditions that allow customers to be more helpful. When service provision is a true partnership and customers are pitching in, employees are more productive, service outcomes are improved, and experiences are enhanced for everyone involved.\nThere are three barriers that can prevent us from productively engaging: 1) not being able to help, 2) not knowing how to help, and, 3) not believing our help is important.\nOrganizations that have succeeded in helping their customers be more helpful have found ways to overcome all three barriers. For example, cinemas have identified a concrete, helpful customer behavior\u2014silencing phones before the movie begins. A simple reminder that demonstrates why it matters to everyone in the theater is all it has taken to practically eliminate interruptions during movies. Another success is how airlines have trained us all to take part in cleaning the plane before landing. During the final approach, a flight attendant asks over the P.A. that we pass our trash and unused items to a crew member in the aisle. On some flights, this message additionally describes a tight upcoming turnaround, and how passengers can help the cleaning crew achieve an on-time departure for the next flight. In both cases, we gladly do our part.\nOne caveat: When the rationale for customers to help seems mostly about enhancing profitability, the request to lend a hand can feel disingenuous, and in some cases, can lead to behaviors that run counter to the organization\u2019s objectives. But when it\u2019s clear that our engagement is broadly helpful\u2014to ourselves and to others\u2014most people are delighted to engage.\nBy identifying concrete ways in which customers can be helpful, providing clear instructions about what they can do, and designing transparency into why their partnership will make a positive difference for everyone involved, business leaders can improve interactions among their customers and employees, and help us all achieve better things together.\nRyan W. Buell (@ryan buell )\u00a0is the Finnegan Family Associate Professor of Business Administration in the Technology and Operations Management Unit.\nPrithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury: Remote work will become strategic\nI\u2019ve been studying remote work for years now, but under very different conditions\u2014not under a crisis like this. We have to recalibrate our minds in terms of why we\u2019re doing remote work now.\nIn this moment of panic, when companies and workers are trying to figure out how to be productive and how to be happy working from home, the most practical advice I can give is to find someone who is experienced in remote work tech tools. Find a colleague who has used Slack and Zoom and set up a tutorial and get a sense of how to use these tools and what their functionality is like. Hopefully the virus will go away soon, but those tools will stay helpful even if you choose to go back to the office when the virus is gone. This is an opportunity to learn Slack and Zoom and have a mentor teach you how to use these tools.\nThe second thing is, working remotely is very effective if you can also restructure the organizational processes for how communication happens, how socialization happens, and how coordination happens.\nIn a short time it\u2019s not possible to do everything, so there are a few things companies can focus on. First, in a remote world, it\u2019s very important to not only communicate synchronously on Skype or Zoom, but asynchronously, where you\u2019re not face to face on a screen.\nThe easiest way is to use a Google doc or Slack. This is how virtual companies work. If you and I are working as a team, I can work in a Google doc and explain what I\u2019ve done, and you can wake up in a different time zone or city, open it up, and see the work I\u2019ve done. There\u2019s less chance of losing communication, and people are on the same page.\nThe final thing I\u2019ll say: Remote companies have well-established processes where people are socializing and no one is feeling isolated and\u00a0falling through the cracks. That\u2019s really important right now, especially with all the anxiety around us and schools getting closed and the fear and psychosis of the moment.\nIn my research, productivity went up when people went to remote work settings. But I would not like to compare those normal circumstances to this moment now, where general anxiety might affect productivity.\nThe isolation and mental sadness needs to be actively worked on by encouraging employees to develop a personal regime: Exercise at home, meditate, and make sure you reach out and talk to people, even if that socialization takes place virtually, just to make sure employees are happy, mentally relaxed, and productive to the extent that we can.\nAnd managers should think: How do we survive this time and even get something positive out of this? One of those positives could be the use of all these cool tools that we should be using anyway. As time passes, workers may find that they like the flexibility of not driving every day and might be interested in making their own self-selection to continuously work from home. So companies should have the right processes and incentives in place to allow for that flexibility.\nPrithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury ( @prithwic) is the Lumry Family Associate Professor in the Technology and Operations Management Unit.\nAmy C. Edmondson: Leadership will engage people to work together creatively\nI hope we will come to learn that hiding bad news is never a good idea. That will mean recommitting ourselves to mastering the leadership skills to tell the truth and to engage people in the hard work of creating\u00a0solutions together.\nMastering the design and management of teams will become an even more critical focus\u2014or more accurately, mastering what I have called teaming\u2014working in flexible groups with shifting membership, often from different locations, to address particular challenges. Depending on how long the current state lasts, we may see a shift away from static organizational structures toward dynamic team forms. This only works well under conditions of psychological safety, when leaders have made it crystal clear that every team member is welcome to speak up with ideas, concerns, and yes, bad news.\nIt is unprecedented to have a large cohort of people all over the world start working remotely at the same moment. The only parallel I can think of is from World War II, when waves of women entered heavy manufacturing for the first time. This current case is even more remarkable because it is moving so quickly. The shift has happened in days, not months. Businesses may be able to learn how to move faster, acting in more agile ways, as a result.\nAmy C. Edmondson ( @AmyCEdmondson) is the Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management.\nJoseph B. Fuller: Standard operating practice will be elevated to a new level\nMany of the changes companies will make in the short term are obvious: dramatically reduced travel, more work-from-home opportunities for white-collar workers, and\u00a0changes in business operations to reduce human contact and to improve workplace hygiene.\nI believe the more interesting changes will play out after this public health emergency is behind us. In the past, companies have used the lessons learned during periods of disruption to improve their standard operating practices. For example, the great recession forced employers to revisit their staffing models. The result was a permanent shift in the ratio of part-time workers to full-time workers across the economy. COVID-19 may yield similar changes.\nTHE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS\nMore Business-Related Pandemic Coverage from Around Harvard and Beyond\nCOVID-19 Business\nImpact Center (Harvard Business School)\nLessons from Chinese Companies\u2019 Response to Covid-19 (Harvard Business Review)\nWhat Quarantine Can Teach You About Spending and Happiness (Wall Street Journal)\nRead COVID-19 coverage from Working Knowledge\n[In terms of the businesses most impacted by COVID-19], certain sectors\u2014air travel, hospitality, tourism, and high-end consumer brands that rely on traditional retailing for the bulk of their sales\u2014have already been demonstrably affected. So will industries that revolve around large gatherings, such as many forms of popular entertainment\u2014sports, cinema, concerts\u2014to business conferences and trade fairs.\nIn the intermediate term, we will see companies that rely on global supply chains be hurt. Once companies run through their existing safety stocks of raw materials or parts provided by a far-flung supplier base, they may face challenges filling demand as their supply chains begin to ramp up.\nJoseph B. Fuller ( @JosephBFuller )\u00a0is a professor of management practice in the\u00a0General Management unit and co-leads the School\u2019s Managing the Future of Work initiative.\nStephen P. Kaufman: Supply chain managers suddenly will have a much more difficult job\nThe surprising length and complexity of many supply chains will be illuminated sharply by the coronavirus as, for example, when an American equipment manufacturer discovers that a British supplier of a major assembly that they thought they had fully vetted must suspend production because they have an Italian supplier of a sub-assembly who gets an inexpensive, but unique specialty component from an Asian company with a plant in China that has shut down.\nSupply chain managers who previously focused their attention one or two levels down into their supply chains will have to go back to work and develop the systems and discipline to track even more deeply into the chain.\nStephen P. Kaufman is a senior lecturer of business administration.\nRosabeth Moss Kanter: The best leaders will break out of silos and improve workplace culture\nIt\u2019s said that fortune favors the prepared mind. Fortune certainly favors companies with broad concern for all stakeholders and good workplace practices. They are better prepared to deal with and mitigate crisis, like the current coronavirus pandemic.\nIf there were ever a time to \u201cthink outside the building\u201d and be more aware of the wider system, it\u2019s now. Operating in silos and paying attention only to a few stakeholders leads to vulnerabilities. Companies are dependent not only on global supply chains and what might be happening in other countries, but also on the state of institutions in their own communities. The ecosystems in which companies operate mean that a disruption to one industry or set of activities ripples to others.\nCompanies with the strongest stakeholder and partner orientations are best able to survive and transcend crises, because they can plan together, gain local knowledge from each other, and draw on good will to get back to business quickly when the crisis abates.\nCivic engagement and social responsibility can go from nice-to-have to essential. Encouraging the growth of local and regional suppliers through regional economic development and job training strategies enriches the local ecosystem. A pandemic makes clear that there is a business interest in contributing to solving problems, such as the adequacy of the public health system, disparities in access to health care, availability of emergency child care, universal broadband and Internet access, or educating people in life skills such as resiliency and adaptability as well as tech skills.\nThinking outside traditional structures also helps within a company. Just about every classic reason that people dislike change under normal circumstances are exacerbated by this crisis: loss of control, excess uncertainty,\u00a0surprises,\u00a0too much difference from normal routines,\u00a0concerns about competence with new technology,\u00a0ripple effects\u00a0from someone else\u2019s disruption,\u00a0threats to future plans.\nIt\u2019s important that people feel that there is something positive they can do to be useful and regain some control over routines and skills. Renewing and reinforcing good workplace practices can make a big difference to productivity as well as well-being. For example:\nAbundant communication. Regular briefings, communication from many levels, town hall dialogues.\nCross-training, so people can fill in for one another.\nFlexible work schedules, start and stop times that fit life needs.\nGoal clarity. Measurement of results and impact, not simply time spent.\nEmpowerment of people at lower levels to make quick decisions.\nBroad purpose. An emphasis on mission and values that drive the company and how employees can contribute.\nOne way to accomplish both \"outside the building\"\u00a0and within the company goals is to empower teams to spend some of their time brainstorming about how they can help make a difference to their communities, now and for times to come. This can unite and inspire people, and it might create good ideas for innovation when attention turns to the business future.\nRosabeth Moss Kanter ( @RosabethKanter )\u00a0is the Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration.\nJohn Macomber: Employees and buildings will be healthier\nCOVID-19 will change the nature of our offices, apartments, hospitals, schools, and government buildings. Concern about the spread of this and other communicable diseases might fade after this contagion, but there will probably be more outbreaks in the decades to come. This means that we can expect our physical structures to change, too.\nThink of the extension of today\u2019s airport and courthouse security screening: not just what weapons you may be carrying, but also what infections you may be carrying. Many of us have experienced health screening in Asian airports for years as technicians viewed our facial temperatures, checked our passports and vaccination histories, and asked questions. This will become a more permanent component of entry to office buildings, schools, and transit hubs.\nPhysical components of buildings and public spaces will change, too\u2014in subtle ways. We are the indoor generation; we spend 90 percent of our time inside. (This means that by the time you are 60 years old, you will have spent 54 years indoors). Organizations will realize that indoor air quality\u2014notably involving fresh air and filtration\u2014directly impacts productivity of healthy people and helps mitigate the onset of sick people.\nAs Dr. Joseph Allen of the Harvard\u00a0T.H. Chan School of Public Health and I argue in our forthcoming book, Healthy Buildings: How Indoor Spaces Drive Performance and Productivity, more money will be spent and should be spent on fans, filters, ductwork, chillers, heat exchangers, and dehumidifiers\u2014and on the energy to run them.\nThe next wave of intervention will be in the collection of population information regarding who enters the building and when. With facial recognition and infrared cameras, there can be time series data collected from your temperature and probably what was in the breaths you exhaled, captured over weeks and years, as you enter vestibules and ride elevators.Further, apartment dwellers, office workers, and hospital patients alike will be able to track and share air quality analytics in a very democratized way from their handheld sensors connected to their mobile phones and organized and served up by third-party rating databases like the future Morningstars, Yelps, Glassdoors, TripAdvisors, and others.\nBuilding owners (and their investors and lenders) in all sectors will have to both outfit their buildings to measure components of public health and also respond to their occupants doing their own assessments. This might be disconcerting, and the rollout will be uneven, but we all will be collectively safer.\nJohn Macomber ( @cleantechcities) is a senior lecturer of business administration in the Finance Unit\nGary P. Pisano: In-person meetings will be less important\nAll organizations will learn that they can leverage technology much more effectively to operate remotely and conduct business. We will realize we need far fewer face-to-face meetings than we thought. I think the productivity benefits could be quite big.\nThe companies that will lose: travel businesses, such as airlines and hotels. We may discover we just don\u2019t need to travel to meetings as much as we thought.\nGary P. Pisano ( @motogp61 )\u00a0is the Harry E. Figgie Professor of Business Administration and Senior Associate Dean of Faculty Development.\nJeffrey T. Polzer: Employees will take stock of their new work priorities\nAs this crisis unfolds, you may find your workdays following a very different cadence. Normal work activities will get disrupted and then blended with your personal life as you begin working from home. The colleagues you usually run into at the office will no longer be down the hall, and the normal meetings and email threads that occupy your days may get shuffled in unexpected ways, depending in part on whether the crisis cripples or amplifies the demand for your work. In either case, this is a good time to take stock of your priorities and rethink your patterns of collaboration.\nBy auditing your work responsibilities and project commitments, along with all the meetings, emails, and other tools you use to collaborate, you can become more focused and intentional about how you spend your time. Before this crisis, you may have felt overloaded with too many meetings and relentless emails, making it seem like you never had time to do your actual work. The shift to working from home, despite all of its inherent challenges, can also be an opportunity to reflect on your priorities and design your new schedule to accomplish them.\nWhat are your most important goals, especially during this crisis? For you, your team, and your organization, which items on your to-do list should take priority, and which should be pruned altogether? Where do you add the most value to collective goals that you care about, whether that is through performing specialized individual tasks, managing projects, inspiring people through your leadership, or building community and camaraderie in difficult times?\nTalk to your colleagues about the roles you are best equipped to play in the new work-from-home landscape, and figure out how they fit with others\u2019 roles to make sure you stay aligned.\nThen design your collaborative activities\u2014your video and audio meetings along with all forms of text-based communication\u2014to fit your role, while giving you time for focused individual work along with family and personal activities. Clarify and, if needed, negotiate your commitments to teams and colleagues throughout your network, given the new and emerging organizational realities, and be intentional about the meetings you organize and the invitations you accept. There still may not be enough time to go around, but by resetting your collaboration patterns, you can make the most of the time you spend 'at work.'\nJeffrey T. Polzer is the UPS Foundation Professor of Human Resource Management.\nWilly C. Shih: Supply chain strategy will be rewritten\nBusinesses have been surprised on how dependent they are on China, for everything from key raw materials or parts to finished products. Often they didn\u2019t realize that it was a supplier to their supplier, or further down as a third or fourth tier. The magnitude of the shock means after they recover from the momentary chaos, many will start thinking about diversifying their risk and trying to develop alternatives in other countries.\nThe biggest losers from the coronavirus [in business] are service industries that have seen their revenues dry up. Airlines, hotels, the travel industry at large, are losing revenue and cash flow that will be difficult to replace. Manufacturers can run overtime and make up for lost production and fill pent-up demand, but services demand is perishable and hard to replace.\nThis will have knock-on effects on suppliers to those industries as well, like the commercial aircraft manufacturers or the motion picture industry.\nWilly C.

Transportation services like Uber, fitness centres, and the tourism industry, for instance, have taken heavy losses and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 have permanently closed operations.\nOther businesses have been compelled to reduce their workforce, give up their physical office addresses and restrict client interactions to digital conversations.\nTechnological impact\nWith COVID-19 necessitating social distancing and work from home, businesses have been facing an unprecedented level of IT challenges.\nThe need to make real-time decisions and manage both external and internal operations online is pressuring C-suite executives to quickly amp up their systems resilience. In many cases, this calls for a complete overhaul of the IT infrastructure.\nALSO READ\nCoronavirus: Impact of the pandemic on Indian car industry\nCustomer relations impact\nCustomer expectations have now drastically changed, both in terms of buying patterns as well as interactions with a brand.\nCompanies that wish to satisfy these new expectations have to ramp up their digital commerce in new ways, such as by working with shipping partners to provide \u201ccontactless\u201d delivery and curb-side pick-up options. They may also need to modify their product lines to cater to more essential needs.\nOperations impact\nSupply chains have undergone a paradigm shift as shipping and distribution facilities have been either shut down or severely restricted. This means that businesses can now cater to only a fraction of customer demand, and must quickly adapt to new channels \u2013 particularly ecommerce \u2013 if they wish to survive.\nHR impact\nBoth team members and executives are struggling to adjust to virtual work while coping with the uncertainties of the present and the future.\nAs businesses struggle to meet demand, employees have additional worries about whether they will face pay cuts or even job losses.\nWhat is the way forward for businesses?\nMarket research\nAs a business evaluates its plans for delivering services optimally in a post-pandemic world, it needs to find the answers to questions about whether the markets and geographies it has been serving remain profitable, which core technology and business practices need to be modified and how the team can be best enabled to keep delivering in the new normal.\nStay Updated\nGet stories of change makers and innovators from the startup ecosystem in your inbox\nThis requires detailed research on online business best practices and how customers would like to be best served in the new reality.\nThe research itself, moreover, has to be completely online as in-person interactions become the exception rather than the rule \u2013 while remaining as authoritative, unbiased and goal-oriented as before.\nDigital transformation\nThe need for digital transformation is not just an outcome of COVID-19. Mckinsey Global Institute predicted in 2017 that up to 375 million workers would need to update their skills by 2030 to adapt to the new wave of automation and artificial intelligence.\nAnother recent survey revealed that 87 percent of executives were already experiencing skill gaps or would do so in the next few years. For a business, the move to digital is not merely about setting up a website and running social media campaigns.\nIt has to figure out optimal ways for the team to stay connected and continue business-as-usual while working from home, while also staying in touch with consumer needs and expectations.\nALSO READ\nHow to avoid failure while attempting digital transformation for your company\nMarket research tools to support digital transformation\nMarket research companies are providing businesses with several solutions in this regard, including a DIY qualitative solution and in-depth data collection assistance. These tools can be set up by any business and can operate on its own.\nCompatible across devices, the tool is designed for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with customers. Another online solution allows businesses to connect with online communities of customers, whom they can categorise according to interest groups and generate loyalty through a rewards programme.\nBecoming agile\nNow more than ever, businesses need to be ready to adjust rapidly to changes. This calls for a complete removal of rigid structures and a shift towards a data-driven, technology-powered enterprise that consists of empowered team members and strong leadership.\nSupply chains need to be reshaped and processes need to be automated wherever feasible. Companies should also be agile with their financial planning so that they have enough liquidity to respond to unexpected needs.\nAdjusting to remote working\nCHROs around the world are rising to the new challenge of helping their teams navigate the sudden and massive transition into remote working. It is critical now for leaders to display solidarity with their teams and support them emotionally as well as professionally.\nKeeping team members informed about strategic decisions and providing them with a platform to voice concerns and suggestions will help them feel included.\nConclusion\nThe COVID-19 lockdown was a situation no one could have predicted. Now, more than ever, it is time for businesses to be at their most agile and to adapt intelligently and optimally to a mostly-online way of working.\nThis requires the active support of the team and an extensive understanding of how markets are likely to work now and in the foreseeable future.\nEdited by Saheli Sen Gupta\n(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)\ncoronavirus\nDigital transformation\nAgile Organisations\nbusiness strategy"}, {"Url": "https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/05/1064802", "CluewebURLHash": "4F9FA7F70136D026EB91E41B86F2747C", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\u2018Business as unusual\u2019: How COVID-19 could change the ...", "Snippet": "How different \ue000do\ue001 \ue000you\ue001 \ue000expect\ue001 the workplace in developing countries to look?

The message was clear: the future of work is not pre-determined, it is up to us to shape it.\nHowever, that future has arrived sooner than anticipated as many countries, companies and workers shifted to remote working in order to contain the transmission of COVID-19, dramatically changing how we work. Remote virtual meetings are now commonplace and economic activity has increased on a range of digital platforms.\nThe ILO's Susan Hayter has been telecommuting during the coronavirus pandemic., by ILO\nAs the restrictions are lifted, a question that is on everybody\u2019s mind is whether this \u2018business as unusual\u2019 will become the \u2018new normal\u2019. A few large companies in developed economies have already said that what has been a large and unplanned pilot \u2013 remote teleworking \u2013 will become the standard way of organizing work. Employees need not commute to work again, unless they choose to do so.\nIs this a good thing?\nThis may indeed be cause to celebrate, for people and the planet. But the idea of an end to \u201cThe Office\u201d is certainly overblown. The ILO estimates that in high-income countries 27 per cent of workers could work remotely from home. This does not mean that they will continue to work remotely. The question is how we can adapt work practices and reap the benefits of this experience with remote working \u2013 for employers and workers \u2013 while not losing the social and economic value of work as a place.\nIn celebrating the innovations in work organization that have supported business continuity during the health crisis, we cannot forget that many will have lost their jobs or gone out of business as the pandemic has brought some industries to a standstill. For those returning to their place of work, the quality of work will be a key issue, in particular safe and healthy workplaces.\nWhat needs to happen next?\nPost-pandemic, workers like these at a factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia will want to be assured their workplace is safe, by Lin Qi\nThe degree of workers\u2019 trust in the measures taken by employers to make workplaces safe, will no doubt have an impact on the return to work. Engagement with trade union representatives, where these exist, is a must.\nEverything from protocols for social distancing, monitoring and testing, and the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) need to be discussed to make this work.\nFor workers in the gig economy, such as food delivery and ride-hailing workers, work is not a place, but an activity performed for an income. The pandemic has revealed the false choice between flexibility and income security. These workers may have no or inadequate access to sick leave and unemployment-insurance benefits. We need to tap into the brave new world to ensure that their work is performed under conditions that are safe.\nHow different do you expect the workplace in developing countries to look?\nThe ILO estimates a 60 per cent decline in the earnings of the almost 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy in the first month of the crisis. \u00a0These workers are simply not able to work remotely and face the impossible choice of risking life or livelihood. Some countries have adopted measures to shore up this essential income while also ensuring adequate hygiene and PPE for employees and customers, informal enterprises and workers.\nAs companies begin to evaluate the effectiveness of the shift to remote work and their ability to tackle data security concerns, new opportunities may open up in services for developing countries with the necessary infrastructure.\nHowever, these off-shoring opportunities in activities such as software development and engineering to financial services, may be accompanied by the reshoring in of other jobs as companies seek to improve inventory management and the predictability of supply chains.\nThis will have longer-term effects on employment in developing and emerging economies. The challenge is that while it will take time for new service sectors to mature, the negative impact of rising unemployment will be felt immediately. Inequalities in digital readiness may further inhibit countries from seizing these opportunities.\nWhat are the benefits and drawbacks of remote work?\nThere may be opportunities for developing countries, like Nepal, to benefit from a global move to remote working., by World Bank/Peter Kapuscinski\nThe shift to remote work has enabled many companies to continue to operate and ensure the health and safety of their employees. Those able to make the transition to remote work during the health crisis have had the opportunity to share meals with their families. Work has become human-centred to accommodate homeschooling and child and elder care.\nYet, the lines between working time and private time have become blurred for these individuals, causing an increase in stress and exposure to mental health risks .\nIn the face of a dramatic economic downturn caused by the pandemic and surging unemployment figures, there are opportunities to leverage these changes in work organization to design new job-sharing schemes that allow for flexibility and save jobs. This may mean shorter work weeks or work-sharing arrangements to avoid furloughs in lean times, while reshaping working time arrangements to achieve better work-life balance in the longer-term.\nThe digital transformation of work and possibility to engage in remote work has also been accompanied by other benefits. It has presented possibilities for older, more experienced workers to prolong their working life on their terms and provided work opportunities for those in rural communities. However, for many others, it has compounded a sense of isolation and a loss of identity and purpose. The social value of work and the dignity and belonging we derive from it cannot be replaced by virtual rooms, no matter how casual our attire while we occupy them.\nTo what extent will the pandemic entrench rising inequality?\nWhile the pandemic may represent a tipping point for the digital transformation of the workplace, it has also revealed deep fault lines. It is those in the upper income brackets who are the most likely to choose to work remotely, whereas those in the lowest have no choice; they will have to commute and are more likely to be time-poor as a result.\nLooking to the future, as digital and online work becomes the new normal, the demand for skilled workers is likely to rise along with their wages. The contributions of care-workers and other workers (e.g. teachers and staff in grocery stores) will be more highly valued than before. Yet, many low-paid workers whose wages have been stagnating in the face of declining union power and a shifting employment relationship are likely to see their incomes eroded even further as the ranks of the unemployed increase.\nHistorically, economic shocks, pandemics and wars have exacerbated inequality. The remaining question is whether this one will be a tectonic shift with rising political and social instability, or a shock that leads us to reinforce the foundations of just societies and the principles of solidarity and democratic decision-making that move societies, labour markets and workplaces in the direction of equality.\n\u2666 Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic.\n\u2666 Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices.\nteleworking|COVID-19|coronavirus\nThe International\u00a0Labour\u00a0Organization () is marking its"}, {"Url": "https://cntraveler.com/story/how-covid-19-will-change-business-travel", "CluewebURLHash": "20CDEFA5D815E960E419C42AB572B992", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "How \ue000Business Travel\ue001 Will \ue000Change\ue001 After \ue000COVID-19\ue001 | Cond\u00e9 ...", "Snippet": "Getty. \ue000Business travel\ue001 has come to a halt during the \ue000COVID-19\ue001 pandemic, as stay-at-home restrictions have required companies to hold more virtual meetings.

While the outbreak is not yet over, experts have started to project a potential rebound for corporate travel.\nAn April poll from the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) found that 98 percent of its member companies had canceled international business trips, and 92 percent axed all or most domestic travel. But in a May follow-up poll, more than half the respondents said they plan to resume travel in the near future.\nLET YOURSELF GO\n1 YEAR FOR $10\nThose results should not come as much of a surprise, given the importance of business travel. Certify, a corporate expense report and travel software provider, estimates that around 445 million business trips take place each year, valued at $251 billion (the GBTA puts that number closer to $345 billion annually for travel and meeting expenditures). An Oxford Economics study found that each dollar invested in business travel can result in as much as $12.50 in revenue. Add it all up, and it's a tremendous potential amount of money that corporations rely on to stay in business.\nIn fact, a recent survey by consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that around three-quarters of business travelers expect to travel the same amount or even more after the pandemic, due to a resurgence of business activity, relatively low travel costs once lockdowns begin to ease, and pent-up demand after teleconferencing for months.\nYet even as travel begins to resume, the prospect of taking a business trip is a trigger for many workers whose main worry remains avoiding the disease. To get a better sense of how corporate travel might change due to COVID-19, we talked to experts throughout the travel industry. Here's what they had to say about how business travel will restart.\nBusiness travel will rebound slowly\n\u201cDomestic business travel is likely to pick up quicker than international,\u201d says Charuta Fadnis, senior vice president of research at travel analytics firm Phocuswright. \u201cBut any uptick in business travel will be dictated by prevailing economic conditions.\u201d In previous economic crises, the travel industry has recovered in around two to three years, she says.\nMichael Steiner, executive vice president of travel management company Ovation, echoes those predictions. \u201cMost businesses are still in a wait-and-see mode,\" he says. \"However, within the last few weeks, we have seen a flurry of clients expressing a desire to hold face-to-face meetings with clients and colleagues,\u201d he adds, noting that U.S. domestic air travel bookings for June and July are slowly on the rise.\nSeveral frequent corporate travelers from various industries including retail, finance, and entertainment\u2014all of whom asked to speak anonymously\u2014say business travel will eventually resume because virtual options such as Zoom and teleconferencing are not sufficient for some of their needs. One individual suggested mergers and acquisitions will spike in the coming quarter, and that deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars often require an in-person handshake (or at least, an elbow bump). Logistics are also part of it, Steiner says. \u201cTry coordinating a global conference and accommodating all those time zones.\u201d\nCorporate travel could recover as much as 70 percent overall by this time next year, assuming a best-case scenario.\nCertain industries might ramp their travel back up more quickly than others, too. \u201cOne of our corporate clients is a medical technology company that works with labs throughout Europe and North America,\u201d says Vikram Seshadri, a business and luxury travel advisor with Protravel. \u201cThey were hiring before the shutdown and expect to be traveling a lot as restrictions are lifted.\u201d Venture capitalists and management consultants, who might be called upon to help companies cope with pressures from the pandemic-caused recession, will also be among the first corporate travelers to hit the road again, he says.\nCorporate travel could recover as much as 70 percent overall by this time next year, assuming a best-case scenario, says Chip Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel & Lodging Association. But he does not expect large meetings, conferences, and conventions to rebound more than 50 percent before early next year. If and when they do, they could help stabilize and even raise airfares and hotel rates. \u201cBusiness travelers generate the most revenue for the travel industry, and are less price-sensitive than leisure travelers,\u201d Rogers says.\nCleanliness is key\nTravel companies will need to implement new sanitation and hygiene measures that make being on the road feel safe. \u201cSafety is the new loyalty, and consumers will choose brands that prioritize their well being,\u201d says Jennie Blumenthal, the travel, transportation, and hospitality leader for consulting company PwC.\nCorporations and employees will also have to agree upon new, so-called \u201cduty-of-care\u201d policies that ensure workers\u2019 welfare while conducting company business. \u201cTraditionally, corporate travel programs have focused on costs and compliance as key metrics,\u201d says Phocuswright\u2019s Fadnis. \u201cNow, however, travelers\u2019 safety will be the top priority. Travel managers will look very closely at their suppliers\u2019 policies and practices around hygiene and distancing, and restrict their list of preferred providers to those they feel most confident about.\u201d\nGiven how much airlines have slashed their schedules, some firms have also turned to charters.\nCorporations are going to have to factor the costs of new health policies into their travel budgets and planning, says Dale Buckner, CEO of Global Guardian, a firm that offers security, emergency, and medical response services. \u201cBusinesses will reevaluate whether travel is fundamentally required,\" he says. \"In cases where it is, a firm will have to sponsor an employee or executive to travel knowing the risks, like that they might be burning money having to put them up at a luxury hotel during a 14-day quarantine.\u201d\nDuring the last major economic downturn, many companies downgraded mid- and lower-level executives to flying coach, but still allowed C-suiters and top brass to book business or first class. Despite the current recession, Protravel\u2019s Seshadri does not expect that to change. \u201cBecause of COVID-related safety concerns, corporate travelers are going to want to be sequestered in a business-class pod, which feels like a much safer and more private environment than your typical economy seat,\" he says.\nCaitlin Morton\nCNT Editors\nRamsey Qubein\nThat is also just practical, according to Steiner. \u201cTraveler comfort directly relates to productivity,\u201d he says. Steiner also notes that luxury properties might post room rates closer to their budget counterparts for some time to come, too, easing the financial burden of corporate travel departments.\nGiven how much airlines have slashed their schedules, some firms have also turned to charters. \u201cWe expect to see a rise in demand for charters as businesses and cities reopen, and people have more places they can travel to confidently,\u201d says Alex Wilcox, the CEO of hop-on jet service JSX. \u201cPeople are going to seek alternative ways to travel, especially when it means avoiding crowded airports and packed planes.\u201d\nLoyalty programs are even more important\nIn addition to promoting new public health measures, airlines and hotels will turn to their loyalty programs to win back business travelers and their most frequent customers. \u201cFor the past half dozen years, airlines have flown mostly full, so there hasn\u2019t been a need to invest in loyalty programs to fill empty seats,\u201d says Gary Leff from the loyalty blog View From The Wing. \u201cThat is going to change. I expect to see bonuses for travel and there will probably be promotions to earn elite status, such as double qualifying miles, status-match offers, and possibly other new benefits like available middle-seat blocking.\u201d\nFadnis agrees that more benefits are on the way for business fliers. \u201cWe are likely to see more perks being included in corporate agreements,\u201d she says. But don\u2019t expect these extra perks to last too long.\n\u201cAirlines and hotels are going to be very careful how they promote added benefits to their loyalty programs since many will be dealing with reduced inventory that may coincide with pent-up demand when people begin traveling again,\u201d Ovation\u2019s Steiner says. So while travelers will probably be able to redeem their airline miles and hotel points for plentiful reward flights and nights in the short term, once people begin traveling in larger numbers, free travel and elite perks might be harder to come by.\n\u201cMaking the traveler feel valued and special will be the key, and that applies to all travelers, business and leisure,\u201d says Fadnis. When airlines and hotels can do that, while convincing people it is safe to take trips, business travel might finally be on its way to a rebound.\nWe're reporting on how COVID-19 impacts travel on a daily basis.

In an effort to protect their employees and help avoid the spread of the virus, companies have quickly enacted new policies.\nThese steps include endorsing video interviews, working from home, halting in-person meetings, canceling conferences, cutting down on flying out to meet clients, becoming more attune to the supply chain and what countries they conduct business with. It's a radical new way of thinking about how the workplace should operate. It shows that there is not an absolute need to have everyone congregated together in one place. With the advancements in technology it's possible to have large numbers, if not all, employees working remotely.\nGoogle informed job seekers that \u201cIn light of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to protect our candidates\u2019 and interviewers\u2019 health and wellbeing, we will be conducting all Google interviews globally virtually via Google Hangout for the foreseeable future.\u201d According to The Verge ,\u00a0Google also canceled a big conference that serves to announce new important developments. A spokesperson for the company said, \u201cDue to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities, we have decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event at Shoreline Amphitheatre.\u201d\nVideo interviews and canceling conferences has been echoed by a large number of other influential companies. Leading investment bank J.P. Morgan, Twitter, Amazon and other major corporations have requested that their employees work at home to help with stemming the spread of COVID-19.\nConsider how much these other changes will reshape the work-world. How much time is wasted by holding long tedious meetings that can easily be dispensed with and addressed by emails? Why should employees fly around the world when video conferences are available and cheaper? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier for a job seeker to have a video interview instead of forcing her to sneak out of the office with some lame excuse, commute across town to the company and then scurry back to work worried that she\u2019ll be found out.\nMORE FOR YOU\nEmpathy Is The Most Important Leadership Skill According To Research\nWhy U.S. Talent Shortages Are At A 10-Year High\nYou Probably Need More Friends\u2014Here\u2019s How To Make Them\nEmployees are conscious of how their companies operate. They desire to work for a place that shares their ethics, morals and social views. We\u2019ve seen that our large trading partner, China, has a different perspective on human rights, health and safety issues and the treatment of workers. It's only a matter of time before CEOs will start regulating the companies and countries they do business with.\nThe traditional manner of conducting business is changing right before our eyes. We\u2019ve done things out of habit. Now the virus outbreak has forced business leaders to rethink better more efficient means of facilitating routine business activities. Online video meetings and interviews, reduced travel to clients, dispensing with physical conferences that can also be done virtually and working from home will take over.\nThese changes are better for both the companies and their employees. Working from home enables people to be more productive, care for their children and avoid stressful soul-sucking commutes. Jetting around the world for conferences and meetings feeds an executive\u2019s ego but it can easily be done through videos. With less plane travel, more people working at home and not commuting, pollution will be reduced and the environment and air quality will improve. Companies will save a fortune on rent and travel related costs and have happier and more motivated employees.\nWe have seen in the past that a terrible situation inspired big changes to our society. After the terrorist attack on 9/11 America instituted substantial changes that reverberate today. Due to fear of future attacks the government passed the Patriot Act. With the best of intentions, trying to detect and prevent hostile acts against our country and people, we\u2019ve created a surveillance society.\nOur financial transactions are scrupulously scrutinized. We\u2019re forced to show up two hours early to the airport and endure the indignities of a search as if we\u2019re criminals. These and other measures put into place probably saved us from bad actors and heinous violence. The downside was that our liberties and privacy have been abridged.\nWith the new measures being announced by companies and not the government, they look different. The unfortunate virus outbreak has forced corporate executives to think of how to dampen it's spread, and in the process came up with clever ideas to help stop the progress of the COVID-19 while establishing improved conditions for workers. It's a winning scenario as the companies will benefit through cost savings, employees will enjoy working from home and the environment will be better with less driving and flying.\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Can we go to events? Here's what to expect long term from the coronavirus pandemic.\nBy\nJillian Wilson\nAug. 6, 2020, 05:45 AM EDT | Updated Sep. 15, 2020\nThe coronavirus has uprooted life as we know it. Everything from our social gatherings to our daily errands has been completely changed and most of us are not too fond of the switch (to say the least). The whole world is eagerly awaiting a COVID-19 vaccine for the safety of ourselves and our loved ones and for the return of life as we know it.\nRealistically and sadly, though, life will not go back to what it was for quite some time due to questions around the actual vaccine and how and when it will be distributed.\n\u201cOne thing that is important to remember: This is not going to be one of those light switch things when all of a sudden we have a vaccine and everyone is vaccinated. It\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d said Hilary Godwin, dean of the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201c We\u2019re fortunate in that we have a number of vaccine candidates that are under development, but we really sped up the process enormously so the chance of any one of those being super effective is not great.\u201d\nLife is going to look different for the next few years, but what exactly does that mean? Below, we spoke with experts in public health and mental health about what the world may look like after the anticipated COVID-19 vaccine arrives.\nExpect the United States to change to a mask-wearing culture\nA year from now, and even beyond that, Godwin expects to still see people wearing masks in public \u2014 especially people who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\u201cI think a big part of the future will be greater expectations around masks. Mask-wearing has not been part of the culture in the United States for infectious disease control other than in clinical settings,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMask-wearing will become more normal, the way it has been in many Asian countries in recent years,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a shift toward that.\u201d\nmladenbalinovac via Getty Images\nThe United States may be a mask-wearing culture, even after a COVID-19 vaccine exists.\nScientists and doctors will have to learn about the efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine even after it\u2019s out\nThe speed at which scientists are working to create a COVID-19 vaccine is impressively fast, but the excitement surrounding fast-track vaccine development is met with concerns from many health professionals.\n\u201cThe rate of development of the vaccine is like nothing we have ever seen before,\u201d said Aparna Kumar, a nurse-scientist and assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson University. \u201c It\u2019s great that the science is moving quickly, but it also creates limitations in terms of what we know about the efficacy of the vaccines.\u201d\nShe defined the efficacy of a vaccine as how well a vaccine works in ideal conditions, like in a randomized controlled trial. The efficacy demonstrates how much the vaccine reduces the frequency of illness in a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated population.\nKumar \u2015 who is also the chief community officer at Dear Pandemic, an all-female team of researchers and clinicians who are working to combat COVID-19 misinformation by sharing accessible and accurate information on social media \u2015 said the vaccine may not eradicate the virus, either.\nS he noted that childhood vaccines work very well, but something like the flu vaccine is 40% to 60% effective, depending on the year and the strain of flu.\n\u201c The flu vaccine prevents many people from getting severely ill and from the disease circulating in the community to the level it would, but we still know that a large number of people are going to get sick,\u201d she said.\nShe added that discoveries around a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness are difficult to discuss until the vaccine is deployed to the community, meaning health professionals cannot predict the effectiveness rate of the COVID-19 vaccine until it is administered to the general public.\nDoctors also anticipate concerns surrounding the actual distribution of the vaccine\nThe impressively fast creation of a COVID-19 vaccine also lends itself to worries about the actual distribution of the approved vaccine.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have challenges getting a vaccine deployed primarily because of supply chain problems,\u201d said Tony Moody, a physician-scientist at Duke University. \u201cHow do you manufacture enough doses and get them distributed in a timely manner? We can do really nice things with vaccine manufacturing capacity \u2014 we make billions of doses of the influenza vaccine every year \u2014 but doing that for a new product and having the ability to get it rapidly distributed is going to be really challenging.\u201d\nHe also anticipates problems around the glass vials and stoppers needed for vaccine storage and distribution.\n\u201cMost vials and stoppers are manufactured overseas and if you can\u2019t actually get ships coming in, you can\u2019t get supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you can make the vaccine, can you get enough vials?\u201d\nMoMo Productions via Getty Images\nEmployers may continue to be more flexible with work-from-home policies even after there's a vaccine for COVID-19.\nCount on fewer business trips and more remote work opportunities\nWith the increase in digital technologies and the realization that some industries can easily continue without sending staff across the county or across the globe, Godwin said she expects business trips will be reduced for people in most industries.\n\u201cMy guess is there will probably be fewer business trips. We now don\u2019t have to be physically in the same room to accomplish many things,\u201d she said.\nShe added that work-from-home routines have accelerated the adoption of technologies like Zoom in a way that would not have happened otherwise. S he expects corporations to be more flexible with remote work policies \u2015 especially if work is still getting accomplished at home while keeping people from getting sick and helping the company with operations costs.\nDon\u2019t plan to attend a concert or sporting event just yet\nUnfortunately, as the vaccine is rolling out and determinations about its efficacy are being made, crowded sporting events and packed concerts won\u2019t become part of our new normal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to convince people to go back to large gatherings that are simply for entertainment or recreational purposes,\u201d Moody said. \u201cI think what you\u2019ll see is clusters of people at smaller gatherings. I doubt we\u2019re going to have big events with tens of thousands of people coming together.\u201d\nHe voiced concerns regarding crowds inside of performing arts and sporting venues, in particular. He questioned how to safely welcome groups of people into an enclosed space and what that means for the venue.\n\u201cHow quickly are we going to be able to get people back into venues? Is it going to be a situation where venues have to charge twice as much because they can only fill half as many seats? Which then makes so many of these things out of reach for people \u2014 I think that\u2019s going to be really challenging,\u201d Moody said.\nAnd since fresh air circulation helps mitigate the risk of the virus, he added that outdoor social gatherings will become even more of the norm.\nImgorthand via Getty Images\nOutdoor gatherings may continue to be more common in the coming years.\nExpect significant psychological, societal and cultural impacts\nThere is no question that people are profoundly affected by the major events that occur in their lifetime. People who lived through the Great Depression have different tendencies than those who did not; those who grew up during the Vietnam War have a different outlook than those born postwar. It is to be expected that modern-day society will be shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEdwin Fisher, a professor of health behavior at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, noted that the psychological after-effects of disasters typically emerge six months after the event ends. He anticipates long-term mental health effects and societal changes as a result of the pandemic, which has kept millions of Americans isolated socially and physically for months.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s ubiquitous, because it\u2019s everywhere, because it hits us 24/7, we tend to lose track of the effects of COVID on our daily lives, mood and consciousness,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWell, what will the similar effect be of having lived through the greatest global pandemic in over 100 years? There are going to be many, many long-term effects.\u201d\nHe worries about depression, suicide rates and marital problems \u2014 things that are currently at heightened rates because of the pandemic.\nLook forward to a public health system that is more prepared to handle epidemics and pandemics\nKumar pointed out that our health system will only be more prepared for any future health crisis or future coronavirus outbreaks after what we\u2019ve experienced with the pandemic.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot about our own public health systems and structures in this pandemic, and those things can only get better,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cAs we continue to move on, we\u2019re more prepared for potential future outbreaks. Having these structures and systems in place, we can just reactivate them when we need to.\u201d\nMost of the general public now also understands pandemic-fighting behaviors like social distancing and mask-wearing, two things that were virtually unheard of in the U.S. before this year.\nFG Trade via Getty Images\nThe public health system will be more prepared for future health crises.\nAnticipate certain levels of discord throughout communities\nWhile the vast majority of people are counting down the days, Fisher warned that any unrealistic and premature hyping of the vaccine could lead people to believe that all troubles will be over as soon as the needle pricks their body.\n\u201cI think there is a tremendous likelihood of conflict, social discord and unanticipated consequences with the arrival of the vaccine,\u201d he said.\nCommunities, co-workers, friends and families will be faced with tough decisions regarding everything from the topic of how to safely socialize after months and months of isolation to sending their child to school where there may be unvaccinated students.\nHe also stressed that there are likely going to be issues regarding vaccine distribution and the potential for inequalities around race that the illness has already highlighted and exacerbated.\nThe virus won\u2019t go away completely\nSadly, COVID-19 won\u2019t disappear when the vaccine is deployed. Godwin noted that the U.S. has a long history of people being opposed to vaccines.\n\u201cWe are already seeing people saying they wouldn\u2019t want to get the vaccine and that limits our ability to create herd immunity, which provides protection for those who can\u2019t get the vaccine or haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine,\u201d Godwin said.\nShe cautioned that the virus will still be circulating even after an effective vaccine is widely available as a result of those who choose not to get the vaccine.\n\u201cWe are going to be living with COVID for a while,\u201d she stressed.\nExperts are still learning about the novel coronavirus.

Business has been disrupted and will not necessarily go back to normal. Instead, the current disruption has changed and continues to change the business landscape as we know it.\nHow can business leaders react to the challenges, reassess what they do, reconfigure their companies and reinvent their activities to adapt to the disruption and prepare for the new normal?\nThe implications of climate change, new technologies, digitalization, demographic changes, artificial intelligence, and financial and political uncertainties have moved many of us. We saw a significant event coming, but the pandemic has likely taken it at least one level up from our expectations.\nSome companies may have advanced their digitalization capabilities in the past few years. These companies are likely experiencing, at least in the short term, only a moderate impact due to the global pandemic. By shifting their operations to remote work via online conferencing and communication tools like Zoom and Slack, most projects continue.\nCompanies in industries heavily affected by the restriction of physical movement (hotels, airlines), however, and those less prepared for technological changes (many retailers, for example) are seeing their operations shattered.\nReacting to the crisis\nWhen crises first hit, companies need to react to immediate challenges and threats. At that point, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of doing the right thing. Businesses must remain true to their vision, be empathetic to stakeholders, make quick decisions and adjust those decisions, if necessary, frequently and transparently on the basis of new information in order to adapt quickly.\nThe actions by Air Canada illustrate this principle very well. Air Canada laid off 16,500 employees as a fast and direct response to a reduction of their flight schedule due to the decline of demand and border closures for non-residents. Recently, the federal government communicated the details of a wage subsidy package.  Right after, Air Canada announced it was immediately rehiring most of their people based on the 75 per cent wage subsidies promised by the government.\nAir Canada initially laid off thousands of employees when business dried up as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, but then hired them back when the Canadian government announced a wage subsidy program. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson\nIn disruption, operational challenges need solutions, cash management and liquidity need to be adjusted for the changes in demand and communications and leadership must be expanded into the digital space.\nIf companies haven\u2019t been online before, they likely are now. In a fast-changing marketplace, aggressively pushing new solutions into the market may help some companies. Many business issues resulting from disruption due to worldwide efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 will need quick fixes and solutions. They are also the beginning of new problems.\nReassessing long-term plans\nNext, businesses must reassess not only their plans for the year, but also on a longer-term basis. The exercise may reveal important insights. Resilience is valuable in crisis. However, just bouncing back from such a consequential worldwide event is not enough. We will likely see long-lasting changes on both the demand and supply side.\nShort term, we may see the gin distillery in town producing hand sanitizers as is happening in Toronto or the maker-space at the local university 3D-printing protective equipment as we\u2019re doing at the University of Guelph. This is a good moment for businesses to assess their capabilities and how they can be used to meet immediate needs or can be leveraged, upgraded or complemented with new technologies or partners.\nOver the long term, finding and pursuing new opportunities will drive change. Companies may now serve new, different customers. They may need to get out of their comfort zones and learn new skills.\nAnd in an online world, data strategies and analytics matter. Writing skills are as important as presentation skills. Cybersecurity becomes a strategic concern. Whatever the changes needed, change will become the new normal.\nReconfiguring and reinventing\nIt\u2019s critical that companies continuously move in the right direction as the pandemic shutdowns continue. Businesses that have change ingrained in their culture are likely to do better in uncertain times.\nChanging  consumption patterns as a result of the pandemic will make home fitness programs more popular in the future.(Shutterstock)\nA crisis like this brings new opportunities and should be a trigger to explore new directions. A recent study shows that sustaining innovations developed during a crisis often yields a positive impact in the long run as opposed to organizations that cut back innovation budgets.\nGovernment will invest more over the coming years to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19. How they direct this spending, whether it\u2019s aimed at restoring the old economy or triggering market changes, will have an impact on a business\u2019s outlook as well.\nWe are likely entering a time in which people change consumption patterns. Fitness solutions for home, home entertainment, people-tracking and data security, new health-care equipment and online education solutions, to name just a few, will be in higher demand.\nAll of these developments create many new opportunities for businesses.\nPandemic\nInnovation\nCoronavirus\nDisruption\nAir Canada\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus and the economy\nWant to write?\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 145,000 academics and researchers from 4,356 institutions.\nRegister now"}, {"Url": "https://weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/building-resilience-in-the-face-of-dynamic-disruption", "CluewebURLHash": "83D3C4971FD0473B134F15C46E3F06EA", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "These are the top risks for business in the post-COVID ...", "Snippet": "The \ue000business\ue001 \ue000landscape\ue001 will face greater uncertainty in the \ue000post\ue001-COVID period.

Foremost on their mind is their survival and building resilience. And not only in relation to ongoing pandemic impacts and their competitive positioning, but also recently unleashed cyber-attacks, catastrophic climate events and social unrest that demands workplace and community change.\nWhile many businesses have innovated and adapted to rapidly-changing circumstances - seizing market share in the process - not all have. Nor will all benefit from the expected economic recovery. Businesses must be ready for a disorderly shakeout during this volatile recovery period. And they will need to strengthen and constantly review their risk mitigation strategies to improve their resilience to future shocks.\nDisruption Is everywhere\nIndustry is facing disruption from all sides. And leaders need to closely watch three critical drivers of risk \u2013 political, technological and societal.\nOn the political side, business needs to be aware of the different trajectories of stimulus packages and how they may be skewed to particular sectors or business types along with the availability of credit. Small and medium-sized business, hard hit during the pandemic, may find the recovery cycle unkind as well. In the US alone, 43% of micro-, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) closed between January and April \u2013 and numerous others still face the potential of permanent closure.\nMany governments are also increasingly shifting towards protectionism in order to create more self-sufficient and self-sustaining economies. Partly in response to COVID-19, during which border closures, lockdowns and export restrictions choked extended supply chains, companies must keep an eye on shifts in domestic policies that focus on national security and self-sufficiency. Such policies could hamper access to foreign talent and investment, as well as future merger and acquisition opportunities.\nTechnological drivers are also accelerating and disrupting the business landscape. The pandemic has precipitated an unheralded tech revolution for big and small businesses alike. Rapid digitalization transformed social and work interactions overnight. E-commerce, virtual conferencing, gaming and streaming all underwent unprecedented growth. It has been estimated that worldwide internet usage in 2020 increased by 30% while e-commerce grew by upwards of 20%.\nThis rapid digitalization also has exponentially increased companies\u2019 cyber exposures and created more complex and potentially less secure networks. The Global Risks Report 2021, in fact, highlights the failure of cybersecurity measures as a top short-term risk. And throughout 2020, we\u2019ve seen increasing cyber-attacks on government agencies and companies globally \u2013 many leveraged the COVID-19 crisis to infiltrate networks. Globally, the attack volume doubled from the second half of 2019 to the first half of 2020.\nThis monumental shift could create potential catastrophic risks on a longer horizon. The hasty rush towards automation, in response to the need for efficiency and reduced on-site labour, may expose businesses to unforeseen financial and ethical risks \u2013 particularly with more socially activist consumers and workforces concerned about job losses and willing to take their talents elsewhere.\nSocietal drivers are also creating real pressure on industry. Businesses are facing enhanced societal scrutiny of their practices, particularly in relation to environmental, social and governance aspects of business performance (ESG) and climate change. These priority concerns are again reflected in this year\u2019s Risks Report, in which environmental risks dominate the high-likelihood, high-impact quadrant of the risk landscape.\nMore than ever, consumers, employees, and investors expect firms to reflect their values. This became apparent as the pandemic\u2019s longer-term health, social and economic impacts manifested, as well as in the response to global social justice movements such as Black Lives Matter (BLM). For example, last summer at the height of the BLM protests, thousands of businesses stopped advertising on social media platforms. Revenue and reputation risks, and ultimately long-term value risks, are emerging over employee diversity, job security and fair pay; outsourcing, gig-work and contracting; and climate action.\nWorkplace and health transformations\nThe pandemic has transformed the needs and demands of workers and workplaces \u2013 whether in company or home offices, manufacturing facilities, shops, hospitals, distribution centres or transport. Greater experience with remote working and flexible work hours is changing expectations of how, when and where employees will work. This is challenging how firms maintain company culture, creativity, identity and the motivation of their employees.\nThis also has big implications for the health and well-being of employees and for society at large. Firms may suffer from productivity losses and need to more carefully manage employee safety and security challenges. This was certainly true in the early days of the pandemic, where surveys showed that 55% of employees were less productive and engaged due to remote working.\nOn a broader societal level, an ongoing global mental health crisis exacerbated by the pandemic and associated lockdowns has produced staggering impacts. Lost schooling, altered work conditions, job losses, isolation and the economic downturn have put all ages at risk of higher rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and lost productivity. The costs of worsening mental health could rise to as much as $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years in just the US alone.\nResponding to truly global risks\nBeyond the public health challenges of the current crisis, governments, international agencies and companies have all struggled in multiple dimensions with their response to this global risk.\nAll organizations can learn much from the past year. However, instead of preparing for the last crisis, they should seek to uncover transferable lessons that could apply to a range of complex, emerging threats.\nConsider what was accomplished when the private and public sector came together during the crisis. We saw:\n\u00b7 The rapid and unprecedented development and distribution of multiple vaccines.\n\u00b7 A repurposing of supply chains and manufacturing processes to develop PPE and critical medical equipment.\n\u00b7 The ability to shift to remote and new ways of working in even the most heavily-regulated industries.\nThis capability to act with single-minded purpose needs to be institutionalized \u2013 the pursuit of national and global resilience is bigger than any one organization and any one risk.\nMore collaboration across society \u2013 the public and private sectors, communities, and NGOs \u2013 is essential. It will involve developing stimulus programs that incentivize sustainable recovery efforts that include green infrastructure and clean energy projects. It will require partnerships between the public and private sectors to upskill workers for an exploding digital economy. And it ought to necessitate the creation of new pandemic and emerging risk insurance mechanisms that could help stabilize companies during extended crisis events.\nTo build and maintain resilience, it is important that business keeps an eye on potentially high impact events in the short-term and on the longer-term landscape. And then be prepared to respond effectively, creatively and collaboratively. This is vital for businesses and the global community to sustainably navigate the risks and opportunities ahead, strengthen their resilience to future shocks and progress towards long-term prosperity.\nLicense and Republishing\nWritten by\nCarolina Klint, Risk Management Leader, Europe, Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC)\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum."}, {"Url": "https://euruni.edu/blog/how-has-covid-19-impacted-international-business", "CluewebURLHash": "E8DA062525516004B47BAED049F48661", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "How has COVID-19 Impacted International Business?", "Snippet": "4.5 / 5 ( 13 votes ) Over 200 countries worldwide have reported cases of COVID-\ue00019\ue001 since early 2020.

The rapid and deadly spread of the virus has necessitated national lockdowns, which have had a devastating effect on countries\u2019 economies. As more people are vaccinated, and we start to look forward to life after a global pandemic, it\u2019s time to take stock of how the virus has impacted international business.\nWith businesses in every sector forced to close and most of the remaining workforce telecommuting, how has the global business market changed? Let\u2019s take a look.\n1. Hospitality & travel were among the hardest-hit industries.\nCOVID-19 has had the most significant impact on businesses in the hospitality and tourism sectors. Hotels, pubs, restaurants, and clubs worldwide have been forced to close their doors to guests to prevent the spread of the virus.\nMillions of jobs were cut, many independent companies went under, and billions of US dollars were lost due to canceled flights, vacations, and business trips.\nIn May 2021, the UK announced its traffic light system for international travel, and though thousands of people have already taken advantage of it and been on vacation to countries on the \u201cgreen list,\u201d it is estimated that international travel will not return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2025.\n2. Unemployment rates have risen.\nBefore the pandemic, global employment rates were relatively steady. However, since the emergence of this virus, the number of people out of work worldwide has risen exponentially. In 2020, the numbers looked like this:\n4.9% (UK)\n7.3% (EU average)\n14.8% (USA), the highest unemployment has been since records began in 1948\nA year later, new job opportunities in Europe are still scarce compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, vacancies in Australia are back to where they were in 2019.\n3. Impact on international stock markets\nThe world\u2019s biggest stock exchanges, including the FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nikkei, were hit hard during the first few months of the pandemic. Since the first vaccine was announced in November 2020, the major Asian and American stock markets are back on track, but the British FTSE is still in the red.\nHowever, the impact of COVID-19 upon international business has not been 100% negative.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, global pharmaceutical companies involved in developing the vaccine have seen significant rises in their share prices over the last 12 months. In 2020, Moderna was by far the biggest beneficiary; its share value rose by a massive 715.5%, outstripping its nearest competitor, Novavax, by over 200%.\nLooking beyond the medical/pharmaceutical industry, a survey of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) carried out by Globalization Partners and CFO Research identified three positive trends for large corporations looking to expand internationally. These were:\n1. Expansion plans are going ahead, despite the pandemic.\nThe majority of respondents made no or minimal changes to their expansion plans when COVID-19 hit. 45% of the CFOs surveyed said they are continuing with their development plans despite the pandemic or delaying their plans by less than a year. A further 9% reported they would be expanding their operations in or very soon after 2021.\nNorth America is the number-one market that organizations in other locations want to crack. The Asia-Pacific region (excluding China) comes in at a close second. This is because newcomers in those areas have the chance to capture a significant share of the market. Respondents also cited sales expansion, diversified investments, and a larger talent pool as reasons they wanted to expand into these regions.\nOther benefits of global expansion include:\nIncreased revenue\nExtended product lifespan\nNew audience\nLess competition\nEnhanced reputation\n2. By making remote working a necessity, COVID-19 has created a more diverse and creative workforce.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has rapidly accelerated the rate of digitization within global companies. The shift from onsite to remote working has forced organizations to implement new practices that allow colleagues to communicate and teams to continue working together from home.\nLearn more about the digital transformation process and how the multinational heating technology company Vaillant responded to this challenge during the pandemic by checking out some of our other recent articles.\nIn 2021, government restrictions still apply in many countries, and they vary from region to region, but as the majority of us begin to emerge cautiously from strict lockdowns, the question is whether or not employers will continue to offer remote/flexible working in a post-pandemic world.\n83% of respondents to the Globalization Partners/CFO Research survey said they thought a global, remote workforce was the solution to the challenges of a world in confinement\u2014and beyond.\nIn May 2020, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, announced his employees could work from home \u201cforever\u201d if that was what they preferred.\nThe pros and cons of remote working have been disputed since it became a widespread practice during the first wave of the pandemic. However, the majority of studies show that a dispersed workforce is more productive. Plus, now that location is no longer a barrier to employment, organizations embracing global, remote working are building more diverse teams, expanding their skill sets, and promoting creativity, all of which are net positives for any business!\n3. Employee wellbeing is now a top priority for organization heads.\nHealth & safety beat new business strategies, increased revenue, and reduced costs to become the most important consideration during the planning stage of a foreign expansion. This has and will likely continue to lead to more consideration of employee needs, and provide opportunities for workers to grow and spend more time on personal development than they might have in a pre-pandemic work environment.\nAre you interested in learning more about what it takes to be the CFO of an international business?

The dollar value of world merchandise  exports in\u00a02019 fell by 3% to US$ 18.89 trillion.\nThe value of commercial services  exports rose 2% to US$ 6.03  trillion in\u00a02019.\nThe wide range  of possibilities for the predicted decline is explained by the unprecedented  nature of this health crisis and the uncertainty around its precise economic  impact. But WTO economists believe the decline will likely exceed the trade slump  brought on by the global financial crisis of\u00a02008\u201109 (Chart 1).\nEstimates of  the expected recovery in 2021 are equally uncertain, with outcomes depending  largely on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy  responses.\n\"This  crisis is first and foremost a health crisis which has forced governments to  take unprecedented measures to protect people\u2019s lives,\" WTO  Director-General Roberto Azev\u00eado said.\n\"The  unavoidable declines in trade and output will have painful consequences for  households and businesses, on top of the human suffering caused by the disease  itself.\u201d\n\u201cThe immediate  goal is to bring the pandemic under control and mitigate the economic damage to  people, companies and countries.

But a rapid, vigorous rebound is possible. Decisions  taken now will determine the future shape of the recovery and global growth prospects.  We need to lay the foundations for a strong, sustained and socially inclusive  recovery. Trade will be an important ingredient here, along with fiscal and  monetary policy. Keeping markets open and predictable, as well as fostering a  more generally favourable business environment, will be critical to spur the  renewed investment we will need. And if countries work together, we will see a  much faster recovery than if each country acts alone.\"\nChart 1 - World merchandise  trade volume, 2000\u20112022\nIndex, 2015=100\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 WTO Secretariat.\nTrade was already slowing in 2019  before the virus struck, weighed down by trade tensions and slowing economic  growth. World merchandise trade registered a slight decline for the year of \u20110.1%  in volume terms after rising by 2.9% in the previous year. Meanwhile, the  dollar value of world merchandise exports in 2019 fell by 3% to US$ 18.89  trillion.\nIn contrast, world commercial  services trade increased in 2019, with exports in dollar terms rising by 2% to  US$ 6.03 trillion. The pace of expansion was slower than in 2018, when services  trade increased by 9%. Details on merchandise and commercial services trade  developments are presented in Appendix Tables 1 through 4 and can be downloaded  from the WTO Data Portal at data.wto.org.\nOutlook for trade in 2020 and 2021\nThe economic shock of the COVID-19  pandemic inevitably invites comparisons to the global financial crisis of 2008-09.  These crises are similar in certain respects but very different in others. As  in 2008-09, governments have again intervened with monetary and fiscal policy  to counter the downturn and provide temporary income support to businesses and  households. But restrictions on movement and social distancing to slow the  spread of the disease mean that labour supply, transport and travel are today directly  affected in ways they were not during the financial crisis. Whole sectors of national  economies have been shut down, including hotels, restaurants, non-essential retail  trade, tourism and significant shares of manufacturing. Under these  circumstances, forecasting requires strong assumptions about the progress of  the disease and a greater reliance on estimated rather than reported data.\nFuture trade performance as  summarized in Table 1 is thus best understood in terms of two distinct  scenarios (1): (1) a relatively  optimistic scenario, with a sharp drop in trade followed by a recovery starting  in the second half of 2020, and (2) a more pessimistic scenario with a steeper  initial decline and a more prolonged and incomplete recovery.\nThese should be viewed as  explorations of different possible trajectories for the crisis rather than  specific predictions of future developments. Actual outcomes could easily be  outside of this range, either on the upside or the downside.\nUnder the optimistic scenario, the  recovery will be strong enough to bring trade close to its pre-pandemic trend,  represented by the dotted yellow line in Chart 1, while the pessimistic  scenario only envisages a partial recovery. Given the level of uncertainties, it  is worth emphasizing that the initial trajectory does not necessarily determine  the subsequent recovery. For example, one could see a sharp decline in 2020 trade  volumes along the lines of the pessimistic scenario, but an equally dramatic  rebound, bringing trade much closer to the line of the optimistic scenario by  2021 or 2022.\nAfter the financial crisis of 2008-09,  trade never returned to its previous trend, represented by the dotted grey line  in the same chart. A strong rebound is more likely if businesses and consumers  view the pandemic as a temporary, one-time shock. In this case, spending on  investment goods and consumer durables could resume at close to previous levels  once the crisis abates. On the other hand, if the outbreak is prolonged and/or  recurring uncertainty becomes pervasive, households and business are likely to  spend more cautiously.\nUnder both scenarios, all regions will  suffer double-digit declines in exports and imports in 2020, except for \u201cOther  regions\u201d (which is comprised of Africa, Middle East and Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) including associate and former member States). This  relatively small estimated decline in exports stems from the fact that countries  from these regions rely heavily on exports of energy products, demand for which  is relatively unaffected by fluctuating prices. If the pandemic is brought  under control and trade starts to expand again, most regions could record  double-digit rebounds in 2021 of around 21% in the optimistic scenario and 24% in  the pessimistic scenario \u2013 albeit from a much lower base (Table 1). The extent  of uncertainty is very high, and it is well within the realm of possibilities  that for both 2020 and 2021 the outcomes could be above or below these  outcomes.\nChart 2 - Ratio of world  merchandise trade growth to world GDP growth, 1990\u20112020\n% change and ratio\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 WTO Secretariat for trade and consensus  estimates for historical GDP. Projections for GDP based on scenarios simulated  with WTO Global Trade Model.\nTwo other aspects that distinguish the current downturn  from the financial crisis are the role of value chains and trade in services.  Value chain disruption was already an issue when COVID\u201119 was mostly confined  to China. It remains a salient factor now that the disease has become more  widespread. Trade is likely to fall more steeply in sectors characterized by  complex value chain linkages, particularly in electronics and automotive  products. According to the OECD Trade In Value Added (TiVa) database, the share  of foreign value added in electronics exports was around 10% for the United  States, 25% for China, more than 30% for Korea, greater than 40% for Singapore  and more than 50% for Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam. Imports of key production  inputs are likely to be interrupted by social distancing, which caused  factories to temporarily close in China and which is now happening in Europe  and North America. However, it is also useful to recall that complex supply  chain disruption can occur as a result of localized disasters such hurricanes,  tsunamis, and other economic disruptions. Managing supply chain disruption is a  challenge for both global and local enterprises and requires a  risk-versus-economic efficiency calculation on the part of every company.\nServices trade may be the component of world trade most  directly affected by COVID-19 through the imposition of transport and travel  restrictions and the closure of many retail and hospitality establishments.  Services are not included in the WTO's merchandise trade forecast, but most  trade in goods would be impossible without them (e.g. transport). Unlike goods,  there are no inventories of services to be drawn down today and restocked at a  later stage. As a result, declines in services trade during the pandemic may be  lost forever. Services are also interconnected, with air transport enabling an  ecosystem of other cultural, sporting and recreational activities. However,  some services may benefit from the crisis. This is true of information  technology services, demand for which has boomed as companies try to enable  employees to work from home and people socialise remotely.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on international  trade is not yet visible in most trade data but some timely and leading  indicators may already yield clues about the extent of the slowdown and how it  compares to earlier crises. Indices of new export orders derived from  Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) are particularly useful in this regard. The  JP Morgan global PMI for March showed export orders in manufacturing sinking to  43.3 relative to  a baseline value of 50, and new services export business dropping to 35.5, suggesting a severe downturn.\nChart 3: New export orders from  purchasing managers indices, Jan. 2008 \u2013 Mar. 2020\nIndex, base=50\nNote:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Values greater than 50 indicate expansion  while values less than 50 denote contraction.\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 IHS Markit.\nTrade developments in 2019\nGlobal merchandise trade stalled in  2019 under the weight of persistent trade tensions, with trade turning down  toward the end of the year. This is illustrated by Chart 4, which shows  seasonally-adjusted quarterly merchandise trade volumes as measured by the  average of exports and imports. Trade in the fourth quarter was down by 1.0%  year-on-year and by 1.2% compared to the third quarter of 2019. The latter is  equivalent to a 4.6% decline on an annualized basis.\nChart 4: World merchandise  exports and imports, 2015Q1\u20112019Q4\nIndex 2015Q1=100 and year\u2011on\u2011year\u00a0% change\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 WTO Secretariat and UNCTAD.\nChart 5 shows seasonally\u2011adjusted  quarterly merchandise export and import volumes by region. South America and  Other Regions posted large declines in exports in the second half of 2019,  while Europe, North America, and Asia experienced either minimal growth or mild  declines. Import volumes for South America experienced a sharp decline throughout  2019, with Europe, North America, and Asia also ending the year lower. Only  imports for Other Regions continued rising with year\u2011on\u2011year growth for each  quarter of between 1.9% and 4.9% in 2019.\nChart 5: Merchandise exports and  imports by region, 2015Q1\u20112019Q4\n(Volume index, 2015Q1=100)\n1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refers  to South and Central America and the Caribbean.\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other  Regions comprise Africa, Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent  States, including associate and former member States.\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 WTO and UNCTAD.\nAlthough services are not subject to tariffs in the way  that goods are, world commercial services trade still slowed sharply in value  terms in 2019 after recording strong increases in the previous two years. This  is illustrated by Chart 6, which shows growth in the dollar value of services  exports by major categories. The category of \u201cOther commercial services\u201d  recorded the strongest growth with a 3% increase in 2019, followed by travel  and goods-related services at 1%. A 0.5% drop in the value of transport service  may have reflected weakness in goods trade as a result of trade frictions  between major economies.\nMonthly, quarterly and annual trade statistics can  be downloaded from the WTO Data Portal at data.wto.org(2).\nChart 6:  Growth in the value of commercial services exports by category, 2015\u20112019\n%  change in US$ values\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 WTO Secretariat, UNCTAD and ITC.\nTable 1: Merchandise trade volume and real GDP, 2018-2021 1\nAnnual % change\n1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Figures  for 2020 and 2021 are projections.\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Average  of exports and imports.\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other  regions comprise Africa, Middle East and Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) including associate and former member States.\nSource:\u00a0\u00a0 WTO Secretariat for trade and consensus  estimates for historical GDP.

Whitman School of Management, told CO\u2014.\nCrisis precedents\nThe coronavirus pandemic is vastly different from other crisis situations, Wimer said. \u201cIt took consumers about six weeks to start spending in the retail sector after 9/11; about six months post the [2008] crash. Right now, there is so much uncertainty that we have no idea when consumer spending will bounce back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really depends on how the government continues to place restrictions that help flatten the curve and when these restrictions will be lifted. Being optimistic, the third quarter for retail should bounce back if restrictions are ended by May 31.\u201d\nStill, \u201cthe revenue being lost right now is not going to be made up, so many retailers will have a huge issues with meeting loan obligations,\u201d Wimer said. \u201cThere will also be some supply chain issues as there will be backup of product, which may mean [retailers] cancel the orders with manufacturers.\u201d\nAdapting and potential silver linings\nThe virus has fueled an uptick in online shopping, which still accounts for a mere 10.7% of total U.S. retail sales. According to a recent survey of 1,000 consumers by brand protection firm Red Points, 58% of Americans have purchased more items online compared to in-store than they normally would have, due to fears of the coronavirus.\nThat shift could lead to changed buying behavior post-pandemic, turning longtime e-commerce holdouts into converts, such as older shoppers who are now most at risk, according to eMarketer.\nWhat\u2019s more, nascent retail models could gain momentum. \u201cPost-2008 saw the rise of off-price retail and value retailers,\u201d Wimer said. \u201cWill the consumer decide that they are okay with not shopping as much for new items? Will this mean that rental or consignment retail will take off?\u201d\nGlobal consumer demand has been adversely affected by both anxiety and the absence of in-person engagement.\nSusan Scafidi, founder and director, Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University\nRay Wimer, assistant professor of the retail practice, Syracuse University\u2019s Martin J. Whitman School of Management. \u2014 Syracuse University\nThe hospitality picture: \u2018We could see fewer people wanting to travel overall\u2019\nThe health crisis is costing the U.S. hotel industry a reported $1.4 billion a week in what\u2019s shaping up to be an unprecedented sector hit, as occupancy rates plummet.\n\u201cHotel demand will be down sharply in the near term as the public puts off traveling because of coronavirus fears and regulations that limit public gatherings,\u201d Peter Trombetta, Moody\u2019s lodging and cruise analyst, told CO\u2014.\nMoody\u2019s March report downgraded its outlook for the U.S. lodging and cruise industry from stable to negative, forecasting 2020 earnings declines among companies rated in the sector, compared to about 5% growth in 2019. The North American consumer accounts for more than half of the revenue for all lodging and cruise companies, according to a report from the ratings agency.\nOn March 17, the hospitality industry asked the Trump Administration for $150 billion in aid due to the virus, just as Marriott set plans to furlough thousands of hotel workers.\nCrisis precedents\n\u201cThe impact to hotel companies could be greater than after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when we saw people still wanted to travel but decided to stay closer to home,\u201d Trombetta said. \u201cWith the spread of COVID-19 and the CDC\u2019s advice to maintain social distancing, we could see fewer people want to travel overall,\u201d he said.\n\u201c Hyatt [for example] reported increased near term group cancellations and slower business travel, which we expect to be the case for all hotel companies that cater to the business traveler including Marriott and Hilton ,\u201d he said. \u201cBut slowing leisure demand is following quickly, which makes no hotel company immune to the impact from COVID-19.\u201d\nThe large hotel companies generate the bulk of their revenue through franchise and management fees, Trombetta said. \u201cThese fees are earned on the hotel\u2019s revenue that is generated. If that hotel earns less revenue because occupancy is down, there is no real way that the hotel company can offset that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf revenue drops enough, the companies would look to cut costs and spending and also suspend share repurchases or even dividends.\u201d\nAdapting and potential silver linings\nWhile the hotel market\u2019s recovery from past crises such as 9/11 nationally, the SARS breakout in Toronto and Zika breakout in Miami took 14 to 25 months, CBRE points to \u201cone cause for hope for fast recovery,\u201d according to a report from the commercial real estate firm. \u201cChinese hotels had nearly fully recovered from the March 2003 SARS breakout by July of that year when SARS was contained,\u201d the report said.\nCoronavirus Guide for Small Businesses\nCO\u2014 is working to bring you the best resources and information to help you navigate this challenging time.

COVID-19 has sparked diners\u2019 exodus and local government-imposed closures. In addition, the sector\u2019s high rent and labor costs and tight profit margins \u201cwill redefine the landscape of what restaurants exist in local markets and towns across the country,\u201d Thoresen said.\nCrisis precedents\nDuring national crises \u2014 like 9/11 and the financial meltdown of 2008 \u2014 when consumer confidence is rattled, \u201cwe tend to see people trading down in terms of their spending,\u201d Thoresen said. \u201cWhat\u2019s drastically different in this scenario is that there\u2019s no opportunity to trade down in the restaurant sector,\u201d he said. \u201cSpending at restaurants is going to grocery stores.\u201d\nAdapting and potential silver linings\nThe grocery sector has been notoriously late to the e-commerce movement, still accounting for only 2% to 5% of the $743 billion U.S. grocery retail market, according to CBRE Research.\nBut as a newly sequestered nation flocks online for food, downloading delivery apps like Instacart, Walmart Grocery and Shipt in record numbers, online grocery shopping could finally take flight.\nAt the same time, national full-service chains in pause-mode could seize the moment to evaluate the performance of their restaurant fleets, Thoresen said.\nBig restaurant chains like Denny\u2019s, Applebee\u2019s and TGI Fridays, \u201cwhich have more resources to weather the storm, will use this crisis as a time to evaluate what locations they should shut down,\u201d he said.\nSusan Scafidi, founder and director, Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University. \u2014 Fordham University\nThe fashion fallout: \u2018the need for a spring wardrobe refresh has all but disappeared\u2019\n\u201cGlobal consumer demand has been adversely affected by both anxiety and the absence of in-person engagement,\u201d Susan Scafidi, founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University, told CO\u2014. \u201c But even if consumers turn to online shopping to while away hours in quarantine, key links in fashion's supply chain have been seriously impacted by the coronavirus.\u201d\nAccording to the World Trade Organization, over 37% of the world's textile exports come from China, up from 10% in 2000, and Italy is a global center of luxury manufacturing, she said. \u201cWhile China appears to have contained the virus and Italy's lockdown has thus far had an exception for manufacturing, illness could still cause looms and sewing machines to fall silent,\u201d Scafidi said.\n\u201cFashion is a super-powerful industry, with speed and flexibility far beyond most categories of consumer goods, but its kryptonite is invisibility \u2014 and the practice of social distancing has just rendered most of us invisible to one another,\u201d she said. \u201cWith social and professional gatherings canceled and telecommuting becoming the new normal, the need for a spring wardrobe refresh has all but disappeared.\u201d\nCrisis precedents\n\u201cThe coronavirus crisis is unlike previous market disruptions that allowed conspicuous consumption to be recast quickly as a virtue,\u201d Scafidi said.\n\u201cAfter 9/11, President Bush encouraged America to go shopping; after the 2008 crash, [Vogue editor] Anna Wintour invited us all to Fashion's Night Out. Today, officials are encouraging stores to close and consumers to stay home,\u201d she said. \u201cWall Street isn't optimistic about 7th Avenue \u2014 over the past month, stock prices of major fashion companies have declined 30% or even 40%.\u201d\nAdapting and potential silver linings\nAt some point, however, \u201chumanity will recover and change out of pajamas,\u201d Scafidi said.\nThe health crisis could spark an uptick in brands looking to U.S. apparel production. \u201cWe may a see resurgence in local manufacturing, driven not only by the coronavirus crisis but also by trade wars and a need to diversify supply chains,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMuch as DVF [Diane von Furstenberg] and the late Liz Claiborne taught women what to wear to work when our foremothers left home for the office en masse in the 1970s, designers will step up to the new challenge of work-from-home chic,\u201d Scafidi said. \u201cAnd for the risk adverse, there will be designer facemasks and new developments in antimicrobial fabric \u2014 a literal silver lining,\u201d Scafidi said. \u201cWhere there's life, there will be fashion.\u201d\nResources\nBusinesses in the retail, hospitality, foodservice and fashion sectors can turn to these sources for industry-specific information and guidance to navigate COVID-19:\nRetail\nThe National Retail Federation: Coronavirus Resource for Retailers\neMarketer: How Marketers Can Adapt to Event Cancellations Brought on by Coronavirus\nRetail Dive\nHospitality\nAmerican Hotel and Lodging Association: COVID-19: Prevention and Preparedness Resources\nHospitality Net\nHotel Business\nFoodservice\nThe National Restaurant Association: Coronavirus Information and Resources\nNational Restaurant News\nThe Food Marketing Institute\nFashion\nThe National Council of Fashion Designers of America: CFDA Resources for Navigating COVID-19 Coronavirus Business Challenges\nSourcing Journal\nAmerican Apparel and Footwear Association\nTo stay on top of all the news impacting your small business, go here for all of our latest small business news and updates.\nCO\u2014is committed to helping you start, run and grow your small business.

Randall S. Kroszner , Austan D. Goolsbee and Raghuram G. Rajan discussed the critical economic questions facing the world amid the COVID-19 crisis.\nModerated by Kathleen Hays of Bloomberg, the conversation ranged from the possible paths and pitfalls for recovery, to how economic sectors such as manufacturing and hospitality will fare, to concerns about incurring debt.\nWhile much uncertainty remains, the Chicago Booth economists shared their perspectives and concerns around key questions facing business leaders, policymakers, employees, and families worldwide. Portions of the first event are highlighted below.\nBy Brian Wallheimer\nMay 11, 2020\nCOVID-19 and the Global Economic Outlook\nWatch on\nProfs. Raghuram Rajan, Austan Goolsbee and Randall Kroszner (counter-clockwise from top left) discuss the impacts of COVID-19 with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hays.\nVideo by Chicago Booth\nHow have stay-at-home orders affected economies?\nWith tens of millions of unemployment claims in the United States, as well as more than 100 million jobs lost in India, global economies are suffering.\n\u201cWe sent everyone home. We didn't allow people to go out and buy anything,\u201d said Kroszner, a former governor of the Federal Reserve System who serves as Booth\u2019s deputy dean for executive programs and Norman R. Bobins Professor of Economics. \u201cSo it's not a surprise that you get this astonishing contraction in demand and production.\u201d\nHoping for a \u2018reverse check mark\u2019\nA former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and a member of President Barack Obama's cabinet, Goolsbee warned that a traditional recession recovery is a slow process.\n\u201cWe could go from less than 4% unemployment to 15% in a short period of time. In a normal recovery, the unemployment rate only goes down 1 to 1.5 percentage points a year,\u201d said Goolsbee, the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics.\n\u201cHopefully there is the possibility of a rapid recovery\u2014maybe a reverse check mark where you went down, and then you came back at least part of the way at kind of a rapid pace. We absolutely have to do everything we can to go in that direction because the alternative is much more grim.\u201d\nShould the government bail out everyone?\nSome sectors, such as manufacturing, can likely come back quickly, said Rajan, who previously served as the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and the chief economist and director of research at the International Monetary Fund. Others, however, will take much longer to fully recover\u2014if they ever do at all. Those differences need to be taken into account when considering government interventions.\n\u201cOne of the decisions we have to make soon is how the government spends that money,\u201d said Rajan, the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be expensive to keep the hospitality industry alive for a year or more until people feel comfortable going out again.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the decisions we have to make soon is how the government spends that money.\u201d\n\u2014Prof. Raghuram G. Rajan\nWhich sectors might expand or contract?\nKroszner said that an effective recovery strategy should consider which types of jobs will be available in the coming years and how to ensure that employees have the skills to fill them.\n\u201cWell-intentioned programs that are trying to freeze things as they were in February are going to make it more difficult for people to find new positions,\u201d Kroszner said. \u201cAt some point we're going to have to allow for a transition. We've got to get the support structures right to get people moving into new sectors.\u201d\nRestarting regular economic activity\nGoolsbee said that the shortest path to recovery is by spending on health care and testing.\n\u201cThe most important thing you can do for the economy is slow the spread of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you stimulate the economy, because people have to feel safe leaving their homes. We\u2019ve now got six countries that have gotten out of lockdown and are going back to normal. Each of them has done extensive testing to get the rate of the spread of the virus low enough that it peters itself out.\u201d\n\u201cThe most important thing you can do for the economy is slow the spread of the virus.\u201d\n\u2014Prof. Austan D. Goolsbee\nPaying off debt\nGoolsbee said there\u2019s no alternative to adding to the debt, but we should be considering the long-term implications for paying off these debts.\n\u201cNobody in June of 1944 questioned how to pay for D-Day and keep it revenue neutral,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look post-World War II, we went through a period of heavy taxation to pay back the debts that we accumulated. It's what we should have done, and spreading that over time is better than trying to pay for it all at once. The same is true here.\u201d\nRajan added that these burdens could also affect future investment.\n\u201cThis was the debt overhang problem that many emerging markets had,\u201d Rajan said. \u201cWe should be wary when we have lots of debt and potential taxation down the line. A lot of investors are going to be worrying about where it's going to fall, and that could be perhaps very damaging for investment and growth.\u201d\n\u2014This story was first published by Chicago Booth.

Many organizations are already taking \u201cno regret\u201d actions to emerge from the pandemic stronger. These leaders are facing the crisis with a spirit of reinvention\u2014accelerating digital transformation, establishing variable cost structures, and implementing agile operations.\nBut in recent weeks, the landscape has changed, with the pandemic continuing to peak in some markets and returning in others. Amidst this uncertainty, the steps for reopening and reinvention remain unchanged, but companies must now consider how the pandemic\u2019s progress, strength or recurrence in different geographies is impacting their recovery strategies.\nCompanies must outmaneuver uncertainty by course correcting, again and again as circumstances change.

The crisis is fundamentally changing how and what consumers buy and is accelerating immense structural changes in the consumer goods industry, for example. Once the immediate threat of the virus has passed, companies will need to consider the impact of these changes on the way we design, communicate, build and run the experiences that people need and want.\nWith these emerging new behaviors, organizations have an opportunity to accelerate the pivot to digital commerce, by expanding existing offerings and creating new lines of service, like the retailers rallying to provide \u201ccontactless\u201d delivery and curb-side pick-up services for consumers.

As business owners and employees navigate the new normal, here are some of the ways they have adapted to stay operating amid a global pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has delivered an indiscriminate blow to businesses as everything from small restaurants to multinational corporations have been forced to change how they do work amid a series of shutdown orders to help stem the tide of the virus. They have also had to implement these massive organizational changes in just a matter of weeks to attempt to stay afloat -- with many companies shifting to full-scale working from home plans and others going all in on delivery.\n\"I\u2019ve done a couple of webinars with groups of companies. As of about a week and a half ago they weren\u2019t doing anything, there wasn\u2019t anything different,\" Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and the director of Wharton's Center for Human Resources, told ABC News.\nMORE: Waffle House Index, the unofficial barometer for how bad things are, dips into the red\nWhile many companies have adapted to the new realities of a pandemic economy, Cappelli predicts, \"the big test will come when it goes on for more than a couple of weeks.\"\nStephen Yang/Reuters, FILE\nA sign explaining that a bookstore will remain closed, due to the outbreak of the coronavi... Read More\nSome industries, like airlines, have not been able to find their footing as ridership has plummeted amid the crisis, leading them to project massive losses. And millions of workers have already filed for unemployment, even as companies scramble to hire workers to accommodate the new realities of the socially distanced and increasingly delivery economy.\n\"Right now, I think companies are getting a lot out of the good citizenship of their employees,\" he added.\nMoreover, in recent months, Cappelli said there has been a shift in the way employers regard their workers, and it has been in vogue for business leaders to refer to employees as \"stakeholders\" not just workers. Cappelli predicts this health crisis is one of the first obstacles to put that to the test.\nSo far, \"we\u2019ve seen more companies carrying employees for longer than expected if this had been a financial downturn versus a health-related one,\" he said.\nTeleworking takes over everything from meetings to yoga classes\nSocial-distancing measures and government-mandated stay-in-place orders have led to entire companies moving their workforce to working from home, leading to a skyrocketing demand for video conferencing software such as Zoom.\n\"The world is not going to be the same as it was in December,\" Janine Pelosi, Zoom's chief marketing officer, told ABC News. \"Where that levels out, none of us really know. But working remotely, and using video conferencing, is not going to go away.

From accelerated digitization of the workplace with millions suddenly working from home,\u00a0to manufacturers pivoting and actually changing their products to help the world cope with new and sudden needs, never before seen or experienced phenomena are happening in businesses around the Globe, with analogies that have been made to both the Great Recession of 2008 and World War II.\nClick to access all the survey data in charts & graphs and read The Future of Business Post COVID-19: A Report from Informa Connect\nWe at Informa Connect have a mission to provide access to extraordinary people and exceptional insight. Our parent company, Informa plc, is a global business with a network of trusted brands in specialist markets across more than 30 countries, and a member of the FTSE 100. We are well known for our conferences, however we are also at our core a digital content creator. From videos to white papers, our content taps into a network of millions of professional and commercial customers.\nWith the spirit of our mission in mind we decided to do a deep dive into how COVID-19 is impacting our global customers so we could share this crucial data with them and with you, the reader. Why are people in sectors from the life sciences to maritime innovating?\u00a0Where are they doing it? How successful are their efforts?\u00a0We surveyed our customers, our speakers and thought leader contacts of Informa Connect, to ask them how their organizations are responding to the crisis. Our initial research told us that the most important changes happening right now in organizations fell into these categories: how organizations manage crises, both before and after COVID-19; the shift to online and working from home or other changes in the workplace;\u00a0how companies are trying to be relevant to their customers; and lastly, how they have applied innovations with new business initiatives or products and creating efficiencies.\u00a0We\u2019re offering our exclusive findings here, in this first-of-its-kind multi-sector report on The Future of Business Post COVID-19.\nAn April 30 Savanta survey of US consumers gives the mind-blowing figure: \u201cjust 24% of respondents plan to go about life the same as before once we emerge from lockdown\u201d, so business innovation is crucial right now. McKinsey recently stated that \u201cIt\u2019s possible that entirely new businesses and business models will emerge from the crisis\u201d and that has indeed been proven in our survey. Organizations have been poised to digitally transform their workforces for some time; right now is a turning point, with \u201ctrials by fire\u201d bringing in both interesting and unforeseen data.\nOur survey results show that COVID-19 has indeed been a disruptor, with 65% of respondents reporting negative financial impact to their businesses, but in many cases companies have been able to turn this disruption into a positive force, by innovating and accelerating the creation of new products as well as cultivating deeper relationships with their customers.\nThe list of new products and services that survey respondees shared with us were astounding in their diversity: from one company who developed a new Mat\u00e9 drink \"to give energy to people in stressful situations\" during the crisis, to a maritime organization that developed remote auditing of vessels, to another organization that purchased their own factory to meet the demands of their clients.\nIn the life sciences, one organization, a telehealth provider, introduced mental health and wellness services,\u00a0a second explained that they were in the process of \"certifying the first 3D printing mask in the world\", a third \"designed and developed Study Protocols for the COVID-19 response in Africa\" and a fourth was developing peptides related to a COVID-19 treatment.\nFinancial services innovated on such initiatives as: \"a business loan for borrowers whose income is not based on salary checkoff\",\u00a0a \"Customer Portal Bank on wheels\"\u00a0and new \"low cost lending products for businesses impacted by coronavirus\" with a \"dedicated phone line for vulnerable customers\".\nThe majority of companies that shared their new initiatives directly had stories that involved either pivoting their manufacturing to produce PPE or sanitizer, or new internal and external digital initiatives. One particularly productive organization announced that \"all technology advancements that were planned for 2020/21 have been moved forward and completed during this period\".\nThere were many new consumer products that came out of the crisis, too. Individuals described software platforms they had developed - from one that allows employees to access and engage with their peers while doing virtual workouts, yoga and healthy eating sessions at home, to another platform \"that helps users safely declare if they are fit to fly, fit to shop\"; one company even developed \"live online theatre performances\". There was one response that simply, and powerfully, summed up the situation: \"We went digital\".\nThe Future of Business Post COVID-19: Key Insights\n87% of respondents feel that the crisis has impacted the need for digital transformation in business.\n34% developed a new product, service or business initiative in response to the crisis; 40% introduced initiatives to better connect with customers;26% accelerated development of an already planned product.\n47% of respondents put in place a dedicated crisis response team to respond to COVID-19.\n85% believe their organizations can cope with at least some of their staff continuing to work from home. 43% believe their companies can cope with large numbers of staff doing so.\n\"Increasingly people from different disciplines across an organization or being gathered together to solve problems, rather than represent a singular division of the business.\"\nShawn Dickerson, SVP Marketing, KeyedIn, Five Ways the Future of Work is Changing Due to Coronavirus\nOur 2020 Informa Connect survey \u201cThe Future of Business Post COVID-19\u201d comprises the responses and insights of 1495 participants drawn from a wide range of Informa Connect customers, event speakers and thought leaders. In the spirit of Dickerson\u2019s observation, we\u2019ve done a first-of-its-kind multi-sector, multi-disciplinary study. Drawn from global companies, participants represent the sectors of: finance, life sciences (pharma and biotech), marketing and innovation, human resources, maritime and energy. The survey consisted of 16 questions designed to discover how COVID-19 has affected the workplace, from human resources to innovation and product development. The conclusions drawn in this report are based on the collected answers and insights of our respondents.\nCOVID-19 is a \u201cGeneration-Defining\u201d Event\n\"We are likely in the midst of a generation-defining event that will influence how consumers behave for years to come.\"\nMcKinsey, How Marketing Leaders Can Both Manage the Coronavirus Crisis and Plan for the Future, April 2020\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has indeed been a \"generation-defining event\" that will influence how all of us behave, from consumers to producers, for years to come. Even as we return to \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d, with the reopening of places that have been shut for three months or more, we will not be returning to the places as we remember them, they will be radically changed. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella aptly describes the scene:\u00a0\"As COVID-19 impacts every aspect of our work and life, we have seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months\".\nWorking from home is not surprisingly the hottest topic around the \u201cnew normal\u201d of coronavirus. But we need to remember that work from home is not a one size fits all. David Michaels of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University reminds us not to forget the 50% of UK workers, and 72% of Americans do not have jobs with the ability to work from home at anytime. He explains: \u201cWhat is important about this pandemic is that it has shined a spotlight on workers who have been essential but before this were invisible.\u201d\n70% of those surveyed said they expect things to go back to normal with some change in the way things are done.\"\nThe Future of Business Post COVID-19: A Report from Informa Connect, July 2020\nWhere work from home has been an option, multiple organizations have conducted studies finding several positive outcomes from virtual work: radical reduction of carbon emissions, cost savings - from company costs to employee commute time & costs, more productivity from employees, improvement of work/life balance, a more equitable workplace for women and people with disabilities or chronic illness, better mental health and a more diverse workforce.\nGlobally, the International Labor Organization estimates that: \"18 per cent of workers have occupations that are suitable for WFH and live in countries with the infrastructure to enable WFH.\" Vox tells us that only 4% of the US workforce, for example, normally works from home at least part time (it\u2019s just slightly higher for the UK ), but due to coronavirus 34% of folks were working from home in early April. Whether this sticks, only time can tell, although Ben Pring, Co-Founder and Leader of Cognizant\u2019s Center for the Future of Work was confident enough to make this prediction\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b in early June: \"probably 15% more will be working at home permanently than pre-COVID-19\".\u00a0Entrepreneur and adviser Hiten Shah reminds us that a transition to everyone who can moving towards permanent work from home would certainly be a radical shift from the status quo: \u201cRight now, remote work isn\u2019t working for most companies\u2026That\u2019s because we spent the last 120 years learning how people can be productive in an office.\u201d\nA Gartner survey says that \u201c74% of CFOs and Finance leaders will move at least 5% of their previously on-site workforce to permanently remote positions post-COVID 19\u201d. Nationwide was one of the first US companies to announce a transition to primarily working from home. Automaker Ford has extended work from home for most salaried employees \"until at least the beginning of September\". Amazon and Microsoft have announced that their corporate employees do not have to return to offices until October; Zillow , Facebook and Google have announced work from home until the end of 2020, and Shopify's offices will be closed until 2021.\nMark Zuckerberg told The Verge \"I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently\" (in 5-10 years) and VMWare \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bforesees 60% of their employees working from home \"over time\". Twitter , Square and Groupe PSA \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b have made remote work permanent for those that are able to do their jobs from home. As of this writing, Mondeley, Barclays and Morgan Stanley were all looking at rethinking their working from home policies. Even state government, such as Silicon Valley's San Jose, California Santa Clara County board of supervisors, is getting involved with promoting virtual work, asking businesses to consider remote work as over 100,000 employees in their region commute for 3 or more hours per day, and they\u2019ve seen as much as a 75% reduction in pollutant levels during the epidemic.\nDuring this pandemic, Human Resources have become more crucial to businesses than ever before, as HR departments have been called upon to retain a sense of normalcy and connection. Michelle Davies, Vice-President of People at Phrasee explains: \u201cEveryone\u2019s been in panic mode, whether it\u2019s fears over losing their job or that they weren\u2019t able to buy toilet paper. But it\u2019s not just about communicating with people formally about business matters. In the office, people have lots of informal connection points, so we\u2019ve tried to recreate that virtually as you have to try and keep things as normal as you can.\u201d In many cases work has become a lifeline to people who are isolated from their friends and families. Fun virtual activities such as pub quizzes, online fitness classes and after-work gatherings provide team-building and help alleviate the multiple stresses that the current pandemic has brought to people\u2019s lives.\nAt Informa Connect\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, like over 92% of our customers surveyed,\u00a0we've been working remotely due to COVID-19; and we've been producing most of our in-person events digitally. This has been an incredibly busy and exciting time; it's been a journey of learning what our audiences value most from our events and digital content. It's been important to us to keep the quality of our digital events as high as our award-winning live events; we've been focussed on making them not only seamless, but best-in-class, from top-notch content to providing as-good-as-in-person networking experiences. Once we are able to do in-person events again, we'll be bringing the valuable lessons we've learned to all our events and content - both in-person and digital. From Informa Connect's EBD Group transforming what would have been a Paris conference to a digital solution for their BIO-Europe\u00ae Spring event,\u00a0to our cutting edge Finovate events going digital for summer and fall 2020,\u00a0we've learned that it's important for attendees to both engage directly with speakers and network with their peers. We've developed apps, live polls and other key ways digital conference goers can engage with speakers and other attendees live and on-demand.\nOne company that's notably bucking the trend is Walmart. Their new 350 acre home office, expected to open in stages by 2025, is still on track; Fortune explains that their CEO Doug McMillon \"firmly believes the value of in-person collaboration with colleagues will endure and says it won\u2019t change the future home office\u2019s design much\".\nCoronavirus and The Financial Sector: Acceleration of Digitization\n\"As we have witnessed in the past few weeks, social distancing has forced many to work remotely, and accelerated the adoption of digital tools. I expect the trend to continue post-pandemic as more organizations reap the benefits of reduced rent obligations with less office space. Unfortunately, we will also likely see a shift in resource needs in some areas such as call centers, where companies are increasing adapting AI and automation capabilities to augment capacity.\" Theodora Lau, Founder, Unconventional Ventures\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\"COVID-19 has made most of us hyper-aware of every touchable surface that could transmit the disease, so in a post-COVID-19 world, it\u2019s expected that we\u2019ll have fewer touch screens and more voice interfaces and machine vision interfaces\" Bernard Marr, What Does The Future Look Like Post-Coronavirus - 9 Future Predictions. Fintech thought leaders Theo Lau's (quote on right) and Bernard Marr's insights both show a remarkable side effect of COVID-19, the acceleration of digital. What is commonly called \u201cvoice first\u201d and machine vision interfaces in mobile payments had slowly been rolled out by early adopters, but in the new reality of fear of disease transmission, it will be something that consumers will demand. PWC\u2019s Covid-19 CFO Pulse survey confirms this: \u201cFS firms, including asset and wealth management, banking and capital markets and insurance, have been going through a rapid digital transformation... Once the COVID-19 situation stabilizes, firms may not be able to compete if they haven\u2019t built systems, products, and processes that meet client demands in the \u2018new normal\u2019.\u201d\nIn The Financial Brand, Jim Marous tells us that: \u201cAs the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic extends, more consumers are adjusting to vastly different daily behaviors. From increases in working from home and ordering take-out food to reductions in visiting friends or going to a workout facility, everything has changed\u2026 According to J.D. Power, only 46% of consumers will go back to \u2018banking as usual\u2019.\u201d\nBased on our survey results, the finance sector has been one of the most responsive to customer needs, with 31% of those surveyed developing a new product or service, 30% accelerating development of an already planned product and 45% introducing new initiatives during the pandemic to better connect with customers. Several respondees mentioned specific philanthropic projects such as pro bono initiatives - in one case all employees and their family members were provided with a supply of masks and hand sanitizer -\u00a0and events for charities being part of their response to COVID-19. One organization used the time to work on their Diversity and Inclusion initiatives, and several others said they focussed on more client interaction and communication including webinars and education to address the impact of the pandemic.\nBeyond disruption in products, the workplace is another place that has seen radical change. CNBC reported on how financial traders were affected: \u201cWhile many global companies are telling all staff to work from home, for some banking roles, this isn\u2019t possible. Traders, for example, often deal with sensitive data, requiring workstations and technology that meet certain compliance standards and cannot be used at home. \u201d Goldman Sachs, Citi, JP Morgan and Bank of America moved employees, in some cases, to backup offices and developed shifts splitting up time between work and home along with \u201cother protective hygiene measures\u201d.\nIn our survey of finance professionals, 80% of respondents said that either everyone (49%) or the majority of staff (31%) were working from home. For those who needed to remain in the office, just 2% reported than they did not have some form of safety measure in place, from hand sanitizing stations to changes in location.\nA consistent theme in the financial industry right now has been comparisons of the coronavirus pandemic to the Global Financial crisis of 2007\u201308. Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo recently told CNBC: \u201cIn the global financial crisis, banks were the problem\u2026 The silver lining from that is that banks are prepared for a situation like this, and they want to be part of the solution this time.\u201d In the Wealthmanagement.com article \u201cHow to run a financial advisory firm during a recession\u201d Erik Bergquist interviews several financial advisors that share similar thoughts about the financial crisis being a great lesson for what the industry is dealing with now.\nPat McClain, Co-Founder and Senior Partner at Allworth Financial offers this advice: \u201c(during) the last crisis we did have a hiring freeze and we went through the expense line of the whole business. If you think about our business, most advisors will work on a 30% to 40% margin and the assets under management comes right off the top, so the margins are compressed. We didn\u2019t furlough anyone, but we pulled back on the marketing budget and tech spend and all capital improvements, and we are doing the same now. You want to make sure on the back side of it that you are healthy. The last thing you want to do is lay people off because there is going to be a recovery, and this is a service business that is built around good quality people. If you do touch people, you don\u2019t want them to be client facing because there needs to be that consistency in the client experience; your firm can\u2019t look like it\u2019s struggling. This is the fourth one I\u2019ve been through\u2014it is steeper and faster than the previous \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bones, but we learned what the recovery should look like.\u201d\nThat PWC CFO Pulse survey mentioned confirms that 2008 has \u201cstrengthened our ability to withstand systemic shocks\u201d; additionally PWC found that \u201conly 55% (of financial services) are considering deferring or canceling planned investments as a result of this crisis, compared to 67% of all sectors.\u201d An Investopedia article reinforces the stability of finance as a sector and a profession during this crisis; three of the \"9 Businesses That Thrive in Recession\" are accountants,\u00a0financial advisors and economists. Jim Chappelow writes: \"People who have substantial assets want to ensure that they're well taken care of, especially during a recession. Financial advisors often see an increase in work as people become concerned about the stability of their investments and seek guidance on how to protect their assets.\"\nA McKinsey report published this June echoes Clarke's sentiments; its authors conclude: \"Nothing will pay more dividends to advisors in the long run than deeply servicing their existing clients.\"\nIn a recent Finovate Podcast, Alyson Clarke, of Forrester Research had this to say:\u00a0\u201cTo hit a recession is preparing for the upturn\u2026. If we think back to the last recession, they didn\u2019t survive so well when the economy improved. What financial services firms and banks need to do, they have to focus on reengineering around the customer, not the product. Reengineering to become more agile so you\u2019ve got the ability to adapt quickly.\u201d\nA Microscope on Marketing: Brands to the Rescue\n\"Three important trends are emerging now that will define Marketing for years to come: truly valuable content in marketing that\u2019s stuffed with empathy, inspiration, and utility; direct-to-consumer messaging, branding, communications; and virtual selling and online sales appointments.\" Ann Handley, Chief Content Officer, MarketingProfs\n\u201cMarketers\u2014many working remotely from home\u2014are faced with an entirely new situation: How should we be talking to our customers? Where should we be spending marketing dollars and where shouldn\u2019t we? How should we be working with our teams and our colleagues across the business? How are we going to stay in business? And all this on top of how can we support our family, friends, communities and planet.\u201d\u00a0McKinsey, How Marketing Leaders Can Both Manage the Coronavirus Crisis and Plan for the Future, April 2020.\n\"92% of marketing professionals surveyed believe that COVID-19 has impacted the need for digital transformation for businesses, and that it will have long term impact.\" The Future of Business Post COVID-19: A Report from Informa Connect, July 2020\nMarketers have had to justify their existence since the dawn of digital, and now the pressure is even higher, with budgets strained and all eyes on cutting costs.\u00a0While marketing teams are being scrutinized, the Wall Street Journal tells us that the role is more crucial than ever. Caren Fleit of Korn Ferry explains to WSJ: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything changes in terms of needing marketing, but in some cases the kind of marketing will change.\u201d How that will change includes being relevant to customers in this time of crisis, with authenticity and mindfulness. Savanta Group specializes in \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Coronavirus Trackers, and their survey of 2,000 consumers (published April 30) proves that \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bFleit is spot on: \u201cconsumers say they actively want to hear positive advertising from brands, with four in ten (42%) consumers believing that brands should focus on life after coronavirus in their ads.\u201d\nFrom Instagram Live classes, hackathons and virtual bingo nights to production of hand sanitizer & PPE and donations to frontline healthcare professionals, Yola Robert gives several examples in Forbes how \"many businesses have had to re-strategize, temporarily shut down or pivot offerings to stay afloat during these times\". This re-strategizing and pivoting is happening globally, from the US to India. Brands who will come out on top are those who will be able to respond to the pandemic with the ability to change all of their plans in an agile manner and shift from regular mode to crisis mode .\u00a0Wade Paschall of Westerra Credit Union aptly explained the situation to Muse by Clio: \"I think brands are going to be remembered for what they do right now, good or bad\".\nInteractive Advertising Bureau (IAB)\u200b\u200b\u200b data \"shows that 73% of advertisers have \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bmodified or developed new assets since the start of the pandemic. Of these, over half (53%) are increasing messaging that emphasizes the mission of the company\". I would say in general that brands are doing remarkably well, because according to Edelman, 55% of those surveyed \u201csaid that brands and companies are responding more quickly and effectively than government\".\n\"80% of marketers surveyed said they had either developed a new product, service or business initiative, or accelerated development of an already planned product in response to COVID-19.\" The Future of Business Post COVID-19: A Report from Informa Connect, July 2020\nAnn Handley, Chief Content Officer of MarketingProfs describes what she sees as trends that came out of the COVID-19 epidemic that will define marketing for years to come: \u201c1. The importance of truly valuable content in marketing that\u2019s stuffed with empathy, inspiration, and utility. Is your customer newsletter a must-read? No? Fix that. 2. The importance of direct-to-consumer messaging, branding, communications. Especially important for companies who have relied on retail brick-and-mortar distribution. 3. Virtual selling and online sales appointments. We might be feeling some element of Zoom fatigue. But face-to-face virtual meetings had a moment in a COVID-19 interrupted world.\"\nLife Sciences: Rising to the Challenge\n\"What COVID-19 has brought upon the world is a triple inflection of change. Amazing technological advances, regulatory and reimbursement approval, and the profound social imperative for use all come together to make health tech no longer an option, but an imperative. My sense is that 20 years from now we will look back at COVID-19 with a vague recollection of its social impact and perhaps even a silly mispronounce of the name. What will endure--become a lasting aspect of our humanity--will be the inculcation of technology into our daily lives. From medicine to education, the toothpaste of technological innovation is out of the tube, and there's no putting it back.\" John Nosta,\u00a0President, NostaLab\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201cIf you are a public [biotech] company with an approach that has promise [against COVID-19], I don\u2019t think there is going to be an issue of funding.

Doctors in the U.S. now perform remote visits across state lines, can email and video-chat patients in compliance with HIPAA, and Medicare and health insurance providers have to now reimburse telemedicine services.\u201d Emma Rose Beinvenu, 7 Predictions for a Post-Coronavirus World, Medium.\nFrom the sudden focus on healthcare workers and the biotech world, to the acceleration of the digitization of medicine and the difficulties of social distancing in labs; the life sciences industry has been has been thrown into the spotlight during the COVID-19 pandemic. Xconomy\u2019s Dan Stanton tell us that \u201cindustry is rising to the challenge. Supported by nervous investors hit hard by volatile markets, products are whizzing through the clinic at unprecedented speed. Tech-sharing partnerships are beginning to blossom. Meanwhile, money is being thrown at clinical trials and manufacturing facilities with faith that diagnostic products, therapies, and vaccines will spin a stronger and healthier world out of the current crisis.\u201d\nCapGemini research declares that the solutions are there for life sciences R&D to excel during this crisis, but they lie in pushing beyond \"old boundaries to accelerate\". Companies such as Novartis, recently interviewed by Pharma Intelligence, are successfully pushing those boundaries, as their Chief Digital Officer Bertrand Bodson explains: \"Many things that we had planned to take a couple of years to get into full motion have happened in two months. Everybody, including the regulators, have come together on this, and so we have been able to change gears strongly.\"\nOur life sciences survey results illustrate this pushing of \"old boundaries\";\u00a0 36% of respondents have developed a new product, service or business initiative while 22% have sped up development of an already planned product. The products and services people described were exciting: one shared that their organization was in the process of certifying the first 3D printed face mask in the world, a few were working on remote patient monitoring and remote clinical trial recruitment, and several were working on developing a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.\n36% of those surveyed in the life sciences sector have developed a new product, service or business initiative while 22% have sped up development of an already planned product.\" The Future of Business Post COVID-19: A Report from Informa Connect, July 2020\nBurning Glass Technologies Labor Insights tells us that \"the number of (life sciences) job postings in mid-May increased from the number in early February\" and MassBio's discussions with industry leaders have found that \"most employees are as busy as ever.\" In a May McKinsey study of life sciences R&D leaders, the picture is less rosy, with reported productivity having fallen \"between 25 and 75 percent due to remote working\" and \"an average of 40 to 50 percent of their time (spent) on crisis management\".\nIn our survey of global life sciences professionals, we discovered that fewer than 10% of respondents had a crisis management team in place before COVID-19, which parallels the McKinsey data showing that a great deal of workers' time needed to be spent on that. Our data found, however, that life sciences professionals were positive about the change to \"work from home\"; over 88% of respondents saw this as sustainable business practice for their organizations in the long term.\u00a045% agreed it was sustainable for at least some to work from home,\u00a0and 44% for large numbers of employees to work from home.\nDigital transformation in healthcare has been accelerated by COVID-19 and 84% of our survey respondents agree that the disease has had an impact; 62% feel that the impact will be long term, 22% short term.\u00a0\u00a0In the pharma industry this has certainly been demonstrated; for example, tools such as \"sentiment/voice analysis, behavioral analysis, (and) strategic intelligence\" are coming out of the \"innovation shadows\" to challenge the \"status quo\". With people unable to or afraid to leave their homes, digital health via telemedicine has filled the gaps -\u00a0and regulatory bodies have been forced to speed up their approval processes. A new Deloitte study affirms that: \"increased digitization is likely to change how therapies are provided, how clinicians practice, how health plans pay for care\u2026and where investors place their bets\".\nRyan Browne of CNBC informs us that: \u201cThe outbreak has led to increased uptake of telemedicine services from the likes of Teladoc, Babylon Health and Kry\u201d and \u201cResearch firm Forrester estimates U.S. virtual care visits will top 1 billion this year due to the pandemic and other factors.\u201d\u00a0The spotlight has been on healthcare workers in hospitals, but Browne reminds us not to forget about those in labs, labs which are both ramping up testing for coronavirus and developing vaccines. Their workplaces too have had to ramp up social distancing efforts, by adjusting staffing and rearranging schedules to practice social distancing. Informa Connect Life Sciences is following someone on the front lines who is working for a cure in their Coronavirus Diaries series, how they've had to quickly pivot the kinds of studies they were doing and apply new cleaning regimes. You can read their story here.\nIn Money\u2019s March article \u201c 5 Stocks That Are Actually Up Since the Coronavirus Market Implosion \u201d\u00a0 - not surprisingly two of the stocks were biotech companies -\u00a0\u00a0Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. both working on drugs related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Moderna Therapeutics is another company that's doing well with a recent $483 million funding from the government for a \u201cRNA-based SARS-CoV2 vaccine\u201d they\u2019re working on.\u00a0Johnson & Johnson is making progress with development of its vaccine; and CEO Alex Gorsky has pledged to make it available on a not-for--profit basis. Other organizations working on Coronavirus cures - from repurposing drugs to Covid-19 treatments include: AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Roche, Novartis, Ergomed PLC, Synairgen PLC, CytoDyn Inc, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Tiziana Life Sciences, CureVac, The Vaccine Group,\u00a0Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies, AltImmune,\u00a0BioNTech and Pfizer, Heat Biologics, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Novavax, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Vaxart, Vir Biotechnology,\u00a0and several Universities as well.

The climate crisis could also be a positive supply side influence...\u00a0So, the real focus in the scenarios going forward is on the economic management of the pandemic and continued focus on climate change. I4 and new propulsion technology will also create new opportunities for adventurous investors.\" Dr. Martin Stopford. Coronavirus, Climate Change & Smart Shipping: Three Maritime Scenarios\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bTwo of the sectors hit early on before coronavirus became a global pandemic were shipping and energy. This is primarily because China - where COVID-19 began -\u00a0is the largest shipowning country in the world. The maritime sector,\u00a0which moves 90% of the world\u2019s goods,\u00a0came to a standstill and this greatly affected the usage of oil as well. The International Labour Organization tells us: \"With 384 sailings cancelled, the first half of 2020 could see a 25 per cent reduction in shipping, with a 10 per cent annual fall in 2020.\" And the World Economic Forum says that: \"Maritime shipping has seen COVID-19-associated drops in activity of up to 30% in some regions.\"\nAnother major impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the drop in oil prices. Although, as Infiniti Research states: \"The current oil price war could be short-lived owing to the increased economic dependence on the sector.\" Nonetheless it has sent waves through not only the energy sector, but through every sector on the Globe, as Jeff Meli, Global Head of Research at Barclays said in their press release :\u00a0\u201cCOVID-19 will accelerate this trend [towards ESG] even further \u2014 creating a greater sense of urgency and responsibility toward everything from consumer behavior to climate change, supply-chain practices and the future of work and mobility \u2014 and potentially alter the nature of the investment process as a result.\u201d Deloitte offers that \"Some of the larger, healthier (oil, gas & chemical) companies may alter or accelerate their plans to diversify into other energy segments.\"\n\"One of the interesting things about shipping is that there will always be heavy machinery (ships) moving heavy stuff (cargo) around. This means that, unlike so many other industries, digitalisation will only go so far. On some level, there will always be a need for people to be physically involved in those processes. The maritime industry's future operators will need to be experts in combined mechanical and digital systems. Even with the rise of autonomous shipping and remote operations, there is also no doubt that a career at the sharp end of the maritime industry will still mean putting on a boiler suit and getting your hands dirty occasionally.\" Nick Chubb, Founder & Director, Thetius\nAs with other industries, COVID-19 has had the effect of speeding up some phenomena already in place, such as decarbonization and digitalisation. We cannot forget the human element, however, as Nick Chubb so aptly reminds us \"there will always be a need for people\". Digital transformation in shipping and maritime has been both tested and sped up during this crisis, emerging as a \"silver lining\". And that is not the only silver lining from this crisis, as some say we may also see a speeding up of the transition to renewable energy. In fact an IRENA study \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b found that \"renewable energy could power an economic recovery from COVID-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (\u00a380tn) between now and 2050\". Power Technology weighs in with more positive news for renewables fans: \"Since the start of the year, returns from renewable energy investment have stayed well above those from fossil fuel projects, and slightly above US industrial averages. In many areas, investment in oil and gas has fallen below the rate needed to replenish existing reserves. Since the same is not true of renewables, they will gain a larger share of the generation as a result of the pandemic.\"\nEnergy company BP which employs 70,000 people worldwide announced in June that they would be cutting 10,000 of those roles, all office based;\u00a0with a significant portion of roles cut being senior level. Electrek writes: \"This (cut) is a result of the coronavirus impact on the economy, and also CEO Bernard Looney\u2019s plan to shift the fossil-fuel company to green energy.\" Just two days after those layoffs were announced, the BBC reported that as of midnight June 10 \"Britain's electricity grid will not have burnt any coal for 60 days...\u00a0by far the longest period since the Industrial Revolution began more than 200 years ago\" more evidence that COVID-19 could be the environment's \"big moment \"\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\"The main impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the energy industry was on 'demand' (particularly the oil demand). Demand shock in the short-term due to the global-lock downs and demand shortfall in the long-term due to potential changes in people\u2019s lifestyles around the world.\" Dr. Sara Vakhshouri, President, SVB Energy International\nMany analysts, however, don't believe the future is bleak for the largest oil companies and see in fact that they may benefit from a COVID-19 induced \"fire sale\" environment. The Washington Post, in their article Big Oil could end up even bigger by the end of the coronavirus pandemic, explains: \"the oil giants...\u00a0have wells around the world and the cash on hand to weather the turmoil\" and \"the largest petroleum industry players to scoop up more wells on the cheap \u2013 and leave them with more reserves after all the market tumult.\"\nThe \"New Normal\" Becomes \"Next Normal\"\n\"83% of Americans currently forced to work from home say they miss attending in-person meetings and conventions. As important, 78% say they plan to attend as many or more when the threat of COVID-19 passes and it is safe to do so.\" Fred Dixon, President and CEO of NYC & Company and co-chair of the Meetings Mean Business Coalition (MMBC)\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bNot surprisingly, new research tells us that in-person meetings and conventions are something that 83% of Americans miss . Trina Camacho-London, Vice President of Global Group Sales at Hyatt Hotels Corporation and MMBC says: \u201c Research proves what many of us have long suspected to be true. Our collective experience of physical distancing has us craving the day that we can all come together again and meet in person.\"\u00a0Our disrupted lives will indeed never be the same, but irrevocably changed; however we will enter into this \"Next Normal\" invigorated, transformed, and ready to connect again.\nAs a society we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as people who rely on digital and \"the cloud\" more than ever before,\u00a0but also people who have radically changed ourselves. Those of us who have had the luxury to work from home have massively slowed down our usual hectic lives; many of us have had some time to reconnect with our families, and have revisited our own personal goals. Shana Sissel,\u00a0Chief Investment Officer of Spotlight Asset Group recently told InsideETFs about an unexpected benefit from the current crisis: \"This has caused people to have to slow down...I almost feel like I'm connecting more to people that I took for granted before.\"\nOne of the biggest things that COVID-19 has exposed are the flaws in our global supply chain systems - shown most dramatically in global healthcare workers in some of the wealthiest countries in the world being \"dangerously ill-equipped \"\u00a0to deal with the crisis. However, almost overnight we saw corporations, groups and individuals step up to deal with the challenges. It's this proud legacy of hands-on problem solving and innovation we can take into our \"next normal\"; and as Wolfgang Lehmacher explains (on the next page), those companies that invest in the best talent and technology will come out on top.\nFor those companies who have employees on site, more than half of all respondents surveyed stated that measures were implemented such as hand sanitizing stations (84%), additional cleaning (68%), protective clothing (64%), or restricted access to communal spaces (54%).

This may include checking the temperatures of everyone on entry, through thermal scanning or other screening processes. Lastly, should it be necessary, all Informa events will work with local authorities to trace and contact participants at our events, subject to local privacy regulations.\n\"COVID-19 has opened people\u2019s eyes for the power of digital in supply chain and logistics. Those that open their minds will make the leap. The talent to build the new solutions is out there. Go and get it.\" Wolfgang Lehmacher, Supply Chain and Technology Strategist, Former Head of Supply Chain and Transport Industries, World Economic Forum\nAs we are revisiting our own personal goals we are also reinventing our business strategies. Whether you are management or entry level, there is no one in business who is not right now reevaluating what they do for their companies and their customers. Wolfgang Lehmacher advises large companies look to startups for inspiration in his article: \"How startup power can eliminate pain points in the time of pandemic\" explaining how startups are helping the business world through this pandemic with everything from assistance to working from home to cybersecurity and innovative supply chain solutions.\nAnnobio Morelix takes it a step further, calling the post-pandemic economy \u201cThe Great Reboot\u201d reminding us in Inc. that \u201chalf of the Fortune 500 companies started during a contraction, and\u2026 more than 50 unicorns started in the Great Recession\u201d.

Geopolitical tensions are rising, and the U.S.-China trade war may only be at its beginning. Countries around the world are scrambling to put policies in place to counter the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and to secure growth in the post-COVID-19 era.\nGlobalization is also being increasingly scrutinized, and protectionist sentiment has been spreading, even in countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which have championed an open approach to markets and benefitted substantially from the world\u2019s increased connectedness.\nThe changes caused by COVID-19 are likely to have a lasting impact that will challenge us far beyond the current pandemic. Recent data and the author\u2019s ongoing research on the world\u2019s largest multinationals suggest that the four following trends will be of particular relevance when formulating expectations on how the international business landscape might evolve in the aftermath of the pandemic.\nCOVID-19 will have an uneven impact on international business\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund's latest estimates 1, the world\u2019s real GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2019, contracted by 3.3 per cent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expected to grow by 6 per cent in 2021. These figures may erroneously suggest that we can expect companies\u2019 international operations to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022.\nA closer look at macro-economic indicators reveals that while it is true that the world\u2019s GDP bounced back to its pre-COVID-19 level relatively quickly, the international business landscape will change significantly. Especially when we compare the pandemic-related effects on trade versus the impact it has had on the actual investments companies make to build, buy or reinvest in operations abroad. As far as trade is concerned, the WTO estimates 2 that the world merchandise trade volume will increase by 8 per cent in 2021 after dropping by 5.3 per cent in 2020, a much lower decline than initially expected. Conversely, when looking at global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, UNCTAD 3 data indicate that FDI flows will take significantly longer to recover, as illustrated in the chart below.\nThe heightened levels of uncertainty and ongoing protectionist pressures are likely to further exacerbate the dynamics described above and limit the recovery of companies\u2019 international investments for a protracted period.\nGlobal FDI flows will take longer to recover from the pandemic-induced crisis than trade.\nGlobal FDI inflows\nBillion US$\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 (Forecast) 2022 (Forecast) 900 1,000 1,100 1,200 1,300 1,400 1,500 1,600 1,700 1,800 1,900 2,000 2,100\nNote: Data for\u00a02015\u20132020 and 2021\u201322 forecast.\nSource: UNCTAD.\nCompanies\u2019 international trade will largely depend on China\u2019s role going forward\nThe last 20 years have witnessed China\u2019s impressive rise in world trade. Since its inclusion in the WTO at the turn of the century, China\u2019s share of global exports increased dramatically on a year-over-year basis. The 2020 UNCTAD data 4 confirm that China accounted for nearly 15 per cent of global exports, with the U.S. and Germany representing roughly 8 per cent each, the only two other countries next to China with a share in global exports that is higher than 5 per cent (see chart below).\nChina\u2019s current role as an export powerhouse implies that changes in its status and/or economic priorities will have major ripple effects on the international business landscape. Two factors must be carefully considered in this respect. First, China is increasingly focusing on its domestic market as a result of the growing maturity of its economy and, in turn, the country\u2019s domestic consumption over the last few years has become a driving force. Second, recent geopolitical tensions, especially involving the U.S., have prompted the Chinese government 5 to groom its economy for a future in which the U.S. no longer plays a key role in global demand and thus the Chinese government is investing even more heavily in bolstering its own economy.\nChina\u2019s increasing focus on its own market will have major implications for multinationals that have been importing goods from the Asian giant and\u2014in response to growing protectionist measures at home as well\u2014may soon start looking for domestic or at least alternatives located in closer proximity to source their goods and establish long-term economic partnerships.\nThe rise of China as the world\u2019s export powerhouse\nChina USA Germany Netherlands Japan China, Hong Kong SAR Korea, Rep.

While cross-border M&As registered a slowdown in the first half of 2020, they were able to largely recover in the second half. This trend is also reflected in the data collected by PwC relative to global M&A deal volumes and values from 2019 to 2021 (see chart below).\nThe same pattern is not observed for greenfield investments, however. Such investments have been of particular relevance for developing countries, accounting for over 50 per cent of total FDI inflows into this group of countries in 2019 compared to cross-border M&As, which made up only 9 per cent. Contrary to cross-border M&As, the negative trend of greenfield investments continued throughout 2020 (falling by over 40 per cent in developing countries vis-\u00e0-vis 2019) and well into 2021.\nOn the one hand, the greater sensitivity of greenfield investments to geopolitical factors such as protectionism and enhanced regulatory accountability is bound to continue to play a role in coming years, in view also of the high level of uncertainty surrounding international markets. On the other hand, the abundance of capital in advanced economies and the growth of alternative types of buyers prepared to invest in international markets\u2014from private equity firms to new special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)\u2014are expected to further accelerate international investors\u2019 search for new deals around the world, especially in developed economies.\nGlobal M&A deal volumes and values (2019\u20132021)\nVolume (Number of transactions)\nValue (Billion US$)\nQ1 2019 Q2 2019 Q3 2019 Q4 2019 Q1 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 1,100 1,200 1,300\nDeal Volume\nDeal Value\nDeal Value (Excluding megadeals)\nSource: PWC\nThe regionalization trend will intensify\nIntraregional trade was already on the rise before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The author\u2019s ongoing research 7 on the world\u2019s largest multinationals included in the Fortune Global 500 list finds that these companies have displayed a strong home-region orientation over the last decade, locating approximately 70 per cent of their equity subsidiaries within their home regions. It is worth noting that this percentage increases to nearly 80 per cent when restricting the focus to Fortune Global 500 companies headquartered in emerging and developing economies.\nIn view of the rising tensions and stronger localization pressures from national governments, we can expect a further escalation in the regionalization trend in the near future.

While over two-thirds of the total confirmed cases are in mainland China, the vast majority of new cases reported since February 25 have occurred outside the country. What was initially seen as a largely China-centric shock is now understood to be a global crisis. The virus\u2019s spread has regrettably borne out analysts\u2019 downside scenarios, with investors digesting the implications of disrupted supply chains, official containment measures, and spillovers from the real economy to financial markets. A decision by two of the world\u2019s largest energy producers to maintain current levels of production, despite falling energy prices, has further unnerved investors while questions about governments\u2019 abilities to mount an effective and coordinated response linger. The increased uncertainty has led to financial market volatility last seen during the global financial crisis.\nQ1: What will be the impact of Covid-19 on the economy?\nA1: The extent of the damage will depend on how quickly the virus is contained, the steps authorities take to contain it, and how much economic support governments are willing to deploy during the epidemic\u2019s immediate impact and aftermath.\nEarly indications of Covid-19\u2019s impact on the Chinese economy are worse than initially forecast. Surveys of China\u2019s manufacturing and services sector plunged to record lows in February, automobile sales sank a record 80 percent, and China\u2019s exports fell 17.2 percent in January and February. The official data confirmed a widespread slowdown in economic activity foreshadowed in low pollution levels and depressed shipping traffic, among other informal barometers. Analysts have sharply revised down estimates of Chinese growth, with many now predicting a drop in first quarter GDP, the first contraction since China began reporting quarterly data in 1992. As Covid-19 spreads, China\u2019s economic recovery will be challenged as demand from other countries drops as they cope with the virus.\nAlthough the outbreak appears to have slowed in China, Covid-19 and its impacts have gone global. Infections are mounting in Europe, South Korea, Iran, the United States, and elsewhere, with authorities implementing increasingly restrictive measures to contain the virus. Europe and Japan are likely already in recession territory given their weak fourth quarter performance and high reliance on trade. While the United States entered the crisis with a tailwind, some analysts are forecasting a contraction in U.S. GDP in the second quarter. Estimates of the global impact vary: early last week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that Covid-19 will lower global GDP growth by one-half a percentage point for 2020 (from 2.9 to 2.4 percent); Bloomberg Economics warns that full-year GDP growth could fall to zero in a worst-case pandemic scenario.\nQ2: What sectors and economies are most vulnerable?\nA2: The Covid-19 outbreak has generated both demand and supply shocks reverberating across the global economy. Among major economies outside of China, the OECD forecasts the largest downward growth revisions in countries deeply interconnected to China, especially South Korea, Australia, and Japan. Major European economies will experience dislocations as the virus spreads and countries adopt restrictive responses that curb manufacturing activity at regional hubs, including in Northern Italy. As a result of depressed activity, the United Nations projects that foreign direct investment flows could fall between 5 and 15 percent to their lowest levels since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.\nAt the sectoral level, tourism and travel-related industries will be among the hardest hit as authorities encourage \u201csocial distancing\u201d and consumers stay indoors. The International Air Transport Association warns that Covid-19 could cost global air carriers between $63 billion and $113 billion in revenue in 2020, and the international film market could lose over $5 billion in lower box office sales. Similarly, shares of major hotel companies have plummeted in the last few weeks, and entertainment giants like Disney expect a significant blow to revenues. Restaurants, sporting events, and other services will also face significant disruption. Industries less reliant on high social interaction, such as agriculture, will be comparatively less vulnerable but will still face challenges as demand wavers.\nQ3: What\u2019s the relationship between the economy and the energy sector?\nA3: Economic slowdowns generally lead to lower energy demand, and the fallout from Covid-19 has proved no different. Often, producers respond to demand slumps by cutting supply to buoy prices. Last week, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a few other major oil producers met to discuss an additional cut of 1.5 million barrels per day through the end of June in response to the outbreak. When the agreement collapsed, Saudi Arabia cut prices and lifted output, ostensibly to harm Russia for refusing to agree to production cuts. Following the Saudi decision, Brent Crude fell more than 20 percent , the sharpest one-day drop since 1991, with analysts predicting further declines ahead. The damage from the Saudi-Russian price war sends an unsettling signal to markets hungry for a coordinated policy response to the epidemic, especially considering Saudi Arabia\u2019s current role as G20 president.\nIn response to the price shock, large oil producers, including U.S. firms, could pare back investment and production, with heavily indebted firms in particular at risk of layoffs, consolidations, and even bankruptcy. Investors are well aware that energy companies account for more than 11 percent of the U.S. high yield (below investment grade) market, with rollovers nearly impossible under current market conditions. In theory, lower oil prices should help oil-importing countries, but depressed activity due to Covid-19 could limit that benefit. In addition, the boom in domestic U.S. energy production in recent years means the United States is exposed to price declines in a way not seen in previous economic downturns.\nQ4: How does the economic slowdown impact financial markets?\nA4: Fears of a broader outbreak and its economic impact spread to financial markets last month, and most international indices are nearing bear market territory (declining at least 20 percent from the 52-week high) as investors process the lower corporate earnings that will result from the virus. The S&P 500 fell 7 percent to open the March 9 session, triggering a \u201c circuit breaker \u201d that briefly suspended trading for the first time since 1997. Overall, the index is down about 17 percent from its record high on February 19. Amid the equity rout, investors have fled to safe haven assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, leading to record low yields. Low yields translate into low borrowing costs for the U.S. government, but low interest rates may not benefit private companies or individuals (or even all sovereigns) who may find financial markets too risk adverse to extend credit in light of such uncertainty. The longer the virus spreads, the more economic and company performance will be impacted, raising concerns about debt sustainability, especially for highly indebted countries and companies, absent official support.\nQ5: How have governments responded to cushion the economic fallout from the epidemic?\nA5: Thus far, national governments have announced largely uncoordinated, country-specific responses to the virus. In China, the epicenter of the outbreak, officials announced billions in special-purpose loans to companies facing liquidity constraints as well as financial support to specific sectors such as aviation. In the United States, the Federal Reserve cut the policy rate in an emergency action on March 3, and on March 9, in coordination with other U.S. bank regulators, it encouraged financial institutions to \u201cmeet the financial needs of customers and members affected by the coronavirus,\u201d a move aimed at supporting financial conditions to prevent the growth shock from turning into a broader financial crisis. On March 9, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also announced expanded overnight repurchase operations by $50 billion to avoid a deeper credit crunch.\nThe European Central Bank and Bank of England are expected to take action when their monetary policy committees meet later this month. On the fiscal front, President Trump previewed his administration\u2019s plans to seek a payroll tax cut and assistance for impacted hourly workers and industries. Countries announcing fiscal measures just this month include Japan ($9.6 billion, or 0.19 percent of GDP), South Korea ($9.2 billion, 0.56 percent of GDP), and Italy ($4.1 billion, 0.20 percent of GDP). The adequacy of such spending will depend on the virus\u2019s path as well as the effectiveness of other measures to contain negative spillovers from the growth shock.\nIn terms of coordinated action, on March 6, the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors pledged to take \u201cappropriate\u201d fiscal and monetary measures but made no specific commitments. On a March 3 phone call, G7 finance ministers reaffirmed their \u201ccommitment to use all policy tools\u201d but did not outline specific steps. For their part, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank last week announced the availability of $50 billion and $12 billion in financing, respectively, to support low income and emerging market economies\u2019 responses to the virus.\nScientists do not yet have a clear understanding of the virus\u2019s behavior, transmission rate, and the full extent of contagion; uncertainty will be part of the backdrop for the foreseeable future. Coherent, coordinated, and credible policy responses provide the best chance at limiting the economic fallout from what is already and sadly a human tragedy.\nStephanie Segal is a senior fellow with the Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

Both the public and private sectors are scrambling to slow the spread of the illness and contain COVID-19 infections. While the full economic consequences of this black swan event are still unclear, we know that the effects that the virus\u2014and the drastic measures being taken to contain it\u2014are already precipitating change across industries. Here are the top three ways Business Insider Intelligence and eMarketer analysts think the pandemic is set to impact telecoms and technology, digital media, payments and commerce, fintech, banking, and healthcare.\neMarketer and Business Insider Intelligence have joined forces to become the leading research company focused on digital transformation. As we come together, we will feature relevant BII content on eMarketer.com. This feature can also be found on BII's site.\nTelecoms and Technology\n1. The clearest and most immediate business impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been a major disruption to supply chains. Having originated in China, the region was hit hard as a large number of citizens contracted the disease and many were forced into quarantine. This led to partial and full shutdowns of plants and factories, some of which were being used by prominent technology companies to manufacture their goods and products. For example, Apple experienced shortages on its iPhone supply as a result of the company's primary manufacturer, Foxconn, shutting down much of its production in China. Ultimately for Apple, this will lead to a significantly reduced forecast in iPhone shipments through Q1\u2014by as much as 10%, according to estimates by Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cited by MacRumors. And while companies often have contingency plans, which revolve around ramping up production in a region that isn't impacted, the rapid spread of the coronavirus across the globe makes it very difficult to pinpoint which regions would be least affected. Even then, the momentum and resources of the Chinese economy will not be easily replicated\u2014\"Made in China\" initiatives have seen the government invest billions in advanced manufacturing sectors, including telecommunications equipment and semiconductors.\n2. The spread of the coronavirus has caused several of the most important tech conferences to be canceled, likely resulting in numerous missed partnership opportunities. Most notably, Mobile World Congress (MWC), which was set to take place February 24-27 in Barcelona, was canceled due to concerns over the virus. MWC is a cornerstone event in the connectivity industry, as it brings together the most important companies in the space to network, share innovations and forge new business partnerships. Several companies rescheduled the events they had planned for MWC, but the continued presence of the coronavirus led others to cancel them entirely.  Beyond MWC, Facebook canceled its F8 developer conference and Global Marketing Summit; Google shifted its Google Cloud Next event to online only; and IBM likewise had to livestream its developer's conference, which last year hosted over 30,000 attendees. Altogether, the cancellation of major tech events has incurred over $1 billion in direct economic losses, according to estimates from PredictHQ cited by Recode.\nOnline alternatives have helped limit the fallout from canceled conferences, but tech industries will likely still suffer a period of stifled innovation due to forgone in-person business opportunities. Conference attendees do not have the same opportunities to network via live streaming as they do attending in-person events. It would be harder for marketers to casually share best practices over the live streamed Facebook Global Marketing Summit, for instance, than it would be if the event actually took place. Though it is difficult to quantify the value of these chance encounters or informal network sessions, the effects will undoubtedly be felt throughout the impacted industries.\n3. The growing need for remote interactions amid the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted a need for 5G technology, potentially accelerating adoption in the long term. 5G's lightning-fast speeds, near-instantaneous communications and increased connection density make it primed for remote interactions, which has become top of mind for many organizations and enterprises as caution mounts over the spread of the virus. Two key areas\u2014telehealth and teleconferencing\u2014are becoming critical for enterprise operations amid the pandemic, and we think that increased dependence on these areas will help strengthen the appeal of 5G:\nTelehealth: The technical superiority of the new standard empowers physicians to diagnose, treat and operate on patients without the need to be physically near them. We've already seen such use cases for 5G to combat coronavirus in China: In January, telecoms ZTE and China Telecom designed a 5G-powered system that enables remote consultations and diagnoses of the virus by connecting physicians at West China Hospital to 27 hospitals treating infected patients. Given the ability of 5G to expand the reach of expertise and services offered by hospitals in this time of increased need, we expect more hospitals will look to tap into 5G to take advantage of the benefits offered by the new standard.\nTeleconferencing: Many employers have increased their reliance on enterprise teleconferencing tools\u2014such as Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and Zoom\u2014as their employees switch to remote work due to public health concerns. We expect that employers' dependence on such tools during the coronavirus pandemic will strengthen the case for 5G connectivity in the home\u2014and in the office as enterprises recognize the value that teleconferencing tools offer. That's because a 5G connection will be able to provide real-time and uninterrupted communication that's not possible with most wired connections today.\nDigital Media\n1. Global media ad spending is likely to take a hit due to the coronavirus, according to newly revised eMarketer estimates, but for now nearly all of the related slowdown is attributable to China alone. In 2020, eMarketer expects total media ad spending worldwide will reach $691.70 billion, up by 7% from 2019, per its\u00a0updated forecast. That's a decrease from eMarketer's previous forecast, which estimated worldwide ad spending would rise by 7.4% to $712.02 billion this year. eMarketer's new forecasts were completed on March 6, 2020, and represent a full-year outlook.\nHere's a closer look at how eMarketer expects coronavirus to affect ad spending in China, the world's second-largest ad market:\nTotal ad spending. eMarketer now expects total media ad spending in China to reach $113.70 billion in 2020, down from the previous estimate of $121.13 billion.\nGrowth in total ad spending. eMarketer has downgraded China's 2020 ad spending growth rate to 8.4% from 10.5%, due to a reduction in spend across all media formats, including digital.\nGrowth in digital ad spending. eMarketer now expects digital ad spending in China to grow by 13% in 2020, compared with a previous estimate of 15.2%. While digital media consumption in China is increasing\u00a0as consumers spend more time at home, some advertisers are pulling back spend over concerns that supply chain shocks might keep them from getting products to market.\nBeyond China, the pandemic's impact on ad spending remains less clear\u2014here's a rundown of other potential consequences that could further dampen worldwide ad spending:\nCompanies with supply chains dependent on China might begin to reduce their ad spend as a way to mitigate economic losses. Already, there is evidence to suggest a slowdown\u00a0in Amazon ad spending, particularly among smaller third-party sellers that already have tighter cash flow. It's possible that this trend could extend to the other digital platforms if problems continue.\nOut-of-home (OOH) ad spending could see a negative impact due to social distancing and isolation measures. Consumers in countries with significant numbers of coronavirus cases are already avoiding\u00a0large public places and gatherings, and that may eventually impact advertisers' willingness to advertise in public spaces as well.\nAdditional event cancellations could cause advertisers to miss out on typically reliable, high-profile opportunities, which may not have appealing substitutes within the year. A significant number of cultural and industry events have been canceled or postponed over the past few weeks, ranging from Facebook's F8 developer conference to the NBA season. And just yesterday, the NCAA canceled its annual March Madness tournament, which was estimated to have generated $655.1 million in ad revenues last year, per Standard Media Index estimates cited by Ad Age. Still, the possibility of an even higher-profile cancellation looms: If the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo are postponed or canceled, that would cause a meaningful reduction in worldwide ad spending. To be clear, eMarketer's revised forecast assumes that the Olympics will still take place in June 2020 and do not account for the March Madness cancellation.\n2. The spread of coronavirus is likely to boost digital media consumption across the board as people spend more time at home and communicate in person less. In the US, where the effects of the virus are still relatively new, we expect digital media consumption to increase across social media, over-the-top video and online gaming\u2014similar to what we've already\u00a0seen in China.\nSocial networks could be a major beneficiary, as people turn to these platforms to connect with friends and family who may be at a distance or to access news content. Beyond encouraging more virtual conversation between family and friends, the fast-changing nature of the coronavirus could translate to more users tracking real-time news updates via social media. Despite the concerns they may have about tech companies' ability to act as a reliable information source, more than half (55%) of US adults got news from social media often or sometimes in 2019, up from 47% in 2018, per Pew Research Center. For context, in November 2019, eMarketer estimated\u00a0that US adults ages 18 and older would spend 54.56 minutes per day on social networks in 2020.\nStreaming video services are also likely to benefit as people seek out more entertainment or news content. The biggest bumps in usage and time spent are likely to go to dominant SVODs, like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, and could even drive some subscriber additions. Ad-supported VOD services like Roku Channel and Pluto TV could also see sizable lifts in usage and streaming hours, as these services can lend themselves to more lean-back viewing and feature some live national and local news programming options\u00a0that aren't available on most SVOD services.\nMedia platforms popular among young people could see a boost as kids and teens spend more time indoors, and in particular if school closures spread further. A few examples: family-friendly SVOD like Disney+; social platforms favored among young people like TikTok and YouTube; community-based live streaming platforms like Twitch; and interactive platforms like Fortnite, where young people go to hang out and explore virtual worlds.\n3. Coronavirus-driven event cancellations will spur marketers to explore digital alternatives and more event-like content promotion. The loss of notable industry events like Mobile World Congress, Facebook's F8 and the Adobe Summit can have significant costs for both conference hosts and the attendees\u201453% of US B2B marketers consider in-person events and trade shows an effective channel for driving conversion, according to a January 2020 survey from Demand Gen Report. Whether its client and customer meetings, dinners or informal gatherings, the lack of personal touchpoints this year will likely have a significant impact on sales rates and lead generation, something eMarketer principal analyst Jillian Ryan pointed out here .\nMarketers will have to get creative to find opportunities to deliver personal experiences to clients and customers from a distance\u2014here are two ways they're approaching it:\nMarketers are exploring the potential of virtual events. Even outside of the current context, digital conferences have some advantages over in-person events\u2014they're easily scalable, and the hosts can have greater control over the proceedings. And early evidence suggests consumers and clients are willing to attend less high-profile virtual events: Virtual exhibition platform V-Ex reported that over 50,000\u00a0people have recently visited its online digital trade shows and sales environments. Over the next few months, Adobe, Facebook, Google and YouTube will all host virtual versions of their popular conferences, which should give us a better sense of the format's potential as a replacement.\nMarketers are distributing content in a format that is more event-like. The core component of events for most marketers is the distribution of some form of content, whether it's information about new products, a new business strategy or a chance to build thought leadership. The wave of event cancellations is leading some marketers to reevaluate how they currently distribute digital content and consider emulating the personalized experiences provided by live events. To that end, Randy Frisch, CMO of content marketing platform Uberflip, told Business Insider Intelligence that a key aspect of such strategies is \"maintaining personalization over the entire course of the buyer journey as a potential client moves through a company's content.\" The trend could also place more emphasis on account-based marketing strategies, where marketers tailor content campaigns to smaller sets of target accounts, as opposed to the more organic approach typically relied upon for in-person settings.\nPayments\n1. Cashless payment adoption and usage could tick up worldwide. In response to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) is recommending that consumers pay contactlessly rather than with cash, if possible, as a means of limiting the virus' spread through microorganisms on cash. Some countries are taking this a step further: South Korea, for example, is quarantining all cash received at the central bank for two weeks before disinfecting it and putting it back into circulation, and China is undertaking similar efforts. Measures to restrict cash, combined with mounting concern that might push consumers to heed the WHO's advice, could boost noncash payments, which we already expect to grow at a 10.5% CAGR from 2019 to 2024\u2014particularly if similar measures are implemented in markets with heavier cash usage than in China and South Korea. This type of increased usage could speed up the adoption curve for these payments by attracting customers who would have otherwise continued using cash.\n2. Ecommerce is likely to grow as consumers eschew physical stores and crowded gathering places\u2014but this could create logistical challenges. Over a quarter (28%) of US internet users are already avoiding public areas or travel, and 58% plan to if the situation worsens\u2014and it already has since this survey was conducted\u2014per Coresight Research data. This avoidance is trickling down into shopping: Three-quarters (74.6%) of US internet users said they'd be likely to avoid shopping centers and malls if the coronavirus outbreak in the country worsens, and over half would avoid shops in general. A decline in brick-and-mortar retail, which comprises over 85% of US retail sales, could shift day-to-day shopping to digital channels, like Amazon or other e-tailers, and boost sales\u2014effects already seen by providers like RedMart in Singapore, per CNBC. Further, it could bolster use of omnichannel commerce, like buy online, pick up in-store (BOPUS), for customers who want to shop in-store but avoid crowds. Such a surge in demand for e-tail could overwhelm logistics providers and workers, which might require ecommerce companies to revisit their strategies for order fulfillment and delivery, including potentially slowing down fast-shipping strategies, in order to keep up with surging demand and keep workers safe. It's worth noting that changes in online shopping habits may be particularly prevalent among older customers\u2014the group most susceptible to the coronavirus and most likely to avoid stores because of it, but least likely to shop online. A shift toward online shopping among this population could provide a short-term boost for sellers, but in the longer term, it may also increase sales if these customers continue shopping online after the outbreak subsides.\n3. Delivery services across the board might see an onslaught of new customers, but they'll have to work to maintain consumer trust. If consumers continue avoiding public places, they're likely to look for digital services that fulfill everyday needs beyond retail, including delivery of food and on-demand goods, per Marketwatch\u2014which in turn could lead to an increase in business for delivery organizations, including Grubhub, Postmates and DoorDash, as well as for online grocers like Instacart and FreshDirect. China is already seeing an uptick in demand for these offerings: Popular delivery platform Meituan has seen an increase in large orders and surging demand for online grocery, per Business Insider. Depending on how long the pandemic and social distancing measures last, grocery and other delivery providers might need to provide discounts, offer loans, or provide installment tools that can help consumers afford services. And in order to maintain consumer trust, couriers also have to be prepared to demonstrate good health and offer \"contactless\" delivery options to minimize risk\u2014something a number of firms, including Instacart and Postmates, are already beginning to implement.\nWhile individual sectors are likely to grow, however, payments companies are anticipating an overall downturn in business as consumer spending falls. Last week, the National Retail Federation (NRF) noted that the coronavirus could impact business confidence and hit retail sales overall in the US\u2014a trend that's likely to be seen worldwide. Such a decline would come predominantly from a downturn in consumer confidence (especially after a string of poor days for the stock market), but could also result from supply and inventory challenges. As a result, any transaction or volume increase that payments and commerce companies see in segments like digital volume or ecommerce would likely be countered by an overall decline in spending\u2014the likely reason driving firms like PayPal, Mastercard and Visa to revise revenue estimates downward.\nFintech\n1. Fintech funding totals will be down for Q1 2020\u2014a dry spell that could potentially persist through a large chunk of the year. Global fintech funding was up 30% in 2019 (when excluding Ant Financial's unusually large $14 billion round in 2018), but as the virus slows down economies globally, 2020 levels may come in far lower. Fintechs should prepare for a less funding-friendly environment in 2020, especially with the magnitude of the coronavirus still being unclear, as investors will likely fly toward safety amid the economic uncertainty\u2014and away from the relatively riskier venture of investing in startups. They can brace themselves by shifting focus to a more sustainable business model that isn't reliant on the constant influx of external investor money.\n2. As the stock market continues to fluctuate, consumers will be wary of investing and flock to savings options. Stock markets have been highly volatile in the past few weeks, largely due to the coronavirus, while many fear a global recession. And the Federal Reserve has already implemented an emergency rate cut\u2014marking the biggest one-time cut in the US since the financial crisis\u2014indicating that the virus is already impacting the economy. Amid such volatility, consumers may be less keen to invest their savings in the stock market, impacting digital wealth managers that conventionally make money by charging customers fees that are a percentage of assets under management. On the flip side, more consumers might seek out savings options for their money, as a less risky way to build their wealth, so platforms like Goldman Sachs' Marcus may see an uptick in demand as a result.\n3. If consumers reduce their spending, more small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) might have to turn to loans to bridge the demand gap\u2014giving alt lenders an opportunity to boost their businesses. Consumers remaining at home will likely lead to reduced spending at brick-and-mortar shops, which would be especially harmful for SMBs, as 44% of small businesses have not taken any measures to prepare for a potential recession. Additionally, 69% of small businesses in the UK are already experiencing cash flow issues related to the coronavirus, according to data from MarketFinance seen by Business Insider Intelligence. Hence, many businesses might have to seek out external funding sources, like loans, to weather the storm and remain operational. This could boost uptake of services from alt lenders like iwoca and OakNorth that offer quick funding options, such as short-term loans.\nBanking\n1. A potential drop in branch visits could shine a spotlight on banks' digital capabilities and customer experiences. The pandemic could reduce total branch visits by forcing banks to temporarily close branches or reduce their hours\u2014as in Hong Kong\u2014or by discouraging customers from visiting to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. As customers will still need access to their money, however, this could lead to a spike in activity in digital channels and call centers, making digital the primary channel for a greater portion of customers across the world. This migration to nonbranch channels will benefit banks that enable customers to handle a wide range of banking functions through online or phone channels while hurting those with more limited offerings, and it will test their ability to handle the increased strain of higher volume. Beyond whether or not customers can carry out banking functions through alternative channels, greater usage will test how easy to use those channels are, especially for first-time users whose usage is a direct result of coronavirus concerns. For that reason, banks should strive to simplify their online and call center interfaces or roll out information and educational materials that instruct customers on how to make the most of nonbranch channels to manage their funds.\n2. Falling central bank interest rates are likely to hurt savings account interest rates that some banks rely on to acquire customers and drive deposits. Central banks across the globe have been making emergency rate cuts to cushion their economies as the coronavirus threatens growth, The New York Times reported. This will encourage more loan activity from banks and discourage them from offering high interest rates on savings accounts for the sake of profit margins. Therefore, these rate cuts are likely to put pressure on banks that wield high-yield savings accounts in order to pull in new business. Goldman Sachs' Marcus digital bank is an example: Its interest rate on savings accounts stood at 2.15% in July, but it has eroded\u00a0to 1.7% since then. On the other hand, Australian neobank Xinja has taken a drastically contrasting approach, choosing to hold its 2.25% interest rate steady, despite a central bank rate cut, but suspending new account opening to limit costs.\n3. Consumers who can't go to work could drive short-term loan and credit activity. Only half of the US workforce holds a job that is compatible with at least partial telework, per data from the American Community Survey analyzed by Global Workplace Analytics. This could pose a problem for the other 50% of workers who must be physically present in the workplace to earn a paycheck, as forced or voluntary shutdowns of businesses due to the coronavirus could effectively prevent them from earning an income. The consumers in this group who live paycheck to paycheck will need temporary solutions to tide them over in this event, which could yield a spike in business for banks and credit unions that offer small to medium-sized loans. Marcus is a good example here as well, offering loans between $3,500 and $40,000, with terms ranging from 36 to 72 months. And UK banks like RBS and Lloyds are offering heightened credit card limits among other resources to clients to help them weather the storm, per The Guardian.\nHealthcare\n1. Digital health firms have an opportunity to fill in gaps in care and assist healthcare incumbents prepare for, contain and diagnose the coronavirus\u2014which could lead to increases even after coronavirus outbreaks.\nTelemedicine providers are extending the reach of healthcare professionals as patients are being advised to seek care from the comfort of their homes. One of the top pieces of advice to inhibit the spread of the coronavirus being passed along to the US public by health organizations is to limit time spent in public settings. And so, the US government is encouraging consumers to turn to virtual consultations with docs in nonurgent situations in lieu of making trips to the hospital. With more people being steered toward virtual care, telemedicine providers are seeing substantial upticks in use. One such firm, PlushCare, has witnessed a 40% bump in appointment volume since December\u2014a month before the first case was reported in the US. For context, the company reports seeing a 10% increase in volume during flu season generally. And we think that as US consumers\u2014the large majority of whom had never tried telemedicine in 2019\u2014get more comfortable with telemedicine now, they will continue to rely on the tech once coronavirus outbreaks subside, providing telemedicine providers with long-term growth opportunities.\nCompanies touting AI-powered remote monitoring tools are granting clinicians the ability to keep track of patients' health from afar in real time. The increased need for medical pros to implement remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems is also attributed to the importance of social distancing during outbreaks, which is likely making developers of RPM solutions alluring partners. For example, Boston-based Biofourmis has teamed up with clinical researchers in Hong Kong to clear the way for speedy connection with quarantined patients. Biofourmis deploys a biosensor to accumulate biological data and AI-based analytics to catch any changes to health, allowing medical pros to remotely monitor patients and step in when necessary. Similar to telemedicine, the necessity to start implementing these solutions now could pave the way for increased adoption among healthcare pros and their patients moving forward.\nHealth tech firms are implementing alert systems that grant busy doctors access to the latest updates on the coronavirus without needing to leave their normal workflows. Because agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are providing frequent updates about the coronavirus, it's necessary for healthcare firms to stay on top of the latest developments. However, this could prove difficult for inundated organizations that need to step outside of their workflows to get this information. That's why it's beneficial to have\u00a0timely outbreak updates\u00a0inputted directly into EHR systems. And digital health firm OptimizeRx is doing just that: The company is embedding CDC alerts about the coronavirus into its cloud-based platform deployed by leading EHR firms to ensure clinicians are granted access to the latest coronavirus-related info. Its ability to link providers with the most recent news should boost OptimzeRx's value in the eyes of partners, and we should see EHR vendors racing to include tools that give providers access to real-time updates.\n2. Cloud developers have a chance to tie up with researchers and drugmakers scrambling to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The computing capabilities of cloud developers can be utilized to speed up drug development, and we've seen innovative digital health firms leverage the tech in their efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine. For example, Massachusetts-based biotech Moderna\u2014which uses Amazon Web Services' (AWS') cloud capabilities\u2014is collaborating with several US government health agencies to create a vaccine for the coronavirus. By leveraging AWS' cloud computing expertise, Moderna was able to develop a cancer vaccine in just 40 days, underscoring the promise of cloud computing technology to potentially develop a viable coronavirus vaccine\u2014which government officials have said could take over a year. And with representatives from big tech firms including Google, Amazon and Microsoft recently meeting with the White House to discuss a response to the coronavirus, we expect to see a growing number of collaborations between cloud developers, researchers and pharmaceutical companies as they concentrate their efforts on tackling the novel coronavirus.\n3. The spread of the illness is forcing the government's hand to slacken some restrictions on access to virtual care\u2014but we're unsure their actions are going far enough. Last week, President Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending plan to address the coronavirus and quell its spread\u2014and the bill includes a plan to allot $500 million to stamp down some of the blockades that bar Medicare members from accessing telehealth. For example, it lifted the rule that only seniors in certain geographic locations could use telehealth. Boosting access for seniors is crucial considering older people are at higher risk for developing fatal coronavirus cases, but we're unsure the bill is combating limitations aggressively enough. For example, in order for a physician to virtually consult with a patient, the physician has to have engaged in telemedicine consultations with that same patient within the last three years. Thus, if a patient has never partaken in remote consultations\u2014which is likely true for the large majority of seniors\u2014they could be disqualified from using telemedicine.\nAnd while healthcare stakeholders are increasingly turning to digital tools now, certain segments of healthcare, like home healthcare, require in-person interactions\u2014underscoring some of health tech's limitations in times of crisis. Home healthcare encompasses many forms of care, ranging from assistance with activities like bathing and dressing to skilled nursing. And although the use of digital solutions such as telemedicine could help seniors access virtual consultations, their reach can extend only so far. For example, administering medications to immobile patients requires in-person interactions, which virtual technologies are currently unable to replace.\nArticle\nArticle\nApple sharpens payments

Our plan was to publish an update on the virus\u2019s implications for business for as many weeks as the news felt urgent. We did not expect to continue for more than two years, nor to ever publish briefing note #100, as we have today.\nIt\u2019s painful to reflect on these 100 editions, on the millions of lives lost, the suffering and grief, and the myriad disruptions to lives and livelihoods. But in what is perhaps a hopeful sign, we now feel the time is right to stop. COVID-19 news seems less urgent than at any time in the past two years. All of McKinsey\u2019s published work now intrinsically accounts for the pandemic, even if it is not directly mentioned. COVID-19 has gone from being a fresh emergency to a fact of life.\nIn a few weeks, we will relaunch this weekly report with links to the latest McKinsey publications. Our new theme will be sustainable and inclusive growth. After more than two years of reporting on a destructive force, we look forward to sharing our research and thoughts on how people and organizations can build a better world.\nMcKinsey is already exploring how to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, the topic of the inaugural episode of the new Future of America podcast. McKinsey Global Institute director and senior partner Kweilin Ellingrud and senior partner Greg Kelly discuss how leading companies can use the pandemic recovery as an opportunity to accelerate prosperity for more Americans. Customers and consumers want to be associated with companies that are making a positive difference. Companies can accelerate inclusivity and sustainability by having real awareness, committing to change, rewarding the change, and providing coaching and development to make the change happen.\nAfter more than two years of reporting on a destructive force, we look forward to sharing our research and thoughts on how people and organizations can build a better world.\nMuch near-term growth will arise from a once-in-a-lifetime wave of capital spending on physical assets between now and 2027. This surge of roughly $130 trillion in investment will flood into projects to decarbonize and renew critical infrastructure. But few organizations are prepared to deliver on this capital influx with the speed and efficiency it demands. Companies should consider implementing a portfolio-synergistic strategy in which planning is top down, a major business challenge requiring savvy stakeholder management, capital markets expertise, and an understanding of complex approval processes.\nSustainable, inclusive growth will require changing the workplace to maximize the contributions of all people. In the COVID-19 era, women across all sectors have shouldered more household responsibilities, and more women report feelings of burnout. These problems can be more acute for women in healthcare, who have fewer opportunities to work remotely and report feeling greater pressure to prioritize work over family. In spite of these challenges, healthcare continues to outperform other sectors in the representation of women, who make up more than two-thirds of entry-level employees and 53 percent of employees in roles at the senior-manager level or above, which is 18 percentage points higher than the average across all sectors.\nEach sector, industry, and function will have to reinvent itself to achieve maximum growth and sustainability. Procurement leaders, for example, are facing one of the toughest market environments of their careers. Procurement organizations need to take a leading role in protecting enterprise margin and growth, invest in proven technology and process automation, and build deep expertise in supply market dynamics, among other fundamental changes. A pair of articles featuring McKinsey and outside experts explore how the CFO\u2019s role is also rapidly evolving \u2014expanding in scope, requiring new capabilities, and demanding greater collaboration with C-suite peers. Among the most significant changes to the role is the demand for CFOs to help promote capability building and talent development within their organizations.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nLithium is needed to produce virtually all batteries currently used in electric vehicles (EVs) as well as consumer electronics. We believe the world will secure enough lithium for the EV revolution, as long as new mining technologies and potential mining sites receive funding and end users communicate upcoming needs so that lithium miners have enough time to react.\nOur interactive explores how fashion is finding ways to participate in the metaverse.\nMcKinsey\u2019s methodology can be used to prioritize investments in innovations based on the economic impact of the health improvements they deliver to society.\nOur latest edition of McKinsey for Kids explores how programmers use games to teach computers how to think, ultimately developing AI. Kids can read, take quizzes, and watch animations to learn about how the human brain and computers are both alike and different and about a cornerstone of AI programming called \u201creinforcement learning.\u201d\nIn our latest edition of Author Talks, neuroscience expert and Cognitas Group cofounder Dr. Laura Watkins discusses her new book (coauthored with Vanessa Dietzel), The Performance Curve: Maximize Your Potential at Work while Strengthening Your Well-being (Bloomsbury Publishing, November 2021). Using insights from neuroscience, adult development psychology, yoga, and behavioral therapy, the book proposes practical ways to improve work performance without sacrificing mental or physical health.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #99, April 6, 2022\nSome pandemic effects will take a long time to cure.\nCOVID-19 appears to be moving to endemicity in some parts of the world. But even in these places, some of the pandemic\u2019s damaging consequences are only now being assessed and understood. This week, McKinsey studied the degrees of learning loss suffered by students around the world. We also looked at the pandemic\u2019s lingering effects on the airline industry and on labor markets and examined how long it might take for some things to go back to how they used to be and why others never will.\nOn average, students globally are eight months behind where they would have been absent the COVID-19-pandemic, but the impact varies widely (exhibit). Within countries, the pandemic also widened gaps between historically vulnerable students and more privileged peers. We estimate by 2040, unfinished learning related to COVID-19 could translate to annual losses of $1.6 trillion to the global economy. Educational systems could consider a tiered approach to support reengagement, with more support (including social and emotional) for the highest-risk students.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused airline revenues to drop by 60 percent in 2020, and air travel and tourism are not expected to return to 2019 levels before 2024. Challenges vary across the global aviation landscape. In particular, airlines need to bolster their resilience by increasing their cash reserves, which would reduce the need for bailouts every time a crisis hits, and by improving their ability to reduce supply quickly and cost-effectively when demand abruptly falls. McKinsey\u2019s latest survey of more than 5,500 air travelers globally revealed a potential long-term challenge: the share of respondents who say they plan to fly less to minimize their environmental impact rose five percentage points since 2019 to 36 percent, and more than half of respondents said that aviation should become carbon neutral in the future. \u201cFlygskam,\u201d or shame about flying, plays a role. Leading airlines that build a brand promise on sustainability will likely attract a growing share of business.\nIn a current episode of McKinsey Talks Talent, McKinsey talent experts Bryan Hancock and Bill Schaninger discuss the power workers have gained as an indirect effect of the pandemic. Although there has been some high-profile organizing activity, the real source of worker power comes from the current high demand for labor and because remote workers have a wider-than-ever range of job choices.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nOn the latest episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Sven Smit, senior partner and chair of the McKinsey Global Institute, discussed some potential effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Refugee numbers may climb from the current few million to ten or even 15 million. The potential doubling or even tripling of food and energy prices could cause hardship for less well-off populations around the world.\nDistributors can learn from Amazon Business and other large digital players that are building best-in-class distribution networks and offering products they used to avoid due to technical or supply chain challenges.\nPaper and forest product CEOs should consider future-proofing companies with strategies such as \u201cprecision forestry\u201d;  by leading on environmental, social, and governance (ESG); and by harnessing digital and analytics capabilities to strengthen competitiveness.\nThe semiconductor industry\u2019s aggregate annual growth could average from 6 to 8 percent a year up to 2030, resulting in a $1 trillion industry. Amid the growth of remote working, AI, and demand for electric vehicles, manufacturers and designers should now take stock and ensure they are best placed to reap the rewards.\nGeneral and administrative functions can optimize for speed and flexibility by eliminating the silos that traditionally occur between different departments. This will drive better cross-department coordination and allow leaders to realign staff more efficiently.\nHealth provider systems could prioritize efforts to meet patients\u2019 unmet needs by creating partnerships with schools, community organizations, payers, private businesses, and government agencies.\nIn 2020, Californians bought and wore more than 500,000 tons of clothing, almost all of which will eventually enter landfills covering an area about 3.5 times the size of the City of Los Angeles. The key to reducing fashion waste is circularity \u2014building a closed loop for recycling materials back into the manufacturing process.\nOur latest edition of McKinsey for Kids explores how programmers use games to teach computers how to think, ultimately developing AI. Kids can read, take quizzes, and watch animations to learn about how the human brain and computers are both alike and different and about a cornerstone of AI programming called \u201creinforcement learning.\u201d\nIn our latest edition of Author Talks, Todd Rose, a former Harvard University professor and the cofounder of the think tank Populace, discusses his latest book, Collective Illusions: Conformity, Complicity, and the Science of Why We Make Bad Decisions (Hachette Book Group, February 2022). The book explores why people are likely to buy into fundamental misunderstandings of what most people think.\nAlso in Author Talks, we spoke with Amy Zegart, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Freeman Spogli Institute at Stanford University, where she is also a professor of political science. Zegart discussed her new book, Spies, Lies, and Algorithms: The History and Future of American Intelligence (Princeton University Press, February 2022). The book explores the current state of intelligence, why the government is behind on adopting new technologies, and what the public misunderstands about the spy business.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #98, March 30, 2022\nOne of COVID-19\u2019s health effects is the transformation of healthcare.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic devastated the world\u2019s health but may leave a lasting legacy of improving how the world addresses healthcare. The effort to develop and distribute vaccines demonstrated how much can be achieved with global collaboration, lessons that can be applied to ambitious improvements in well-being. This week, McKinsey explored how the pandemic changed healthcare approaches, including expectations, delivery, viral-vector gene therapy, investment, and consumer attitudes.\nHumanity mobilized against COVID-19 at a speed and scale previously unseen. While far from perfect, the undertaking\u2019s successes should inspire the world to challenge the view of what is possible. Over the past century, life expectancy has dramatically increased in most parts of the world, but the portion of life that human beings spend in moderate and poor health hasn\u2019t changed (exhibit). The McKinsey Health Institute believes humanity could add roughly six years per person on average of higher-quality life by making six major shifts in how the world approaches health.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nEven when COVID-19 becomes endemic, healthcare delivery in the United States will continue to transform rapidly. McKinsey\u2019s 14th annual healthcare conference explored the next wave of industry evolution and how healthcare organizations must innovate to thrive. The future of care delivery is evolving to become patient-centric, virtual, ambulatory, in the home, value based, and risk bearing. It will be driven by data and analytics, enabled by new medical technologies, and funded by private investors.\nCOVID-19 accelerated viral-vector gene therapies. Some of the earliest viral-vector-based therapies targeting rare diseases required companies to produce only about 1,000 doses across development, access programs, and two years of commercialization. In comparison, the unprecedented demand and funding for COVID-19 vaccines enabled a ten- to 100-fold increase in production when adjusted by dose amount, with over two billion doses of the AstraZeneca viral-vector-based vaccine already produced. Keeping pace with increasing demand requires the consideration of challenges, the potential for standardization, and strategizing for accelerating patient access.\nIn light of growing opportunities, private investors are pouring into healthcare. That becomes clear throughout McKinsey\u2019s annual Global Private Markets Review, which delves into the data and details of a wide range of private markets asset classes, including private equity, debt, real estate, and infrastructure investing. Healthcare is a recurring theme in this year\u2019s report: in 2021, the healthcare sector had the fastest deal-volume growth globally since 2016. Of the largest ten private equity deals in 2021, three were in healthcare, and the largest deal involved a manufacturer and distributor of healthcare supplies. Many of the top 20 private equity firms have dedicated teams for healthcare, which speaks to its growing importance within the\nasset class.\nThe number of vaccinated US respondents in McKinsey\u2019s Consumer Health Insights Survey has remained about the same since November of 2021, when 77 percent reported that they were vaccinated. Approximately 75 percent of respondents to the February survey reported that they\u2019d been vaccinated; in addition, 63 percent of vaccinated respondents plan to stay current on COVID-19 vaccinations as recommended by healthcare leaders. Consumers are increasingly comfortable testing for COVID-19 at home; in fact, it now ranks as the most preferred testing location. Additionally, more than half of respondents indicated that they would prefer a health plan with virtual-health benefits.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nIn the next decade, expect giant leaps in outer space. In the latest edition of McKinsey\u2019s multimedia The Next Normal series, \u201c The future of space: It\u2019s getting crowded out there ,\u201d McKinsey experts and industry executives envision the space industry\u2019s near future.\nInflation could challenge the buying power of the Department of Defense (DOD) for the $773 million budget approved for fiscal year 2023. To address these risks, the DOD and industry leaders should increase affordability, improve inventory management, and develop better contracts that will help both buyers and sellers if costs rise.\nThe US construction sector faces a labor mismatch. In October 2021, 402,000 construction positions in the United States remained unfilled at the end of the month. That\u2019s a headwind for a sector that our modeling suggests could create 3.2 million new jobs across the nonresidential-construction value chain over the next decade.\nMore than one-fifth of global greenhouse-gas emissions come from agriculture, making the development and consumer adoption of alternative proteins a meaningful opportunity to reduce negative climate impacts. Top executives from alternative meat companies spoke to McKinsey about opportunities and challenges facing the industry.\nOn the latest episode of The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partner Mekala Krishnan talks about how companies can get started on the path to net-zero emissions.\nOn the McKinsey on Consumer and Retail Podcast, McKinsey retail experts Tiffany Burns and Tyler Harris discuss five things retailers need to improve in omnichannel sales, including making the experience more seamless for customers and getting products to customers faster.\nIn our latest edition of Author Talks, Tessa West, an NYU associate professor of psychology, talks about her new book, Jerks at Work: Toxic Coworkers and What to Do about Them (Portfolio, January 2022). If anyone in the C-suite embraces jerk behaviors, it\u2019s going to trickle down through the company because jerkish behavior is contagious at work, she says.\nAlso in Author Talks, science journalist Catherine Price discusses her new book, The Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again (The Dial Press, December 2021). People can improve their mental and physical health by getting in touch with what is really fun for them and making it a priority\u2014rather than just vegging out in front of a screen, she says.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #97, March 23, 2022\nUncertainty returns\u2014but this time, the cause is not COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created short-term disruptions and provoked long-term changes in how the world lives and does business. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is now doing the same. This week, McKinsey published on what we know about the war and some of its possible global consequences. Among them are likely impacts to supply chains and how companies think about preparing for crises, two of our other topics this week. Another article provides a hopeful look at the investment pouring into decarbonization and renewal of infrastructure.\nWe, like many others, are shocked by the unfolding humanitarian tragedy resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine (exhibit).\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nAs a result of the war in Ukraine, the era of not looking too closely at supply chains, trusting suppliers, and optimizing for cost is probably over. Those behaviors, already made suspect by new tariff regimes and the COVID-19 pandemic, are now likely to be consigned to history. Our latest research finds that despite progress over the past several years, companies are still struggling to build the capabilities that their emerging digital supply chains need. The most effective capability-building programs invest in foundational, end-to-end supply chain knowledge building, coupled with advanced functional, technical, and leadership training.\nAs in any conflict, uncertainty is high, although it is already certain that global consequences will include disruptions to energy and food markets, testing many companies\u2019 resilience. McKinsey\u2019s annual global board survey of approximately 1,500 corporate directors found that a mere 7 percent of respondents gave their boards the highest rating for risk management, and only 40 percent say their organizations are prepared for the next large crisis. On the Inside the Strategy Room podcast, McKinsey senior adviser Nora Aufreiter; senior partner Celia Huber, who leads McKinsey\u2019s board services work in North America; and associate partner Ophelia Usher discussed how boards can improve how they handle big crises.\nThe world will see a once-in-a-lifetime wave of capital spending on physical assets between now and 2027. Roughly $130 trillion will flood into projects to decarbonize and renew critical infrastructure. But it won\u2019t be easy: constructing and justifying the cost of a physical asset such as a manufacturing plant is much more difficult than it was decades ago, given inflation, rigorous sustainability requirements, and rapid changes in technology and regulations.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated online purchases and package deliveries at an unprecedented rate. Even conservative estimates project that cross-border e-commerce in goods will expand to about $1 trillion in merchandise value by 2030, from its current value of approximately $300 billion. Regulations and tariffs are also likely to increase, as are customer expectations for speed, decentralized supply chains, and specialist segments.\nThe increasing frequency and magnitude of economic volatility have put more pressure on traditional financial planning and analysis (FP&A) processes and teams. Next-level FP&A teams have figured out how to build more speed and flexibility into their processes, which can trigger more efficient and effective operations throughout the company.\nHealth equity is an opportunity and a challenge for pharmaceutical and life sciences players. By following the data and by working together, organizations can meet needs and create a cycle of trust in underserved communities.\nDebra Facktor, head of U.S. Space Systems for Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, spoke to McKinsey about her job responsibilities, the future of the aerospace sector, and her experience as a woman in a male-dominated industry.\nOn the McKinsey Talks Operations podcast, Bruce Lawler, managing director for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Machine Intelligence for Manufacturing and Operations program, and Vijay D\u2019Silva, senior partner emeritus at McKinsey, discussed why some companies are pulling ahead of others with machine learning.\nOn the Inside the Strategy Room podcast, Robert Uhlaner, who co-led McKinsey\u2019s Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice until his retirement this summer, and Liz Wol, the global leader of McKinsey\u2019s work on M&A capability building, discussed programmatic M&A. This approach to mergers and acquisitions has proven to be the most successful at delivering results\u2014provided you execute it right.\nOur latest edition of Author Talks features Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code and an activist for women\u2019s economic empowerment, discussing her new book, Pay Up: The Future of Women and Work (and Why It\u2019s Different Than You Think) (Atria/One Signal Publishers, March 2022). Working mothers are overburdened and exhausted, so companies that want them to come back to the workforce need to help with childcare, paid leave, and mental-health support.\nAlso in Author Talks, retired Navy SEAL commander Rich Diviney talks about his book, The Attributes: 25 Hidden Drivers of Optimum Performance (Random House, January 2021). Diviney dives into how we can\u2014and should\u2014assess and develop our own attributes, equipping ourselves for optimum performance within our lives and throughout our careers.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #96, March 16, 2022\nOn the second anniversary of the COVID-19-pandemic, we reflect on what we\u2019ve learned.\nJust over two years ago, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Since then, one in every 1,300 people alive in 2019 has died from infection with SARS-CoV-2. Two years on, it is easy to forget how remarkable the development of COVID-19 vaccines was: moving in just 326 days from a genomic sequence to the authorization of a vaccine shattered all previous records.\nFor this anniversary, we reflected on ten core lessons of the pandemic (see sidebar), some of which exposed fault lines in our society and others that demonstrated amazing capabilities. A separate initiative compiled two years\u2019 worth of research on pandemic impacts, while a third article examined how the pandemic set input prices rising and what to do about it.\nSidebar\nTen core lessons of the pandemic\nAs part of our examination of where the pandemic took us and what\u2019s next, we\u2019ve gathered interviews and articles about COVID-19 from the past two years. Interviews with General James Mattis; Steven M. Jones, co-inventor of the first Ebola vaccine; and McKinsey senior partner Shubham Singhal addressed the crisis as it occurred. Packages of articles examining the pandemic\u2019s effects on areas including healthcare, operations, and sustainable and inclusive growth show how industries have been shaped by the experience and how leaders are looking toward the future.\nThe aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to rock the global economy. Following the shutdowns of 2020 and the supply chain challenges of 2021, another wave of disruptions is now breaking over businesses around the world: rising input prices. Accurate cost models and advanced digital operations help organizations respond to rising costs and equip them with the tools and capabilities they need to thrive when prices fall.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nCybersecurity threats are growing and threaten companies of all sizes, municipalities, and state and federal governments. The solution is to reinforce defenses by anticipating emerging cyberthreats and understanding the new defensive capabilities that companies can use today and others they can plan to use tomorrow.\nOn the McKinsey on Healthcare podcast, Errol Pierre, senior vice president of state programs at Healthfirst, discusses what New York\u2019s largest not-for-profit insurer learns from working with diverse communities.\nBy 2020, 40 years after the development of the first commercial machines, the additive-manufacturing sector had become a \u20ac13.4 billion industry. As technical barriers fall, the onus is on manufacturers to build skills, processes, and business models.\nMcKinsey\u2019s second annual review of the progress of digitization in German healthcare shows solid uptakes of telemedicine and consumer health apps, but lagging use of e-prescriptions, health-data exchange, and use of electronic health records.\nMcKinsey and Club 21e Si\u00e8cle created the French Corporate Diversity Barometer to measure the diversity of national origins and socioeconomic backgrounds of the executives of large companies in France.\nPrioritizing privacy, sustainability, and inclusion will soon be essential to successful tech development. Companies must provide the tools, training, and resources for product managers to make responsible innovation ubiquitous.\nInternal-combustion-engine suppliers must manage uncertainty during these challenging times for the industry. To succeed, they will need a new operating model that includes formulating dynamic responses to continuing disruptions and focusing on building value through higher return on invested capital.\nSustainability and digital (particularly e-commerce) will create significant challenges for packaging industry leaders, as well as once-in-a-lifetime transformational opportunities.\nThis week, McKinsey senior partners Carolyn Dewar, Scott Keller, and Vik Malhotra launch their new book, CEO Excellence: The Six Mindsets That Distinguish the Best Leaders from the Rest (Scribner, March 2022). The authors spoke about their interviews with 67 CEOs as part of our Author Talks series and how they identified the traits that separate the best leaders from the pack.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #95, March 9, 2022\nAnother global crisis is now overshadowing COVID-19.\nFor the first time in two years, concerns about another global crisis overshadowed the COVID-19 pandemic: the Russian government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian tragedy it is causing. Implications for the world economy will become more visible in the coming weeks and months; this week, McKinsey identified some immediate global economic impacts.\nCoincidentally, our other major publishing initiative this week is a deep dive into insurance\u2014an industry that exists, in essence, in case things go wrong.\nThe Russian government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is causing a humanitarian crisis and economic risks. Our Global Economics Intelligence executive summary for February discusses how the invasion of Ukraine has mostly set energy prices surging. The oil price (Brent) was near $60 per barrel on December 1 but climbed steadily thereafter, touching $100 in late February. The price of natural gas and coal has similarly climbed during this period (exhibit). Prior to the invasion, the US dollar was depreciating slightly against most major currencies; it is now rising in value. Other immediate economic effects were spikes in the prices of gold, crude oil, and natural gas, as well as stock market losses.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nAs part of our celebration of International Women\u2019s Day 2022, 20 female McKinsey partners offer insights in a series of interviews on the insurance industry. Topics include operations, growth, claims management, underwriting, product innovation, digital business building, and motor insurance. Further interviews examine women\u2019s representation in the insurance industry and look at the broader issue of diversity in insurance.\nNew customer expectations, low interest rates, and new sources of competition (such as leading tech companies, insurtechs, and third-party capital) are putting pressure on insurance carriers to be more innovative. It\u2019s not easy: successfully profiting from innovation is a complex, company-wide endeavor, and most insurers have not yet consistently cracked this code. Steps for building innovation into the way an organization works include shifting resources from core business tasks to breakthrough innovation initiatives and developing distinct product-development pathways and processes.\nInsurers should consider programmatic M&A: systematically acquiring small to midsize businesses, services, and capabilities and integrating them as new businesses or capabilities. Insurers can use this approach to tackle issues including sustaining growth in core life and annuity businesses and enhancing property and casualty presence in growth markets.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nOn The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partners Michael Chui and Mark Collins share their thoughts on the findings of McKinsey\u2019s latest Internet of Things (IoT) report. Fast-growing areas include consumer applications (especially in the connected home); hospital, acute-care, and residential-care settings; and factories, cities, and work sites. Integrating IoT is often easier in greenfield settings but harder to integrate into legacy environments.\nOf 346 large M&A deals announced between 2013 and 2020, 47 were canceled for antitrust or regulatory reasons. While executing remedy separations, it is vital to adhere to the perimeter set by regulators, move fast in identifying potential buyers, and ensure a close integration between the remedy separation process and the overall transaction and integration process.\nIn this edition of Author Talks, Deepa Purushothaman talks about her new book, The First, the Few, the Only: How Women of Color Can Redefine Power in Corporate America (Harper Collins, March 2022). Drawing on more than 500 original interviews, Purushothaman examines work life for women of color and what needs to change to improve their experiences.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #94, March 3, 2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may finally be ending.\nA new variant may yet trigger another chapter in the COVID-19 pandemic, and societies must be prepared to respond if and when that happens. But for now, the pandemic phase looks to be ending. With a possible conclusion in sight, this week McKinsey focused on how postpandemic workforces can be supported with expanded opportunity, digital tools, more equitable promotions, and better office design.\nIn the latest edition of our \u201c When will the COVID-19 pandemic end ?\u201d series, McKinsey examined scenarios that would lead to either reigniting a pandemic-level crisis or further steps toward endemicity. As long as Omicron remains the dominant variant, there is reason for relative optimism; in the United States, for example, hospitalizations would remain low (exhibit). By and large, the six-month outlook in many countries is brighter than at any time in the past two years. The main risk to the transition to endemicity is a significantly different and more severe new variant that replaces Omicron as the dominant strain.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nThe latest episode of the McKinsey Global Institute\u2019s Forward Thinking podcast features David Autor, the Ford Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Autor identifies pandemic paradoxes, which include that many thought US poverty and joblessness would skyrocket, but the opposite occurred when poverty rates plummeted to unprecedented lows and the United States ended up with a labor shortage. Leaders should think about ways to expand opportunities, including by being honest with themselves and the labor market about which jobs truly require a college degree.\nOn McKinsey Talks Talent, HR expert David Green speaks with McKinsey talent experts Bryan Hancock and Bill Schaninger. HR leaders can use people analytics to identify big-picture attrition patterns, illuminate how office space is being used, and automate parts of the recruiting process, including finding diverse candidates.\nIn technical roles, only 52 women are promoted to manager for every 100 men, according to McKinsey\u2019s Women in the Workplace 2021 report, coauthored with LeanIn.Org. Companies can improve women\u2019s promotion rates by providing equitable access to skill building, implementing a structured promotion process that seeks to remove bias, and building a strong culture of support for women via mentors and sponsors.\nDiane Hoskins, co-CEO of Gensler, a global design and architecture firm, has been thinking about effective workplaces for decades and is now helping her clients navigate the next normal. In a conversation with McKinsey Real Estate Practice leader Aditya Sanghvi, Hoskins discusses how COVID-19 made it even more essential to design offices around organizational strategies, leadership models, operational frameworks, and potential outcomes of a company.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nThe Consumer Price Index rose faster in January than at any time in the prior 40 years. Businesses facing inflation are caught between the need to reprice and sustain margins and the damage this can do to customer relationships and sales. McKinsey\u2019s suggested approach can help companies establish sales-led pricing for inflation while maintaining long-term value for the business and its customers.\nBanks can learn to manage nonfinancial risks by observing the effective approaches corporates have developed. These include embedding risk into strategy and improving overall resilience.\nOur analysis suggests that in 2030, demand for green steel in Europe could be twice as great as the available supply, and there may be global shortages of recycled aluminum and recycled plastic. By planning green-materials sourcing strategies, companies can achieve immediate emissions reductions and sustain progress toward longer-term goals.\nCOVID-19 accelerated the sophistication of China\u2019s logistics industry, a crucial node in the global supply chain. Greater consolidation and integration are likely in some subsectors\u2014such as third-party logistics and express-delivery carriers\u2014and expect growth in other areas, such as warehouse automation and air cargo.\nOn the McKinsey on Government podcast, McKinsey senior partner Scott Blackburn and partner Brooke Weddle discuss how the US government\u2019s leaders can implement an effective transformation.\nIn this edition of Author Talks, Whitney Johnson, the CEO of tech-enabled talent agency Disruption Advisors, talks about her new book, Smart Growth: How to Grow Your People to Grow Your Company (Harvard Business Review Press, January 2022). Mastering new skills follows an S-curve, where there\u2019s a difficult introductory phase, a \u201csweet spot\u201d where you\u2019re enjoying applying new knowledge, and an end part of the curve where boredom can set in. Leaders need to understand where their teams are to create the right supports for each phase, Johnson says.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in McKinsey\u2019s Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #93, February 23, 2022\nThe COVID-19-pandemic accelerated our need for a new kind of growth.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic served as an accelerant in multiple ways. This week, McKinsey looked at how the pandemic spurred the adoption of telehealth and e-commerce, exacerbated pressure on nurses, and made company operations more complex. In the big picture, it increased the urgency for a new vision of global growth, one that benefits more people and leaves our planet healthy.\nCrises such as COVID-19 can become watersheds of policy and strategy. In an editorial published in Fortune, Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive director of the World Economic Forum, and Bob Sternfels, McKinsey\u2019s global managing partner, propose pursuing a sustainable, inclusive growth agenda that supports the health of the natural environment while improving the livelihoods of wider population segments. Leaders can shape a resilience agenda by addressing the interrelationships between climate, healthcare, labor needs, supply chains, digitization, finance, and inequality and economic development.\nTo build a better future, the emphasis must now shift from defensive measures and short-term goals to a sustainable, inclusive growth agenda.\nThe pandemic ignited telehealth: as of mid-2021, utilization was 38 times higher than before the pandemic. However, McKinsey\u2019s most recent Physician Survey showed that most doctors don\u2019t love telehealth as much as patients do. Most expect to return to a primarily in-person delivery model over the next year, and 62 percent said they recommend in-person over virtual care to patients.\nThe pandemic essentially forced consumers to try e-commerce and to increasingly rely on product ratings and reviews to give them the confidence to make purchases. The total number of global reviews roughly doubled in the year after COVID-19 started. On The McKinsey Podcast, McKinsey partner Dave Fedewa and McKinsey senior expert Chauncey Holder discuss how companies need to adapt to the new world in which reviews matter more than ever.\nHealthcare workers and their organizations continue to face unparalleled demands stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-two percent of registered nurses surveyed in the United States in November said they may leave their current direct-patient-care role, according to McKinsey\u2019s latest research. Healthcare organizations can consider a number of medium- and longer-term strategies to support their workforces.\nAs companies look at areas to automate, they need a clear, complete picture of service processes. The complexity of services, which often involve coordinating multiple functions in nonlinear ways, makes bad handoffs a perpetual problem. Add to these factors the burgeoning number of customer touchpoints and the accelerated move to remote working since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the challenge looms even larger. An approach we call process insights\u2014which marries technology tools and analytics in a disciplined, three-stage process\u2014shows promise.\nWhile our theme this week is the pandemic\u2019s accelerating effects, we also looked at the opposite: how COVID-19 can spur lightning-fast pullbacks. Although consumer confidence is growing, desire for travel has shown a faltering recovery due to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks. Our examination of China\u2019s tourism industry showed that a predictable pattern is emerging where desire for travel recovers roughly two months after a decline. Furthermore, travelers\u2019 preferences are shifting, with implications for travel companies.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nSigned in November, the US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will provide more than $1 trillion in public investment. One core component of the legislation is addressing the country\u2019s aging water system. The act provides funding to replace lead pipes, address emerging contaminants in small and disadvantaged communities, and support rural water projects.\nA relative lack of top software companies threatens Europe\u2019s economic competitiveness. But Europe could take a lead in software and build large players by playing to the continent\u2019s strengths: vertical B2B software, software platforms for digitizing small and medium-size enterprises, and horizontal platforms built on European R&D excellence.\nSoftware sourcing, now a major driver of overall product cost, requires critical investments in capabilities and technologies, as well as significant financial resources. Those players that can procure software and related services at minimum cost and risk have a distinct competitive advantage.\nAsian acquirers are key players in the Asian M&A landscape, and many are setting their sights worldwide. Our research finds that the most effective dealmakers practice programmatic M&A tied directly to a stated strategy.\nOn the McKinsey on Consumer and Retail podcast, McKinsey partner David Feber and Amcor CEO and managing director Ron Delia talk about exciting innovations that could transform the packaging industry.\nThis week in Author Talks, Ruchika Tulshyan, an award-winning inclusion strategist and speaker, discusses her new book, Inclusion on Purpose: An Intersectional Approach to Creating a Culture of Belonging at Work (MIT Press, March 2022). She explores the bias behind terms such as \u201clean in\u201d and \u201cculture fit\u201d and proposes that inclusion efforts target the needs of women of color.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #92, February 16, 2022\nAs Omicron reminded us, health is everything.\nMcKinsey focused on health this week, starting with a discussion of how Omicron has played out so far and what is likely next in the pandemic\u2019s trajectory. An article on women\u2019s health explores the remarkable tradition of viewing it as a healthcare niche, rather than a core concern of half the world\u2019s population. Technology is increasingly merging with healthcare, so we extrapolated this theme further to examine how to keep companies\u2019 technology healthy.\nIn this episode of The McKinsey Podcast, Shubham Singhal, senior partner and global leader of McKinsey\u2019s Healthcare and Public & Social Sector Practices, reflects on where Omicron has taken us so far and where we go from here. Omicron spread so fast because it evades prior immunity and is more transmissible, allowing it to out-compete the previously dominant strain. Society will begin viewing COVID-19 as endemic when we\u2019re comfortable getting on with life even though the risk of disease is not zero (and for the unvaccinated, it remains high).\nHalf of the world\u2019s population is women, and women account for 80 percent of consumer-purchasing decisions in the healthcare industry. Yet women\u2019s health has been considered a niche market and a mere subset of healthcare. A particularly illuminating statistic: only 1 percent of healthcare research and innovation is invested in female-specific conditions beyond oncology. Changing how the industry thinks about women\u2019s health is an important step toward identifying value-creating opportunities for meeting women\u2019s healthcare needs.\nIt is not a light switch event to get to an endemic phase, because it is as much about the behavior and psychology that we all exhibit as it is about the\nepidemiology of the virus itself.\nFemTech is an emerging category consisting of tech-enabled, consumer-centric solutions addressing women\u2019s health. Depending on scope, estimates for FemTech\u2019s current market size range from $500 million to $1 billion, and forecasts suggest opportunities for double-digit revenue growth. Our analysis of 763 companies indicates that the dynamics underlying FemTech are accelerating and that public awareness, company formation, and funding are surging.\nWhen employees feel understood and supported by their employers, they tend to be happier, more effective, and more likely to stick around. Companies can use the power of AI and machine learning to coach employees. An AI-driven system can be designed to identify key moments when employees would benefit from a \u201cnudge\u201d that guides them toward positive actions, including improving their health, accessing training, and trying a different performance approach.\nTo protect the health of our work environments from ransomware, everyone from the board and C-suite to down the line must work to ingrain security into an organization\u2019s DNA. Ransomware costs are expected to reach $265 billion by 2031. Supply chain attacks rose by 42 percent in the first quarter of 2021 in the United States, affecting up to seven million people, while security threats against industrial control systems and operational technology more than tripled in 2020.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nMcKinsey\u2019s Global Insurance Report 2022 explores long-term challenges facing the industry as well as a raft of trends unleashed by COVID-19. Insurers face fundamental strategic questions of how to create more value for shareholders and how to reframe the role of insurance in society. The report proposes nine imperatives that will help carriers navigate the current environment and focus on the businesses of which they are the best natural owners.\nWith a target of a 78 percent reduction in economy-wide greenhouse-gas emissions by 2035 now enshrined in law, there is a strong impetus to transition the United Kingdom\u2019s energy system to net zero. Looking at electricity demand, technology, and the grid, McKinsey examines options available to investors, regulators, policy makers, and energy companies.\nCompanies used to outsource business processes primarily as a cost-saving strategy. Today, companies outsource to capitalize on sophisticated provider offerings ,\u00a0including customized industry solutions and advances in digital technology, such as AI, analytics, and machine learning.\nIn this edition of Author Talks Amy Webb, a leading futurist and business adviser, talks about her recent book, The Genesis Machine: Our Quest to Rewrite Life in the Age of Synthetic Biology (Hachette Book Group, February 2022), coauthored by microbiologist Andrew Hessel. The book explores a new field of science that combines engineering, design, and computers with biology, enabling the engineering of living cells. Webb says that synthetic biology\u2014the ability to reprogram the fundamental units of life\u2014is going to change industries such as healthcare, agriculture, and industrial materials.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #91, February 9, 2022\nThe CEO job description just got a bit longer.\nCEOs have always carried a heavy workload, but the issues they confront today add several fresh layers. Climate change requires a new way of looking at asset value that models the potential impact of various types of risk. COVID-19 and its aftermath means leaders must engage empathetically in topics relating to their employees\u2019 well-being. This week, McKinsey examined how the pandemic and other world events have added to leaders\u2019 list of most important tasks.\nClimate change and the risks it imposes upon assets and markets is one of the biggest challenges confronting CEOs and other leaders today. The real-estate industry is already facing the need to build new capabilities that allow it to assess how climate-change risks alter values and what subsequent actions to take. Part of capability building involves understanding both physical risks and transition risks stemming from regulatory, social, and market reactions to climate change (exhibit). Once real estate and other leaders understand value impact, they can proceed to decarbonizing and finding new sources of value throughout the climate transition.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nCOVID-19 brought on a new set of employee pressures, including trying to take care of work and children at a time when school doors close suddenly, and managing the 24/7 nature of working from home. These burdens also imply a new set of pressures for CEOs and other leaders as they attempt to support overburdened workforces. On the McKinsey Talks Talent podcast, McKinsey talent experts Bryan Hancock and Bill Schaninger discuss how leaders must engage in employees\u2019 lives and well-being in ways they seldom did in the past.\nWe\u2019re in one of the most bewildering labor markets in a generation, said Asutosh Padhi, McKinsey\u2019s managing partner for North America, in a CNN Business Perspectives commentary. CEOs can respond by expanding recruitment efforts to people who have work experience but don\u2019t have degrees; supporting more \u201cgateway jobs,\u201d or stepping-stone positions that provide an income boost; and by challenging their organizations to embrace a more inclusive, skills-based approach to hiring and talent management.\nAcross industries, product-development functions are encountering a perfect storm of supply chain issues arising from the pandemic, the current labor mismatch, and evergreen themes of managing cost, quality, and time. Rather than becoming part of the much-bemoaned war for talent, companies can develop the capabilities of their existing workforce to fill skills gaps.\nAs the economy continues to reel from the effects of COVID-19, consumer-packaged-goods companies are under more pressure than ever. Prices for food and packaging commodities have increased by more than 22 percent. Manufacturing wages and labor costs rose in 2020 from 5 to 20 percent of total costs. To respond to these rapid, sweeping changes, companies need to transform their operating models to the new reality.\nGiven that economies are expected to shift away from stimulus spending and other policy supports, forecasters and economists generally project a slower pace for global growth in 2022\u2014but one that is still faster than prepandemic levels. January\u2019s Global Economics Intelligence executive summary focuses on how inflation is playing out around the world, efforts to control it, and its impact on growth and employment.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nTo better understand recent developments in sustainable packaging, we mapped regulations in 30 countries and found four common patterns. To ensure they comply with evolving requirements, packaging companies should track regulatory changes in their focus markets and implement processes to address future requirements proactively.\nResponding to a McKinsey survey, two out of three Americans told us their social values now shape their shopping choices, and 45 percent believe retailers should actively support Black-owned businesses and brands. Most retailers will need to make changes to meet the needs of these \u201cinclusive consumers\u201d by sourcing products that dovetail with consumer values and by communicating the changes to the public.\nUp to four-fifths of a product\u2019s lifetime emissions are determined by decisions made at the design stage. By building on proven cost-optimization techniques, companies can get those choices right.\nMyths often hold back heavy industries from activating agile working practices. However, agility in heavy-industry organizations can be used to make operational improvements, to enhance run activities, to augment all-important safety standards, and ultimately to become an enduring source of competitive advantage.\nIn this edition of Author Talks, Neil Hoyne, Google\u2019s chief measurement strategist, discusses his new book Converted: The Data-Driven Way to Win Customers\u2019 Hearts (Penguin Random House, February 2022). Data alone is not the answer for companies trying to grow, Hoyne says. Instead, companies can find growth by creating the right data strategy, leadership, and processes.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #90, February 2, 2022\nThe postpandemic world calls for fresh leadership ideas.\nOrganizations increasingly recognize that modern leadership means knowing how to make the most of digitization and technology, diverse talent, and the opinions of a range of stakeholders. This week, McKinsey dug for the details. Articles and an interactive explore how companies can take advantage of advanced-intelligence technology and become truly data driven. A new interview series illuminates how three Black leaders developed their leadership styles, while further articles explore casting the idea net wider.\nLeading industrial and manufacturing companies are using machine-intelligence technologies to move the needle on a broad set of performance indicators, achieving three or four times the impact of average players. The full scale of the opportunity is set to continue as more use cases evolve from simple dashboards to greater levels of autonomy.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nWhat exactly does it mean to be a data-driven enterprise, and what would such an organization look like by 2025? Our interactive helps executives envision success by defining seven characteristics of a data-driven organization, how each would differ from what we typically see today, and how to achieve each step. Companies able to make the most progress fastest stand to capture the highest value from data-supported capabilities.\nMcKinsey created the Connected Leaders Academy to equip Black, Hispanic, Latino, and Asian leaders with the network and capabilities to achieve their professional aspirations. In our new interview series, My Leadership Journey, participants from the private sector, academia, the arts, and other walks of life reflect on their formative experiences and leadership styles. Jason Wright, president of Washington\u2019s football team, the Commanders, told McKinsey about getting cut nine times from the NFL and talking his way back to opportunity by honing a narrative about what he could contribute. Stephanie Hill, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin\u2019s Rotary and Mission Systems, discussed the importance of accepting uncomfortable challenges to build a career. Barry Lawson Williams, founder and former managing general partner of Williams Pacific Ventures, who has also served on 16 major public-company boards, spoke about how he built a network that helped position him for lucky breaks.\nWhat does an army veteran who has returned from deployment five times have to teach a McKinsey organizational expert? Plenty, as a letter and conversations between Adria Horn, executive vice president of workforce at Tilson, a national telecom provider, and senior partner Aaron De Smet revealed. Horn reached out to McKinsey after reading about how companies can reengage employees postpandemic. She shared her view of parallels between soldiers returning from war zones and employees coming back to the office after living through the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting conversation explores the alienation of return and how employers can work from a place of empathy.\nBrainstorming is supposed to result in conversations like the one between Horn and De Smet. But too often, the value of casting the net wide for opinions is undercut by participants feeling pressured to conform. A structured approach that guides a group through anonymous brainstorming and silent voting removes some of the risks that can thwart honest discussion.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nBased on a survey of physicians who serve predominantly Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage patients, we estimate that up to $265 billion worth of care services could shift from traditional facilities to the home by 2025 without a reduction in quality or access. Care at Home could create value for payers, healthcare facilities and physician groups, providers, technology companies, investors, and, above all, patients.\nKorean companies would benefit from portfolio restructuring by making governance more transparent and by advancing women\u2019s equality at work. In a wide-ranging conversation, Andr\u00e9 Andonian, managing partner of McKinsey Korea, discusses McKinsey\u2019s near- and long-term goals in the country and how Korea is preparing for the post-COVID-19 economy.\nInvestors are directing more funds to projects involving lunar and beyond orbital regimes, which have traditionally attracted less attention than regimes at lower altitudes. All signs point to continued growth.\nEven the most seasoned professional was a neophyte at some point, a fact celebrated in our My Rookie Moment video series, in which McKinsey colleagues discuss the first time they had to deal with a particular challenge. The latest edition features stories about \u201cleaps of faith,\u201d in which partners had to do something for which they felt unprepared. Yarns include a tale of on-command public speaking and the recollection of facing a client who demanded different conclusions.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #89, January 26, 2022\nTackling the other big global crisis.\nSince March of 2020, we have focused this weekly update on sharing research into the health emergency facing the world. This week, we took a break from the COVID-19 pandemic to zero in on the other crisis that poses threats to lives and livelihoods: climate change, and the need to transition to a net-zero world. Additional articles looked at pressing issues including why the loss of US manufacturing has increased inequality, and how the Great Attrition is playing out in nursing.\nA new report from the McKinsey Global Institute looks at what an economic transformation to net-zero emissions would entail. The transformation would affect all countries and all sectors of the economy, either directly or indirectly. In six sections of the report, we assess economic shifts for 69 countries and changes in sectors that produce about 85 percent of overall emissions, as well as provide estimates for what it will all cost (exhibit).\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nThe report includes an examination of effective decarbonization actions, which include shifting the energy mix, increasing energy efficiency, and enhancing sinks of both long- and short-lived greenhouse gases. Another section illustrates the economic and societal adjustments that would enable a successful transition to net-zero emissions by 2050, focusing on demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs. We examine which sectors of the economy are more exposed to a net-zero transition, and how the transition could play out in various countries and regions. A section about actions for stakeholders explores what companies, financial institutions, and governments and multilateral institutions can do.\nAlso this week: revitalizing US manufacturing could be fundamental to resolving inequities while driving sustainable, inclusive growth. Today, the manufacturing sector represents just 10 percent of US GDP and jobs but drives 20 percent of the nation\u2019s capital investment, 35 percent of productivity growth, 60 percent of exports, and 70 percent of business R&D expenditure. Strengthening the sector could also address the pervasive supply chain issues wreaking havoc all over the world, easing short-term disruption caused by the pandemic while improving global competitiveness in the midterm to long term.\nDuring a time of unprecedented need, what can employers do to prevent losing nurses, the backbone of the healthcare workforce, to the Great Attrition? The McKinsey Podcast speaks with senior partner Gretchen Berlin, a registered nurse, about the need to pay nurses adequately and to ensure that there\u2019s sufficient staffing, respite, and gratitude.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nIn October 2020, coking coal accounted for more than half of the cost of the raw materials needed to produce a metric ton of steel via a blast furnace\u2014a rare occurrence by historical standards. Though prices have fallen since then, steelmakers should consider the effect of longer-term coal price increases as part of their planning and adjust their plans as the implications evolve.\nThe new normal for sporting goods includes increased health awareness, acceptance of athleisure, thriving e-commerce, and sustainability as a core concern. McKinsey\u2019s summary of the state of the industry suggests strategies for navigating the trends.\nNew and better digital tools can help companies analyze voice conversation and unlock the full potential of digital investments to improve customer service.\nIn the latest edition of our Author Talks series, John Koenig, author of The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows (Simon & Schuster, November 2021), discusses how and why he invents new words for emotions and sensations. From \u201ckenopsia\u201d (the eeriness of places left behind) to \u201csuerza\u201d (a feeling of quiet amazement that you exist at all), Koenig\u2019s made-up words pinpoint universal experiences and demonstrate how creative human language can be.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #88, January 19, 2022\nFallout from the pandemic demands targeted action.\nFor much of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders have tried to prepare for what might unfold. Today, some of those possibilities have arrived as undeniable challenges that demand new ways of operating. This week, McKinsey looked at fallout, including inflation, young peoples\u2019 mental-health struggles, a pattern of \u201cjolting\u201d growth, and the demand for government agencies to improve customer service.\nNot since the 1970s has inflation been such a central issue for companies, so finding creative ways to mitigate price increases is a dormant skill in many organizations. McKinsey experts offer a series of steps supply-chain leaders can use to determine whether a price increase is fair, starting by identifying the main cost inputs that have the highest level of change, estimating the percentage of the total cost these inputs make up, and calculating an acceptable price-increase range (exhibit). Response strategies include using a strong fact base for win\u2013win negotiating and exploring new suppliers.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nA series of McKinsey consumer surveys and interviews indicated unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z and stark differences among generations. Gen Z respondents were more likely than other generations to report having been diagnosed with a mental-health or substance-use issue, as well as more likely to have sought no treatment for the problem. Gen Z respondents were also two to three times more likely than other generations to report thinking about, planning, or attempting suicide in the 12 months spanning late 2019 to late 2020.\nThere could be a postpandemic boom on the horizon, but it will likely depend on business leaders\u2019 ability to respond to productivity and growth \u201cjolts\u201d caused by the pandemic. The onset of COVID-19 brought a set of discontinuities that drove the first jolt to growth and productivity. Now, near-term uncertainties pose risks to growth; however, responding effectively could translate to a second jolt. The potential third and final jolt may be the largest as companies reshape their long-term strategies to reflect\u2014and define\u2014the next normal.\nOn the McKinsey on Government podcast, McKinsey partner Tony D\u2019Emidio and associate partner Marcy Jacobs discuss how the pandemic forced many government agencies to modernize the customer experience (CX) amid high demand for unemployment and healthcare assistance. Transparency has improved, but there is more work to do so that when citizens fill out applications or forms, they get status updates instead of just wondering what happened. Another insight: better CX brings costs down because satisfied customers call with fewer questions.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nRoad freight accounts for 53 percent of CO 2 emissions within global trade-related transport, a share expected to rise to 56 percent by 2050 if current trends continue. Road Freight Zero: Pathways to faster adoption of zero-emission trucks is a joint publication by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey that describes how countries can reach their emissions goals for road freight.\nWith a market of more than $2.8 trillion worldwide, fragmented retail is poised to be transformed by \u201ceB2B\u201d players: portals and applications that replace the in-person sales model for small retailers and restaurants. By understanding the market structure and properly setting the scale and speed of change, companies can design an eB2B solution capable of disruption.\nReaching net zero in the cement and construction value chain by 2050 will require the buildings and construction industry to decarbonize three times faster over the next 30 years versus the previous 30. At the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, McKinsey brought together global property owners, contractors, materials suppliers, investors, equipment manufacturers, and disruptors to define the path forward. Among the takeaways: the industry can boost innovation by developing common standards and shared R&D resources.\nWhat makes a CEO great? In this edition of Author Talks, McKinsey senior partners Carolyn Dewar, Scott Keller, and Vik Malhotra discuss their new book, CEO Excellence: The Six Mindsets That Distinguish the Best Leaders from the Rest (Scribner, March 2022). The authors interviewed 67 CEOs worldwide who met their criteria for excellence and diversity of both background and approach and identified keys to excellence that can provide lessons for any type of leader.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #87, January 12, 2022\nPeople are the fuel that will power the next industrial revolution.\nAmid the Omicron surge, it\u2019s perhaps poignant to note that all the advanced technology in the world means nothing without a population capable of adopting it and creating with it. COVID-19 vaccines are a good example of a technology that depends on people\u2019s acceptance. This week, McKinsey explored how people in various industries and sectors relate to technology and the power of these interactions.\nThe McKinsey Talks Operations podcast brings together the CEOs of Flex, Protolabs, and Western Digital to discuss why the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be people powered. Digital manufacturing and production will change how the world makes goods but only if there is training and development to teach workers the skills to use these technologies. With the current labor mismatch in many countries, now is the time to further engage workers for a digitally enabled future.\nWith Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies in the hands of a workforce empowered with the skills needed to use them, an organization\u2019s digital-transformation journey can move from aspiration to reality.\nA pivot to telemedicine, remote work, and other technologies helped a leader in pediatric medicine manage the onslaught of COVID-19. Boston Children\u2019s Hospital president and CEO Dr. Kevin Churchwell calls for more innovation to cope with a sharp rise in children and young adults with behavioral- and mental-health issues. This generation of kids is being reared under physical distancing, lockdowns, and school closures. Churchwell believes that those presenting with mental-health issues would benefit from a tech-enabled continuum of care that encompasses the family, the primary-care pediatrician, the school system, the hospital, and the state.\nSarah Bond, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for game creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, describes how recognizing that game playing is a fundamental human trait helped Microsoft create its \u201cubiquitous global gaming ecosystem.\u201d Investments in cloud gaming, the Game Pass subscription service, and cross-platform play allow gamers to participate anywhere, anytime, on any device.\nTulsa Remote, a program that enabled Tulsa, Oklahoma, to attract 1,300 remote workers to the area, also prioritizes the human need for connection. In addition to giving relocators $10,000, the program provides membership to a local coworking space and assists in finding housing. Events, both virtual and in-person, are intended to mitigate the potential isolation of remote work. The initiative has attracted 50,000 applicants and is making a meaningful impression on the local economy.\nIn a typical organization, only a specific department and designated functions are accountable for quality in design, development, operations, and even postmarket activities. But in a smart-quality organization, everyone owns quality. Pharmaceutical and medtech companies can create value by redesigning key quality processes along these principles.\nHere are other key findings from our research this week:\nAs the move toward cleaner technologies progresses, the metals and mining sector will provide the raw materials required for the energy transition. The required pace of transition means that the availability of certain raw materials will need to scale up quickly\u2014and, in certain cases, at volumes ten times or more than the current market size. We expect materials shortages, price fly-ups, and the need for technological innovation and substitutions.\nStakeholder capitalism asks leaders to prioritize long-termism over short-term gain. In the latest episode of the Inside the Strategy Room podcast, senior partner Dame Vivian Hunt and senior adviser to McKinsey Bruce Simpson, CEO of the Stephen A. Schwarzman Foundation, discuss research and experience that strongly link stakeholder capitalism to traditional sources of value.\nWhat makes a CEO great? In a recent edition of Author Talks, McKinsey senior partners Carolyn Dewar, Scott Keller, and Vik Malhotra discuss their new book, CEO Excellence: The Six Mindsets That Distinguish the Best Leaders from the Rest (Scribner, March 2022). The authors interviewed 67 CEOs worldwide who met their criteria for excellence and diversity of both background and approach and identified keys to excellence that can provide lessons for any type of leader.\nAlso in Author Talks, Tareq Azim, founder of Empower Gym, trainer of NFL greats, and creator of the Afghan Women\u2019s Boxing Federation, talks about his new book, Empower: Conquering the Disease of Fear (Simon & Schuster, January 2022), which was coauthored with Seth Davis. Azim discusses how he created a place for women to practice the most male-dominated activity in the most male-dominated society of all time and how anyone can find inner strength.\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nCOVID-19: Briefing note #86, January 5, 2022\nOmicron demands renewed focus on familiar pandemic themes.\nA new year is here, but COVID-19\u2019s latest surge feels so very last year\u2014not to mention the year before that. To kick off 2022, McKinsey looked at issues that many people thought would have started to resolve as the virus died down, but which instead require renewed engagement. Topping our list this week are employee burnout and hits to tourism. But there is positive news as well: reports on the state of mobility and pharmaceuticals reflect that pandemic-inspired changes are leading some industries in new directions.\nCompared with nonparents, employed parents are more likely to miss days of work because they are experiencing symptoms of burnout (exhibit). Companies need to understand what the compound pressures of employment and parenting during a pandemic are doing to these workers and consider a list of interventions to counteract their experience of burning the candle at both ends.\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nWomen also are reporting higher-than-average rates of burnout. In a new episode of The McKinsey Podcast, senior partners Alexis Krivkovich and Lareina Yee discuss results from the recently released Women in the Workplace 2021 report. Forty-two percent of women report being burned out, a percentage that is higher than it was last year and higher than it is for men. Reasons include the fact that one in three women, and 60 percent of mothers with young children, spend five or more hours a day on housework and caregiving.\nEarly January is when many of us go on a diet and re-up at the gym. Here\u2019s another tune-up option: take our \u201cCan you turn attrition into attraction?\u201d quiz to test how good you are at combatting burnout, rewarding employees in meaningful ways, and strengthening bonds with your teams.\nOur \u201c year in review \u201d\u00a0recap of 2021 highlights themes that many were hoping to leave behind, including the pandemic and the Great Resignation, as well as aspirations, such as inclusive growth and digital transformation, that will only grow in importance. The \u201c year in images \u201d\u00a0collection showcases the most evocative art we published last year, while the \u201c year in charts \u201d\u00a0collection tells visual stories about virus cases and vaccination rates, diversity targets and employee experiences, and how sustainable growth might be attained.\nAnother consequence of COVID-19 is the devastation wrought on tourism markets worldwide. We looked at a key US market and found that the financial impact of the pandemic on New York City is six times that of the September 11 attacks, costing the city $1.2 billion in lost tourism-related tax revenue. New York can reinvigorate its tourism industry by encouraging domestic travel and by reimagining business travel.\nMcKinsey reflected upon how the pandemic has affected mobility and where the sector is headed. Among the findings: half of the consumers in our recent Global COVID-19 Automotive & Mobility Consumer Survey stated a clear preference to travel less than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the forecasts: by 2035, in an accelerated scenario, the largest automotive markets in the world (that is, China, the European Union, and the United States) will be fully electric.\nThe pandemic has also reshaped the pharmaceuticals industry, and changes are still under way. We conducted a survey of senior executives in commercial roles at global pharma companies and found that more than 80 percent think that companies will fully embrace agile ways of working, and 66 percent believe that companies will move away from the traditional sales rep model because of restricted access, virtual interactions, and perceived low return on investment.\nHere are some of this week\u2019s other key findings from our research:\nQuantum computing is about a decade away from widespread commercial application. Less well known, but also important, are two related technologies that could become available much earlier: quantum sensing and quantum communication. We explore the market landscape for both, looking at opportunities, risks, and demand.\nBased on the results of our latest McKinsey Global Survey, we identify the different stages of a transformation\u2019s life cycle to understand where value is lost and what companies can do to preserve it. According to our analysis, three core actions are especially predictive of value capture.\nOne way to accelerate decarbonization in the shipping sector is to implement \u201cgreen corridors\u201d: specific trade routes between major port hubs where zero-emission solutions are supported. A new report, The next wave: Green corridors ,\u00a0probes the feasibility of two such selected corridors\u2014with encouraging results.\nTwo books in our Author Talks series address the workplace issues so prevalent in our research from this past year. Joan C. Williams, distinguished professor of law and chair of the Hastings Foundation, discusses her latest book, Bias Interrupted: Creating Inclusion for Real and for Good (Harvard Business Review Press, November 2021). Jennifer Moss, Harvard Business Review contributor and nationally syndicated radio columnist, shares her recent work, The Burnout Epidemic: The Rise of Chronic Stress and How We Can Fix It (Harvard Business Review Press, September 2021).\nThis briefing note was edited by Katy McLaughlin, a senior editor in the Southern California office.\nFor McKinsey\u2019s 2021 perspectives on the business impact of COVID-19, visit our archive of several dozen briefing notes published throughout the year.\nAbout the author(s)\nMatt Craven is a partner in McKinsey\u2019s Silicon Valley office; Linda Liu is a partner in the New York office, where Matt Wilson is a senior partner; and Mihir Mysore is a partner in the Houston office.\nThis article was edited by Mark Staples, an executive editor in the New York office.\nTalk to us\nExplore a career with us\nSearch Openings"}, {"Url": "https://mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/from-surviving-to-thriving-reimagining-the-post-covid-19-return", "CluewebURLHash": "81C891FB8FFF3A978582C798AD41ACD5", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000From surviving to thriving\ue001: \ue000Business\ue001 after \ue000coronavirus\ue001 ...", "Snippet": "For companies around the world, the qualities that brought Brazilian football to new heights in 1970\u2014imagination, leadership, and on-the field execution\u2014will be paramount as they consider how to navigate the \ue000post\ue001-COVID-\ue00019\ue001 environment. \ue000Business\ue001 as usual will not be nearly enough: the game has changed too much.", "Click_Cnt": 0.014, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0043-19-05906", "CluewebDocument": "From surviving to thriving: Business after coronavirus | McKinsey\nFrom surviving to thriving: Reimagining the post-COVID-19 return\nMay 1, 2020 | Article\nBy Kevin Sneader and Bob Sternfels\nDOWNLOADS\nArticle (PDF-287KB)\nThe 1966 World Cup marked a low point for Brazilian soccer. Although the winner of the previous two tournaments, the team was eliminated in the first round, and its star player, Pel\u00e9, failed to perform. Fouled frequently and flagrantly, he threatened never to return to the World Cup. Many wondered if Brazil\u2019s glory days were over. Four years later, however, Brazil won again, with such grace and style that the 1970 team is not only widely regarded as the best team ever to take the pitch but also as the most beautiful. And Pel\u00e9 was named the player of the tournament.\nMaking this turnaround required innovation, in particular, the creation of a unique attacking style of soccer. It required building a cohesive team, even as most of the roster changed. And it required leadership, both in management and on the field. The result: by reimagining everything, Brazil came back stronger.\nAs businesses around the world consider how they can return from the torment inflicted by the coronavirus, Brazil\u2019s journey from failure to triumph provides food for thought. In a previous article, McKinsey described five qualities that will be critical for business leaders to find their way to the next normal: resolve, resilience, return, reimagination, and reform. We noted that there would likely be overlap among these stages, and the order might differ, depending on the business, the sector, and the country.\nIn this article, we suggest that in order to come back stronger, companies should reimagine their business model as they return to full speed. The moment is not to be lost: those who step up their game will be better off and far more ready to confront the challenges\u2014and opportunities\u2014of the next normal than those who do not.\nThere are four strategic areas to focus on: recovering revenue, rebuilding operations, rethinking the organization, and accelerating the adoption of digital solutions.\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n1. Rapidly recover revenue.\nSpeed matters: it will not be enough for companies to recover revenues gradually as the crisis abates. They will need to fundamentally rethink their revenue profile, to position themselves for the long term and to get ahead of the competition. To do this companies must SHAPE up.\nS tart-up mindset. This favors action over research, and testing over analysis. Establish a brisk cadence to encourage agility and accountability: daily team check-ins, weekly 30-minute CEO reviews, and twice-a-month 60-minute reviews.\nH uman at the core. Companies will need to rethink their operating model based on how their people work best. Sixty percent of businesses surveyed by McKinsey in early April said that their new remote sales models were proving as much (29 percent) or more effective (31 percent) than traditional channels.\nA cceleration of digital, tech, and analytics. It\u2019s already a clich\u00e9: the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the shift to digital. But the best companies are going further, by enhancing and expanding their digital channels. They\u2019re successfully using advanced analytics to combine new sources of data, such as satellite imaging, with their own insights to make better and faster decisions and strengthen their links to customers.\nP urpose-driven customer playbook. Companies need to understand what customers will value, post-COVID-19, and develop new use cases and tailored experiences based on those insights.\nE cosystems and adaptability. Given crisis-related disruptions in supply chains and channels, adaptability is essential. That will mean changing the ecosystem and considering nontraditional collaborations with partners up and down the supply chain.\nRapid revenue response isn\u2019t just a way to survive the crisis. It\u2019s the next normal for how companies will have to operate. Assuming company leaders are in good SHAPE, how do they go about choosing what to do? We see three steps.\nIdentify and prioritize revenue opportunities. What\u2019s important is to identify the primary sources of revenue and, on that basis, make the \u201cnow or never\u201d moves that need to happen before the recovery fully starts. This may include launching targeted campaigns to win back loyal customers; developing customer experiences focused on increased health and safety; adjusting pricing and promotions based on new data; reallocating spending to proven growth sources; reskilling the sales force to support remote selling; creating flexible payment terms; digitizing sales channels; and automating processes to free up sales representatives to sell more.\nOnce identified, these measures need to be rigorously prioritized to reflect their impact on earnings and the company\u2019s ability to execute quickly (exhibit).\nExhibit\nMcKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\nAct with urgency. During the current crisis, businesses have worked faster and better than they dreamed possible just a few months ago. Maintaining that sense of possibility will be an enduring source of competitive advantage.\nConsider a Chinese car-rental company whose revenues fell 95 percent in February. With the roads empty, company leaders didn\u2019t just stew. Instead, they reacted like a start-up. They invested in micro\u2013customer segmentation and social listening to guide personalization. This led them to develop new use cases. They discovered, for example, that many tech firms were telling employees not to use public transportation. The car-rental company used this insight to experiment with and refine targeted campaigns. They also called first-time customers who had cancelled orders to reassure them of the various safety steps the company had taken, such as \u201cno touch\u201d car pickup. To manage the program, they pulled together three agile teams with cross-functional skills and designed a recovery dashboard to track progress. Before the crisis, the company took up to three weeks to launch a campaign; that is now down to two to three days. Within seven weeks, the company had recovered 90 percent of its business, year on year\u2014almost twice the rate of its chief competitor.\nDuring the current crisis, businesses have worked faster and better than they dreamed possible just a few months ago. Maintaining that sense of possibility will be an enduring source of competitive advantage.\nDevelop an agile operating model. Driven by urgency, marketing and sales leaders are increasingly willing to embrace agile methods; they are getting used to jumping on quick videoconferences to solve problems and give remote teams more decision-making authority. It\u2019s also important, of course, for cross-functional teams not to lose sight of the long term and to avoid panic reactions.\nIn this sense, \u201cagile\u201d means putting in place a new operating model built around the customer and supported by the right processes and governance. Agile sales organizations, for example, continuously prioritize accounts and deals, and decide quickly where to invest. But this is effective only if there is a clear growth plan that sets out how to win each type of customer. Similarly, fast decision making between local sales and global business units and the rapid reallocation of resources between them require a stable sales-pipeline-management process.\n2. Rebuilding operations.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has radically changed demand patterns for products and services across sectors, while exposing points of fragility in global supply chains and service networks. At the same time, it has been striking how fast many companies have adapted, creating radical new levels of visibility, agility, productivity, and end-customer connectivity. Now leaders are asking themselves: How can we sustain this performance? As operations leaders seek to reinvent the way they work and thus position themselves for the next normal, five themes are emerging.\nBuilding operations resilience. Successful companies will redesign their operations and supply chains to protect against a wider and more acute range of potential shocks. In addition, they will act quickly to rebalance their global asset base and supplier mix. The once-prevalent global-sourcing model in product-driven value chains has steadily declined as new technologies and consumer-demand patterns encourage regionalization of supply chains. We expect this trend to accelerate.\nThis reinvention and regionalization of global value chains is also likely to accelerate adoption of other levers to strengthen operational resilience, including increased use of external suppliers to supplement internal operations, greater workforce cross-training, and dual or even triple sourcing.\nAccelerating end-to-end value-chain digitization. Creating this new level of operations resilience could be expensive, in both time and resources. The good news, however, is that leading innovators have demonstrated how \u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d (or the Fourth Industrial Revolution suite of digital and analytics tools and approaches) can significantly reduce the cost of flexibility. In short, low-cost, high-flexibility operations are not only possible\u2014they are happening. Most companies were already digitizing their operations before the coronavirus hit. If they accelerate these efforts now, they will likely see significant benefits in productivity, flexibility, quality, and end-customer connectivity.\nRapidly increasing capital- and operating-expense transparency. To survive and thrive amid the economic fallout, companies can build their next-normal operations around a revamped approach to spending. A full suite of technology-enabled methodologies is accelerating cost transparency, compressing months of effort into weeks or days. These digital approaches include procurement-spend analysis and clean-sheeting, end-to-end inventory rebalancing, and capital-spend diagnostics and portfolio rationalization. Companies are also seeking to turn fixed capital costs into variable ones by leveraging \u201cas a service\u201d models.\nEmbracing the future of work. The future of work, defined by the use of more automation and technology, was always coming. COVID-19 has hastened the pace. Employees across all functions, for example, have learned how to complete tasks remotely, using digital communication and collaboration tools. In operations, changes will go further, with an accelerated decline in manual and repetitive tasks and a rise in the need for analytical and technical support. This shift will call for substantial investment in workforce engagement and training in new skills, much of it delivered using digital tools.\nReimagining a sustainable operations competitive advantage. Dramatic shifts in industry structure, customer expectations, and demand patterns create a need for equally dramatic shifts in operations strategies to create competitive advantage and new customer value propositions. Successful companies will reinvent the role of operations in their enterprises, creating new value through a far greater responsiveness to their end customers\u2014including but not limited to accelerated product-development and customer-experience innovation, mass customization, improved environmental sustainability, and more interconnected, nimble ecosystem management.\nTaking action. To keep up during COVID-19, companies have moved fast. Sales and operation planning used to be done weekly or even monthly; now a daily cadence is common. To build on this progress, speed will continue to be of the essence. Companies that recognize this, and that are willing to set new standards and upend old paradigms, will build long-term strategic advantage.\n3. Rethinking the organization.\nIn 2019, a leading retailer was exploring how to launch a curbside-delivery business; the plan stretched over 18 months. When the COVID-19 lockdown hit the United States, it went live in two days. There are many more examples of this kind. \u201cHow can we ever tell ourselves that we can\u2019t be faster?\u201d one executive of a consumer company recently asked.\nCall it the \u201cgreat unfreezing\u201d: in the heat of the coronavirus crisis, organizations have been forced to work in new ways, and they are responding. Much of this progress comes from shifts in operating models. Clear goals, focused teams, and rapid decision making have replaced corporate bureaucracy. Now, as the world begins to move into the post-COVID-19 era, leaders must commit to not going back. The way in which they rethink their organizations will go a long way in determining their long-term competitive advantage.\nSpecifically, they must decide who they are, how to work, and how to grow.\nWho we are. In a crisis, what matters becomes very clear, very fast. Strategy, roles, personal ownership, external orientation, and leadership that is both supportive and demanding\u2014all can be seen much more clearly now. The social contract between the employee and employer is, we believe, changing fundamentally. \u201cIt will matter whether you actually acted to put the safety of employees and communities first,\u201d one CEO told us, \u201cor just said you cared.\u201d One noticeable characteristic of companies that have adapted well is that they have a strong sense of identity. Leaders and employees have a shared sense of purpose and a common performance culture; they know what the company stands for, beyond shareholder value, and how to get things done right.\nHow we work. Many leaders are reflecting on how small, nimble teams built in a hurry to deal with the COVID-19 emergency made important decisions faster and better. What companies have learned cannot be unlearned\u2014namely, that a flatter organization that delegates decision making down to a dynamic network of teams is more effective. They are rewiring their circuits to make decisions faster, and with much less data and certainty than before. In a world where fast beats slow, companies that can institutionalize these forms of speedy and effective decentralization will jump ahead of the competition.\nMany leaders are reflecting on how small, nimble teams built in a hurry to deal with the COVID-19 emergency made important decisions faster and better.\nOrganizations are also showing a more profound appreciation for matching the right talent, regardless of hierarchy, to the most critical challenges. In an environment with strong cost pressures, successful leaders will see the value in continuing to simplify and streamline their organizational structures. Experience has shown a better way, with critical roles linked to value-creation opportunities and leadership roles that are much more fluid, with new leaders emerging from unexpected places: the premium is placed on character and results, rather than on expertise or experience. This can only work, however, if the talent is there. To hire and keep top talent, the scarcest capital of all, means creating a unique work experience and committing to a renewed emphasis on talent development.\nHow to grow. Coming out of the crisis, organizations must answer important questions about growth and scalability. Three factors will matter most: the ability to embed data and analytics in decision making; the creation of learning platforms that support both individual and institutional experimentation and learning at scale; and the cultivation of an organizational culture that fosters value creation with other partners.\nThose organizations that are making the shift from closed systems and one-to-one transactional relationships to digital platforms and networks of mutually beneficial partnerships have proved more resilient during the crisis. \u201cEvery business is now a technology business, and what matters most is a deep understanding of the customer, which is enabled by technology,\u201d remarked a retail CEO.\nBy organizing to encourage insight generation\u2014for example, by linking previously unconnected goods and services\u2014technology is revolutionizing how organizations relate to their customers and their customers\u2019 customers. Creating digitally enabled ecosystems is therefore critical because these catalyze growth and enable rapid adaptation. When the crisis hit, one company moved all its full-time direct employees into a virtual operating environment; meanwhile, its outsourcing partner, the CEO recalled, \u201chid behind their contract and played one customer off against another.\u201d It is not difficult to imagine who is better placed to succeed in the more flexible post-COVID-19 business environment, where value creation is shared and strategic partnerships matter even more.\n4. Accelerate digital adoption to enable reimagination.\nOver the past few months, there has been a transformation in the way we interact with loved ones,  do our work, travel, get medical care, spend leisure time, and conduct many of the routine transactions of life. These changes have accelerated the migration to digital technologies at stunning scale and speed, across every sector. \u201cWe are witnessing what will surely be remembered as a historic deployment of remote work and digital access to services across every domain,\u201d remarked one tech CEO.  He is right. Through the COVID-19 recovery, too, digital will play a defining role.\nDuring the early recovery period of partial reopening, business leaders will face some fundamental challenges. One is that consumer behavior and demand patterns have changed significantly and will continue to do so. Another is that how the economy lurches back to life will differ from country to country and even city to city. For example, consumers may feel comfortable going to restaurants before they will consider getting on a plane or going to sporting events. Early signals of increased consumer demand will likely come suddenly, and in clusters. Analyzing these demand signals in real time and adapting quickly to bring supply chains and services back will be essential for companies to successfully navigate the recovery.\nTo address these challenges, leaders will need to set an ambitious digital agenda\u2014and deliver it quickly, on the order of two to three months, as opposed to the previous norm of a year or more. There are four elements to this agenda:\nRefocus digital efforts to reflect changing customer expectations. To adapt, companies need to quickly rethink customer journeys and accelerate the development of digital solutions. The emphasis will be different for each sector. For many retailers, this includes creating a seamless e-commerce experience, enabling customers to complete everything they need to do online, from initial research and purchase to service and returns. For auto companies, this could mean establishing new digital distribution models to handle trade-ins, financing, servicing, and home delivery of cars. For industries such as airlines, ensuring health and safety will be essential, for example, by reinventing the passenger experience with \u201ccontactless\u201d check-in, boarding, and in-flight experiences.\nUse data, Internet of Things, and AI to better manage operations. In parallel, companies need to incorporate new data and create new models to enable real-time decision making. In the same way that many risk and financial models had to be rebuilt after the 2008 financial crisis, the use of data and analytics will need to be recalibrated to reflect the post-COVID-19 reality. This will involve rapidly validating models, creating new data sets, and enhancing modeling techniques. Getting this right will enable companies to successfully navigate demand forecasting, asset management, and coping with massive new volumes. For example, one airline developed a new app to manage and maintain its idle fleet and support bringing it back into service; and a North American telecommunications company developed a digital collection model for customers facing hardship.\nAccelerate tech modernization. Companies will also need to greatly improve their IT productivity to lower their cost base and fund rapid, flexible digital-solution development. First, this requires quickly reducing IT costs and making them variable wherever possible to match demand. This means figuring out what costs are flexible in the near-to-medium term, for example, by evaluating nonessential costs related to projects or maintenance, and reallocating resources. Second, this involves defining a future IT-product platform, establishing the skills and roles needed to sustain it, mapping these skills onto the new organization model, and developing leaders who can train people to fill the new or adapted roles. Third, the adoption of cloud and automation technologies will need to be speeded up, including bringing\ncloud operations on-premise and decommissioning legacy infrastructure.\nIncrease the speed and productivity of digital solutions. To deal with the crisis and its aftermath, companies not only need to develop digital solutions quickly but also to adapt their organizations to new operating models and deliver these solutions to customers and employees at scale. Solving this \u201clast mile\u201d challenge requires integrating businesses processes, incorporating data-driven decision making, and implementing change management. There are different ways to do this. A wide variety of companies, from banks to mining operations, have accelerated delivery by establishing an internal \u201cdigital factory\u201d with cross-functional teams dedicated to matching business priorities to digital practices. Others, in addition to reinventing their core businesses, have established new business\u2013building entities to capture new opportunities quickly.\nFor companies around the world, the qualities that brought Brazilian football to new heights in 1970\u2014imagination, leadership, and on-the field execution\u2014will be paramount as they consider how to navigate the post-COVID-19 environment. Business as usual will not be nearly enough: the game has changed too much. But by reimagining how they recover, operate, organize, and use technology, even as they return to work, companies can set the foundations for enduring success.\nAbout the author(s)\nKevin Sneader, the global managing partner of McKinsey, is based in McKinsey\u2019s Hong Kong office.

For example, Sam Harris says in his book The End of Faith that faith and religion are \"the most prolific source of violence in our history.\"\nThere's no denying that campaigns such as the Crusades and the Thirty Years' War rested on religious ideology. Such events are horrible and should have never occurred.\nThat said, it is simply incorrect to assert that religion has been the primary cause of war. Moreover, although there's also no disagreement that radical Islam was the spirit behind 9/11, it is a fallacy to say that all faiths contribute equally to religiously motivated violence and warfare.\nAn interesting source of truth on the matter is Philip and Axelrod's three-volume Encyclopedia of Wars, which chronicles some 1,763 wars that have been waged over the course of human history. Of those wars, the authors categorize 123 as being religious in nature, an astonishingly low 6.98 percent of all wars. However, when one subtracts wars waged in the name of Islam (66), the percentage falls to 3.23 percent.\nThat means that all faiths combined \u2013 minus Islam \u2013 have caused less than 4% of all of humanity's wars and violent conflicts. Further, religion was not a motivating factor in the wars that have resulted in the most loss of life.\nThe truth is, non-religious motivations and naturalistic philosophies bear the blame for nearly all of humankind's wars. Any appeal to the contrary or arguments that dictators like Hitler were Christians simply do not hold up under historical scrutiny.\nMoreover, the number of lives lost during true religious conflicts does not compare to the number lost during atheistic regimes \u2013 a fact showcased in R. J. Rummel's work Lethal Politics and Death by Government:\nRummel says, \"Almost 170 million men, women and children have been shot, beaten, tortured, knifed, burned, starved, frozen, crushed or worked to death; buried alive, drowned, hung, bombed or killed in any other of a myriad of ways governments have inflicted death on unarmed, helpless citizens and foreigners. The dead could conceivably be nearly 360 million people. It is as though our species has been devastated by a modern Black Plague. And indeed it has, but a plague of Power, not germs.\"\nThe historical evidence is quite clear: religion is not the primary cause of war.\nIf religion can't be blamed for most wars and violence, then what is the cause? The principal trigger is the same thing that produces crime, cruelty, loss of life, and other such things: \"For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.  All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person\" (Mark 7:21\u201323 ). The problem, according to Jesus, is sin.\nJames (naturally) agrees with Christ: \"What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel\" (James 4:1-2 ).\nIn the end, the evidence shows that the atheists are quite wrong about what causes most wars. The sinful human condition is the number-one cause of war and violence, not religion, and certainly not Christianity.\nReturn to:\nTruth about Worldview and Apologetics"}, {"Url": "https://huffpost.com/entry/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766", "CluewebURLHash": "D64D958D07B08F440AAB41DC468631A4", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Is Religion the Cause of Most Wars? | HuffPost", "Snippet": "Most modern\ue000 wars,\ue001 including the Napoleonic Campaign, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the American Civil\ue000 War,\ue001 World\ue000 War\ue001 I, the Russia Revolution, World\ue000 War\ue001 II, and the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, were not\ue000 religious\ue001 in nature or cause.

The wars of the ancient world were rarely, if ever, based on religion.\nBy\nRabbi Alan Lurie, Contributor\nAuthor, 'Five Minutes on Mondays: Finding Unexpected, Purpose, Peace and Fulfillment at Work'\nApr. 10, 2012, 04:09 PM EDT | Updated Jun. 10, 2012\nThis post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

It is understandable that these misconceptions persist, though, because they come from the loudest voices on the extremes, and like other polarizing positions in politics and culture are simplistic ideas that promote easy \"us vs. them\" thinking. But there is one common misconception about religion that is voiced often and consistently as an obvious truth -- often by educated, thoughtful people --that is just not factually true: The idea that religion has been the cause of most wars.\nIn his hilarious analysis of The 10 Commandments, George Carlin said to loud applause, \"More people have been killed in the name of God than for any other reason,\" and many take this idea as an historical fact. When I hear someone state that religion has caused most wars, though, I will often and ask the person to name these wars. The response is typically, \"Come on! The Crusades, The Inquisition, Northern Ireland, the Middle East, 9/11. Need I name more?\"\nWell, yes, we do need to name more, because while clearly there were wars that had religion as the prime cause, an objective look at history reveals that those killed in the name of religion have, in fact, been a tiny fraction in the bloody history of human conflict. In their recently published book, \"Encyclopedia of Wars,\" authors Charles Phillips and Alan Axelrod document the history of recorded warfare, and from their list of 1763 wars only 123 have been classified to involve a religious cause, accounting for less than 7 percent of all wars and less than 2 percent of all people killed in warfare. While, for example, it is estimated that approximately one to three million people were tragically killed in the Crusades, and perhaps 3,000 in the Inquisition, nearly 35 million soldiers and civilians died in the senseless, and secular, slaughter of World War 1 alone.\nHistory simply does not support the hypothesis that religion is the major cause of conflict. The wars of the ancient world were rarely, if ever, based on religion. These wars were for territorial conquest, to control borders, secure trade routes, or respond to an internal challenge to political authority. In fact, the ancient conquerors, whether Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, or Roman, openly welcomed the religious beliefs of those they conquered, and often added the new gods to their own pantheon.\nMedieval and Renaissance wars were also typically about control and wealth as city-states vied for power, often with the support, but rarely instigation, of the Church. And the Mongol Asian rampage, which is thought to have killed nearly 30 million people, had no religious component whatsoever.\nMost modern wars, including the Napoleonic Campaign, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the American Civil War, World War I, the Russia Revolution, World War II, and the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, were not religious in nature or cause. While religious groups have been specifically targeted (most notably in World War II), to claim that religion was the cause is to blame the victim and to misunderstand the perpetrators' motives, which were nationalistic and ethnic, not religious.\nSimilarly, the vast numbers of genocides (those killed in ethic cleanses, purges, etc. that are not connected to a declared war) are not based on religion. It's estimated that over 160 million civilians were killed in genocides in the 20th century alone, with nearly 100 million killed by the Communist states of USSR and China. While some claim that Communism itself is a \"state religion\" -- because it has an absolute dictator whose word is law and a \"holy book\" of unchallenged rules -- such a claim simply equates \"religion\" with the human desire for power, conformance, and control, making any distinctions with other human institutions meaningless.\nOf course the Hebrew Bible chronicles many wars -- most notably Moses' conflicts in the desert and Joshua's conquest of the nations of Canaan -- and we may see these as examples of religiously sanctioned violence. Here, though, we must recognize that archeological evidence points to the conclusion that these conquests never occurred, or at least not as dramatically as described in the Bible. As one who reads the Bible for spiritual truths, not historical facts, I am, of course, quite happy that no such slaughters occurred. The ancient Rabbis also understood these stories not as celebrated victories, but as warnings about the dangers of warfare.\nJudaism has always taught that war may only be considered when there is a clear threat, and only after every other option has been exhausted. Avoiding war must be the goal. Deuteronomy states, \"When you approach a city to do battle with it you should call to it in peace.\" In other words, even when threatened, seeking peace must be the first course of action. The ancient Rabbis took this teaching so far as to flatly state, \"In God's eyes the man stands high who makes peace between men. But he stands highest who establishes peace among the nations.\"\nTo be clear, this is not to say that religion is not a cause of conflict. Obviously it is, has been, and no doubt will continue to be. Clearly there are those who have committed horrendous acts based on religious zeal, and we must be alert to these threats and respond forcefully. But in a world with billions of people who are self-defined as religious, those who believe that violence is the will of God and that the murder of innocents is a holy act are a small, insane minority.\nPeace is the highest religious aspiration for which we must work. As he envisioned a future where the world is perfected by the conscious acts of human beings, the ancient Hebrew prophet Isaiah wrote, \"They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\" While religions have often fallen well short of this utopian vision, we must recognize that greed, unbalanced power, and causeless hatred - not religion - are the causes of most wars, and eliminating these should be our focus.\nreligion violence religious war Judaism\nPopular in the Community"}, {"Url": "https://deadlineessay.com/does-religion-cause-war", "CluewebURLHash": "511D27DDCF0E3BACFD93702B7B3BBB45", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Does Religion Cause War? - Deadline Essay", "Snippet": "Therefore although religion might have some involvement in conflicts and wars globally, religion does\ue000 not\ue001 cause war, and those wars motivated by faith have a low percentage compared to wars on other bases.", "Click_Cnt": 0.115, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0033-72-14886", "CluewebDocument": "Does Religion Cause War? - Deadline Essay\nDoes Religion Cause War?\nDoes Religion Cause War?\nScholars define religion as a system of socio-cultural practices, ethics, worldviews, practices, and behaviors.

Political violence is a result of ideological differences and fights over resources, including that of territories. Religion has dominated every aspect of life for centuries, primarily through indoctrination, and it is through this that religion is seen as a cause of war. Religion was the cause of drawing of borders where some people considered themselves unique and different based on the differences in matters concerning their faith. The divisions resulted in uprisings and warfare among many kingdoms. Many people view religion as a significant feature in historical conflicts and, most recently, as a wave of modern terrorism. However, religion is not the primary cause of war.\nLet me start by analyzing the wars of the ancient world, which involved Persians, Greeks, Babylonians, and the Roman empires. These wars were basically to secure borders, expansion of territories, secure trading routes, or building empires. In the case of the Babylonian war, History has it that conflict involved two rulers Antigonus and Seleucus, who wanted to rule the empire after the death of Alexander the Great. Babylon is one of those empires that lived in warfare, but it is not because of religion but hunger for power. The battles of the ancient kingdoms did not seize but extended to the middle ages. During the Middle Ages, the war was mainly due to contests over possession of properties, primarily feudal properties and power of different city-states. The Mongols, Barbarian invasions, and all other invasions during this time were mainly due to the pursuit of land and livestock, which were primarily the sign of wealth of these Kingdoms. War did not seize in the middle age era because, during the 17th to 19th centuries, colonization of countries by superpowers was the main issue. Conquest saw the British, Spanish, Dutch, and the Portuguese fight over colonial powers. It was also the time when the missionaries emerged. Missionaries influenced their colonies with their beliefs and practices, but religious components had very little to do with colonial conquest. Human history has experienced mass murders and genocides because of the rulers who were hungry for power. Superpower countries have not been left behind, especially during the second world war, which experienced a significant loss and a great depression altogether. One might ask, what might be the cause of the war? The war was all about power, ambitions, treaties, and differences in ideologies.\nThere has been a war between Iran and the USA. But this war did not start recently but in April 1980. According to the Pew poll conducted in 2018, about thirty-nine percent of Americans said that to limit the influence of Iran should be the priority and among the top foreign policies. Is religion the cause of the war? Faith is not the cause, but political relations when Shah of Iran dispatched first Iran\u2019s ambassador in Washington Dc is when ambassadorial conflicts started. One cannot hide the fact that religion has been the cause of some wars.\nAn example is brutal terrorist attacks in Paris that result in the death of innocent people. The war was coordinated by an Islamic group ISIS which claimed responsibility. Similarly, there are the infamous al-Qaeda attacks in September 2001 in the USA was on religious motivated and was part of the holy war(Jihad) against Western societies. Ibn Khaldun, a Muslim philosopher, and historian, argues that the holy war is a religious duty because of the Muslim mission to convert people to Islam either by force or through persuasion. Muslim extremists have gone to the extent of forming groups such as ISIS and many others in a bid to spread Islam with the aim of global domination.\nIn his book, Robin Schumacher makes a comparison of conflicts caused by religion and those that have nothing to do with the faith, and clearly, he states that although most wars have religious backgrounds, religion is not the leading cause of these wars. Whether or not some wars are caused by faith, it is something that cannot be measured, and when figures are used, it turns out that contrary to what many people think, very few wars are based on religion. Therefore although religion might have some involvement in conflicts and wars globally, religion does not cause war, and those wars motivated by faith have a low percentage compared to wars on other bases.\nGet professional assignment help cheaply\nAre you busy and do not have time to handle your assignment?

We all see many indications of it every day, and we all know it when we see it.\" (Kimball 15). Totems, witchcraft, liberalism, Japanese tea ceremonies, nationalism, sports, and a lot of other institutions treated under the rubric religion according to the religious studies literature. Comparable to Theravada Buddhism and Confucianism, if one tries to limit the meaning of the religion faith in God or gods then certain belief systems that conviction called religions for a fact. If the value adds belief systems, then all sorts of practices go down under the definition of religion.\nThe debate between whether religion cause war or not based on their impression of religion; furthermore, it is unreasonably clear about what does and does not permit like a religion. Countries such as Islam are fated while certain others, like nationalism, are subjectively ignored. Authors used different theories such as absolutist, divisive, and absurd to explain why religion is so predisposed to violence. Sometimes authors combine these arguments to make their case.\nIn Martin Marty book, Politics, Religion, and the Common Good, Marty argues that there is a movement of violence in religion.

This is a matter of historical fact. Since time immemorial, men have fought each other in wars caused by religion. There are at least three instances by which religion causes war.\nThe first is when people try to compel other people to adopt their religion or religious perspectives.

That desire can be accompanied with a strong zeal such that if others are impervious to our peaceful approach\nReligion is a cause of all wars, is a phrase which is often heard and said by many.

These wars can involve one nation fighting against another who have different beliefs\nThere is a conventional belief among many individuals that religion is the main cause of the present and past wars inflicting torment within the world. However, many humans fail to see past that belief; they are unable to understand that religion is just a small factor amongst the many contributing to the cause of wars. In fact, religion is merely a tool and an excuse used to hide the need for power and sins of the human nature. Among these factors, it may be the misinterpretation of religious teachings\nReligion Causes War.\"\n\nSo often is this sentiment heard in the best sellers from Richard Dawkins to Sam Harris that it has almost become a proverb.

War causes negative effects on religion, moral values, death and destruction of properties. The morality of war has become a debatable issue in the modern society. This is because of the adverse effects caused by war. Morality in the society is determined by the behavior and character of an individual. For example, society appreciates people having good behaviors as they are viewed as morally right. The society condemns\nFinding the purpose of life has always been a constant in human history and religions have been the predominant answer to this need for a long period of time.

Religion divides people into separate groups and tells them that they are incompatible with each other. It provides justification for the killing of others and the promise of reward for martyrs.\nThere are numerous examples of religious wars. Some of the main ones include the Crusades, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, The War On Terror, The Thirty Year War, Northern Ireland and the numerous religious wars of England and France (which culminated in the Saint Bartholomew Day Massacre). A frequent justification for the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese etc, (which led to horrendous massacres) empires was so that the natives could be converted to Christianity. Religions claim they have the one truth that will save only them and all other religions are wrong and/or the work of the devil. The Torah, Bible and Koran all contain justifications for the killing of non-believers (who after all are going to Hell). They are clear that following a different religion is an unforgivable crime deserving death and destruction of entire cities (see here ). 2nd\u00a0Kings 10:19-27 records how every member of the religion of Baal was killed (with God\u2019s approval). \u00a02nd\u00a0Chronicles 28:6 records the killing of 120,000 \u201cvaliant\u201d men because they did not worship God. These are two of many examples.\nReligion played a part in causing World War Two (as well as nationalism). Hitler believed he was doing God\u2019s work (see a post on this topic ), denounced atheism and regularly referred to God in his speeches. The Holocaust built upon the anti-Semitism that came from the Christian belief that Jews were guilty of murdering Jesus (see here ). If there had been no religion, there would be no difference between Christians and Jews and therefore no persecution. Fascist dictatorships in Spain, Italy and Latin America were strongly supported and endorsed by the Catholic Church.\nSome argue that Atheism is responsible for the crimes of Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. However this is confusing correlation and causation. They killed people because they were brutal Communist dictators, not because of their religious beliefs (or lack of any). Collectivisation still would have failed and caused famines killing millions, regardless of the religious beliefs of the nation. For comparison, Scandinavian countries are very secular, yet are not dictatorships. (see here)\nEven wars which were caused by reasons other than religion, religion was used to justify it and motivate soldiers. For example, the fact that Protestant Germany invaded Catholic Belgium was a main part of the recruitment process in Ireland during World War One, even though it was not a purely religious war.\nReligion creates division between people who otherwise have little differences. It justifies hate and murder. It is responsible for numerous wars and conflicts. Along with nationalism it is the major cause of war.\n(In my next post I will look at this topic in a specifically Irish context)\nShare this:\nLike\n5 bloggers like this.\nRelated\nReligion As A Cause Of War In\u00a0Ireland\nIn \"Religion\"\nWorld Without God\nThere are many reasons why I am an Atheist, but at the core, I believe it is far more likely that we live in a world without God rather than one with one.

This story is part of the conventional wisdom of Western societies, and it underlies many of our institutions and policies, from limits on the public role of religion to efforts to promote democracy in the Middle East.\nIn this essay, I am going to challenge that conventional wisdom, but not in the ways it is usually challenged by people who identify themselves as religious. Such people will sometimes argue that the real motivation behind so-called religious violence is in fact economic and political, not religious. Others will argue that people who do violence are, by definition, not religious. The Crusader is not really a Christian, for example, because he doesn\u2019t really understand the meaning of Christianity. I don\u2019t think that either of these arguments works. In the first place, it is impossible to separate out religious from economic and political motives in such a way that religious motives are innocent of violence. How could one, for example, separate religion from politics in Islam, when Muslims themselves make no such separation? In the second place, it may be the case that the Crusader has misappropriated the true message of Christ, but one cannot therefore excuse Christianity of all responsibility. Christianity is not primarily a set of doctrines, but a lived historical experience embodied and shaped by the empirically observable actions of Christians. So I have no intention of excusing Christianity or Islam or any other faith system from careful analysis. Given certain conditions, Christianity, Islam, and other faiths can and do contribute to violence.\nBut what is implied in the conventional wisdom that religion is prone to violence is that Christianity, Islam, and other faiths are more inclined toward violence than ideologies and institutions that are identified as \u201csecular.\u201d It is this story that I will challenge here. I will do so in two steps. First, I will show that the division of ideologies and institutions into the categories \u201creligious\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d is an arbitrary and incoherent division. When we examine academic arguments that religion causes violence, we find that what does or does not count as religion is based on subjective and indefensible assumptions. As a result certain kinds of violence are condemned, and others are ignored. Second, I ask, \u201cIf the idea that there is something called \u2018religion\u2019 that is more violent than so-called \u2018secular\u2019 phenomena is so incoherent, why is the idea so pervasive?\u201d The answer, I think, is that we in the West find it comforting and ideologically useful. The myth of religious violence helps create a blind spot about the violence of the putatively secular nation-state. We like to believe that the liberal state arose to make peace between warring religious factions. Today, the Western liberal state is charged with the burden of creating peace in the face of the cruel religious fanaticism of the Muslim world. The myth of religious violence promotes a dichotomy between us in the secular West who are rational and peacemaking, and them, the hordes of violent religious fanatics in the Muslim world. Their violence is religious, and therefore irrational and divisive. Our violence, on the other hand, is rational, peacemaking, and necessary. Regrettably, we find ourselves forced to bomb them into the higher rationality.\nThe Incoherence of the Argument\nThe English-speaking academic world has been inundated\u2014especially since September 11, 2001\u2014by books and articles attempting to explain why religion has a peculiar tendency toward violence. They come from authors in many different fields: sociology, political science, religious studies, history, theology. I don\u2019t have time here to analyze each argument in depth, but I will examine a variety of examples\u2014taken from some of the most prominent books on the subject\u2014of what they all have in common: an inability to find a convincing way to separate religious violence from secular violence.\nCharles Kimball\u2019s book When Religion Becomes Evil begins with the following claim: \u201cIt is somewhat trite, but nevertheless sadly true, to say that more wars have been waged, more people killed, and these days more evil perpetrated in the name of religion than by any other institutional force in human history.\u201d 1 Kimball apparently considers this claim too trite to need proving, for he makes no attempt to reinforce it with evidence. If one were to try to prove it, one would need a concept of religion that would be at least theoretically separable from other institutional forces over the course of history. Kimball does not identify those rival institutional forces, but an obvious contender might be political institutions: tribes, empires, kingdoms, fiefs, states, and so on. The problem is that religion was not considered something separable from such political institutions until the modern era, and then primarily in the West. What sense could be made of separating out Egyptian or Roman \u201creligion\u201d from the Egyptian or Roman \u201cstate\u201d? Is Aztec \u201cpolitics\u201d to blame for their bloody human sacrifices, or is Aztec \u201creligion\u201d to blame? As Wilfred Cantwell Smith showed in his landmark 1962 book, The Meaning and End of Religion, \u201creligion\u201d as a discrete category of human activity separable from \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cpolitics,\u201d and other areas of life is an invention of the modern West. In the course of a detailed historical study of the concept \u201creligion,\u201d Smith was compelled to conclude that in premodern Europe there was no significant concept equivalent to what we think of as \u201creligion,\u201d and furthermore there is no \u201cclosely equivalent concept in any culture that has not been influenced by the modern West.\u201d 2 Since Smith\u2019s book, Russell McCutcheon, Richard King, Derek Peterson, and a host of other scholars have demonstrated how European colonial bureaucrats invented the concept of religion in the course of categorizing non-Western colonized cultures as irrational and antimodern. 3\nNow that we do have a separate concept of \u201creligion,\u201d though, is the concept a coherent one? Jonathan Z. Smith writes: \u201cReligion is solely the creation of the scholar\u2019s study . . . . Religion has no independent existence apart from the academy.\u201d 4 Brian C. Wilson says that the inability to define religion is \u201calmost an article of methodological dogma\u201d in the field of religious studies. 5 Timothy Fitzgerald argues that there is no coherent concept of religion; the term should be regarded as a form of mystification and scrapped. 6 We have one group of scholars convinced that religion causes violence, and another group of scholars which does not think that there is such a thing as \u201creligion,\u201d except as an intellectual construct of highly dubious value.\nThe former group carries on as if the latter did not exist. Kimball is one of the few who acknowledges the problem, but he dismisses it as merely semantic. Describing how flustered his students become when he asks them to write a definition of \u201creligion,\u201d Kimball asserts, \u201cClearly these bright students know what religion is\u201d; they just have trouble defining it. After all, Kimball assures us, \u201cReligion is a central feature of human life. We all see many indications of it every day, and we all know it when we see it.\u201d 7 When an academic says such a thing, you should react as you would when a used car salesman says, \u201cEverybody knows this is a good car.\u201d The fact is that we don\u2019t all know it when we see it. A survey of religious studies literature finds totems, witchcraft, the rights of man, Marxism, liberalism, Japanese tea ceremonies, nationalism, sports, free market ideology, and a host of other institutions and practices treated under the rubric \u201creligion.\u201d 8 If one tries to limit the definition of religion to belief in God or gods, then certain belief systems that are usually called \u201creligions\u201d are eliminated, such as Theravada Buddhism and Confucianism. If the definition is expanded to include such belief systems, then all sorts of practices, including many that are usually labeled \u201csecular,\u201d fall under the definition of religion. Many institutions and ideologies that do not explicitly refer to God or gods function in the same way as those that do. The case for nationalism as a religion, for example, has been made repeatedly from Carlton Hayes\u2019s 1960 classic Nationalism: A Religion to more recent works by Peter van der Veer, Talal Asad, Carolyn Marvin, and others. 9 Carolyn Marvin argues that \u201cnationalism is the most powerful religion in the United States.\u201d 10\nAt this point I can imagine an objection being raised that goes like this: \u201cSo the concept of religion has some fuzzy edges. So does every concept. We might not be able to nail down, once and for all and in all cases, what a \u2018culture\u2019 is, or what qualifies as \u2018politics,\u2019 for example, but nevertheless the concepts remain useful. All may not agree on the periphery of these concepts, but sufficient agreement on the center of such concepts makes them practical and functional. Most people know that \u2018religion\u2019 includes Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and the major \u2018world religions.\u2019 Whether or not Buddhism or Confucianism fits is a boundary dispute best left up to scholars who make their living splitting hairs.\u201d\nThis appears to be a commonsense response, but it misses the point rather completely. In the first place, when some scholars question whether the category of religion is useful at all, it is more than a boundary dispute. There are some who do not believe there is a center. In the second place, and much more significantly, the problem with the \u201creligion and violence\u201d arguments is not that their working definitions of religion are too fuzzy. The problem is precisely the opposite. Their implicit definitions of religion are unjustifiably clear about what does and does not qualify as a religion. Certain belief systems, like Islam, are condemned, while certain others, like nationalism, are arbitrarily ignored.\nThis becomes most apparent when the authors in question attempt to explain why religion is so prone to violence. Although theories vary, we can sort them into three categories: religion is absolutist, religion is divisive, and religion is irrational. Many authors appeal to more than one of these arguments. In the face of evidence that so-called secular ideologies and institutions can be just as absolutist, divisive, or irrational, these authors tend to erect an arbitrary barrier between \u201csecular\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d ideologies and institutions, and ignore the former.\nConsider the case of the preeminent historian Martin Marty. In a book on public religion, Politics, Religion, and the Common Good, Marty argues that religion has a particular tendency to be divisive and therefore violent. When it comes to defining what \u201creligion\u201d means, however, Marty lists 17 different definitions of religion, then begs off giving his own definition, since, he says, \u201c[s]cholars will never agree on the definition of religion.\u201d Instead, Marty gives a list of five \u201cfeatures\u201d that mark a religion. He then proceeds to show how \u201cpolitics\u201d displays all five of the same features. Religion focuses our ultimate concern, and so does politics. Religion builds community, and so does politics. Religion appeals to myth and symbol, and politics \u201cmimics\u201d this appeal in devotion to the flag, war memorials, and so on. Religion uses rites and ceremonies, such as circumcision and baptism, and \u201c[p]olitics also depends on rites and ceremonies,\u201d even in avowedly secular nations. Religion requires followers to behave in certain ways, and \u201c[p]olitics and governments also demand certain behaviors.\u201d In offering five defining features of \u201creligion,\u201d and showing how \u201cpolitics\u201d fits all five, he is trying to show how closely intertwined religion and politics are, but he ends up demolishing any theoretical basis for separating the two. Nevertheless, he continues on to warn of the dangers of religion, while ignoring the violent tendencies of supposedly \u201csecular\u201d politics. For example, Marty cites the many cases of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who were attacked, beaten, tarred, castrated, and imprisoned in the United States in the 1940s because they believed that followers of Jesus Christ should not salute a flag. One would think that he would draw the obvious conclusion that zealous nationalism can cause violence. Instead, Marty concludes: \u201cit became obvious that religion, which can pose \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 . . . carries risks and can be perceived by others as dangerous. Religion can cause all kinds of trouble in the public arena.\u201d 11 For Marty, \u201creligion\u201d refers not to the ritual vowing of allegiance to a flag, but only to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses refusal to do so.\nAs you can see, we need not rely only on McCutcheon, Smith, King, Fitzgerald, and the rest to show us that the religious/secular dichotomy is incoherent. Religion-and-violence theorists inevitably undermine their own distinctions. Take, for example, sociologist Mark Juergensmeyer\u2019s book Terror in the Mind of God, perhaps the most widely influential academic book on religion and violence. According to Juergensmeyer, religion exacerbates the tendency to divide people into friends and enemies, good and evil, us and them, by ratcheting divisions up to a cosmic level. \u201cWhat makes religious violence particularly savage and relentless\u201d is that it puts worldly conflicts in a \u201clarger than life\u201d context of \u201ccosmic war.\u201d Secular political conflicts\u2014that is, \u201cmore rational\u201d conflicts, such as those over land\u2014are of a fundamentally different character than those in which the stakes have been raised by religious absolutism to cosmic proportions. Religious violence differs from secular violence in that it is symbolic, absolutist, and unrestrained by historical time. 12\nHowever, keeping the notion of cosmic war separate from secular political war is impossible on Juergensmeyer\u2019s own terms. Juergensmeyer undermines this distinction in the course of his own analysis. For example, what he says about cosmic war is virtually indistinguishable from what he says about war in general:\nLooking closely at the notion of war, one is confronted with the idea of dichotomous opposition on an absolute scale. . . . War suggests an all-or-nothing struggle against an enemy whom one assumes to be determined to destroy. No compromise is deemed possible. The very existence of the opponent is a threat, and until the enemy is either crushed or contained, one\u2019s own existence cannot be secure. What is striking about a martial attitude is the certainty of one\u2019s position and the willingness to defend it, or impose it on others, to the end.\nSuch certitude on the part of one side may be regarded as noble by those whose sympathies lie with it and dangerous by those who do not. But either way it is not rational. 13\nWar provides an excuse not to compromise. In other words, \u201cWar provides a reason to be violent. This is true even if the worldly issues at heart in the dispute do not seem to warrant such a ferocious position.\u201d The division between mundane secular war and cosmic war vanishes as fast as it was constructed. According to Juergensmeyer, war itself is a \u201cworldview\u201d; indeed, \u201cThe concept of war provides cosmology, history, and eschatology and offers the reins of political control.\u201d \u201cLike the rituals provided by religious traditions, warfare is a participatory drama that exemplifies\u2014and thus explains\u2014the most profound aspects of life.\u201d Here, war itself is a kind of religious practice.\nAt times Juergensmeyer admits the difficulty of separating religious violence from mere political violence. \u201cMuch of what I have said about religious terrorism in this book may be applied to other forms of political violence\u2014especially those that are ideological and ethnic in nature.\u201d 14 In Juergensmeyer\u2019s earlier book, The New Cold War? Religious Nationalism Confronts the Secular State, he writes: \u201cSecular nationalism, like religion, embraces what one scholar calls \u2018a doctrine of destiny.\u2019 One can take this way of looking at secular nationalism a step further and state flatly . . . that secular nationalism is \u2018a religion.\u2019 \u201c 15 These are important concessions. If true, however, they subvert the entire basis of his argument, which is the sharp divide between religious and secular violence.\nOther theorists of religion and violence make similar admissions. Kimball, for example, says in passing that \u201cblind religious zealotry is similar to unfettered nationalism,\u201d and, indeed, nationalism would seem to fit\u2014at times\u2014all five of Kimball\u2019s \u201cwarning signs\u201d for when religion turns evil: absolute truth claims, blind obedience, establishment of ideal times, ends justifying means, and the declaration of holy war. The last one would seem to preclude secular ideologies, but as Kimball himself points out, the United States regularly invokes a \u201ccosmic dualism\u201d in its war on terror. 16 Political theorist Bhikhu Parekh similarly undermines his own point in his article on religious violence. According to Parekh,\nAlthough religion can make a valuable contribution to political life, it can also be a pernicious influence, as liberals rightly highlight. It is often absolutist, self-righteous, arrogant, dogmatic, and impatient of compromise. It arouses powerful and sometimes irrational impulses and can easily destabilize society, cause political havoc, and create a veritable hell on earth. . . . It often breeds intolerance of other religions as well as of internal dissent, and has a propensity towards violence. 17\nParekh does not define religion, but assumes the validity of the religious/secular distinction. Nevertheless, he admits that \u201cseveral secular ideologies, such as some varieties of Marxism, conservatism, and even liberalism have a quasi-religious orientation and form, and conversely formally religious languages sometimes have a secular content, so that the dividing line between a secular and a religious language is sometimes difficult to draw.\u201d 18 If this is true, where does it leave his searing indictment of the dangers peculiarly inherent to religion? Powerful irrational impulses are popping up all over, including in liberalism itself, forcing the creation of the category \u201cquasi-religious\u201d to try somehow to corral them all back under the heading of \u201creligion.\u201d But if liberalism\u2014which is based on the distinction between religion and the secular\u2014is itself a kind of religion, then the religious/secular distinction crumbles into a heap of contradictions.\nFor some religion-and-violence theorists, the contradictions are resolved by openly expanding the definition of \u201creligion\u201d to include ideologies and practices that are usually called \u201csecular.\u201d In his book Why People Do Bad Things in the Name of Religion, religious studies scholar Richard Wentz blames violence on absolutism. People create absolutes out of fear of their own limitations. Absolutes are projections of a fictional limited self, and people react with violence when others do not accept them. Religion has a peculiar tendency toward absolutism, says Wentz, but he casts a very wide net when considering religion. Wentz believes that religiousness is an inescapable universal human characteristic displayed even by those who reject what is called \u201corganized religion.\u201d Faith in technology, secular humanism, consumerism, football fanaticism, and a host of other worldviews can be counted as religions, too. Wentz is compelled to conclude, rather lamely, \u201cPerhaps all of us do bad things in the name of (or as a representative of) religion.\u201d 19\nWentz should be commended for his consistency in not trying to erect an artificial division between \u201creligious\u201d and \u201csecular\u201d types of absolutism. The price of consistency, however, is that he evacuates his own argument of explanatory force or usefulness. The word \u201creligion\u201d in the title of his book\u2014 Why People Do Bad Things in the Name of Religion \u2014ends up meaning anything people do that gives their lives order and meaning. A more economical title for his book would have been Why People Do Bad Things. The term \u201creligion\u201d is so broad that it serves no useful analytical purpose.\nAt this point, the religion-and-violence theorist might try to salvage the argument by saying something like this: \u201cSurely secular ideologies such as nationalism can get out of hand, but religion has a much greater tendency toward fanaticism because the object of its truth claims is absolute in ways that secular claims are not. The capitalist knows that money is just a human creation, the liberal democrat is modest about what can be known beyond human experience, the nationalist knows that a country is made of land and mortal people, but the religious believer puts faith in a god or gods or at least a transcendent reality that lays claim to absolute validity. It is this absolutism that makes obedience blind and causes the believer to subjugate all means to a transcendent end.\u201d\nThe problem with this argument is that what counts as \u201cabsolute\u201d is decided a priori and is immune to empirical testing. It is based on theological descriptions of beliefs and not on observation of the believers\u2019 behavior. Of course Christian orthodoxy would make the theological claim that God is absolute in a way that nothing else is. The problem is that humans are constantly tempted toward idolatry, to putting what is merely relative in the place of God. It is not enough, therefore, to claim that worship of God is absolutist. The real question is, what god is actually being worshiped?\nBut surely, the objection might go, nobody really thinks the flag or the nation or money or sports idols are their \u201cgods\u201d\u2014that is just a metaphor. However, the question is not simply one of belief, but of behavior. If a person claims to believe in the Christian God but never gets off the couch on Sunday morning and spends the rest of the week in obsessive pursuit of profit in the bond market, then what is \u201cabsolute\u201d in that person\u2019s life in a functional sense is probably not the Christian God. Matthew 6:24 personifies Mammon as a rival god, not in the conviction that such a divine being really exists, but from the empirical observation that people have a tendency to treat all sorts of things as absolutes.\nSuppose we apply an empirical test to the question of absolutism. \u201cAbsolute\u201d is itself a vague term, but in the \u201creligion and violence\u201d arguments it appears to indicate the tendency to take something so seriously that violence results. The most relevant empirically testable definition of \u201cabsolute,\u201d then, would be \u201cthat for which one is willing to kill.\u201d This test has the advantage of covering behavior, and not simply what one claims to believe. Now let us ask the following two questions: What percentage of Americans who identify themselves as Christians would be willing to kill for their Christian faith? What percentage would be willing to kill for their country? Whether we attempt to answer these questions by survey or by observing American Christians\u2019 behavior in wartime, it seems clear that, at least among American Christians, the nation-state is subject to far more absolutist fervor than Christianity. For most American Christians, even public evangelization is considered to be in poor taste, and yet most endorse organized slaughter on behalf of the nation as sometimes necessary and often laudable. In other countries or other traditions the results of this test might be very different. The point is that such empirical testing is of far more usefulness than general theories about the violence of \u201creligion.\u201d\nWe must conclude that there is no coherent way to isolate \u201creligious\u201d ideologies with a peculiar tendency toward violence from their tamer \u201csecular\u201d counterparts. So-called secular ideologies and institutions like nationalism and liberalism can be just as absolutist, divisive, and irrational as so-called religion. People kill for all sorts of things. An adequate approach to the problem would be resolutely empirical: under what conditions do certain beliefs and practices\u2014jihad, the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market, the sacrificial atonement of Christ, the role of the United States as worldwide liberator\u2014turn violent? The point is not simply that \u201csecular\u201d violence should be given equal attention to \u201creligious\u201d violence. The point is that the distinction between \u201csecular\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d violence is unhelpful, misleading, and mystifying, and should be avoided altogether.\nWhat Is the Argument For?\nIf the conventional wisdom that religion causes violence is so incoherent, why is it so prevalent? I believe it is because we in the West find it useful. In domestic politics, it serves to silence representatives of certain kinds of faiths in the public sphere. The story is told repeatedly that the liberal state has learned to tame the dangerous divisiveness of contending religious beliefs by reducing them to essentially private affairs. In foreign policy, the conventional wisdom helps reinforce and justify Western attitudes and policies toward the non-Western world, especially Muslims, whose primary point of difference with the West is their stubborn refusal to tame religious passions in the public sphere. \u201cWe in the West long ago learned the sobering lessons of religious warfare and have moved toward secularization. The liberal nation-state is essentially a peacemaker. Now we only seek to share the blessings of peace with the Muslim world. Regrettably, because of their stubborn fanaticism, it is sometimes necessary to bomb them into liberal democracy.\u201d In other words, the myth of religious violence establishes a reassuring dichotomy between their violence\u2014which is absolutist, divisive, and irrational\u2014and our violence\u2014which is modest, unitive, and rational.\nThe myth of religious violence marks the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d worldview that attributes Muslims\u2019 animosity toward the West to their inability to learn the lessons of history and remove the baneful influence of religion from politics. Mark Juergensmeyer, for example, sets up a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d pitting the \u201cresurgence of parochial identities\u201d over against \u201cthe secular West.\u201d \u201cLike the old Cold War, the confrontation between these new forms of culture-based politics and the secular state is global in its scope, binary in its opposition, occasionally violent, and essentially a difference of ideologies.\u201d Although he tries to avoid demonizing \u201creligious nationalists,\u201d Juergensmeyer sees them as essentially \u201canti-modern.\u201d The particular ferocity of religious nationalism comes from the \u201cspecial relationship between religion and violence.\u201d The question then becomes \u201cwhether religious nationalism can be made compatible with secular nationalism\u2019s great virtues: tolerance, respect for human rights, and freedom of expression.\u201d Given the war between \u201creason and religion,\u201d however, Juergensmeyer is not optimistic; \u201cthere is ultimately no satisfactory compromise on an ideological level between religious and secular nationalism.\u201d 20\nDespite its incoherence, the idea that religion is prone to violence thus enforces a binary opposition between \u201cthe secular West\u201d and a religious Other who is essentially irrational and violent. The conflict becomes explicable in terms of the essential qualities of the two opponents, not in terms of actual historical encounters. So, for example, Juergensmeyer attempts to explain the animosity of the religious Other toward America:\nWhy is America the enemy? This question is hard for observers of international politics to answer, and harder still for ordinary Americans to fathom. Many have watched with horror as their compatriots and symbols of their country have been destroyed by people whom they do not know, from cultures they can scarcely identify on a global atlas, and for reasons that do not seem readily apparent. 21\nNevertheless, Juergensmeyer is able to come up with four reasons \u201cfrom the frames of reference\u201d of America\u2019s enemies. First, America often finds itself cast as a \u201csecondary enemy.\u201d \u201cIn its role as trading partner and political ally, America has a vested interest in shoring up the stability of regimes around the world. This has often put the United States in the unhappy position of being a defender and promoter of secular governments regarded by their religious opponents as primary foes.\u201d Juergensmeyer cites as an example the case of Iran, where \u201cAmerica was tarred by its association with the shah.\u201d The second reason often given is that America is the main source of \u201cmodern culture,\u201d which includes cultural products that others regard as immoral. Third, corporations that trade internationally tend to be based in the United States. Fourth and finally, the fear of globalization has led to a \u201cparanoid vision of American leaders\u2019 global designs.\u201d\nJuergensmeyer acknowledges, \u201cLike all stereotypes, each of these characterizations holds a certain amount of truth.\u201d The fall of the Soviet Union has left the United States as the only military superpower, and therefore \u201can easy target for blame when people have felt that their lives were going askew or were being controlled by forces they could not readily see. Yet, to dislike America is one thing; to regard it as a cosmic enemy is quite another.\u201d The main problem, according to Juergensmeyer, is \u201csatanization,\u201d that is, taking a simple opponent and casting it as a superhuman enemy in a cosmic war. Osama bin Laden, for example, had inflated America into a \u201cmythic monster.\u201d 22\nThe problem with Juergensmeyer\u2019s analysis is not just its sanitized account of colonial history, where the United States just happens to find itself associated with bad people. The problem is that history is subordinated to an essentialist account of \u201creligion\u201d in which the religious Others cannot seem to deal rationally with world events. They employ guilt by association. They have paranoid visions of globalization. They stereotype, and blame easy targets, when their lives are disrupted by forces they do not understand. They blow simple oppositions up into cosmic proportions. Understanding Muslim hostility toward America therefore does not require careful scrutiny of America\u2019s historical dealings with the Muslim world. Rather, Juergensmeyer turns our attention to the tendency of such \u201creligious\u201d actors to misunderstand such historical events, to blow them out of proportion. Understanding Iranian Shi\u2019ite militancy does not seem to require careful examination of U.S. support for overthrowing Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 and for the shah\u2019s 26-year reign of terror that was to follow. Instead, Juergensmeyer puzzles over why \u201creligious\u201d actors project such mundane things as torture and coups and oil trading into factors in a cosmic war. Juergensmeyer\u2019s analysis is comforting for us in the West because it creates a blind spot regarding our own history of violence. It calls attention to anticolonial violence, labeled \u201creligious,\u201d and calls attention away from colonial violence, labeled \u201csecular.\u201d\nThe argument that religion is prone to violence is a significant component in the construction of an opposition between \u201cthe West and the rest,\u201d as Samuel Huntington puts it. 23 Huntington\u2019s famous thesis about the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d was first put forward by Bernard Lewis in an article entitled \u201cThe Roots of Muslim Rage\u201d: \u201cIt should by now be clear that we are facing a mood and a movement far transcending the level of issues and policies and the governments that pursue them. This is no less than a clash of civilizations\u2014the perhaps irrational but surely historic reactions of an ancient rival against our Judeo-Christian heritage, our secular present, and the worldwide expansion of both.\u201d 24 As in Juergensmeyer, actual historical issues and policies and events are transcended by a consideration of the irrationality of the Muslim response to the West. The West is a monolithic reality representing modernity, which necessarily includes secularity and rationality, while the Muslim world is an equally monolithic reality which is ancient, that is, lagging behind modernity, because of its essentially religious and irrational character. This opposition of rational and irrational, secular and religious, Western and Muslim is not simply descriptive, but helps to create the opposition that it purports to describe. As Roxanne Euben writes in her study of Islamic fundamentalism, this opposition is part of a larger Enlightenment narrative in which defining reason requires its irrational other:\n[E]mbedded in the Enlightenment\u2019s (re-)definition and elevation of reason is the creation and subjection of an irrational counterpart: along with the emergence of reason as both the instrument and essence of human achievement, the irrational came to be defined primarily in opposition to what such thinkers saw as the truths of their own distinctive historical epoch. If they were the voices of modernity, freedom, liberation, happiness, reason, nobility, and even natural passion, the irrational was all that came before: tyranny, servility to dogma, self-abnegation, superstition, and false religion. Thus the irrational came to mean the domination of religion in the historical period that preceded it. 25\nThe problem with grafting Islamic fundamentalism into this narrative, according to Euben, is that it is incapable of understanding the appeal of fundamentalism on its own terms. It dismisses rather than explains. 26 It also exacerbates the enmity that it purports to describe. As Emran Qureshi and Michael Sells put it, \u201cThose who proclaim such a clash of civilizations, speaking for the West or for Islam, exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism: the assumption of a static essence, knowable immediately, of each civilization, the ability to ignore history and tradition, and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations.\u201d 27\nIn other words, the opposition of \u201creligious\u201d violence to \u201csecular\u201d peaceableness can lend itself to the justification of violence. In the book Terror and Liberalism, The New Republic contributing editor Paul Berman\u2019s call for a \u201cliberal war of liberation\u201d to be \u201cfought around the world\u201d is based on the contrast between liberalism and what he calls the \u201cmad\u201d ideology of Islamism. 28 Similarly, Andrew Sullivan, in a New York Times Magazine article entitled \u201cThis Is a Religious War,\u201d justifies war against radical Islam on epistemological grounds. He labels it a \u201creligious war,\u201d but not in the sense of Islam versus Christianity and Judaism. It is, rather, radical Islam versus Western-style \u201cindividual faith and pluralism.\u201d The problem with the Islamic world seems to be too much public faith, a loyalty to an absolute that excludes accommodation to other realities: \u201cIf faith is that strong, and it dictates a choice between action or eternal damnation, then violence can easily be justified.\u201d 29\nAt root, the problem is epistemological. According to Sullivan, it took Western Christians centuries of bloody \u201creligious wars\u201d to realize \u201cthe futility of fighting to the death over something beyond human understanding and so immune to any definitive resolution.\u201d The problem with religion is that authoritative truth is simply not available to us mortals in any form that will produce consensus rather than division. Locke, therefore, emerges as Sullivan\u2019s hero, for it was Locke who recognized the limits of human understanding of revelation and enshrined those limits in a political theory. Locke and the founding fathers saved us from the curse of killing in the name of religion. \u201cWhat the founders and Locke were saying was that the ultimate claims of religion should simply not be allowed to interfere with political and religious freedom.\u201d 30\nIn theory, we have the opposition of a cruel fanaticism with a modest and peaceloving tolerance. However, Sullivan\u2019s epistemological modesty applies only to the command of God and not to the absolute superiority of our political and cultural system over theirs. According to Sullivan, \u201cWe are fighting for the universal principles of our Constitution.\u201d Universal knowledge is available to us after all, and it underwrites the \u201cepic battle\u201d we are currently waging against fundamentalisms of all kinds. Sullivan is willing to gird himself with the language of a warrior and underwrite U.S. military adventures in the Middle East in the name of his secular faith. Sullivan entitles his piece \u201cThis Is a Religious War,\u201d though the irony seems to elude him. On the surface, the myth of religious violence establishes a dichotomy between our peaceloving secular reasonableness and their irrational religious fanaticism. Under the surface often lies an absolute \u201creligious\u201d devotion to the American vision of a hegemonic liberalism that underwrites the necessity of using violence to impose this vision on the Muslim other.\nSam Harris\u2019s book about the violence of religion, The End of Faith, dramatically illustrates this double standard. Harris condemns the irrational religious torture of witches, but provides his own argument for torturing terrorists. Harris\u2019s book is charged with the conviction that the secular West cannot reason with Muslims, but must deal with them by force. In a chapter entitled \u201cThe Problem with Islam,\u201d Harris writes: \u201cIn our dialogue with the Muslim world, we are confronted by people who hold beliefs for which there is no rational justification and which therefore cannot even be discussed, and yet these are the very beliefs that underlie many of the demands they are likely to make upon us.\u201d This is especially a problem if such people gain access to nuclear weapons. \u201cThere is little possibility of our having a cold war with an Islamist regime armed with long-range nuclear weapons. . . . In such a situation, the only thing likely to ensure our survival may be a nuclear first strike of our own. Needless to say, this would be an unthinkable crime\u2014as it would kill tens of millions of innocent civilians in a single day\u2014but it may be the only course of action available to us, given what Islamists believe.\u201d Muslims then would likely misinterpret this act of \u201cself-defense\u201d as a genocidal crusade, thus plunging the world into nuclear holocaust. \u201cAll of this is perfectly insane, of course: I have just described a plausible scenario in which much of the world\u2019s population could be annihilated on account of religious ideas that belong on the same shelf with Batman, the philosopher\u2019s stone, and unicorns.\u201d\nIn other words, if we have to slaughter millions through a nuclear first strike, it will be the fault of the Muslims and their crazy religious beliefs. Before we get to that point, Harris continues, we must encourage civil society in Islamic countries, but we cannot trust them to vote it in. \u201cIt seems all but certain that some form of benign dictatorship will generally be necessary to bridge the gap. But benignity is the key\u2014and if it cannot emerge from within a state, it must be imposed from without. The means of such imposition are necessarily crude: they amount to economic isolation, military intervention (whether open or covert), or some combination of both. While this may seem an exceedingly arrogant doctrine to espouse, it appears we have no alternatives.\u201d 31\nHarris\u2019s book is a particularly blunt version of this type of justification for neocolonial intervention, but he is by no means isolated. His book is enthusiastically endorsed by such academic superstars as Alan Dershowitz, Richard Dawkins, and Peter Singer. Indeed, Harris\u2019s logic is little different in practice from the Bush Doctrine, which says that America has access to liberal values that are \u201cright and true for every person, in every society,\u201d that we must use our power to promote such values \u201con every continent,\u201d and that America will take preemptive military action if necessary to promote such values. 32 Today, the U.S. military is attempting, through the massive use of violence, to liberate Iraq from religious violence. It is an inherently contradictory effort, and its every failure will be attributed in part to the pernicious influence of religion and its tendency toward violence. If we really wish to understand its failure, however, we will need to question the very myth of religious violence on which such military adventures depend.\nNotes:\nCharles Kimball, When Religion Becomes Evil (HarperSanFrancisco, 2002), 1.\nWilfred Cantwell Smith, The Meaning and End of Religion (Macmillan, 1962), 19.\nSee, for example, Russell McCutcheon, Manufacturing Religion: The Discourse on Sui Generis Religion and the Politics of Nostalgia (Oxford University Press, 1997); Richard King, Orientalism and Religion: Postcolonial Theory, India, and \u2018The Mystic East\u2019 (Routledge, 1999); The Invention of Religion: Rethinking Belief in Politics and History, ed.

Since time immemorial, men have fought each other in wars caused by religion. There are at least three instances by which religion causes war.\nThe first is when people try to compel other people to adopt their religion or religious perspectives.

The most popular religions in the world today are Christianity, Buddhism, and the Muslim religions.  Other religious sects exist amongst distinct groups.

The Supreme Being exists in many names with different abilities depending on every religion. The\nDoes Religion Cause Wars?\nThere is a conventional belief among many individuals that religion is the main cause of the present and past wars inflicting torment within the world. However, many humans fail to see past that belief; they are unable to understand that religion is just a small factor amongst the many contributing to the cause of wars. In fact, religion is merely a tool and an excuse used to hide the need for power and sins of the human nature. Among these factors, it may be the misinterpretation of religious teachings\nCan Religion Be A Cause Of War?\nCan Religion be a cause of War? \n\tFor centuries religion has impacted the world greatly, having an influence amongst people and their society that cause them to behave in certain ways.

II \u00a0 A Century of War (Lewiston, New York: Mellen Press), 2004.\nWhy Religions Facilitate War?\nA colleague at Swarthmore College is attempting to raise her 8-year-old son in accordance with Quaker principles. \u00a0 After meeting one Sunday, a group of Friends, including the parents, were sitting in a circle having a discussion. \u00a0 A Quaker matron pronounced, \" I hate war.\" The child responded, \"I like war.\" She replied, kindly, \u201cYou're just a little boy. \u00a0 You don't know yet what war is really like.\" \u00a0 The child did not back down. \u00a0 \"I really like war.\" \u00a0 The parents at this point hustled the child off (with a story likely to be retold often). \u00a0 I remember as an 8-year-old that my Methodist parents would not buy me a toy gun. \u00a0 So I went to the YMCA and made one out of wood that sufficed when I could not borrow the neighbor boys\u2019 guns. \u00a0 I also really liked war.\nWhat is normal for little boys is more dangerous in adults. \u00a0 Two recent books, Chris Hedges, War Is a Force that Gives us Meaning and Andrew Bacevich, The New American Militarism, discuss our nation's love of war and both link it to religion. \u00a0 \"The moral certitude of the state in wartime is a kind of fundamentalism. \u00a0 And the dangerous messianic brand of religion, one where self-doubt is minimal, has increasingly come to color the modern world of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.(1) Bacevich relates America's new thirst for militarism to the rise of militant evangelicalism's post Vietnam love affair with Israel, reinterpretation of just war of contemporary life. \u00a0 The result was to give \"moral legitimacy\" to \"military activism.\" (2)\nIn spite of our infatuation with war, I have learned that a good way to kill conversation is to respond to a new acquaintance\u2019s query as to subject of my research by saying, \u00a0 \u201cReligions\u2019 roles in war.\u201d \u00a0 This generates two responses, \u00a0 \u201cthat\u2019s relevant today\u201d or \u201creligious wars are the worst,\u201d and then the subject changes. \u00a0 Still, the popular press, particularly since 9/11, has discovered that not only realpolitik, economics, or dictators but organized religion can play a major role in war \u2013 though it is often assumed that this happens elsewhere, in Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe uncivilized nations\u201d(3) However, a close observer of America\u2019s response to 9/11 would have noticed the frequency that politicians, businesses, mass media, and individuals invoked and are still using the slogan, \u201cGod bless America,\u201d and singing the Irving Berlin song has become customary at sports events. \u00a0 When I gave an address at the annual meeting of the AFSC two months after 9/11, driving into Philadelphia on the Schuylkill expressway, a large billboard announced a special price on three adult (pornographic) movies and ended with \u201cGod bless America.\u201d\nThe meanings Americans attach to \u201cGod bless America\u201d are ambiguous. \u00a0 The biblical benediction in Numbers, \u201cThe Lord bless you and keep you \u2026and give you peace,\u201d has been simplified to affirm America the innocent and that God will give us victory in war. \u00a0\u00a0 When the slogan appears on banks or buses or car bumpers, is it there because we are sure God is on our side, or should be on our side because we are so religious, or are unsure God is now protecting us because allowing 9/11 resulted from our sins. Twentieth-century Americans wish to believe that our democracy and not our policies caused 9/11. \u00a0 The only response demanded of Americans seems to be patriotic support of the war on terrorism. \u00a0 I only saw one sign that reversed the equation, \u201cAmerica bless God,\u201d but that would have required actions from us rather than the deity.\nThe issue for this lecture is simply: was America\u2019s use of religious images to justify our military response different in kind from Al Qaeda\u2019s invoking of jihad? \u00a0 Is the link between organized religion and war historically as well as theoretically inevitable? \u00a0 The first section of this paper will analyze the words in the title to illustrate the difficulties in even defining our subject. \u00a0 The second will look at favorable attitudes toward war in the formative or canonical documents of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. \u00a0 The third will focus of these religions\u2019 attempts to control war, i.e., just war theories. \u00a0 The last part discusses the societal roles of religion that are conducive to war. \u00a0 My conclusions, in a paper handed out, can serve as a basic for further discussion.\nI. \u00a0 Defining Terms\nA first requisite in answering these questions is to define the terms: religion, facilitates, war. \u00a0 Religion as a concept works rather well in defining modern Christianity but less precisely for Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American spirituality. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scholars of religion use sacred /profane, rituals, myths, scriptures, ethics, and institutions in discussing religions. \u00a0 One can use a theological definition (a deity or a set of beliefs) or a functional (providing solace, establishing boundaries, ultimate value, normative behavior patterns), or a structural (churches, priests, sacred writings). \u00a0 None of these definitions is very satisfactory.\nWhat we think of as religions have long and complex histories enduring over centuries in all kinds of political and economic systems \u2013 sanctifying, criticizing, ignoring and escaping from them. \u00a0 So, just to look at Christianity, does one define it as a transnational body aiming at universal institution but with state forms\u2013 Roman Catholicism, or as state sponsored forms \u2013 Church of England, Russian Orthodoxy, or as a denomination \u2013 like Methodists and Disciples, or in a sectarian way \u2013 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses or Quakers. \u00a0 Or is there some essence of Christianity as a religion that allows us to ignore its diversity in belief, ritual, and practice? \u00a0\u00a0 Is Christianity\u2019s impact on war best defined by the practices of the higher clergy, men or women, educated or un-educated, devout or fellow travelers? \u00a0\u00a0 What should one conclude about the public piety of politicians \u2013 none of whom rule on a platform of fostering evil and most of whom pay lip service to morality and piety? \u00a0 Or should one use a Gallup poll of religious attitudes \u2013 as in America where a majority of the people say they do not want clergy discussing politics but want religious politicians. \u00a0 Religious rhetoric and feelings can be easily manipulated by spiritual elites or secular politicians and there is no verifiable test for religious sincerity. \u00a0 So during the rest of this paper, which is about religion and war, beware of the vagueness of the concepts. \u00a0 Our focus is upon the basic documents and functions of religious traditions that have been and continue to facilitate war, rather than specific examples from history.\nThe second term may be less problematic because it is a weak term: facilitates. Note that I did not say \u201ccause\u201d because causation requires a higher level of proof. \u00a0 Facilitates is more accurate because religion in whatever its form is never a sole cause of war. \u00a0 It is always religion plus \u2013 economics, ethnicity, form of government, character of leader, geopolitics. \u00a0 Religion becomes potent when it is so mixed with nationalism that they become indistinguishable and now appear as the dominant force of our day (although nationalism is as difficult to define as religion).\nStill, there can be religious wars. Michael Sells of Haverford sees the Serbian war in Bosnia as becoming a religious war, even though none of the populations at the beginning were particularly devout. A religious war is 1. led by clergy. 2. fought by groups defined by religion against other groups also defined by religion. \u00a0 3. the clergy justifies the war, vilifies the opponent, and absolves guilt for killing. \u00a0 4. the goals are religious \u2013 strengthening or purifying the religious group and driving out or subordinating the other group. \u00a0 5. martyrdoms. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even using this stringent definition, a religious war could also be an ethnic or a nationalistic war and apply to one side but not the other.\nUntil recently, conventional wisdom held that religious wars in Europe stopped at the peace of Westphalia in 1648; from then on wars were fought over balance of power or secular ideologies or empire. \u00a0 Backward areas used religion: examples included Islamic resistance to French colonialism in W. Africa or the Mahdi versus the British in the Sudan; Muslim against Hindu in the partition of India; Muslim vs. Russian in Chechyna; various Christian groups against the Turks in the Balkans. \u00a0 Zionism was an ambiguous phenomenon because it began as a secular ideology to create a homeland for Jews, but its advocates soon settled on Palestine for religious reasons and divisions continue over the religious implications of creating a promised land with Jewish rule in Israel.\nWith the end of the Cold War, scholars discovered religions emergence as a powerful political force in the contemporary world but it may have been there all along. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just as there is not easy way to define religion, so there is no regression analysis possible to say when religion is a major cause alone, when it is an important though secondary cause, and when it is a pretext used to facilitate war. History is, after all, not a science. But religion, when utilized by a state, makes war seem moral by legitimating it as just in cause, asserting that killing is ethically justified, and providing consolation to the bereaved. \u00a0 After all, killing outside of a state or religiously sanctioned war is just murder.\nAfter making confusing the concepts of religion and facilitates, I wish I could say that the term \u201cwar\u201d was clear, but it is not. \u00a0 War used to be legally clear: \u00a0 a state in control, armies in distinctive dress, borders. \u00a0 War was organized violence fought by soldiers against soldiers. Since the 16 th century, according to Christian and later international law theories, civilians were not targets. Rebellions were problematic but became recognized as war after the American and French Revolutions, if the rebels controlled territory. \u00a0 The rules governing behavior in an occupied country or in guerilla wars were and remain less clear. \u00a0 The 20 th century has witnessed an erosion of restraint in war so that now soldiers are less likely to be killed than civilians. \u00a0 Now also we have what is now termed \u201cfourth generation\u201d war involving a non-state actor: \u00a0 here, according to an 1989 article in the Marine Corps Gazette \u00a0 \u201cthe distinction between war and peace will be blurred to the vanishing point. \u00a0 It will be nonlinear . . . . \u00a0 The distinction between \u2018civilian\u2019 and \u2018military\u2019 may disappear.\u201d(4)\u00a0 Whether or not there is a 4 th generation warfare, Al Qaeda and the U.S. are acting to make it so. \u00a0 We have declared \u201cwar\u201d on terrorism, but in Afghanistan treated both the Taliban and foreign fighters as not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Convention and recently seems to have treated some Iraqis the same way. \u00a0 Yet the outcry over Abu Ghraib shows that there is widespread resistance to using torture even against alleged terrorists. \u00a0 The American military in Gulf War II sought to fight Saddam Hussein using smart weapons to minimize civilian casualties.\nWhat seems clear, however blurred the practice, is that the world still recognizes a distinction between a terrorist and a soldier, a war and a massacre. \u00a0 Terrorists commit crimes against non-combatants and soldiers do battle with other soldiers. \u00a0 War has publicly declared political objectives and is fought to attain them. \u00a0 (Modern terrorism is more of a media event with no clear relationship between the act and a political aim. \u00a0 Religion has often been used to legitimate terrorism, i.e. assassinations of political leaders for betraying the true faith has characterized Christianity and Islam. \u00a0 However there is a distinction between using religion in war as either a pretext or cause for criminal activity.) \u00a0 This paper is about religion and war; terrorism is not war in spite of much recent semantic confusion.\nII. Sacred Scriptures and War\nThe great religions of the world \u2013 our focus will be on Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism - proclaim their aim as bringing peace but have used their sacred writings to legitimate war. \u00a0 War against evil becomes part of the nature of creation. \u00a0 What follows is a brief description of the sacred writings and early history of the world\u2019s most influential religions in order to illustrate how deeply war and violence are in their formative documents. \u00a0 I will begin with the Bible because war is deeply imbedded in both testaments and my audience here is mostly Christian or Jewish.\nA. Judaism\nOften worldly war is related to a cosmic struggle between good and evil. \u00a0 The Bible, for example, begins with Yahweh conquering the forces of chaos \u2013 the term deep, for example in Genesis I \u201cGod moving over the face of the deep.\u201d \u00a0 The same term \u201cdeep\u201d appears again in Exodus in the Red Sea story and again in Job where it refers to a dragon killed by God. \u00a0 The Genesis, Exodus, and Job stories draw upon Babylonian myths where Marduk wars against the forces of chaos to bring order to the world. \u00a0 Still, in Genesis God does not actually war; the story has been, so to speak, baptized.\nBiblical scholars insist that the formative period of the Jewish people was the Exodus events, symbolized by the destruction of Pharaoh\u2019s force in the Red Sea, and memorized poetically by Marian\u2019s song that proclaims \u201cYahweh is a man of war.\u201d Elohim or El who fights was a war god leading the heavenly hosts who fought with Joshua for the Hebrews in the conquest of the promised land and who, according to the book of Judges, inspired males like Gideon and females like Deborah and Heber the Kenite. \u00a0\u00a0 God alone gains the victory against the Midianites and Jericho, though humans do ritual acts and mop up after Yahweh acts.\nGod\u2019s war evolved after the conquest and establishment of the monarchy with its standing army. \u00a0 Now the Lord God aids and inspires or fights along side of the king\u2019s soldiers. \u00a0\u00a0 According to the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, the relationship of the king and people to God and observance of divine law and social justice determine whether Jehovah will help the Jews and give the army victory and bring security, and will, in the words of the 23 rd Psalm, \u201cerect a table in the presence of my enemies.\u201d \u00a0 The fall of the Northern and then Southern kingdoms did not end a belief in holy war, for in Second Isaiah God ordains the rise and destruction of states. \u00a0 During the Persian and Greek empires, holy war evolved into apocalyptic war in the books of Ezra and Daniel evolved into apocalyptic war and was utilized and was reinvigorated or reinterpreted again in the struggles of the Maccabees. \u00a0 In apocalyptic war, an oppressed people without power living in a totally corrupt world is delivered by a heavenly host of angels after a climatic battle. \u00a0 The present time of troubles is a sign of the impending eschaton. \u00a0 Then a time of peace under a restored Davidic king could come on under the reign of God at the end of time. \u00a0\u00a0 Except in messianic revolts against Rome in 4 b.c., 40 a.d. and 130 a.d., holy war in any of its biblical forms would disappear as an influence upon Jewish behavior until the 1930s struggles against the Palestinians, and is now flourishing in Israel. \u00a0 The main and continuing influence of biblical descriptions of God\u2019s role in war would come through Christianity.\nB. Christianity\nThe belief in an apocalyptic war before the end of time permeates the New Testament in the synoptic gospels and the book of Revelation. \u00a0 The term \u201cson of man,\u201d\nfrequently used for Jesus, had earlier been used for the leader who would initiate the final war. \u00a0 The petition in the Lord\u2019s Prayer for \u201cthy kingdom come\u201d is for the reign of God after the final conflagration. At the end of Revelation, a figure dipped in blood \u2013 a clear reference to Jesus \u2013 will come to \u201cjudge and make war.\u201d \u00a0 For Mennonites, like Prof. John Howard Yoder, such a war does not negate our responsibility for pacifism \u2013 since it is initiated and fought by God and angels against the forces of the antichrist. \u00a0\u00a0 Many Fundamentalists do not worry about the pestilence, famine, and war accompanying the final battle (even if it is initiated by a nuclear war allegedly prophesied in First Peter), because they will be taken up to heaven in the rapture. \u00a0 However, modernist or liberal Christians seeking to reconcile the warrior, judge Jesus with their image of a non-violent peaceful Savior have to do a selective exegesis.\nThose who make Christianity approve war face the difficulty that Jesus did not fight, died a non-resistant, forgave his crucifiers, and advised love of enemy and martyrdom. \u00a0 He held no political office, rejected worldly power, and offered no explicit political advice beyond paying taxes and the ambiguous \u201cGive unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar and unto God what belongs to God\u201d \u2013 though not saying what belongs to each.\nSo far as we can tell, the disciples and early church members did not join the army, either because they were exempt as a sect of Judaism, or as believers in the imminent end of the world, or because they took seriously love of enemy teaching.\nPaul and the John of Revelation disagreed about the status of Rome, whether it represented just government ordained by God or the antichrist. \u00a0 By the second century Christians began praying for the success of Roman arms and, even before they were tolerated, some joined an army where service for the divine emperor occurred daily. Before the conversion of Constantine, the Church fused Roman war with Jewish holy war. \u00a0 Constantine became a new King David, fighting under the sign of the cross and allegedly carrying a fragment of the true cross into battle. \u00a0 Justinian could be pictured as a thirteenth apostle. \u00a0 Selective proof texts also legitimated war: \u00a0 John the Baptist told soldiers to be content with their wages; Jesus healed the centurion\u2019s daughter without rebuking him; he said, \u201cI come not to bring peace but a sword\u201d and when asked about two swords, replied \u201cit is enough.\u201d \u00a0 Even the love of neighbor supported war, because \u2013 according to St. Augustine \u2013 a man should not pick up the sword for oneself but could to protect a neighbor. \u00a0 Until he obtained true peace in heaven, a Christian soldier had an obligation to support the fragmentary peace of a well-ordered society. \u00a0 War was analogous to a magistrate\u2019s enforcing civil order by using law to punish a fault. \u00a0 Expanded and revised, Augustine\u2019s synthesis would become Christian just war theory officially espoused by the Roman Catholic and most Protestant churches until the present.\nC. Islam\nUnlike Christianity, which did not face the issues posed by political power for three hundred years, Islam\u2019s paradigmatic figure, the Prophet Muhammad, ruled in Medina and later in Mecca, participated in battles, and left teachings in the Q\u2019uran about legitimate war and right conduct in war. \u00a0 Yet at his death, the realm of Islam did not extend beyond the Arabian Peninsula. \u00a0Only after the spread of Islam from Spain to India, the rise and fall of the Umayyad dynasty, and the coming to power of the Abbasids would a normative theory of war and peace emerge.\nIn Islam, all humanity desires peace. True peace will come only after submission to God and this is accomplished through personal struggle or jihad. \u00a0 Muhammad taught that an individual\u2019s internal striving for submission is the greater jihad. \u00a0\u00a0 The lesser jihad is the military struggle to make the world submit to the rule of God, which is the natural law as described in the Q\u2019uran. \u00a0\u00a0 The spread of the faith can be done peacefully or by the sword. \u00a0 The use of military force is not to convert a person (this submission must be voluntary) but to create a government of Muslims that will rule in accordance with\nsharia, or God\u2019s law. \u00a0 People of the book, Jews and Christians, can be tolerated and given some self rule if they pay special taxes.\nThe only legitimate jihad war is a religious war to expand the rule of God. \u00a0 Only the caliph can declare an offensive jihad after an invitation to submit to the opponent has been issued and should be fought only by Muslims free of debt. \u00a0\u00a0 A defensive jihad is when Islam is under attack and is a duty incumbent on all Muslims. \u00a0 Those within the realm of faith (the dar es islam) are in perpetual conflict with those outside (the dar el harb), though the Prophet allowed truces of up to ten years. \u00a0 In theory at least Islam did not recognize the existence of several states; in practice there soon came to be multiple kingdoms taking their legitimacy by being recognized by the caliph and Muslim states often engaged in wars (quital) that were not religious in nature. \u00a0 In fact, jihad was rarely invoked in civil wars and even in wars against the Christian Byzantines and the crusaders. \u00a0\u00a0 While Muhammad had cautioned against war over minor differences within Islam, even during the reign of the first four good or paradigmatic caliphs, reformers appeared who attempted by armed revolution or assassination to purify the realm of allegedly corrupt rulers. \u00a0\u00a0 As will become apparent shortly, the teachings of Muhammad were interpreted to create a kind of holy war as well as justice in the conduct of war similar to medieval Christian just war theory.\nD. Hinduism\nHinduism is a term invented by outsiders to describe the indigenous religions on India and was used in the nineteenth century by nationalists to distinguish all these from the foreign imports, Islam and Christianity. \u00a0 In Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, there is no one founder or normative canon or myths but layers of traditions contained in Vedas, Puranas, and epics. \u00a0 In the earliest Vedas Indra is a war god who subdued the monster and fights for or even becomes the king in battle. \u00a0 Over centuries the king or warrior caste became subordinate to the Brahmin or priest caste who led pure lives and conducted the rituals necessary to please the gods and guarantee victory in battle. \u00a0 The warriors or kings granted money to the Brahmins and they occupied a privileged position, as a caste above merchants, tradesmen, and farmers.\nThe founding epic of Hinduism is the Mahabharata, a poem that purports to be the story of the struggle for their rightful throne by the Pandavas against their usurping cousins, the Kurovasa. \u00a0 In spite of many vicissitudes, the Pandavas \u2013 because they have the gods on their side \u2013 will prevail. \u00a0 The most influential part of the Mahabharata is a long section termed the Bhagavadgita occurring just before the climatic battle scene. \u00a0 Arjuna, a mighty Pandava warrior who has never before in the epic shown any ethical sensitivity, now hesitates to fight because he will be shedding the blood of his relatives. \u00a0 Arjuna\u2019s charioteer, an avatar of the god Krishna, assures him that it is his duty as a warrior to fight. \u00a0 The carnage of battle is irrelevant because death is not ultimate but is part of the karmic cycle of rebirth. \u00a0 Although Arjuna will gain material rewards, he must fight with a right attitude of detachment in which life and death are ultimately meaningless. \u00a0 The high point of the Bhagavadgita is Krishna\u2019s appearing in his full cosmic glory, with Arjuna becoming a devotee.\nEventually the Pandavas are restored to the throne through means allowed by Krishna that violate the just practices of war and contribute to their own downfall. \u00a0 The end of the epic is a sort of Gotterdammerung in which the gods pass away to be replaced by kings whose caste duty legitimated fighting in a world where an ethical means of war is no longer possible.\nE. Buddhism\nBuddhism seems the least likely of a major religion to legitimate war. \u00a0 The Buddha taught non-killing and detachment, accepted no political office, and dismissed war as of no importance. \u00a0 Yet Siddhartha came from a warrior caste, accepted kings as his followers, and allowed them to build and endow monasteries as a way of earning merit.\nThe ideal kingdom was a dharma realm, a place where the king should practiced non-violence, harm nobody, and try to preserve peace and avoid war. \u00a0 An ideal king in this imperfect world should exemplify the dharma and by his charisma can bring order out of chaos and do violence to obtain justice. \u00a0 A normative pattern of kingship, exemplified by Asoka in India and Duttagamini in Ceylon was for a claimant to the throne to wage war against evil men and, after victory, to donate to the monks as expiation while promoting the dharma realm. \u00a0 Duttagamini showed sorrow for killing Tamils, but was assured by the monks that, because his opponents were not Buddhists, their deaths were equivalent to those of beasts and equaled only one and one-half a Buddhist. \u00a0\u00a0 In other words, using violence as a means to create peace. \u00a0 This teaching allowed kings to wage war even against other Buddhist kings.\nA second way of linking Buddhism to war came in late medieval Japan when Zen became the ideology of samurai warriors. \u00a0 Zen was a non-ritual and anti-intellectual form of Buddhism for samurai who found in its asceticism, discipline, and emphasis upon mindlessness the means to become totally focused in battle. \u00a0 Killing an opponent was not evil because his death was only a fulfilling of karmic destiny caused by misdeeds in an earlier life. \u00a0 Zen proved adaptable to warrior life when they fought and, after 1600, when the samurai became bureaucrats who also wrote poetry and arranged flowers.\nThis brief survey illustrates that built into the formative documents and practices of the five major religions of world is an acceptance of war. \u00a0 There may be countervailing emphases as well, but frequently in history religious and political authorities have called upon traditions that legitimate war. \u00a0 No matter how often we may emphasize the teachings about the value of peace in early traditions and canonical documents, the potential for making war a religious duty will always be there. \u00a0 Holy war is a basic ingredient for Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and both the devout and those who want to exploit the traditions for political ends will find in the canon fodder for another kind of cannon.\nIII. Roles of Religion in Restraint in War\nJustified War Theories\nIt is not clear whether this section on limiting the cause and conduct of war should be included in this paper on religions facilitating war or in the next paper on religion and peace. \u00a0 This is because we cannot prove whether establishing restraints on war prevents it or instead by making it more religiously and morally acceptable facilitates war by giving it legitimacy and prevents the human costs from being calculated. \u00a0 If the various religions\u2019 just war theories really have stopped wars from occurring, the historical record should provide clear examples where a ruler or country was restrained from fighting for moral as against prudential or utilitarian reasons. \u00a0 I know of no such example, though John Adams\u2019 refusal to declare war on France in 1798 is the closest American example. \u00a0 There is, by contrast, considerable evidence that just war theories have on many occasions established restraint by professional soldiers in regular armies in the conduct war.\nThe critics of Christian just war theory, from Erasmus to our time, have complained about the ambiguity of the tenets and the ease of misrepresentations by government and its apologists. \u00a0 The various responses of social ethicists to Vietnam and the two Gulf Wars show how difficult it is to reach consensus on the meaning of justice in the cause of war or of proportionality, that the evil done in war will not be greater than harm done by the original fault. \u00a0 John Howard Yoder concluded that modern theories require a well-informed citizenry to judge, and because governments lie, the theories have become useless. \u00a0 Quaker James Childress says since just war theories do provide a language used by politicians and the military, it does provide a language for which pacifists and other opponents of a war can communicate to the generals and politicians, in Quaker jargon, speak Truth to Power. \u00a0 Even if not efficacious in preventing or stopping war, the categories provide a way before, during, and after to evaluate a conflict and becomes, what Michael Walzer terms a moral equivalent for military strategy.\nAll major religions that legitimate war establish standards for right cause and right conduct. \u00a0 Unchecked violence for its own sake is universally condemned. \u00a0 So it is a mistake to view justified war theories as a solely Christian, Western, or European contribution to world civilization. \u00a0 In additional to Geneva Conventions and the U.N., there is just war theory in the formative documents of Hinduism and Islam. \u00a0 All these theories arise from the same basic insight famously described by Plato and Aristotle: war is not for the sake of war; it is fought for the sake of peace. \u00a0 Peace means a well-ordered society, and it is legitimate to defend that well-ordered society. Self-defense is a natural right for individuals and can be extended to the state. \u00a0\u00a0 Religion according to Christian theory was not a sufficient cause for war, even though often used in crusades against Islam, heretics, and in post-Reformation struggles between Catholics and Protestants that restriction was ignored. \u00a0 After the crusades ended and certainly by 1648, religious differences alone were no longer acceptable as a just cause and reinterpretations of jihad appeared in some but not all Muslim theorists by the nineteenth century.\nA second element that has been dropped in just war theories was the requirement for purity of motive by rulers and soldiers. \u00a0 A desire for power or wealth or adventure was, according to St. Thomas Aquinas, enough to make a war caused by a sufficient major fault unjust. \u00a0 Note that the same purity of motive was required or Arjuna in his dialogue with Krishna. \u00a0\u00a0 And while in medieval Islam and Christianity, there were elaborate rules for division of booty, both religions condemned making war for the sake for getting riches.\nThe primary contribution of just war theory was the belief, even if often violated, of the immunity of civilians. \u00a0 Soldiers were and are to be the target of other soldiers, not those who do not carry weapons. \u00a0 This portion of the ethics of war was not dictated by military needs of soldiers, but by religious and moral insight. \u00a0 We have anecdotal evidence that protecting peasants was observed in ancient Indian warfare. \u00a0 The first direct statement that one should not war against women, children, and old men comes from Muhammad in the Q\u2019uran. \u00a0 While there are other ambiguous statements in early Muslim documents, Averroes (Ibn Rushd) in the 12th century insisted that all Muslims agreed that war was not against civilians. \u00a0 Since in the 7 th century, neither Byzantium nor Western Europe had extended immunity beyond priests, it is very possible though not yet provable that a belief in civilian immunity spread from Muslim Spain to Christian Europe. \u00a0 However, one should not rule out independent origins. \u00a0\u00a0 By the 11 th century, Peace of God documents list categories of people - priests, merchants, serfs - who are not to be preyed upon. \u00a0 Widely known, but also often ignored in the religious wars after the Reformation, civilian immunity has become a universal norm even though the 20 th century practice did more than any other to undermine it in practice.\nThe code of the aristocratic warrior - samurai, knight, ksatriya, or jihadist - is the origin of most of other restraints in the practice of war found in Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist writings. \u00a0 Knights are to attack their equals and to fight fairly. \u00a0 After defeat, a captured knight is to be ransomed. \u00a0 At first common soldiers could be killed or enslaved, but over time this practice was changed into the immunity of Prisoners of War not to be tortured or killed and the wounded to be helped. \u00a0\u00a0 The founder of the Red Cross envisaged a transnational organization to help all the wounded, but governments created their own Red Cross divisions to reassure the parents of the new mass armies that their sons would receive medical care while they appeased their military by not requiring them to surrender control of soldiers or the battlefield. \u00a0 Until the 20 th century, the restraints in war enforced by an aristocratic officer class held for wars among Europeans, but were often not observed in wars against so-called barbarians \u2013 Native Americans, Africans, Chinese. \u00a0 The code allowed society to treat returned officers as belonging to an honorable calling who protected society while observing with professional standards. \u00a0 The code had little effect on preventing war, except in so far as it allowed the establishment of civilized contact between the parties before and after negotiating the end to fighting and re-establishing what they called peace.\nIV. Religions and Society\nThus far our discussion should show that we cannot expect religions to jettison either their founding documents on war or their long history of attempting to limit the cause and conduct of war. \u00a0 A third factor, equally significant, would be the symbiotic relationship of organized religions to the societies in which they flourish. \u00a0\u00a0 Marx saw religion as a tool of the ruling class, a way to persuade peoples to accept their impoverished lot by promising pie in the sky, bye and bye. Religion would disappear when the social conditions that brought it were ameliorated. \u00a0 Until then, religion would bless the wars initiated by the ruling class for economic advantages. \u00a0\u00a0 Emile Durkheim insisted that in religion we create idealized images of ourselves and then ascribe ultimate value to our society. \u00a0 So, in essence, the nation worships itself. \u00a0 Again, religion could not stand against a society at war. World War I showed the accuracy of his description of the role of European churches in a war for which historians still search for adequate causes. \u00a0 More recently, Ren\u00e9 Girard saw early religions as a kind of Freudian displacement mechanism whereby we ritually sacrifice a kind of scapegoat in order to keep ourselves from killing each other. \u00a0 A variant of this theory using the Cain and Abel story as a model sees monotheism as creating a scarcity economics in which only one side can obtain the blessing of God. \u00a0 This leads to the arrogance of a chosen people and a devaluing of the Other, who then can be warred upon.\nI find all these theories unsatisfactory, but for our purposes they do point to one essential truth \u2013 that priests and politicians recognize that religion cannot be divorced from its society without destructive consequences the state as well as for church or mosque or temple. \u00a0\u00a0 And if this is true for society in peacetime, it becomes ever more important when the society is under the stress of war. \u00a0 So rather than in engage in analysis of these theory, I should like to offer a much more simple and, I hope, more common sense understandings of why it is so easy for religions to facilitate war at first looking at what the state gains and then what the religions gain.\nRulers benefit from having a supportive religion. \u00a0 Kings or presidents praise religions because they provide a divine sanction to their governance, legitimate the social order, and can be used to establish boundaries keeping apart or establishing links among peoples. \u00a0 The social ethics of all religions \u2013 proscribing murder and stealing and advocating helping the poor and caring for one\u2019s neighbor are useful to a state in keeping order. \u00a0 Statute laws should be obeyed because they derive authority not only from the caliph or parliament but from God\u2019s revealed or natural law. \u00a0 So, of course, politicians claim the sanction of religion and bestow favors on its institutions and leaders. \u00a0 The state may pay the salaries of priests or mullahs, and the history of state supported religions shows that they rarely criticize a king or diet in peacetime or war. \u00a0 Subsidies for religious institutions, either in indirect form through exemption from taxation as in the U.S. or direct subsidy for institutions also facilitate silence or concentration upon spiritual matters.\nEven an organization as powerful as the Roman Catholic Church learned during the French Revolution how vulnerable it was to pressure from what was the first modern anti-clerical state. \u00a0 After the French Revolution until now there has a constant European anti-clericalism that restricted the power of the papacy to influence decisions on war, even inside of Italy after 1870. \u00a0 The history of relations between the state and organized religion in dictatorships and totalitarian rulers shows that, although there can be passive resistance by the devout who can carve out safe space, the state is rarely constrained in initiating or pursuing war. \u00a0 For example, neither Hitler, Mussolini, nor Saddam Hussein hesitated to start wars in spite of the opposition of religious leaders to their rule. \u00a0 Stalin sought to destroy Russian Orthodoxy until it proved useful to mobilize the people in WWII. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the U.S. opposition from the National Council of Churches and the Papacy to Gulf Wars I and II did not stop the presidents from initiating a war or prevent an enormous outburst of support during and immediately after the initial successes. \u00a0\u00a0 So political leaders try to co-op religions when they are useful and to ignore them when they are not.\nThe main impediment to organized religions\u2019 opposing a war may be their own vision of the transcendent. \u00a0 Religions, having survived many economic and political systems over their long history, do not see themselves as in the messy business of daily politics, and social justice, although important, is not of overriding significance. \u00a0\u00a0 Putting people in touch with ultimate reality \u2013 God, Allah, Atman, Buddhahood \u2013 is their raison d\u2019etre. \u00a0 Ministering to suffering, providing ethical counsel, organizing ritual to give meaning to life \u2013 these are what religions are about. \u00a0 To provide these services, religious institutions and their leaders must reach people where they are. \u00a0 If the price of communicating spiritual Truth is silent acquiescence in a war, so be it. \u00a0 Otherwise, the soldiers in the field and their families and the general populace would be estranged.\nEqually important, the personal of all organized religions are drawn from the society they serve and will share most of its values, both the good and bad ones. \u00a0 The similarity of experience helps the priests to communicate with and serve the community. \u00a0 If the people approve of a war, so will religious institutions that are directly dependent upon them. \u00a0 This dependence is both intellectual and financial. \u00a0 Formerly, in most of the world, the state supported the clergy; in America, the clergy need the laity. \u00a0 Any minister knows that being too far in front of his/her congregation may mean the loss of his job or create weakness in his religious congregation. \u00a0 A few leaders, often far away from local congregations, do make bold pronouncements, but these are easily ignored under the sentiment that what do religious leaders know about international politics. \u00a0 There realpolitik rules and the ministers should confine themselves to individual or local moral issues. \u00a0\u00a0 The only religious institutions that are really free to oppose war during wartime are sectarian organizations far removed from power.\nFinally, many religious organizations are organized within a state. \u00a0 Even when there is a transnational body, like the Roman Catholic Church, most members of the hierarchy were born and live in the nation their churches are in. \u00a0 Even a kind of weak transnational organization is minimal for most Protestants and Orthodox Christians, Jews, Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. \u00a0 History shows how easy it has been for fellow believers to war; it is even easier when the parties are of different religions.\nIn conclusion, when we consider the roles of war in scriptures, the prevalence of just war theories, the usefulness of religion to government, and the internal constraints on religious institutions \u00a0 - there seems little prospect that churches or mosques can resist the siren calls from the Osamas and W\u2019s that God is blessing their calls to war. \u00a0 Bertram Russell was right when he complained that churches are like a thermometer, reflecting rather than shaping, their societies views of war.\nTo conclude, here is my list of factors predicting when religions will facilitate wars:\nSacred texts portray violence in an approving manner whether done by a god or by paradigmatic men and women who make war and whose successes the god guarantees. \u00a0 Imitation of such warriors is approved\u00a0 behavior.\nRituals and prayers are designed to enlist the help of the god in war and the blood sacrifices in rituals prefigure the martyrdoms of those fighting for a holy cause.\nThe risk of losing life in war for a holy cause is compensated for by the promise of salvation in the next life. \u00a0 Martyrdom becomes the highest mark of religious devotion.\nA group defines itself as a holy or chosen people with special obligations \u00a0\u00a0 and privileges, particularly involving a right to a land. \u00a0 Such chosen people are more likely to war if\nsocio-political divisions are justified and enforced on religious \u00a0 lines.\nthe religious group feels persecuted in the present or past and nable to obtain justice.\nthe religious group is cohesive enough to unify politically and sees the possibility of gaining power to achieve autonomy or dominion.\nthe land itself is sacralized and contains sites of special holiness.\nThe devotion of the faithful is joined so intensely to nationalism that these \u00a0 seem to be one phenomenon, and fighting for land and family becomes a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 religious duty.\nPolitical and/or spiritual leaders come from the upper class, share common\u00a0 interests, and see in the religious teachings and institutions a means of gaining or maintaining power.\nPriests and people are willing to use the political realm to institutionalize and/or enforce correct worship, doctrine, and ethical practices. \u00a0 Such a perspective can justify rebellion against corrupt leaders or suppression of schismatics or heretics.\nAlternative value systems and institutions are weak or lacking.\nThe state fails to provide an opportunity in which minority and/or majority faith communities can obtain political and religious rights and in which there is minimal interaction among religious leaders.\nPeople of different faiths live in close proximity but the teachings and practices of their religions seem incompatible.\nA group sees its truth as universal and is intolerant of other perspectives either within or outside of its religious tradition.\nA faith's influence is restricted to a \"spiritual\" realm and its teachings considered irrelevant to a political sphere in which realpolitik is the prime consideration.\nHow Religions Facilitate Peace\nSt. Augustine, writing at the time of the decline of the Roman Empire, insisted that built into humanity was a desire for peace. \u00a0 Aristotle, unlike Plato who saw war as an essential ingredient in creating civilization, believed peace was the normal state and war the abnormality, i.e., a society or rock at rest tends to stay in that position. \u00a0 Virtually all religions insist that pax, shalom, salaam, nirvana are the desideratum of life and promise to bestow it on their followers who practice right belief, rituals, and ethics. \u00a0 Modern peace theorists, including Quaker Elise Boulding, remind us that peace is the condition of most of humanity most of the time. \u00a0 Even belligerent powers, and there is a strong correlation with being a great power and the frequency of war, remain at peace most of the time. \u00a0 That is, if peace is defined solely as the absence of war. \u00a0 So it may be that not peace, but war needs to be seen as the abnormality and explained.\nWhat we mean by peace is often unclear. \u00a0\u00a0 A tee shirt I bought at South of the Border has the motto: \u201cKnow God, peace; no God, no peace.\u201d \u00a0 Is peace a method, a means, a process, an end? \u00a0 What is the difference between peace and non-peace, and is war the best or a misleading description of non-peace. \u00a0 (The analogy is similar to the distinction between violence and non-violence.) \u00a0 If there are a variety of wars, should we not also talk about a variety of peaces? \u00a0 For Quakers and the Historic Peace Churches, which make a very small percentage of the population, a major issue in their work to prevent war should be determining whether there is a direct relationship among individual, small group, community, national, and international peace? \u00a0 Briefly put, does domestic politics in some complicated fashion end up determining international relations or do the systemic features of our interstate politics govern the incidence of war and peace?\nTwo leading theorists of the discipline of non-violent conflict resolution, John Burton and Roger Fisher, insist that all conflict stems from identical causes (though they do not agree on those causes) and the same techniques designed to ameliorate small groups\u2019 differences by fulfilling basic needs or by blending interests can at the national and international level manage conflict and/or end the need for war. \u00a0 Perhaps because both of these men, like Gene Sharp, the theorist of civilian based defense, were writing to persuade secular academics and military strategists of the value of their perspectives, they divorced themselves from religious and moral precepts and ran away from rather than seeking, any direct contact with modern pacifists. \u00a0 Instead, they advocated a secular method for bringing secular results \u2013 creating a win/win situation as a way of managing rather than solving conflicts.\nThe results of attempting to teach the theories to professional practitioners who will apply non-violence in a wide variety of contexts have been more successful dealing with individuals and small groups rather than in easing intractable international conflicts, such as the war in Bosnia or disputes between Israelis and the Palestinians. \u00a0 No use of non-violence, or diplomacy, or peacekeeping forces seems likely to bring an end to conflicts in the Congo, Somali, the Sudan. \u00a0 The many churches teaching non-violent conflict resolution and the Alternatives to Violence Project of the AFSC have had many small-scale successes. \u00a0 Rather than utilizing careful training or social science, the great successes of non-violence have come from peoples applying Gandhi\u2019s insight that withdrawing consent makes governments fall \u2013 as witnessed in the Velvet and recent Orange revolutions in Eastern Europe. \u00a0 This paper will finesse the issue of evaluating non-violent conflict resolution as either a religious movement or secular technique because many scholars and practitioners are assessing whether its failures are due to the type of people who become national leaders, or the theories, or the techniques.\nI. \u00a0 The Meanings of Peace\nFor our purposes of focusing primarily upon religion and the international realm, a logical starting place is to decide what we mean by first political and then religious peace and then to see where they are congruent and the roles that organized religions can play. \u00a0 One form of political peace is that of an empire, of which the \u201cpax romana\u201d remains the primary example. \u00a0 Imperial peace can come by controlling a contiguous land mass or by using cultural influence to keep the peace, as the papacy attempted in the medieval Europe. \u00a0 Currently the U.S., which sees itself as a hegemonic power, is trying to create a balance of power peace in East Asia by military power and cultural influence. \u00a0 None of the great empires had lasting success, and what they did to subject peoples could as easily be labeled as oppression rather than peace. \u00a0 Certainly the U.S. in the post cold war has shown a limited ability to impose peace either by cultural or military might. \u00a0 The U.S. should have learned in Iraq that building peace by transformation of a state through a combination of military might and ideologies of democracy and capitalism when there are profound religious/ethnic differences is not possible in our times. \u00a0 Early Islam, the Ottomans, and maybe Russia before 1914 were the last empires created successfully using religion as a unifying factor. \u00a0 Today religious diversity is so pronounced that creating an empire utilizing an existing or new religion will fail.\nA second form of peace is obtained by defense. \u00a0 Its classic formulation was given by the 4 th century Roman theorist Vegetius: to have peace, prepare for war. \u00a0 The U.S. seems to be officially committed to Vegetius\u2019 perspective since it now spends more on its defense than the rest of the world combined. \u00a0 The modern form of military might is justified by the assumption that the international realm is anarchy with states constantly engaged in competition, of which one form is war. \u00a0 Plato refuted the Sophist version of this argument as applied to domestic society but realist theorists as diverse as Henry Kissinger and Robert Kaplan continue to apply it to contemporary issues.\nOften building upon realism is a belief in a balance of power. \u00a0 As old as Renaissance Italy, balance of power received its classic form with the emergence of the modern state system in the seventeenth century. \u00a0 One difficulty in ascertaining whether a balance of power can bring peace is that it is difficult to determine whether war is prevented by a gross disparity of power or an equilibrium among states \u2013 all of whom are trying to increase their power relative to each other in a zero sum game. \u00a0 If it is the equilibrium that brings peace, the danger is, as Kant observed, that this house of cards can be destroyed by a slight wind. \u00a0 Even more dangerous in today\u2019s world is that no one can accurately calculate a nation\u2019s power and so the shorthand method is to use armed forces. \u00a0 The break up of the USSR which still had its military intact shows the limitations in calculating power based upon armies. \u00a0 If the theories of international anarchy and that relations among states are always either latent or hot war are true, then there is very little that organized religions can do to bring world peace. \u00a0 The best that we can hope is to create a widespread moral opprobrium against the use of nuclear weapons. \u00a0 (Larry Wittner\u2019s three-volume history of the international anti-nuclear bomb movement concluded that this is what happened in the Cold War, but he also found that religious organizations played a very limited role in this crusade.) \u00a0 We have returned to the situation that existed in Europe before 1700. \u00a0 Then war was considered inevitable, a product of sin bringing God\u2019s wrath that humanity could do little to avoid and must endure. \u00a0 The modern form of this theory assumes that war is inevitable, because of the nature of the state and the international system. \u00a0 The best that can be hoped for is a cold peace based upon mutual deterrence or overwhelming force.\nA third form of peace is a stable peace, when war becomes so remote as to become unthinkable. \u00a0 Examples would be the U.S.\u2019s relations with Mexico and Canada, and, most importantly, Western Europe since the 1950s. \u00a0 The example of the European Union shows that a stable peace can be created in what historically is a very limited time frame. \u00a0 It has been done by modifications of rather than abandoning a state system and it works because, in spite of a long history of war and different languages, similar economic and political systems have emerged. \u00a0 The irony for students of religion in thinking about this positive development is that the old warring Europe was a far more Christian place than the new peaceful Europe where secularism, as defined as the declining influence of religion in all areas of life, is rampant. \u00a0 Still, religious organizations have and can continue to play a supporting role in the integration of Europe. \u00a0 However, if one defines the religious fault lines as between Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim Europe, as Samuel Huntington does, then the acid test for the Common Market model of stable peace will be whether the very different countries of the Balkans, Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey can become integrated in this system.\nA final definition of peace links transnational peace with justice within a society. \u00a0 Here when one works for peace, he or she is also working for a more just economic and social order within and external to a society. \u00a0 This is a secular theory, but it is easy to baptize it because in the Hebrew and Christian scriptures God demands justice for the poor. \u00a0 Liberation theologians found biblical authority in the deliverance of the Jews from Egypt, the demand of prophets for social justice, and Jesus\u2019 identification with the poor. The liberal church lobbies working in Washington have been described as not knowing that peace and justice are two words. \u00a0 They assume that the process of creating a more just society can be done without violence, even when privileged groups lose influence.\nThe peace and justice groups often link a peaceful society with a democratic society as more likely to allow a change that does not directly benefit the ruling class. (That is a big assumption!) \u00a0 I suspect that also built in is the belief of some political scientists and virtually all Americans that democracies tend to be peaceful. \u00a0 Our President also believes democracies retard terrorism; one wonders if he remembers the Red Guards of Germany and Timothy McVeigh. \u00a0 At least, many political scientists argue that democracies rarely fight each other, but, of course, this may be because they find so many non-democracies to fight. \u00a0 The classic theories of just war assume that the society to be defended is a moral good, though the preference for legitimate authority and distrust of rebellion overrode almost all other criteria. \u00a0 A democratic society is now seen as offering the greatest potentiality for becoming a moral society, although \u2013 as Niebuhr said \u2013 this is because everything else looks worse.\nThe most extreme, and therefore very popular with my students, variant of the peace/justice theory is by Johann Galtung, who defines a peaceful society as one in which everyone can achieve to the limits of his or her capacity. \u00a0 A disease not caused by poverty or lack of intelligence would not in Galtung\u2019s scheme be considered as war, but a disease caused by lack of money for a vaccine would disrupt peace. \u00a0 Obviously such a utopian society has never existed, perhaps never can, and is even difficult to conceptualize. \u00a0 Would, for example, the child who never achieved what his parents thought was his potential, be a cause for concern. \u00a0 The theory is also very human centered, with environmental concerns placed second to individual capacities, i.e., central only when they directly affect people. \u00a0 Galtung might say that asking if such an ideal society can be created is the wrong question. \u00a0 Rather, the concept allows us to see what we should be focusing on.\nThe advantage of any version of the peace and justice linkage is that one can begin working at any level and can obtain successes even if the micro does not easily transform into the macro level. \u00a0 I used to ask my students, who were required to write term papers on various NGOs, whether it was necessary to have a comprehensive theory of peace to do effective peace work. \u00a0 The answer, of course, depended upon the definition of peace and the work undertaken, but most students decided that peace work was not primarily an academic exercise. \u00a0 That is, the successes of the AFSC or Amnesty International or the International Red Cross depended on a careful definition of what they sought to accomplish. \u00a0\u00a0 The world today is a better place for the activities of the NGOs, but recent history does not prove that it is becoming a more peaceful place, if the quantity of wars and numbers of deaths are the criteria.\nIf the advantage of peace/justice theories is that they allow a wide variety of programs, that is also their disadvantage because there is no clear way to decide what is most crucial for success. \u00a0This dilemma is not new: to cite a Quaker example, the difference between Lucretia Mott and John Whittier on reform activities in the 1830s. \u00a0 Both agitated against slavery, but Mott also worked for other crusades: women\u2019s rights, temperance, prison reform and, like Garrison, disdained politics. \u00a0\u00a0 Whittier believed in all of these causes, but crusaded only against slavery and, because he saw the potential from political activities, in 1840 supported the Liberty Party. \u00a0 Who was more effective is difficult to prove. \u00a0 Another analogy, using more classic terms: \u00a0 the myth of Sisyphus. \u00a0 Sisyphus, you remember from the Camus book, is condemned to carrying a boulder to the top of the hill and then watch as it rolls down the hill. \u00a0 We all know that peace work is like carrying a boulder, but if the peace/justice or the Galtung formula is adopted \u2013 we don\u2019t have a good way of knowing which rock is the one to carry \u2013 or to mix a stone metaphor \u2013 what is the keystone. \u00a0 My solution, not original and one I suspect most of you already practice, is to work in a few causes, accept small victories, and hope without much expectation that the academic professionals in many fields will in the future provide more helpful theories that will influence the political class.\nII. Peace in the Teachings of Major Religions\nPeace (shalom) is a frequently used term in the Hebrew Scriptures with a wide variety of meanings. \u00a0\u00a0 It can be what we would call religious \u2013 obedience to or a right relationship to God or a blessing from God. \u00a0 Peace can be a greeting or a benediction. \u00a0 Peace can also be what we, but not the ancient Hebrews, see as more secular: security, prosperity, health, justice. \u00a0 In the Bible these qualities can be applied to an individual, household, a kingdom, or the whole world. \u00a0 Peace can be a description of relations between kingdoms, a ceasing of hostilities or a treaty, and even, on one occasion, a war undertaken in obedience to God. \u00a0 In Amos, war results from God\u2019s punishment because of the failure of justice within the kingdom. In first Isaiah peace comes after defeat of the Assyrians by God\u2019s miracle and there will be a future realm of peace under a restored Davidic king dwelling in God\u2019s holy mount Zion. \u00a0 In Jeremiah peace requires a whole new creation and in 2nd Isaiah God controls the processes of all kingdoms. \u00a0 For Ecclesiastes, even peace may be a vanity. \u00a0 In the Psalms, peace, identified with rest, can refer to death. \u00a0\u00a0 Peace can be a past, present, or future condition. \u00a0 Most often, peace is not created by humans, but is a gift bestowed by God when individuals respond in obedience to Jehovah\u2019s revealed law. Seeking the will of God, finding it, and responding appropriately is the key to the Peace of God.\nVirtually all of these meanings are carried over into the New Testament. \u00a0 Peace is proclaimed by the angels at the nativity, advocated in the Beatitudes, and is the desired condition among the followers of Jesus before the resurrection and in the early church. \u00a0 The biggest change is that the Old Testament prophecies about the coming age of peace are applied to Jesus. \u00a0 Jesus in his teaching, suffering, and resurrection is the bringer of peace. \u00a0 The peace is not political, however. \u00a0 Jesus explicitly rejects worldly power in the temptation scene on the mountain at the beginning of the ministry and the gospels make clear that his kingdom and rule are not at least at present in this world, even though Paul and the early church preached that Jesus\u2019 return and the worldly reign of God would happen soon. \u00a0 The Gospels present Jesus as mourning over the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem in a coming war, not preventing their destruction. \u00a0 In the book of Revelation, the New Jerusalem comes after the time of troubles, including war, and takes place at the throne of God after the judging of the quick and the dead. \u00a0 None of the teachings about peace in the New Testament are about politics or war. \u00a0 This is one of differences between the two Testaments. \u00a0 They agree in seeing peace as having many dimensions and as a gift from God. \u00a0 The Kingdom of God is at hand, realized in the disciples of Jesus before the crucifixion and then in the church, even though \u2013 as the letters of Paul show \u2013 the early church was far from unified or peaceful.\nThe concept of salaam or peace in Islam is more like the Old than the New Testament; that is, there is a explicit political as well as a religious dimension. \u00a0 In fact, they are almost one. \u00a0 Islam means submission to God and doing so brings the believer peace. \u00a0 When the whole world submits to the rule of God as contained in the Quran, then the whole world is at peace. \u00a0 Since the sharia embodies the teachings of the Quran, then the ruler has an obligation to enforce its norms. \u00a0 Of course, the sharia is not just law; it encompasses advice for behavior that goes beyond law to attitudes. \u00a0 In the Sunni tradition, there is a strong presumption of loyalty to the caliph and then sultans, but authority for interpreting the religious traditions after Muhammad\u2019s death belonged not to the political leader but to the community of scholars. \u00a0 Now no political leader can have his authority blessed by the caliph or sultan, but the ulema is still a major source for legitimacy. \u00a0 The most radical Wahhabis and Sunnis insist that the only true political peace can come in the restoration of the transnational boundaries of early Islam as exemplified by the rule of Muhammad in Medina and Mecca. \u00a0 For the twelver Shiites who dominate Iran and Iraq, true peace cannot come until the return of the Mahdi who will restore the pure realm of the first caliphs and the legitimate succession of the Prophet. \u00a0 Shiite teaching, resembling Christian eschatology, sees a decisive break with normal history with a superhuman figure necessary to create a lasting peace.\nDeciphering the Hindu teachings on peace is complicated by the enormous variety of traditions and the fact that there is no one canonical text or agreed upon set of beliefs. \u00a0 I once registered for a philosophers\u2019 conference on karma sponsored by the East-West Center of the University of Hawaii. \u00a0 When asked which sessions I wished to attend, my response was any on social ethnics. \u00a0 I was informed that karma had no social ethics. \u00a0 While this is a caricature, we should recognize that there is a strong emphasis in Hinduism and Buddhism in a devotees escaping from or making irrelevant this world of attachment and impermanence. \u00a0 After all, suffering is caused by attachment and among Hindus mortifications is one way to purity.\nOn the other hand, ahimsa or non-violence to living things is a prominent element among the Jains, Buddhists, and Hindus. \u00a0 While scholars can debate whether there is a social ethics of peace in ancient Hinduism, certainly Gandhi created one and his satyagraha campaigns are now a prominent feature in modern Hinduism within India as well as the diaspora. \u00a0 Gandhi took features from classic Indian, Buddhist, Jain, and even Christian writings to create his satyagraha campaigns. \u00a0 He reinterpreted the Bhagavadgita so that Arjuna became the model for a satyagraha warrior \u2013 a detached soldier who could be male or female prepared to struggle or even die while using non-violence and compassion in a search for truth or God \u2013 the terms became the same. \u00a0 The struggle for India\u2019s independence and self-sufficiency began with a careful political analysis before each campaign but became a religious quest in which the welfare of both sides became paramount and a tainted or violent means could not result in a pure end. \u00a0 Gandhi\u2019s preeminent value was not peace per se but truth, and he associated being passive with cowardice, insisting that he preferred a soldier to a do-nothing bystander. \u00a0 He was also no humanist and was prepared to allow his followers to sacrifice, to become martyrs in the quest for truth. \u00a0\u00a0 However, it is no accident that Gandhi has become the patron saint of those who believe pacifism is religious truth as well as politically relevant. \u00a0 Gene Sharp and others have shown that India was one of many examples of people creating non-violent revolution by mobilizing a people against oppressive governments. \u00a0 Gandhi shows that it possible for the right kind of person to transform an ambiguous or pro-military religious Hindu legacy into ahimsa.\nIII. The Problem of Evil\nAll the great religions on the world have grappled with a world and people that are hostile or indifferent to their proclamation of truth. \u00a0 Since truth requires adherence to a transcendent or supernatural reality, one response to violence is withdrawal from the world in search of peace. \u00a0 For Jews in the Middle Ages, the debate was how to respond to persecution \u2013 what could be compromised or surrendered and what was essential enough to die for. \u00a0 For Hindus, members of the warrior class could fight, but Brahmins must keep ritually pure. \u00a0 For some Muslims, Sufi mysticism and/or organization into Brotherhoods was a way out of the compromises of politics. \u00a0 For Christians and Buddhists, there was seclusion in a monastery. \u00a0 Christians in politics might have to fight, but priests, monks, and nuns had a higher calling and should not shed blood. \u00a0 Theirs was a way of perfection reserved for the most devout. \u00a0 After the Reformation and years of persecution, the Anabaptists, who in essence made all believers priests, renounced political influence as well as violence and sought to find a sanctuary as subjects to sympathetic nobleman or later in Pennsylvania. \u00a0 Anabaptists agreed that magistrates might need to employ force but true Christians took literally the Sermon on the Mount and withdrew from politics.\nThe Quaker Peace Testimony after 1660 in England but not in colonial America also rested upon no direct involvement in political events. \u00a0 God had established and pulled down Charles I and Cromwell, and Friends did not interfere with the providence of God. \u00a0 In Britain, Penn\u2019s attempt to change this policy and to become involved with electoral and royal politics was discredited by the revolution of 1688. \u00a0 Eighteenth-century British Friends remained loyal to the powers that be, but would not fight. \u00a0 American Friends in our Revolution adopted strict neutrality as a way of preserving peace. \u00a0 By creating a separate community, the group can find religious peace and it finds politics irrelevant to its quest for salvation. \u00a0 The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who see all governments of this world as corrupt and unchristian and refuse to take the pledge of allegiance or salute the flag or vote exemplify a sectarian attempt to live in America without embracing any duties of citizenship. \u00a0 Their willingness to die for their faith rather than compromise in places like Nazi Germany shows that martyrdom remained a cost of discipleship the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were willing to embrace.\nThose unwilling to give up responsibility for the whole society must come to terms with war, which they see as linked to the problem of evil. \u00a0 In the Christian tradition the three most influential critics of a pacifist withdrawing from politics are St. Augustine, Luther, and Reinhold Niebuhr. \u00a0 All three hated war, but saw it as an unavoidable response to the sinful nature of mankind. \u00a0 For Augustine and Luther, the Genesis story of the fall was a literal truth; for Niebuhr it was a myth whose truth was confirmed by Darwin, history, and self-knowledge. \u00a0 Pride, will to power, a desire to play God, identifying our society with God, or our welfare with the common good \u2013 meant that even the highest cultural achievements of humanity were flawed. \u00a0 He claimed that the social gospel\u2019s claim to create a peaceful society was based upon the enlightenment, not biblical categories. \u00a0 Augustine had a kingdom of man searching for the peace only offered in the kingdom of God; Luther espoused a two kingdom theory in which the church was the imperfectly realized kingdom of peace set in a worldly kingdom of power. \u00a0 All three said that an obligation to one\u2019s neighbor translated into political terms allowed fighting to preserve a peaceful society. \u00a0 Augustine at the time of the Vandal siege of Carthage, counseled a Roman commander who desired to enter a monastery to first fulfill his duty as a soldier. \u00a0 Luther insisted that soldiering as an honorable calling, comparable to being a priest or a merchant, to preserve a kingdom against unjust attack or anarchy. \u00a0 Niebuhr insisted that states operated by coercion, that the exercise of power was a continuum and that there was no essential distinction between using coercion within and outside of a state.\nAll three men saw a desire for peace as natural, as God-given, but as unrealizable on earth and all criticized pacifism as a political tool. \u00a0 It was an attempt by humans to build the City of God on earth and was doomed to failure. \u00a0\u00a0 An individual pacifist can accept death as a result of passive resistance against evil, but states do not and should not commit suicide. \u00a0 So a state\u2019s obligation and possibility for good is different from an individual\u2019s. \u00a0 A sacrificial love exemplified by Jesus is the highest that a woman or man can aim at, but justice based upon power is the goal for a state. \u00a0 There were differences among them on when war was allowed. \u00a0 Luther argued that the kingdom that fired the first shot was always in the wrong; that is, he made a qualitative difference between power in peace and power in war. \u00a0 Augustine did not condemn an initiator of hostilities, because a just war was correcting an already existing fault, was self-defense. \u00a0Niebuhr disliked just war theories because they could too easily be used to sanctify an oppressive social order and were unduly legalistic and rationalistic. \u00a0 That is, they failed to grasp a state\u2019s ability to lie to itself about fault and motives. \u00a0 Still, all three thinkers essentially found in just war theory a solution to dealing with the problem of evil. \u00a0 As I wrote these papers, I debated putting a section on just war theory here. \u00a0 Many believe that its theoretical limits on just cause for and just conduct during a war are a significant contribution to world peace. \u00a0 Whatever the strengths of the theories of fault, immunity of civilians, and proportionality, the historical record shows that sin overwhelms the restraint required. \u00a0 Just wars are, as the slogan indicates, just wars.\nModern Rethinking\nAfter contemplating the horrors of modern war, more recent Catholic teaching has sought to narrow the difference between just war and pacifism. \u00a0 The transformation that has occurred beginning with John XXIII and his two successors is analogous to the change that Gandhi brought to Hinduism. \u00a0 In Pacem in Terris and Vatican II, the church endorsed both just war theory and pacifism. \u00a0 Augustine had insisted that one did not fight for oneself but could for a neighbor. \u00a0 Now the Church insisted that pacifism based on love of neighbor was acceptable. \u00a0 Pius XII insisted that biological, chemical, and nuclear war are morally unacceptable under any circumstances because they do not protect civilians and do disproportionate damage, but during the Reagan administration the American bishops allowed the possession of nuclear weapons if done on a interim basis and with no intent to use. \u00a0 Liberation Theology in Latin America, building upon traditional Catholic social thought, insisted that structural violence could be so pervasive that the essential conditions for a just society could not be fulfilled. \u00a0 In such a case, non-violent resistance was the preferred option but, as a last resort and if the rulers employed violence to preclude political change, violence could be morally justified. \u00a0 It is a tragedy that the openness that John Paul II brought to the just war tradition was not extended to Liberation Theology. \u00a0 I see no sign that Benedict XVI will be more flexible here.\nReligious pacifism has also grown more complex, partially by recognizing that there can be many kinds of pacifism and new challenges. \u00a0 Pacifists have grappled with the issues of genocide, failed states, and terrorism and the value of international peace- keepers, armed or unarmed. \u00a0 John Howard Yoder\u2019s book, Nevertheless, describes a multitude of forms of religious pacifism. (There are additional secular forms: humanism, free trade, Marxism.) \u00a0 The most prominent of these religious theories are non-violence, principled disobedience irregardless of consequences, nuclear war pacifism, just war pacifism, and programmatic pacifism. \u00a0 The last seems to the most relevant to Quakers as well as to mainline Protestants and Catholics because it builds upon the early 20 th century experience of the social gospel. \u00a0 The social gospel attempted to use the power of government to build the kingdom of God on earth. \u00a0 Its theorists like Walter Rausenbusch saw a positive use of the powers of government as protecting against the worse excesses of industrialism. \u00a0 Abroad, its advocates worked for international law, arbitration of disputes, and a league of nations. \u00a0 In political science, the social gospel helped to create International Relations; the same anti-war impulse was behind another more recent reform discipline, Peace and Conflict Studies. \u00a0 The Social Gospel advocates were aware that war was not just a product of a ruler\u2019s moral failures (though having moral leaders was greatly to be desired) but peace could come only by countering racism, colonialism, and economic exploitation. \u00a0 Against the Augustinian-Niebuhr perspective that all actions were flawed by original sin, Quaker A.J. Muste insisted that there is such a phenomenon as amazing grace. \u00a0 More recent critics say that the ambiguity and conflict exalted by Niebuhr were male projections of his own insecurities and that a feminist theory emphasizing the value of nurturing and community offers an alternative. \u00a0 Even if actions are tainted by sin, all evil is not the same either qualitatively or quantitatively. \u00a0 Neither is all coercion the same, and killing in war is qualitatively different from other exercises of power. \u00a0 Building institutions that can contain the worst impulses of humanity has been done in many societies; there is a great deal of middle ground between perfection and genocide and our task is to find it. \u00a0 Because religions require a long perspective and critically examine human motivations and actions, spiritual institutions can provide an underpinning for peacemaking activities.\nFinally, religion has played a major role in inspiring individuals and groups working for peace. \u00a0 From St. Francis to male and female Nobel Laureates \u2013 Martin Luther King, Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama and Jimmy Carter, Quakers Jane Addams and Emily Greene Balch, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, and Rigoberte Mechu Tum of Guatemala - these and many obscure individuals working in church peace groups whose efforts do not lag in spite of years of discouragement show the strong correlation of religious devotion and work for peace. \u00a0 There are also religious and secular peace organizations throughout the world: \u00a0 Roman Catholic, Sant Egido, Jewish, Peace Now in Israel, \u00a0 Buddhist, Savrodaya in Thailand and Sri Lanka, the originally Christian, Fellowship of Reconciliation and secular, Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom, War Resisters League. \u00a0 Roman Catholic and Protestant missionary work has for years sought better living conditions through education and health care, and major denominations have lobbies in Washington. \u00a0 The evangelical churches that often seek to avoid direct political contact in missionary work can have a social impact. The argument has been made that the Pentecostal revival in Latin and South America has done more to improve the status and reduce violence to women than all the international conferences. \u00a0\u00a0 Like you, when I look at recent American foreign policy and elections, I despair. \u00a0 When we look at the response of the world to America\u2019s second Gulf War and the work of a plethora of NGOs \u2013 religious and secular, there are if not many grounds for hope, reasons for action.\nSo religions facilitate peace when\nTheir scriptures and paradigmatic figures proclaim the value of peace, with peace having a heavenly and earthly dimension.\nThey provide a source of ultimate value, often termed a God, beyond the immediate people and a culture that provides a means of judging and establishes restraints upon behavior.\nThey inculcate ethical norms of, compassion, honesty, charity, and social justice. \u00a0 These norms apply to all peoples, including rulers.\nThey question the value of transitory worldly goods and political power and rebuke inordinate ambition.\nThey provide spiritual solace helping people to endure the ills of the political and economic system.\nThey legitimate the political order by preaching against anarchy and accept the present boundaries of the state.\nThey promote forms of devotion that ignore the state.\nThey bring moral perspectives to bear upon the causes and conduct of a war. \u00a0 Religious leaders must have sufficient autonomy so that they are free to speak out in opposition to the state and a war.\nJ.

For the last six months, we\u2019ve taught apologetics to these high schoolers from Upland Christian Academy. Now it was time for them to \u201cget off the sidelines and into the game\u201d\u00a0and engage non-Christians with the truth. Of course, my atheist friends are more than happy to oblige, so they meet with our missions teams, challenge them with a short lecture, and then dive into some rigorous dialogue.\nWithout fail, a couple of our atheist guests will contend, \u201cReligion is the cause of most wars.\u201d\u00a0This cultural mantra has been uttered so often and with so much force, it has come to be accepted as an undeniable declaration. Prominent atheists like Sam Harris contribute to the chorus of voices, arguing religion is \u201cthe most prolific source of violence in our history\u201d\u00a0( The End of Faith page 27). Richard Dawkins claims, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that throughout history religious faith has been a major motivator for war and for destruction.\u201d\nBut as we trained students for this trip, we equipped them with a simple question to expose such claims: \u201cHow did you come to that conclusion?\u201d\u00a0(also known as Columbo Question #2 ). We simply taught students to recognize when someone makes a claim and then to request their supporting reasons. When our atheist presenters were challenged to provide justification, they could only offer up the Crusades, the Inquisition, 9-11, or vague references to Islamic terrorism. Certainly we recognize religion\u2019s role in these examples, but three or four references cannot support the claim that most wars are caused by religion.\nNot only were students able to demonstrate the paucity of evidence for this claim, but we helped them discover that the facts of history show the opposite: religion is the cause of a very small minority of wars. Phillips and Axelrod\u2019s three-volume Encyclopedia of Wars lays out the simple facts. In 5 millennia worth of wars\u20141,763 total\u2014only 123 (or about 7%) were religious in nature (according to author Vox Day in the book The Irrational Atheist ). If you remove the 66 wars waged in the name of Islam, it cuts the number down to a little more than 3%. A second scholarly source, The Encyclopedia of War edited by Gordon Martel, confirms this data, concluding that only 6% of the wars listed in its pages can be labelled religious wars. Thirdly, William Cavanaugh\u2019s book, The Myth of Religious Violence, exposes the \u201cwars of religion\u201d\u00a0claim. And finally, a recent report (2014) from the Institute for Economics and Peace further debunks this myth.\nWe didn\u2019t stop there. We showed students it gets worse for the atheists\u2019\u00a0claim. A strong case can be made that atheism, not religion, and certainly not Christianity, is responsible for a far greater degree of bloodshed. Indeed, R.J. Rummel\u2019s work in Lethal Politics and Death by Government has the secular body count at more than 100 million...in the 20th century alone.\nOur students were able to see that a simple examination of the facts relieves religion from blame for most of the world\u2019s wars. In addition, we were able to help cultivate in students a healthy skepticism of atheistic claims. If the skeptic will shout such an unsubstantiated claim so loudly and with so much force, what other skeptical claims might quickly fall apart under rational scrutiny?"}, {"Url": "https://existenceofgod.org/is-religion-the-cause-of-most-wars", "CluewebURLHash": "FE7B632D592295C59724254EF36F2B5C", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000Is religion the cause of most\ue001 wars?", "Snippet": "The evidence \ue000does\ue001 seem somewhat conclusive, doesn\u2019t it?

I'd like to try a scientific approach.\nThe position is that religion causes war. Just like, say, alcohol causes inebriation and sunlight makes things grow.\nIf we wanted to test the alcohol/inebriation or sun/growth hypotheses scientifically, what would we do? Quite simple: Remove the alcohol from whatever drinks we are serving and see if our clients are still inebriated. Same with the sun/growth theory: Remove the sunlight and see if things still grow.\nWith the religion/war hypothesis, we don't have to actually make a clinical study\u2014it's already been done for us. In the 20th century, we saw the most disastrous wars of history, both in Europe and in the Far East. Tell me, which of these were centered around religious disputes?\nAs scientists, we are forced to develop an alternative hypothesis: There is another common factor to war, much more common than religion\u2014and that is that they are fought by human beings.\nI can't speak on behalf of other religions, but I can tell you that many of the great prophets of Judaism spoke of the value of peace even in a time when war was the accepted state of affairs. Isaiah 's words are inscribed on the wall of the United Nations: \"And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword upon nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\"\nIn fact, the rabbis of Roman times taught that Peace (Shalom in Hebrew) is one of the names of G\u2011d.\nFor the rest of the world, it wasn't until the cataclysmic disaster of World War I that people began to realize that war isn't so much fun after all. That's how recent it was, less than ninety years ago, that suddenly peace became a value in the minds of human beings. If only they had listened to those prophets and rabbis a few thousand years earlier!\nHere's another article on the same subject: Who Needs Religion, If It's the Cause of So Much Violence?\nBy Tzvi Freeman\nTzvi Freeman is the author of Bringing Heaven Down to Earth and, more recently, Wisdom to Heal the Earth.

The strongest glue of any community is common beliefs, rituals and modes of dress\u2014that which we call religion.\nBut the community is a double-edged sword. It creates oneness within, but it also renders outsiders as \"others.\" Rabbi Jonathan Sacks addresses this issue in his most recent book, \"Not In God's Name.\"\nTorah addresses this issue with a constant reminder to respect and care for \"the stranger amongst you.\" This is taken to mean the non-Jew who lives in Israel, keeps the civil law, but not the religious law of the Jews. Great thinkers of the 17th century, such as Selden, Grotius and Locke, cited this as a precedent for the principle of religious tolerance. Reply\nRobert Queens July 16, 2015\nThis is my second posting on chabad but I do not know the purpose of the site, simple searches have led me here and I like the articles and the comments even better. Their is fundamental problem in religious belief and its that its tapestry forms clothing for its believers who then segregate\nthemselves from other persons wearing different outfits. Segregation is such a problem within religion and it creates ego. That ego grows and then believers feel entitle themselves to act God-like. What God needs the help of man? To fight over religion is to have no faith in God. If the point of celebrating a higher being by a means of demeaning others then the diety is reflected with malice. What religion does not have oposing sects? Who can claim to wrestle a spirit into his hand and hold it for a minute. Agreed, man causes war and the God enlightenment. Religion is a bird in a foxhole.

What ever countries currency runs the trade market runs the economy, at this point in time it is america so countries are turning on them power hungry and the leaders are using religion to brainwash the people to fight, same on both sides.\nThat is just one modern example, the economy theory is just an opinion not fact so please don't start an argument about it cause i don't care.\nThroughout history though this has always been the truth though any leader wanting world domination has used religion to brainwash people to fight.

It's those who take their religious teachings and warp themselves into thinking that their religion is the truth. Many Human's have an inability to tolerate one another, be it because of race, color, or religion. Unfortunately, religion is a motive for Humans who cause and fight wars. World War II was not caused by religion. The Allies had little knowledge of Hitler's concentration camps and what he was doing. Reply\nHarley Trevorton, PA April 30, 2013\nOpinion Not every war is caused by religion, but more were caused by religion then what people think. Granted, World War II did have the highest death count, but it still only counts as one war. Wars are not won by loses, they are won by whoever is stronger. We are not asking what has the higher death death toll, we are asking if religion is a cause of wars. Mathematically, religion is the number one cause of wars because there is so many. World War II cannot be the deciding factor. If you want to use it that way then my next argument would be that Hitler exterminated the Jewish, Gays, Gypsies, and the Mentally Challenged. He hated the Jewish because of their religion, not because they were not the same race because lets not forget that Hitler was Jewish himself, and you may say Hitler wanted there to be a master race, but there were plenty of Aryans that were Jewish and Hitler still killed them. Again, not every war was religious, but math and history don't lie.

The Bible seems to say that God once commanded such actions.\nPhoto: \"The Victory of Joshua over the Amalekites\" by Nicolas Poussin (c. 1624) / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\nJanuary 12, 2015\nBy\nJonathan Merritt\nPhoto: \u201cThe Victory of Joshua over the Amalekites\u201d by Nicolas Poussin (c. 1624) / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons\nHave you ever wondered why there are no Amalekites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites today? If you believe the Biblical accounts of history in the Old Testament are accurate, it may be because God commanded the Israelites to slaughter those people groups\u2013men, women, children, infants, and animals.\nCan you imagine someone ripping a newborn baby from its mother\u2019s breast and severing its head from it\u2019s body? The Bible seems to say that God once commanded such actions.\u00a0How do we reconcile those passages with a belief that God is unconditionally loving to all human beings?\u00a0Such\u00a0passages are among the least discussed and most ethically problematic in the Bible, but they cannot be ignored just because we don\u2019t like what they say.\nPaul Copan and Matthew Flannagan have sought to address the existence of these passages with the idea of a loving God in their book, Did God Really Command Genocide? Coming to Terms With the Justice of God, and here we discuss their views on the matter. Take a look and decide for yourself what you believe about these scandalous Scripture passages.\nRNS: Paul, there are some really horrible scripture passages in the Bible\u2013especially the Old Testament. What is the worst or most difficult?\nPaul Copan (PC): Definitely making the list are questions related to \u201cslavery\u201d or servitude, God\u2019s seeming harshness in judgments and punishments, and God\u2019s command to sacrifice Isaac. But perhaps the most troubling question from the Old Testament is God\u2019s command to kill and drive out the Canaanites and perhaps even innocent ones\u2014and there are similar commands concerning the Midianites and Amalekites as well. Some have suggested that this is a command to commit genocide, although we dispute this in our book and attempt to bring clarity to this and related questions.\nImage courtesy of Baker Books\nRNS: In these passages, t he text says God told them the Israelites to slaughter children, women, even animals. How do we even begin to process this?\nPC: We must first understand that the Canaanites engaged in acts that would be considered criminal in any civilized society\u2013incest, infant sacrifice, ritual prostitution, bestiality. Also, God waited over 400 years for Canaan to hit moral rock-bottom before commanding they be driven out (Gen. 15:16). In addition, things are less straightforward than what first appears. Tensions exist within the biblical text itself:\nFirst, the Israelites were commanded to \u201cdrive out\u201d or \u201cdispossess\u201d the Canaanites, but this assumes Canaanites would be alive\u2014not killed\u2014if driven out. Second, the \u201cutterly destroy\u201d or \u201cleave alive nothing that breathes\u201d language is hyperbolic in Scripture\u2019s war texts as in other ancient Near Eastern war texts. It typically stands alongside mention of many survivors\u2014like when sports teams use the language of \u201ctotally slaughtering\u201d their opponents. The land has \u201crest from war\u201d (Joshua 21:44), yet Joshua says nations still remain in Israel\u2019s midst (23:12); Judges 1-2 regularly repeats \u201cthey could not drive them out.\u201d\u00a0 The book addresses more of these nuances.\nRNS: Matt, you write, \u201cIn the Bible, God appropriates the writing of a human being with the\u00a0writer\u2019s own personality, character, and writing style.\u201d Does this change the way we might read passages where God seemingly commands violence?\nMatthew Flannagan (MF): Those passages occur in the context of a historical narrative. We are reading history, not as a 21 st century writer would write it, but history written by the literary conventions, style of narration and level of precision used by an the ancient Near Eastern writer. We, therefore, need to ask how phrases such as \u201cthey completely destroyed everyone in it\u201d or \u201che left no survivors\u201d or \u201cnot sparing anyone who breathed\u201d or \u201cuntil they exterminated them\u201d functioned in this sort of literature. It is not always as one might assume.\nRNS: You also talk about \u201chagiographic hyperbole.\u201d What is this and why does it matter?\nMF: Hagiographic hyperbole is a term used by philosopher Nicholas Wolterstorff to describe the kind of historical writing you see in the book of Joshua. The basic idea is that the accounts of Israel\u2019s early battles in Canaan are narrated in a particular style, which is not intended to be literal in all of its details and contains a lot of hyperbole, formulaic language and literary expressions for rhetorical effect. We argue in our book that the evidence both from within the Bible and from other ancient Near Eastern conquest accounts supports this conclusion.\nWhen biblical authors use phrases such as \u201cThey totally destroyed\u00a0them,\u00a0not sparing anyone that breathed\u201d (Josh 11:11), which are later followed by passages that presuppose that the same areas are still inhabited by the same peoples, they cannot be affirming that literally every man, woman and child was killed at God\u2019s command. It is a mistake to take them as affirming that Israel literally engaged in complete annihilation at God\u2019s command. They are exaggerating for rhetorical effect.\nRNS: An entire section of the book addresses\u00a0the question, \u201cIs it always wrong to kill innocent people?\u201d Well, is it, Paul?\nPC: Let\u2019s draw some distinctions.\u00a0There are (a) absolute duties to love God and avoid idolatry,\u00a0(b) general duties that, all things being equal, ought to be obeyed such as \u201cdon\u2019t deceive\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t kill,\u201d and (c) unusual cases of supreme emergency, in which some general duties may be overridden. For example,\u00a0to save innocent human life from would-be killers, deception would be morally permissible (cp. Ex. 1:15-21; 1 Sam. 16:1-2).\nLikewise, God issues a unique command to drive out a wicked people; if they stay behind\u2014despite the obvious divine public signs and wonders\u2013Red Sea crossing, pillar and fire cloud, manna\u2014they make themselves vulnerable to Israelite attack. God didn\u2019t command something intrinsically evil, though difficult, it was morally justifiable; God had good reason for issuing this command.\nRNS: Matt, people often point out that God is both loving and just. I agree, but commanding the slaughter of children, innocents, and animals by other sinners, is neither in my book. What am I missing?\nMF: There are two claims. First, a loving and just person would absolutely never endorse killing innocents no matter what the circumstances. Second, a\u00a0loving and just person would endorse a strong presumption against such actions but could, in principle, support them in rare circumstances if there is some greater good that overrides this presumption.\nThe existence of cases such as those where a woman in childbirth will die unless her child\u2019s head is crushed, both conjoined twins will die unless one is deprived of access to a vital organ, on a crowded life-boat one has to decide which people to push over, or on a plane doomed to crash who gets a parachute and who does not, suggest that the second\u00a0claim and not first that is true. This means that while a loving and just God does endorse a general rule against killing the innocent, he could allow exceptions to it in rare, unusual occasions.\nPosted in\nArts & Culture Beliefs Ethics Institutions On Faith and Culture Opinion"}, {"Url": "https://signsofthetimes.org.au/2021/10/does-religion-cause-war", "CluewebURLHash": "962B04037F046442CA84E1C2C9CBE437", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Does religion cause war? - Signs of the Times", "Snippet": "\ue000Does religion cause war\ue001?It\u2019s a firm yes from British zoologist and vocal atheist Richard Dawkins, who sees a direct correlation between the two.According to Dawkins, \u201c\ue000religion\ue001 \ue000causes\ue001 wars by generating certainty\u201d.

Children gunned down, innocent civilians killed by bombs or bullets, and hostages executed publically when demands aren\u2019t met. We hear reports from various commentators attributing this increase in violence around the world to religion. Religion is irrational, archaic and dangerous\u2014or so they say.\nWho\u2019s to blame?\nAlthough in recent years there has been a lot of finger pointing at Islamic extremists, Christians can\u2019t dodge the blame either. Examples include the crusades, sectarian Catholic and Protestant violence in Europe, and support for the Apartheid system in South Africa. We must admit that our own history is a mixed bag, and that violence has been perpetrated in the name of Christianity.\nWith the regularity that we hear the mantra \u2018religion is the cause of all wars\u2019, it would be easy to become disenchanted in our faith. If it\u2019s said often enough it must be true\u2014right?\nBut, like so much else about the issue of religion\u2019s relationship with war and violence, such generalisations are incredibly simplistic and misleading. Not only do they misrepresent the powerful benefit for good that flows out of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but also much of the positive influence of the family of God throughout history.\nAt the same time, it could be equally easy to deny the culpability of \u2018our\u2019 religion, while accepting uncritically everything that is said about another religion. A better understanding of other people\u2019s faiths, along with the context underlying their belief and behaviour, is part of \u2018loving our neighbour\u2019\u2014or doing unto others what we sometimes wish our secular friends would do unto us, when they dismissively judge our Christianity.\nOur view of Christianity and its relation to war and violence is a subject worthy of thought, as we seek to shape our faith in a way that reflects the love we have for God and as we seek to honour him.\nReligion causes war\nThe accusation that religion causes war is especially simplistic when applied to the pre-modern era. Religion, then, was not thought of as somehow separate from the rest of life and therefore could not be specifically identified as the cause of war. In reality, people groups, states and empires resorted to war for multiple reasons, including economic and social concerns.\nReligion has sometimes helped reduce or even stop war\u2014such as here in New Zealand when one common inspirational response made by Maori to the gospel was to cease applying the rule of utu and to apply the rule of forgiveness instead, setting the captive slaves free in the process! This kind of religiously-motivated outbreak of peace has often been overlooked.\nSo, too, has the fact that secular states have often been incredibly violent. Think of the French revolution (the birthplace of the secular state), Communist Russia, the regimes of the Shah of Iran and Ataturk in Turkey, not to mention Hitler\u2019s Germany.\nReligion has often acted as a corrective to state violence, with variations of the \u2018do unto others what you would like others to do unto you\u2019 golden rule, which is not only found in Christianity. Mahatma Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Archbishop Desmond Tutu\u2014and here in New Zealand the Maori prophets Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kakahi at Parihaka\u2014are\u00a0 clear examples of religious leaders who did much to avert violence by refusing to use it, even for what they clearly saw as a just cause. This was only possible because of their religious convictions.\nViolence vs peace\nA religion can also be greatly affected by the context that it exists within, so that we sometimes see religions respond to and reflect the anguish and fears of the culture and people it exists within. An essentially peaceful religion can become more violent and aggressive in its thinking when it is imbedded in a people who live in a climate of fear, violence and humiliation. In that context it can be hard to determine whether the religion was intrinsically evil and violent, or was \u2018turned\u2019 that way by the extreme context it existed within.\nIn New Zealand, the peace that first came to Maori through Christianity initially resulted in increasingly peaceful relations between various Iwi. It was a peaceful religion. However, with the land wars, the loss of land, devastating epidemics and the loss of mana, Maori experienced huge disillusionment and despair. This left them open to religious leaders who espoused a more aggressive theology that sometimes emphasised violent Old Testament themes. A religion of violence.\nIt would seem that too often the love of God does not work sufficiently in our lives that it reaches to our neighbour and that we do not always meet the call of Jesus to \u2018love our enemies\u2019.\nA striking example of this is the genocide in Rwanda. In his research on Christian churches and genocide in that country, Timothy Longman notes the extensive criticism faced by that country\u2019s Christian churches, not only for failing to oppose the genocide, but for complicity in the violence. A World Council of Churches team that visited Rwanda in August 1994 reported: \u2018In every conversation we had with the government and church people alike, the point was brought home to us that the church itself stands tainted, not by passive indifference, but by errors of commission as well.\u2019\nLongman\u2019s research confirms these conclusions. He says church personnel and institutions \u2018were actively involved in the programme of resistance to popular pressures for political reform that culminated in the 1994 genocide, and numerous priests, pastors, nuns, brothers, catechists, and Catholic and Protestant lay leaders supported, participated in, or helped to organize the killings.\u2019 Given that both Catholic and Protestant churches in Rwanda were multi-ethnic, this means that \u2018in most communities members of a church parish killed their fellow parishioners and even, in a number of cases, their own pastor or priest\u2019.\nWhen the roots of our faith do not reach down fully into the depths of God\u2019s love, fear and terror can follow. And so we stand in a place in time where must we consider our response to the fears of\nour world.\nPraying for peace\nI participated recently in a time of prayer for peace. It was carried out in response to the recent killings in France. The prayers were held in a Mosque, and leaders of the three great monotheistic faiths were present: Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The Jewish Rabbi prayed that violence would not define us and our religion. All repudiated this kind of violence and referred to the teachings of love and acceptance inherent in their respective faiths. All were concerned that the fear and hate building in much of the world should not spill into New Zealand.\nFrom a Christian point of view, I found this challenging. It could be tempting to score points on Islam in making the most of the obvious evil carried out in its name by some. This could seem a good way of lifting the Christian banner higher. Certainly, there are real issues around the potential risk to innocent people when terrorists carry out their immoral plans. Thought needs to be given on how to respond to this.\nIn addition, the media\u2019s focus on the most sensational and negative aspects of any issue can raise emotions and lead to the demonising of a whole people. Germans living in New Zealand during World War I and II experienced this. Despite all kinds of efforts they couldn\u2019t seem to do anything to get acceptance as New Zealanders, and experienced rejection and some violence instead.\nAlthough no excuse can be made for the barbaric violence carried out by individuals in the name of Islam, it does arise out of a context with a long tail. British, Russian and American imperialism, oil and forced secularisation have all exacted a terrible price on the people of the Middle East. The religion of Islam was brutally repressed\u2014in Iran by the Shah, Iraq by Saddam Hussein, Turkey by Ataturk, and Eqypt by Nasser. No wonder, then, that a violent and reactive kind of religion has appealed to some.\nMany wars have led to large numbers of people leaving their countries yearning for a better life. Some have found what they were looking for, but others have found isolation and marginalisation in their adopted countries. The racism and ghettoization of Islamic people in France has been identified by many as a likely contextual factor that could lead disaffected young people toward the kind of violence that is now emerging there. Islamic religious leaders that appear to articulate the reasons for their plight, a way of striking back, a cause to die for, a reason to live, and a people to belong to can be persuasive to young people, who have a palpable sense of being discriminated against.\nBreaking down walls\nI am sure, however, that the winsome love of Jesus is always more powerful than violence in affecting peace, by reaching people with God\u2019s love.\nJesus broke down so many walls. He spoke to and about Samaritans in a positive way, despite the prevailing view of disdain and even hatred for Samaritans at that time. He had as a disciple Simon the Zealot, who belonged to a group that worked to incite violence and rebellion against the Roman Empire (a terrorist). Jesus also chose Matthew, a tax collector\u2014or if you like, a collaborator with the Empire. Wouldn\u2019t it have been interesting to hear Simon and Matthew talk about their view of the Kingdom they were hoping Jesus would initiate?\nWhat can we, as Christians, bring to the conflict that seems to be affecting many around the world? Will we greet the refugee fleeing from desperate situations of poverty and violence? Or will we seek to exclude the stranger because of a common generalised view our cultural group uncritically dresses up as fact?\nWe are called to follow Jesus, who has broken down every wall. Maybe the first step in removing a wall is to meet and get to know a person from a cultural group we might be apprehensive about, perhaps because of the prevailing views of our people group.\nMy prayer is that, far from contributing to the rather erroneous view that religion causes all wars, Christians would witness to the world that Christ our saviour has broken every wall. And that we, as his followers, are prepared by word and in deed to be a light to the world in a time of darkness.\nLieut-Colonel Ian Hutson is the Divisional Commander of the Central Division in New Zealand.\nby Ian Hutson(c) 'War Cry' magazine, 12-13 March 2015, pp9.\nYou can read 'War Cry' at your nearest Salvation Army church or centre, or subscribe through Salvationist Resources."}, {"Url": "https://papersowl.com/examples/does-religion-cause-war", "CluewebURLHash": "1EBB91BA9DB0539EFFCEE7703DAAC133", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Does Religion Cause War? - Free Essay Example | PapersOwl.com", "Snippet": "Religion does cause war; it has been recorded in our literature and it is known as The Crusades.

After all, one can easily summon to mind a huge number of examples, from the Crusades to warfare connected with early Islam, to the September 11th attacks and sectarian warfare in the Middle East, and on and on and on. Some liberal-minded people, particularly those of an atheist bent, will rattle off these examples as clear proof that religion is a force for evil in the world.\nBut what if it\u2019s more complicated than that? What if there\u2019s less evidence than one might think that religion causes violence? That\u2019s the provocative thesis of an upcoming new article in Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations, a journal launched in April of 2018 (available as a preprint ), authored by Joshua Wright and Yuelee Khoo at Simon Fraser University.\nThe paper is mostly dedicated to a literature review which summarises a wide array of findings about the supposed link between religion and violence. Overall, Wright and Khoo argue that the literature points in both directions, and that there\u2019s little reason, at this relatively early juncture in understanding the connection between religion and behaviour, to believe that there\u2019s something unique to religious ideologies that cause them to foster violence.\nThat said, there are certainly plenty of studies on the side of the ledger that suggest religion does cause violence. For example, the authors cite research showing that the more that people felt the September 11th attacks to be a violation of their sacred values, the more likely they were to \u201cendorse \u2026 the use of nuclear and biological weapons in response.\u201d Similarly, \u201cThe more Christians perceive Jews as desecrators of Christianity, the more prejudice they exhibit toward [them].\u201d\nHowever, the authors also highlight complexities that fog up the picture. For example, they cite one study by US psychologist Tammy Greer that found (in Wright\u2019s and Khoo\u2019s words) \u201cgreater frequency of church attendance and greater frequency of engagement in church activities was associated with less self-reported vengeance,\u201d but at the same time that \u201ca more consistent donation pattern was related to greater self-reported vengeance.\u201d This suggests that, in some circumstances at least, asking slightly different questions about religiosity can yield answers pointing opposite directions.\nOther studies, meanwhile, provide apparently unequivocal evidence against the \u201creligion causes violence\u201d argument, including one of \u201c600 men in the Arkansas correctional system\u201d for whom religiosity was correlated with \u201clower self-reported acts of actual violent behavior over one\u2019s lifetime,\u201d which lined up with the results of another study showing an inverse link between church attendance and crime in Sweden. And \u201cLongitudinal work confirms the relationship between greater involvement in religious activities and less aggressive behavior across the lifespan,\u201d say Wright and Khoo.\nSo the literature is clearly a hodgepodge. And even if religion can be linked to an increased susceptibility to violence, the authors point out that this is not unique to religion. \u201cWhile threat perceptions toward individuals\u2019 religious identities may institute aggressive or violent responses, these effects are a product of a general social psychological process of group behavior, rather than anything inherent to religion,\u201d they write. That is, when ardent adherents of secular ideologies sense threat, they, too, often lash out at outsiders \u2013 what\u2019s going on is a fairly universal aspect of social psychology.\nThere could have been many situations in which researchers, by only asking questions about religion, missed this bigger picture. For example, while attendance at religious services has been associated with increased hostility toward, and intentions to harm, outgroups, it could be that religious attendance is simply a proxy for people having strong in-group identification. It\u2019s plausible that greater attendance at national, sporting or other secular ceremonies, might similarly correlate with hostility towards relevant outgroups \u2013\u00a0but if the only questions you ask are about religion, the only answers you get will be about religion.\nIn their conclusion, Wright and Khoo make a final point that should give pause to anyone who thinks the research literature, at present, offers a comprehensive look at the link between religion and violence. As they explain, \u201cWhat makes religion unique \u2026 is a belief in the supernatural, the meaning of this belief to the individual and the group, and the internalization and integration of religious identity to the individual.\u201d And yet \u201cDirect study of supernaturalism is noticeably absent in the literature.\u201d If the authors are correct, this means researchers have so far left out the single most important aspect of religious identity \u2013 leaving an incomplete picture as to whether it really does have a unique effect on the likelihood of violence or not.\n\u2014 Empirical perspectives on religion and violence (the link is to a PsyArXiv preprint, however the paper has been peer-reviewed and is due for publication in Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations.

Let's face it - the pandemic has made death a presence on a scale most of us aren't used to. Your beliefs about what happens after death or if anything happens might shape how you're dealing with your fears and anxieties. In the new book, \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife,\" my guest Bart Ehrman writes about where the ideas of heaven and hell came from. He examines the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, as well as writings from the Greek and Roman era.\nEhrman is a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and is one of America's most widely read scholars of early Christianity and the New Testament. His books such as \"Misquoting Jesus\" and \"How Jesus Became God\" challenge a lot of beliefs and common wisdom. As for Ehrman's beliefs, as a child, he was an altar boy in the Episcopal Church. At age 15, he became a born-again fundamentalist evangelical Christian. After attending the Moody Bible Institute, he studied at Princeton Theological Seminary, which introduced him to texts and interpretations that led him to a more liberal form of Christianity. Eventually, he left the faith altogether.\nBart Ehrman, welcome back to FRESH AIR. It is a pleasure to have you back. How are you and your family?\nBART EHRMAN: We're all well. And thanks for having me back.\nGROSS: So is the pandemic making you think differently about your book? Are you seeing your book in a way that you didn't quite when you were actually writing it?\nEHRMAN: I would say not so much. I mean, my view is that, you know, people have always been concerned about death, about what happens to them when they die, and so that's why I took on this book in the first place. But the pandemic, for me, is simply making it crystal clear why these are issues for so many people. Most people, of course, are more concerned about the process of dying right now or getting sick or the economics of that. But there's still the issue of death, so it's just simply become more pronounced.\nGROSS: Is it fair to say you're an atheist now?\nEHRMAN: That is fair to say (laughter). I actually consider myself both an atheist and an agnostic because I - you know, I don't really know if there's a superior being in the universe, but I don't believe there is. And so in terms of what I know, I'm an agnostic. But in terms of what I believe, I'm an atheist.\nGROSS: In a time like this, do you wish you could still believe in a heaven that offers eternal life, in a place where you would be united with loved ones?\nEHRMAN: Yeah, that would absolutely be good. It's not that I wish I believed it; I wish that it were true. And as I say in my book, as we'll probably get to, it may be true that we will live after we die. But if we do, it'll be something pleasant like that. It's not going to be something awful. So I - you know, it's not that I wish I believed it so much as I wish that it were true.\nGROSS: So what do you believe about death now, about what happens after you die?\nEHRMAN: Well, I - you know, I've read about death and thought about death and the afterlife for many, many years now and what - you know, what philosophers say and theologians say and biblical scholars say and, you know, what people generally say. And I still think that Socrates is the one who probably put it best. When he was on trial, on capital charges - so it was a death sentence awaiting him - he was talking with his companions about what death would be, and his view is that it's one of two things.\nEither we live on and we see those we knew before and those we didn't know before, and we spend all of our time being with them, which for him was absolute paradise because Socrates liked nothing better than conversing with people, and so now he could converse with Homer and with all the greats of the Greek past. So that would be great. And if it's not that, he said it would be like a deep sleep. Everybody loves a deep, dreamless sleep. Nobody frets about it or gets upset by having it. And so that's the alternative. And so it's either a deep sleep, or it's a good outcome, and either way it's going to be fine. And that's exactly what I think.\nGROSS: One of the theses of your book about the history of heaven and how is that views of heaven and hell don't go back to the earliest stages of Christianity, and they're not in the Old Testament or in Jesus' teachings. They're not?\nEHRMAN: (Laughter) I know, exactly. This is the big surprise of the book, and it's the one thing people probably wouldn't expect because, you know, when I was growing up, I just assumed. This is the view of Christianity. So this must be what Jesus taught. This is what the Old Testament taught. And in fact, it's not right. Our view that you die and your soul goes to heaven or hell is not found anywhere in the Old Testament, and it's not what Jesus preached. I have to show that in my book, and I lay it out and explain why it's absolutely not the case that Jesus believed you died and your soul went to heaven or hell. Jesus had a completely different understanding that people today don't have.\nGROSS: Are there things in the Hebrew Bible that still support the idea of heaven and hell as people came to understand it, things that you can extract from the Old Testament that might not literally mention heaven and hell but still support the vision that emerged of it?\nEHRMAN: I think one of the hardest things for people to get their minds around is that ancient Israelites and then Jews and then Jesus himself and his followers have a very different understanding of what the relationship between what we call body and soul. Our view is that we - you've got two things going on in the human parts. So you have your body, your physical being, and you have your soul, this invisible part of you that lives on after death, that you can separate the two and they can exist - the soul can exist outside of the body. That is not a view that was held by ancient Israelites and then Jews, and it's not even taught in the Old Testament.\nIn the Old Testament, what we would call the soul is really more like what we would call the breath. When God creates Adam, he creates him out of earth, and then he breathes life into him. The life is in the breath. When the breath leaves the body, the body no longer lives, but the breath doesn't exist. We agree with this. I mean, when you die, you stop breathing. Your breath doesn't go anywhere. And that was the ancient understanding, the ancient Hebrew understanding of the soul, is that it didn't go anywhere because it was simply the thing that made the body alive.\nAnd so in the Old Testament, there's no idea that your soul goes one place or another because the soul doesn't exist apart from the body. Existence is entirely bodily. And that was the view that Jesus then picked up.\nGROSS: Are there specific passages in the Hebrew Bible that support the notion of an afterlife?\nEHRMAN: Yeah, no, it's a good question. And people generally point to these passages in the Book of Psalms that talk about Sheol, or Sheol. It's a word that gets mistranslated into English. Sometimes Sheol is translated by the word hell, and it absolutely is not what people think of as hell. Sometimes Sheol is talked about by people today as a place that's kind of like the Greek Hades, a place where everybody goes after they die, and they aren't really physical beings down there; they're just kind of like souls, and they exist forever there, and there's nothing to do, and they do - they're all the same. And so Sheol is sometimes portrayed like that. The Bible does talk about this place Sheol, especially in poetry, especially in Psalms. And it's probably not a place that people go to, per se.\nIf you actually look at what the Psalms say about Sheol, they always equate it to the grave or to the pit. And so it appears that the ancient Israelites simply thought that when you died, your body got buried someplace. It got put in a grave, or it got put in a pit, and that's what they called Sheol, is the place that your remains are. But it's not a place where you continue to exist afterwards.\nJust about the only place in the Hebrew Bible where you get an instance of somebody who has died who seems still to be alive afterwards is in this very strange and interesting passage in the book of 1 Samuel, where the king, Saul, is desperate for some advice from somebody who knows, and so he calls - he has a necromancer, a woman, this woman of Endor, who calls up his former adviser Samuel from the grave. And she holds a kind of seance. And Samuel comes up and is really upset that she's called him up from the grave, and he gets upset with Saul for doing this, and he predicts that Saul is going to die the next day in battle, which he does.\nAnd so people often point to that as an instance that's - well, so people are alive after they're dead. And right, it kind of seems like that when you read it - when you just kind of simply read it. But if you actually read it carefully, it doesn't say that. What it says is that Samuel came up, but it doesn't say where he was, and it doesn't say if he was living at the time. It looks like what - before he was raised up, it looks like he was simply dead, and he was brought back to life temporarily, and he didn't appreciate that (laughter), and so he was upset.\nGROSS: Why don't we take a short break here? And then we'll talk about the history of ideas of heaven and hell. If you're just joining us, my guest is Bart Ehrman. He's the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n(SOUNDBITE OF STEFANO BOLLANI'S \"ALOBAR E KUDRA\")\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\nSo you write that starting in the sixth century, Hebrew prophets began to proclaim, you know, that the nation had been destroyed and would be restored back to life by God. It would be the resurrection of the nation. But then toward the end of the Hebrew Bible era, some Jewish thinkers came to believe that the future resurrection would apply not just to the nation but to individuals. So how does that shift happen?\nEHRMAN: Right. So this is a really important shift for understanding both the history of later Judaism and the history of later Christianity and the historical Jesus. About 200 before Jesus was born, there was a shift in thinking in ancient Israel that became - it became a form of ideology, a kind of religious thought that scholars today call apocalypticism. It has to do with the apocalypse, the revelation of God. These people began to think that the reason there is suffering in the world is not what the prophets had said, that it - because people sin and God is punishing them; it's because there are forces of evil in the world that are aligned against God and his people who are creating suffering. And so you get these demonic forces in the world that are creating misery for everyone.\nBut they - these apocalyptic thinkers came to think that God was soon going to destroy these forces of evil and get rid of them altogether, and the world would again return to a utopia. It'd be like paradise. It'd be like the Garden of Eden once more. The people who thought that maintained that this Garden of Eden would come not only to people who happened to be alive when it arrived; it was going to come to everybody. People who had been on the side of God throughout history would be personally raised from the dead and individually would be brought into this new era, this new kingdom that God would rule here on Earth.\nGROSS: So this was all dependent on, like, the Messiah coming on the end of days, which some Jewish prophets predicted would be soon. When Jesus was alive, he thought the end of days would be soon. And of course, it kept not happening.\nEHRMAN: Yeah.\nGROSS: And you say that for the ancient Jews, the fact that the Messiah didn't come, that was a turning point in beliefs about what happens after death, too. There started to be a belief that reward and punishment would be right after death, as opposed to after the Messiah comes.\nEHRMAN: Yeah. That became a view somewhat in Judaism, and it became a very pronounced view in Christianity. The - after Jesus. Jesus himself held to the apocalyptic view that I laid out. He taught - his main teaching is that the kingdom of God is coming. People today, when they read the phrase kingdom of God, they think he's talking about heaven, the place that your soul goes to when you die. But Jesus isn't talking about heaven because he doesn't believe - he's a Jew - he doesn't believe in the separation of soul and body.\nHe doesn't think the soul is going to live on in heaven. He thinks that there's going to be a resurrection of the dead at the end of time. God will destroy the forces of evil. He will raise the dead. And those who have been on God's side, especially those who follow Jesus' teachings, will enter the new kingdom here on Earth. They'll be physical. They'll be in bodies. And they will live here on Earth, and this is where the paradise will be. And so Jesus taught that the kingdom of God, this new physical place, was coming soon, and those who did not get into the kingdom were going to be annihilated.\nWhat ends up happening is that, over time, this expectation that the kingdom was coming soon began to be questioned because it was supposed to come soon and it didn't come soon, and it's still not coming, and when is it going to come? And people started thinking, well, you know, surely I'm going to get rewarded, you know, not in some kingdom that's going to come in a few thousand years, but I'm going to get rewarded by God right away. And so they ended up shifting the thinking away from the idea that there'd be a kingdom here on Earth that was soon to come to thinking that the kingdom, in fact, is up with God above in heaven. And so they started thinking that it comes at death, and people started assuming then that, in fact, your soul would live on.\nIt's not an accident that that came into Christianity after the majority of people coming into the Christian church were raised in Greek circles rather than in Jewish circles because in Jewish circles, there is no separation of the soul and the body. The soul didn't exist separately. But in Greek circles, going way back to Plato and before him, that was absolutely the belief. The soul was immortal and would live forever in Greek thinking. And so these people who converted to Christianity were principally Greek thinkers, they thought there was a soul that live forever. They developed the idea, then, that the soul lived forever with God when it's rewarded.\nGROSS: So you were saying there really isn't an explicit description of heaven and hell in the Hebrew Bible or even in the New Testament, but that Paul is important in understanding the history of heaven and hell. Tell us about what Paul wrote.\nEHRMAN: Paul is very important for understanding the history of heaven and hell, as he's important for understanding most things about early Christian thinking. Paul was not a follower of Jesus during his lifetime, during Jesus' lifetime. He wasn't one of the disciples. He converted several years after Jesus' death. He - Paul was Jewish. He was raised Jewish. He wasn't raised in Israel; he was from outside of Israel. He was a Greek-speaking Jew. But he was also, like Jesus, an apocalypticist who thought that at the end of the age, there would be a resurrection of the dead.\nWhen he became convinced that Jesus was raised from the dead, he thought that the resurrection had started. And so he talked about living in the last days because he assumed that everybody else now was going to be raised to follow suit. And so Paul thought he would be alive when the end came. For Paul, Jesus was going to come back from heaven and bring in God's kingdom here on Earth, and people would be raised from the dead for glorious eternity. Paul, in his earliest letters, affirms that view of the imminent resurrection. It's going to come very soon. And he fully expected to be alive when it happened.\nBut then time dragged on, and a couple of decades passed, and it didn't arrive, and Paul started realizing that, in fact, he might die before it happens. And so in some of his later letters, he ponders the possibility of death, and he wonders, well, what happens to me, then? If I'm brought into the presence of Christ at the resurrection, and, you know, there's a gap between the time I die and - what happens to me during that gap? And he started thinking that, surely, he's going to be in Christ's presence during that time.\nAnd so he came up with the idea that he would have a temporary residence up with Christ in God's realm, in heaven, until the end came. And so this is what the later Paul has to say, and this is the beginning of the Christian idea of heaven and hell, that you can exist - even though your physical remains are dead, you can exist in the presence of God in heaven. And once Paul started saying that, his followers really latched onto it because most of Paul's converts were from Greek circles. They were gentiles. They weren't Jews. And they had been raised with the idea that your soul lives on after death, and now they had a Christian model to put it on. They could say that, yes, your soul lives on, and so when you die, your soul will go up to God with heaven. And as time went on, that became the emphasis rather than the idea of the resurrection with the dead.\nGROSS: How does hell come into it?\nEHRMAN: Well, so since these people believed that the soul was immortal, that you can kill the body but you can't kill the soul, they thought, well, OK, so our soul will go to heaven to be with God, but then they realized, well, what about the people who are not on the side of God? Well, if we're being rewarded, they're going to be punished. And that's how you start getting the development of the idea of hell, that it's a place where souls go to be punished in - as the opposite of the people who go to heaven to be rewarded. And in thinking this, as it turns out, the Christians are simply picking up on views that had been around among the Greeks since way back in the time of Plato. Plato also has ideas about souls living on, either to be rewarded or punished forever. And Christians now, who were mainly coming from Greek contexts, latched onto that idea with a Christian way of putting it.\nGROSS: We have to take a short break here. So let's do that, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Bart Ehrman, who is the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. We'll be right back and talk more about the history of heaven and hell. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MATT ULERY'S LOOM'S \"OVER UNDER OTHER\")\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of Religious Studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and is one of America's most widely read scholars of early Christianity and the New Testament. His earlier books include \"Misquoting Jesus\" and \"How Jesus Became God.\"\nYou've also studied the Gnostic Gospels, which were the recently discovered gospels that never became part of the canon. And these are more mystical texts. And the most famous of the Gnostic Gospels is Thomas. What was his vision of what happens after death?\nEHRMAN: The various groups of Christians that people sometimes label gnostic would cover a wide range of views. There are lots of different religions that people have called gnostic. But one thing that most of them have in common is the idea that the body is not what matters. The body is not your friend, and God did not create the body. The body is a cosmic disaster. It's why we experience so much pain and suffering because we live in these material shells. And in most gnostic religions, the idea is to get out of the shell, to escape the shell. So they have very much a differentiation between soul and body. It comes - Gnosticism, in some ways, comes out of Greek thinking. So for them, there's no resurrection of the dead.\nGnostics disagreed with the Jewish idea that at the end of time, God would raise the dead physically. For Gnostics, the idea of being raised in your body was repulsive. You mean I've got to live in this thing forever? No. Real life is in the soul. And so they denied the idea of the resurrection of the body. And what is interesting is Gnostics then claimed that Jesus also denied it. And so when you read the Gnostic Gospels, you find Jesus denouncing the idea that there's a resurrection of the body or that life will be lived eternally in the body; it's strictly a matter of the soul.\nAnd the other interesting thing is that what the Gnostics did, by reading their ideas into Jesus, is also what the Orthodox Christians did, by putting words in Jesus' lips that supported their ideas of heaven and hell. And so in our various Gospels, you have Jesus saying all sorts of things that are contradictory because different people are putting their own ideas onto his lips.\nGROSS: So your new book is about the history of heaven and hell. Your forthcoming book that you're working on now is going to be called \"Expecting Armageddon.\" So how does the Book of Revelation contribute to the vision of hell?\nEHRMAN: Well, yeah. You know, a lot of people read Revelation as indicating that people who are opposed to God - sinners will be cast into the lake of fire forever, and they will be - yeah, they'll be floating in fire for eternity. And they get that from several passages in the Book of Revelation. I have to deal with this in my book, where I try to show that, in fact, the Book of Revelation does not describe eternal torment for sinners in the lake of fire. The - there are several beings that go into the lake of fire, but they are not human beings; they are the antichrist, the beast and the devil, and they are supernatural forces that are tormented forever.\nThe people, in the Book of Revelation, human beings who aren't on the side of God, are actually destroyed. They are wiped out. This is the view that is fairly consistent throughout the New Testament, starting with Jesus. Jesus believed that people would be destroyed when - at the end of time, they'd be annihilated. So their punishment is they would not get the kingdom of God. That also is the view of Paul, that people would be destroyed if - when Jesus returns. It's not that they're going to live on forever. And it's the view of Revelation. People do not live forever. If they aren't brought into the new Jerusalem, the city of God that descends from heaven, they will be destroyed.\nGROSS: So a lot of the imagery of hell comes from the Book of Revelation. It's a very explicit, kind of gruesome book, and I wonder if you've thought about why it's so graphic.\nEHRMAN: Yeah, I've thought a lot about it. As you said, this is going to be what my next book is on, is about how people have misinterpreted Revelation as a prediction of about what's going to happen in our future. And the graphic imagery in the book has really contributed to all of these interpretations of Revelation. When earlier I was saying that Jesus was an apocalypticist who thought that the world was going to come to an end, that God was going to destroy the forces of evil to bring in a good kingdom, that is precisely what the author of the Book of Revelation thinks, that - and the book is a description of how it's going to happen.\nThe book is all about the terrible destruction that is going to take place on Earth when God destroys everything that is opposed to him, before bringing in a good kingdom. And so all of the imagery of death and destruction and disease and war in the Book of Revelation is used to show what terrible measures God has to take in order to destroy the forces of evil that are completely - have completely infiltrated the human world, before he brings in a new world. This, though, is not a book that describes what's going to happen to individuals when they die and go to heaven or hell; it's a description of the final judgment of God that somehow is going to be coming to Earth.\nGROSS: You've talked about how belief in the end times led in a circuitous way to belief in heaven and hell. I've heard a lot of joking lately about how it's the end times. You know, California was on fire. We have climate change and extreme weather and earthquakes and volcanoes. And people are afraid that the planet itself is dying. We have, you know, plastics in the ocean, ice caps that are melting. And now we have the pandemic. I'm wondering if you're hearing that kind of thing, too.\nEHRMAN: Yes. Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, a lot of people aren't joking. They take it very seriously. And it's - I want to say a couple of things about that. First is every generation from the time of Jesus till today has had Christians who insisted that the prophecies were coming true in their own day. There have always been people who actually picked a time when it's going to happen. And there are two things that you can say about every one of these people over history who've picked a time. One is they based their predictions on the Book of Revelation. And secondly, every one of them has been incontrovertibly wrong (laughter). So that should give one pause. The things that are happening now are absolutely dreadful as, of course, they were in 1916 to - 1914 to 1918 and as they have been at other times in history.\nThe book that I'm writing that I'm now calling \"Expecting Armageddon\" is all about that. It's about how people have misused the Book of Revelation to talk about how the end is coming and how it always seems like it's going to be coming in our own time. And everybody thinks this is as bad as it can be. And, you know, this time we may have it right. This kind of thinking, though, really came to prominence at the end of the 19th and into the 20th century and hit big prominence in 1945, when we actually had the means of destroying ourselves off the planet, which we still have, by the way. People aren't talking about nuclear weapons anymore, but they probably should be because that's another way this whole thing might end.\nBut now the talk is more about climate change, as it should be. We absolutely may do it to ourselves this time, but it won't be a prediction - a fulfillment of predictions of a prophecy; it'll be because of human stupidity and refusal to act in the face of crisis.\nGROSS: Let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is religion scholar Bart Ehrman, who is the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n(SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE'S \"SUPERA\")\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and the author of many books about early Christianity.\nSo now we're faced with a pandemic. You could, I suppose, use the word plague, and the word, you know, plague is in the Hebrew Bible. What were the explanations in the Hebrew Bible for plagues?\nEHRMAN: Yeah. The old testament has a fairly uniform and rather stark explanation for why there are plagues or epidemics or pandemics. In virtually every case, we're told that it's because God is punishing people. People have gone against his will, and so he is - so he's bringing this disaster of epidemic upon them. You get that in the story of Moses in the Book of Exodus. You get it everywhere in the writings of the prophets in Amos and Isaiah, etc. This was the old view that the reason God's people suffer is because they've done something wrong and he wants them to repent.\nEventually, Jewish thinkers began to reason that it didn't make much sense because there were times when they would be doing what God told them to do, or at least they'd be doing their level best to do what God told them to do, and they'd still be suffering these plagues. And that's when they developed the idea that, in fact, it's the forces of evil causing these disasters. These continue to be two of the common explanations today.\nThere are people today who are saying that the reason of the pandemic is because, you know, one sin or another. It's because of, you know, those LGBTQ folk, you know, who are allowing promiscuous activity. God is punishing us. Or it's because of, you know, one social ill or another that God is punishing. And you have that group. And then you have group who saying that it's the devil doing it, that in fact, it's the forces of evil. Satan is working his way, and that it's because we're at the end of time, and he has to be released here at the end of time before God will intervene. You get both of those explanations. Most people probably don't subscribe to either one. Most people just say, well, look - you know, it's a pandemic, and we better pay attention to our scientists, which is, obviously, the more socially satisfying answer to the question.\nGROSS: When you were 15 and became a fundamentalist evangelical Christian, what would you have believed about the pandemic?\nEHRMAN: That's a really good question. I probably would have subscribed - I would have subscribed to either the view that God was upset and we needed to repent so that he would relent, or that the devil - it was the devil doing it, and we needed to pray to God for mercy and for him to intervene on our behalf.\nGROSS: And compare that to now.\nEHRMAN: Well, I think those views - I mean, I respect believers. I do not try to convert anybody. I don't try to trash anybody's views. I try to respect everybody's views. I think that sometimes those very highly religious views can be socially extremely dangerous because if you think that the cause is supernatural, then you don't have much motivation to find a natural solution. It is quite dangerous to refuse the findings of science because of your personal beliefs. And we all just hope that it doesn't lead to even further disaster.\nGROSS: I'm wondering - since you've changed from being a fundamentalist when you were in your teens and early 20s to now being an agnostic atheist, how have you dealt with the deaths or impending deaths over the years of loved ones who do believe and who - you know, who are Christians, who are Christian believers and do believe in heaven and hell? Like, I'm sure you don't want to talk them out of their beliefs. But it's not what you believe.\nEHRMAN: Yeah.\nGROSS: So how do you mediate between your beliefs and their beliefs in how you talk to them about what will happen and how you talk to yourself?\nEHRMAN: When I talk with somebody, especially somebody who's close to me who is a firm believer in heaven and hell, I have no reason to disabuse them of that, unless they're using that belief to hurt somebody or to advocate social policies that are harmful to people. My dear elderly mother is a very good Christian, and she believes that she will die and she will go to heaven and she will see her husband. And so I would be crazy to say, no, Mom, actually, yeah, you're not going to see him (laughter). Of course, I'm not going to - I mean, there's no reason to shatter somebody's beliefs, especially if they simply are providing them with hope.\nMy view is that we all believe very strange things, and most of the time we don't realize how strange they are. And so I don't - it's not that I think that I believe only rational things and everybody else is irrational. I have a different set of beliefs. But my firmest belief is that whatever we believe, it should not do harm in the world; it should do good in the world. And of course, belief in heaven and hell has done a lot of good; it's also done a lot of harm. It has terrified people. There are people who are terrified of dying because they're afraid - they are literally afraid that they will be tormented for trillions of years, just as the beginning. And I think that's a harmful belief.\nAnd so I will never try to talk somebody out of a belief in heaven, but I certainly will try to talk people out of a belief in hell because it's simply wrong, and it's harmful. It does psychological damage. And when people raise their children on this stuff, it can scar them for life. And so I think that hell is something we need to fight against; heaven, I'm all for.\nGROSS: Do you feel that believing in hell scarred you?\nEHRMAN: I do in some ways. I don't think I'm scarred much longer, but I worked really, really hard at it. I was terrified of going to hell. And I think that, you know, psychologically, that was very bad. It made me a rather obnoxious fundamentalist Christian because I thought that everybody else was going to go to hell, and so I had to go out of my way to convert them all (laughter). So I wasn't always a pleasant person to be around because I was right and they were wrong, and since they were wrong, they were going to hell.\nBut the main thing is that I think that, in fact, it imposes emotional damage. When people need to find life pleasant and hopeful and they need to be helpful to other people, they need to enjoy life, if all you're looking forward to is what's going to happen after you die, you can't really fully enjoy life now because this is just a dress rehearsal. And so I don't try to talk people out of their view of heaven, but I think, actually, it's better off, you know, not living for what's going to happen after you die; it's better off living for what you can do now.\nGROSS: Let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is religion scholar Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MICHAEL NYMAN'S \"HOW DO I KNOW YOU KNOW?\"\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Bart Ehrman, author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\" He's a distinguished professor of religious studies at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and the author of many books about early Christianity.\nYou know, you write in your book that it's hard for you to conceive of God as being a sadist who would torture people for eternity in hell.\nEHRMAN: Right. So the bottom line of the book is that the way you kind of trace the history of heaven and hell is that when people thought that everybody dies and it's the same for everybody forever, they thought, well, that's not fair. Surely, if there are gods in the world or God in the world, there has to be justice. So suffering now must be rewarded later, and wicked behavior now must be punished later. And so they came up with the idea of an afterlife with rewards and punishments.\nBut eventually, in Christianity, the idea was that since the soul is eternal, it's either rewarded eternally or it's punished eternally. But then people started thinking, well, wait - is that fair? So, OK, suppose I'm just a regular old sinner, and I die when I'm 40, and so maybe I had about 25, maybe even 30 years of not being the most perfect person on Earth. I'm going to be tortured for 30 trillion years for those 30 years? And those 30 trillion years is just the beginning? Is there really a God who's going to allow that, let alone cause it? I mean, I just - no (laughter).\nAnd so I think - I cannot believe that you can actually say that God is just and merciful and loving - even if he believes in judgment, he is not going to torture you for 30 trillion years and then keep going. It just isn't going to happen.\nGROSS: I'm wondering what you think about when you think about how the number of people who are contracting COVID 19 and how the number of people who are dying keeps growing as we get closer to Passover and Easter, which are very holy times in Judaism and Christianity.\nEHRMAN: I think that - I'll speak from the Christian tradition, which I still cherish even though I am no longer a Christian, there are aspects of Christianity that I resonate with because they're so deeply ingrained in me. The Easter story is a story of hope that - in the Easter story, death is not the final word, that there's something that comes after death. There is hope in moments of complete despair. There can be life after death.\nI don't take that literally anymore because I don't believe there is. I'm open to it, and I hope there is something after death, and if it is, it'll be good. But I personally think, probably, this life is all there is. But I take the Easter story as a metaphor that, even in the darkest hours when there looks to be no hope and it looks like it's simply the end of all things, there actually is a glimmer of hope and that something good can come out of something very bad. And so I really believe that, and I'll probably always believe it.\nGROSS: So what are you doing to stay safe? You live in North Carolina. You teach in the - at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I know you're on sabbatical right now. We're recording this on Thursday. As we speak, is there any kind of advice you're getting in North Carolina about how to behave?\nEHRMAN: Well, the same advice everybody's getting who's listening to the right news sources, which is that you need to self-isolate. You simply - it is going to be a disaster for some way - somewhere, on some level, for the economy, but it'll be a worse disaster if we are out in public because we could be spreading the virus. We have to self-isolate. And so I'm - my wife and I have been completely self-isolated for a week now, and we're going to stay this way. And it's really the only way to stop this thing from growing. It's going to grow. It'll be exponential. But it's the only way to stop it.\nGROSS: So does that mean you're not leaving the house at all?\nEHRMAN: Just to go out in my yard. I'll occasionally walk around the block if nobody's around. But other than that, no. We aren't using our cars. We're not going out. We're not doing anything else. We're staying - absolutely staying inside, and we're in the yard.\nGROSS: Well, Bart Ehrman, I wish you good health, and I thank you very much for talking with us.\nEHRMAN: Well, thank you for having me. I hope you stay safe, too.\nGROSS: Thank you. Bart Ehrman's new book is called \"Heaven And Hell: The History Of The Afterlife.\" And if you're thinking, but what about this passage in the Old Testament or what about that passage in the New Testament, let me just say we only had time to touch on a few of the points in Bart Ehrman's book, so if you want to know more about what he has to say about the history of the afterlife, I refer you to his book. Bart Ehrman, thank you again.\nEHRMAN: Thank you for having me.\nGROSS: Bart Ehrman is the author of the new book \"Heaven And Hell: A History Of The Afterlife.\"\nTomorrow on FRESH AIR, my guest will be a doctor who has worked in war zones around the world and is now battling the pandemic, treating patients in his own country, England. I'll talk with David Nott, who's been a trauma surgeon in conflict zones, including Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq, and trains doctors in conflict and natural disaster zones.

(We\u2019re not the best conversationalists.) She asked, \"If there's no biological basis for race, then why do some medications work better for people of some races than others?\" Which is a good question. Since we had a long drive ahead of us, I stalled by pointing out the window at a pretend elk and changed the subject, then did some furious Googling when we stopped for gas.\nFor hundreds of years, we\u2019ve been told that each race is a discrete group of people defined by specific genetic and biological differences. As a result, we\u2019ve used race as a way of explaining observed differences in health: Sickle Cell Anemia is considered a black person disease; Cystic Fibrosis is considered a white person disease; we\u2019ve said people of color are genetically pre-disposed to diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and other chronic conditions; the FDA has approved drugs for different races; and through \u201c race-based medicine \u201d we\u2019ve established care standards (such as responding to patients\u2019 pain) that vary by race. But it\u2019s all wrong.\nIn the early 1800s, Dr. Samuel Morton conducted research to demonstrate biological differences between races. His extraordinarily flawed and biased findings have since been used to justify hundreds of years of horrors like slavery and genocide. Since then, science has unequivocally demonstrated that race isn\u2019t biologically real. The genetic diversity that exists across the entire human race is very, very small, and race isn\u2019t even a good proxy for what diversity does exist. That\u2019s why we say race is a social construct: it\u2019s a human-invented classification system. It was invented as a way to define physical differences between people, but has more often been used as a tool for oppression and violence.\nWhich brings us back to the original question, though. If there\u2019s no biological basis for race, how do we explain the health differences we observe? As I\u2019ve since learned, there are a couple reasons for it. First, race is inaccurately used as a proxy for geography. Certain diseases or conditions originate in particular areas of the world where the environment has caused an evolutionary response or genetic impact. Sickle Cell Anemia, for example, is an evolutionary adaptation to malaria exposure, and is most common in populations with ancestors that lived in regions of the world where malaria is or was common. So while we see it at higher rates in people of Sub-Saharan African descent, we also see it in higher rates of people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent, because malaria is or was widespread in those regions.\nThe other aspect of what we see as racial health differences is explained by the field of epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of how we inherit changes in the way our genes our expressed\u2014whether they\u2019re turned on or off\u2014without actually changing our DNA. The things we eat, the environment we\u2019re exposed to, our life experiences\u2014these can all modify our gene expression, and then those changes can be passed on to future generations. So, the incidence of a disease or condition within a racial group might actually be caused by environmental, political, economic, and other forms of systemic racism. For example, pre-term births are 60 percent more common with black babies than white babies, which is a leading contributor to our unacceptably high infant mortality rate. One study showed that chronic stress was the primary reason for this disparity, and other studies have shown how chronic stress can be transmitted from generation to generation. So, black women aren\u2019t more likely to have pre-term births because they are black, but because stressors like racism and poverty disproportionately affect black women.\nThis paradox, where race is both not biologically real and yet incredibly socially and politically real, is an unusual challenge for the health care system. We must de-emphasize race in how we provide health care, classify our patients, and assign causality, while increasing our emphasis on race in how structural and institutional racism lead to health inequities. So, I hope this answers your question, doctor!"}, {"Url": "https://scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue", "CluewebURLHash": "7A99D7370BC1662F1717F3488566D567", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Race Is a Social Construct, Scientists Argue - Scientific ...", "Snippet": "Today, the mainstream belief among scientists is that\ue000 race\ue001 is a\ue000 social construct\ue001 without biological meaning.

Du Bois was concerned that race was being used as a biological explanation for what he understood to be social and cultural differences between different populations of people. He spoke out against the idea of \"white\" and \"black\" as discrete groups, claiming that these distinctions ignored the scope of human diversity.\nScience would favor Du Bois. Today, the mainstream belief among scientists is that race is a social construct without biological meaning. And yet, you might still open a study on genetics in a major scientific journal and find categories like \"white\" and \"black\" being used as biological variables.\nIn an article published today (Feb. 4) in the journal Science, four scholars say racial categories are weak proxies for genetic diversity and need to be phased out. [Unraveling the Human Genome: 6 Molecular Milestones ]\nThey've called on the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to put together a panel of experts across the biological and social sciences to come up with ways for researchers to shift away from the racial concept in genetics research.\n\"It's a concept we think is too crude to provide useful information, it's a concept that has social meaning that interferes in the scientific understanding of human genetic diversity and it's a concept that we are not the first to call upon moving away from,\" said Michael Yudell, a professor of public health at Drexel University in Philadelphia.\nYudell said that modern genetics research is operating in a paradox, which is that race is understood to be a useful tool to elucidate human genetic diversity, but on the other hand, race is also understood to be a poorly defined marker of that diversity and an imprecise proxy for the relationship between ancestry and genetics.\n\"Essentially, I could not agree more with the authors,\" said Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, a biologist and director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, who worked on the Neanderthal genome but was not involved with the new paper.\n\"What the study of complete genomes from different parts of the world has shown is that even between Africa and Europe, for example, there is not a single absolute genetic difference, meaning no single variant where all Africans have one variant and all Europeans another one, even when recent migration is disregarded,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo told Live Science. \"It is all a question of differences in how frequent different variants are on different continents and in different regions.\"\nIn one example that demonstrated genetic differences were not fixed along racial lines, the full genomes of James Watson and Craig Venter, two famous American scientists of European ancestry, were compared to that of a Korean scientist, Seong-Jin Kim. It turned out that Watson (who, ironically, became ostracized in the scientific community after making racist remarks) and Venter shared fewer variations in their genetic sequences than they each shared with Kim.\nAssumptions about genetic differences between people of different races have had obvious social and historical repercussions, and they still threaten to fuel racist beliefs. That was apparent two years ago, when several scientists bristled at the inclusion of their research in Nicholas Wade's controversial book, \"A Troublesome Inheritance\" (Penguin Press, 2014), which proposed that genetic selection has given rise to distinct behaviors among different populations. In a letter to The New York Times, five researchers wrote that \"Wade juxtaposes an incomplete and inaccurate account of our research on human genetic differences with speculation that recent natural selection has led to worldwide differences in IQ test results, political institutions and economic development.\"\nThe authors of the new Science article noted that racial assumptions could also be particularly dangerous in a medical setting.\nSign up for Scientific American\n\"If you make clinical predictions based on somebody's race, you're going to be wrong a good chunk of the time,\" Yudell told Live Science. In the paper, he and his colleagues used the example of cystic fibrosis, which is underdiagnosed in people of African ancestry because it is thought of as a \"white\" disease. [The Best Genealogy Software for Tracing Your Family Tree]\nMindy Fullilove, a psychiatrist at Columbia University, thinks the changes proposed in the Science article are \"badly needed.\" Fullilove noted that by some laws in the United States, people with one black ancestor of 32 might be called \"black,\" but their 31 other ancestors are also important in influencing their health.\n\"This is a cogent and important call for us to shift our work,\" Fullilove said. \"It will have an enormous influence. And it will make for better science.\"\nSo what other variables could be used if the racial concept is thrown out? P\u00e4\u00e4bo said geography might be a better substitute in regions such as Europe to define \"populations\" from a genetic perspective. However, he added that, in North America, where the majority of the population has come from different parts of the world during the past 300 years, distinctions like \"African Americans\" or \"European Americans\" might still work as a proxy to suggest where a person's major ancestry originated.\nYudell also said scientists need to get more specific with their language, perhaps using terms like \"ancestry\" or \"population\" that might more precisely reflect the relationship between humans and their genes, on both the individual and population level. The researchers also acknowledged that there are a few areas where race as a construct might still be useful in scientific research: as a political and social, but not biological, variable.\n\"While we argue phasing out racial terminology in the biological sciences, we also acknowledge that using race as a political or social category to study racism, although filled with lots of challenges, remains necessary given our need to understand how structural inequities and discrimination produce health disparities between groups,\" Yudell said.\nGenetics by the Numbers: 10 Tantalizing Tales\n15 Weird Things Humans Do Every Day, and Why\nTop 10 Controversial Psychiatric Disorders\nCopyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company.

But what does that mean?\nPosted December 5, 2016 |Reviewed by Ekua Hagan\nTrevor Noah, host of The Daily Show, recently released an autobiography entitled Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood. As a biracial man born and raised in South Africa, he shares fascinating insights into how we racially categorize people and the consequences of such categorization.\nHe recounts how, as the son of a Black mother and a White father, his biracial status put in him a middle ground, considered \u201cinferior\u201d by half of his family and \u201csuperior\u201d by the other half. After all, in South Africa, there have historically existed many gradations of whiteness and blackness as social categories, each of which comes with different social standing.\nFor instance, Noah describes how his Black grandmother was much less severe with him relative to his Black cousins, given his privileged status as half-White. He also explains how under the apartheid system one\u2019s racial category or status could change, both socially and legally.\nThis is in sharp contrast to how race is conceptualized in the US, where the \u201cone-drop rule\u201d has long dominated. Although American culture recognizes the biracial category, people are generally considered Black (and treated as such) if they have descended from any Black relatives to any degree. That is, even a \u201cdrop\u201d of Black blood has rendered someone Black (but even this varies depending on whether the perceiver is White or Black, among other factors).\nAs such, even being 1/16th Black historically resulted in your categorization as Black. (Incidentally, the Nazis held similar views, where having Jewish ancestry, even in a distant sense, categorized one as Jewish).\nThis is known as hypodescent, a process whereby a biracial person is categorized fully or primarily in terms of the lower status (or disadvantaged) social group. The fact that status plays a role in social categorization clearly demonstrates that categorization (e.g., as White, as Black) is a social construction.\nYet when I talk about race in class, it becomes apparent that students grapple with the notion of race as a social construction. Some will say, \u201cBut I can see race. I can see that you\u2019re White, that she is Asian, and that he is Black.\" Others, including those in the media, are suspicious of the notion of race as a social construction, fearing that such ideas represent a left-wing ploy. A trick. A trap.\nBut recognizing race as a social construction does not make race less \u201creal.\" Marriages are social constructions, but they have serious legal, cultural, and interpersonal implications. Oftentimes the social aspect is what makes a phenomenon so central to our lives.\nSo what do we mean by social construction in the racial context? Rather than draw on scientific or philosophical discussions of race and essentialism, my goal here is to describe some concrete examples that might help to elucidate what is meant by race as social construction.\nLet\u2019s start with President Barack Obama. When he was running for president, we witnessed a range of responses from the voters and pundits. To some, he was clearly \u201ctoo Black.\" For others, he was clearly \u201cnot Black enough.\" Even within social groups, there were disagreements. For some Black Americans he was not Black enough because he did not descend from slavery in an American context (i.e., his father moved from Kenya).\nThe fact that there exists disagreement, whether between Whites and Blacks, or within Whites and Blacks, drives home the point of this article: Race is a social construction with no true or absolute biological basis. If we can disagree about whether someone is of Race X or Y, and if there are consensual rules for determining such designations (e.g., based on social status, slave history), and if such a designation can change over time or across cultures (e.g., US vs. South Africa), then we are dealing with a social construct, not a biological one. As a society we develop cultural rules about race and then we apply these rules when psychologically categorizing people.\narticle continues after advertisement\nNeed more convincing? Let\u2019s turn to some interesting science. Kemmelmeier and Chavez (2014), using a variety of different methods across studies, exposed White participants to a range of photos of Barack Obama. Cleverly, the researchers darkened or lightened the photos systematically. The task of the participant was to identify which photo reflected Obama\u2019s true skin colour.\nIn both studies, those higher in symbolic racism (i.e., feeling resentment toward Black demands for equality; denial of anti-Black discrimination) selected the darker photos to reflect his true colour, and this was true both before and after each election cycle. Interestingly, those with stronger identification as a Republican supporter also perceived Obama\u2019s skin to be significantly darker, but this latter effect was observed only prior to the election, not after the election.\nThink about that for a minute. Political partisanship predicted \u201chow Black\u201d Obama is, but only in the context of a political race where a Black man might subsequently take or retain power of the White House. In the words of the authors, \u201c\u2026 partisan biases in the perception of skin tone are activated as a function of political intergroup conflict\u201d (p. 149).\nPut simply, Obama\u2019s \u201cblackness\u201d was systematically determined by racial biases of the perceiver, by the political partisanship of the perceiver, and by the temporal proximity of the testing session to an election. These patterns reflect the social construction of race. If Obama were Black or biracial simply as a matter of biological race, we would not see such patterns, whereby his degree of Blackness is a moving target and a topic of debate. Obama is who he is, but people categorize him as more or less Black as a function of their own psychological processing. When the target stands still but his categorization \u201cas X\u201d or \u201cas Y\u201d moves, there is a reasonable conclusion: Categorization is a social construction with psychological roots.\nAnd let\u2019s keep in mind some basic differences between cultures in how they think about race. In the US, one has historically been considered \u201cColoured\u201d (although that term is becoming increasingly disavowed) to the extent that one has Black ancestry.\nIn South Africa, \u201cColoured\u201d refers to someone of mixed White-Black background, not someone of a Black-only background. In South Africa, therefore, Black is Black and Coloured is mixed White-Black. Comparing these countries, it is clear that being \u201cBlack\u201d (or not) varies as a function of social and cultural conventions, not biology.\narticle continues after advertisement\nObama is widely considered as Black in the US, but as Coloured (and higher status) when he steps off of Air Force One in South Africa. Prior to becoming an international symbol and one of the world\u2019s most powerful men, he would have also been treated very differently as a result of being Black (US) or Coloured (South Africa). Again, race is a social construction, where societies generate informal or formal rules about what we see (i.e., perception) and how to act and treat others (i.e., discrimination).\nScientists generally do not recognize races as biologically meaningful. Yet scientists, including me, discuss race and describe the racial composition of our samples.\nTo be clear, I am not advocating that we ignore race. In fact, there are many dangers in ignoring race as a social topic. Race is \u201creal.\" But race is socially real, not biologically real.\nSocially important categories can be very real and meaningful, but arguably nonetheless arbitrary in nature. From a Social Dominance Theory perspective, \u201cthe arbitrary-set system is filled with socially constructed and highly salient groups based on characteristics such as clan, ethnicity, estate, nation, race, caste, social class, religious sect, regional groups, or any other socially relevant group distinction that the human imagination is capable of constructing\u201d (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999, p. 33).\nLike race, nations are arbitrary but real. What we call Belgium is not biologically or essentially Belgium; what is called Belgium is a region that the international community agrees is Belgium. It is socially constructed. It might not have the same boundaries in the future, and it certainly did not in the past. This doesn\u2019t make Belgium unreal. On the contrary, it has very real meaning and is of psychological, political, and legal significance. But humans created it as a concept. Belgium itself has no essence in a biological sense, and race works much the same way.\nAs I\u2019ve argued, the degree to which a person is categorized into a racial category can vary as a function of the social context (e.g., power differentials between groups; temporal proximity to elections), personal factors (e.g., racism in the perceiver; political partisanship in the perceiver), or an interaction between personal and social factors.

Is the child 'half black' and 'half Asian'? What about his children when he marries someone of another 'race'? Sure, there clear differences between really dark Africans and really white Europeans, but what about north-eastern Africa? When do 'black' people become 'Arab'? What about in parts of southern Siberia, where the lines between white and Asian are blurred? You can't define people by skin color it's just senseless. And if race holds no definition beyond skin color and other minor physical alterations, then what substance is there to race? Absolutely none. Black people can get sickle cell and whites can't, but is that really enough of a difference to separate people of skin color into categories(that aren't people who can and people who can't get the disease)? What is the definition of 'race'? I thought it was the Human race. I think the argument that race is a social construction is an answer to the idea that 'black people in America act different than white people'.

He's white, and whites love nothing more than restricting freedom (even though whites invented the idea of freedom, while the rest were either in states of tribalism or dictatorship).\nAnother argument I hear is \"privilege,\" an idea that presumes one race is one person with one, single pre-positioned income and state of living, and the only person of that one race is incapable of making his own future, and instead he must either have money and benefits shoveled at him or money stolen from him depending on his race and his assumed income.\nEither way, both arguments are based on a feeling perspective instead of science, and even scientific arguments arguing against the mainstream are being censored and having labelum thrown at them.

Lusca\nOct 29, 2019\n\u00b7\n9 min read\nRace As A Social Construct\nPhoto by munshots on Unsplash\nAs Ruth Frankenberg in her book The Social Construction of Whiteness: White Women, Race Matters argues, our daily lives are affected by race whether we are aware of it or not. We all see the world through a racial lens that colors our world black, white, Asian, Mexican, minority, or \u201cother\u201d.\nHow we are seen and how we see others affects various domains of our lives and the lives of others; from the types of jobs we have, the amount of money we make, the kind of friends we make, the places we live, the foods we eat, the schools we go to, etc\u2026 The entire social structure we inhabit is affected by at least one social construction, race. Interestingly, most people in the United States (which consist of people of color) are aware of this, but have not dismantled it. Why is that?\nOften times the word social construct is thrown around in various theoretical and general works without ever being defined or discussed. However, understanding what is meant by race as a social construct is vital to understanding the capacity race has to intersect and affect other aspects and domains of life and society, as well as how to dismantle it.\nWhat is a Social Construct?\nA social construct is ontologically subjective but epistemologically objective. It is ontologically subjective in that the construction and continued existence of social constructs are contingent on social groups and their collective agreement, imposition, and acceptance of such constructions (for more on the notion of social constructions see The Construction of Social Reality by John Searle). There is nothing absolute or real about social constructions in the same way as there is something absolute and real about rocks, rivers, mountains, and in general, the objects examined by physics. For example, the existence of a mountain is not contingent on collective acceptance, imposition, or agreement. A mountain will exist regardless of people thinking, agreeing or accepting that it does exist. Unlike a mountain, the existence of race requires that people collectively agree and accept that it does exist. Franz Boas, a physicist by training, supports this view of race best in his work Race, Language, and Culture where he observes that there is nothing biologically real about race. There is nothing that we have identified as race that exists apart from our collective agreement, acceptance, and imposition of its existence.\nRace, although it does not exist in the world in any ontologically objective way, it still is real in society (as opposed to nature). Race is a social construction that has real consequences and effects. These effects, consequences and the notion that race is ontologically subjective is epistemologically objective. We know that race is something that is real in society, and that it shapes the way we see ourselves and others. Many rightly claim that race is conceptually unstable. However, this should not lead us to skepticism about race, i.e. that we cannot have any objective knowledge about race. We can know what race is and how it works regardless of the various shifts in meaning that have occurred through history and occur geographically.\nThe notion of race as a social construct I am proposing is partially captured by various works. In Takaki\u2019s work A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America, race is a social construct produced by the dominant group in society and their power to define. In other words, the dominant group in society imposed the boundaries of group membership by defining race in terms of biology. If you were black, then you were biologically inferior to a white person. Takaki explains that Africans in America were first brought to America as indentured servants. After completing the terms of their servitude they were freed and had the status of free men. The color line at the time had not been drawn. Nonetheless, with the growing population of free Africans in America, fear of losing hegemonic control began to spread through the white population. Due to this, race as a biological concept was developed and used to justify the enslavement of a growing free black population early in U.S. history. This initial biological understanding of race helped draw the color line. The boundaries of group membership were marked by skin color. To this day the primary race indicator is skin color.\nFrankenberg in her work The Social Construction of Whiteness expands on what race indicators and hence race identify today. She simply explains that race is an indicator of difference, but an indicator of what kind of difference she does not say. As we have seen through Boas\u2019s work, there are no biological differences between different \u201craces\u201d. Additionally, race does not identify differences in culture and is always loosely connected to biology. According to Frankenberg culture is unbounded. We cannot conclusively say on the basis of skin color that someone participates in white, or black cultural practices (although many people still do). This notion of unbounded cultural practices is exemplified in Gary Taylor\u2019s piece White Noise: What Eminem Can Tell Us About White America, where he describes a white man (Eminem) in the hip-hop culture. George Lipsitz in his work Lean on Me: Beyond Identity Politics also discusses how Joe Clark, a black man, engages in a form of racism that perpetuates white privilege and supremacy.\nJan Nederveen Pieterse\u2019s work White Negroes, suggests that the difference Frankenberg speaks of is one of status. The meaning of race developed so far with Takaki, Boas, Frankenberg and now Pieterse suggests that race is a marker of status that includes or excludes one from broader social constructs and enables or disables certain powers. Race typically works through race indicators which are used to indicate which race you are, and consequently what sort of status you have in society, e.g. in President Jefferson\u2019s time race indicated a status of slave or slave master. Since race and race indicators are collectively imposed and defined by the dominant group, so is one\u2019s status. Additionally, since race is a social construct and is ontologically subjective, it continues to work only in virtue of collective agreement and acceptance. Many people may object that they are not part of the collective agreement and acceptance I am describing. Nonetheless, as Frankenberg discusses and admits she herself is evidence of, white people are often blind to racism and do not see the privileges they have due to their skin color. Regardless of white people being anti-racist, they participate in a racialized society that privileges them. As Frantz Fanon described in his book Black Skin, White Masks, many individuals may claim they are not racist while tacitly accept the dominant racist ideology by way of reaping the benefits coffered to them.\nLet us summarize what we have said about what race is so far. First, race is a social construct contingent on collective acceptance, agreement, and imposition. Second, race has always been defined by the dominant group in society. Third, race indicates differences in status. The status indicated by which race you are either includes or excludes one from broader social constructs and disables or enables certain powers. To illustrate how this sort of understanding of race works let us look at the United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind case of 1923 and the United States v. Takao Ozawa case of 1922.\nCase Studies\nThind, an Indian American man, filed for citizenship in the U.S. in 1923 and was denied on the basis of his not being white. The U.S. Supreme court found that while Indians were anthropologically categorized as Caucasian, the \u201cunderstanding of the common man\u201d, wrote Justice George Sutherland, \u201cknows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences\u201d. Hence, despite being Caucasian, what many in the past (and almost everyone today) believed to be white, Thind was denied his status as white. The effects of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling retroactively affected all Indians who had already been granted citizenship. In the Takao Ozawa case in 1922, Takao argued that based on scientific evidence, he was white. Nonetheless, Justice Sutherland argued that he was not Caucasian, and hence could not be white, and consequently denied his citizenship. The rulings denying Takao and Thind\u2019s citizenship strengthened anti-Asian sentiment.\nThe above cases demonstrate a profound kind of contradiction. The cases demonstrate a contradiction that was overlooked regardless of how obvious it was. Thind was not granted citizenship because he was not white, regardless of being Caucasian, and Ozawa was denied citizenship for not being Caucasian, despite being white. What allowed for this contradictory position to be maintained was the Supreme Court\u2019s dominant status. The power Takaki describes is evident in the court\u2019s ruling. The common \u201cwhite\u201d man, and his status as dominant allowed him to define the parameters of race, despite contradictions. As a result, Thind and Ozawa were excluded. By being excluded, by way of being denied citizenship, all the various powers enabled by the status of U.S. Citizen were disabled. Such powers included the right to vote, run for political office, and various other legal powers. In addition, other powers that are not as codified or legal, such as access to work unions, certain academic institutions, and certain neighborhoods were also disabled. The effects of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling trickled down and strengthened racist immigration policies, e.g. the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924, as well as affecting the lives of people of color in general.\nRacist Thinking is Not About Skin Color\nThe above contradiction points out how racist thinking has little to do with skin color, and much to do with status, power, and fear. Roediger\u2019s work Working Towards Whiteness exemplifies this point by showing how new immigrants, initially identified as \u201cnot white\u201d but with an in-between status (regardless of having white skin), gained a new status (of white) and consequently- power. As we can see from the above cases and analysis, race is consistently utilized to maintain and control power due to fear of losing power and the current dominant position. Oddly enough, the ideology of white supremacy is inspired and maintained due to fear.\nW.E.B. Du Bois in his work The Souls of White Folk questioned what it is about whiteness, that enables white men to commit crimes and not be condemned. In other words, he questioned why in virtue of being white, does a person have certain powers. With the analysis we have developed so far, we can answer Du Bois\u2019s question. The answer is there is nothing inherent or intrinsic about white skin that enables white men to commit crimes and not be condemned. What enables white men to do so, is the structure of society in which they live. As we have seen, there is nothing ontologically objective about race and intrinsic or inherent in white skin that makes white people dominant. If there was, race would not be as fluid and unstable, and Thind or Ozawa would have been granted citizenship. Race and status are defined by the dominant group in society politically, economically, socio-culturally, and historically. The process of defining is made possible due to collective acceptance, agreement, and imposition. Additionally, the definition produced by the dominant group in society is constituted by collective acceptance, agreement, and imposition.\nFrantz Fanon and his notion of socio-therapy, as developed in Black Skin, White Masks, advises that in order for racism to cease, society must abandon the notion of race. Fanon believed that only after society had realized that race is not real, would it overcome racism. Fanon is logically correct in assuming that racism will end when we no longer see through a racial lens, yet he is wrong in assuming that race is not real and that removing the lens is possible. To illustrate how he is wrong, take for instance Russell Simmons\u2019 position towards homophobia and sexism in hip-hop. Simmons\u2019 position is similar to Fanons. Simmons believes that by eliminating the words \u201cnigger\u201d, \u201cbitch\u201d, and \u201choe\u201d from hip-hop, it will solve the problem of homophobia and sexism within hip-hop culture. This is obviously misdirected because it simply evades the root of the problem. Frankenberg\u2019s notion of power-evasive racist discourse can directly critique both Simmons and Fanon.\nThus far, I have repeatedly said that social constructs are contingent on collective acceptance, agreement, and imposition. It seems only natural to suppose that race will disappear altogether, as Fanon had hoped, once society stops collectively agreeing, accepting, and continuously imposing the notion of race. Nonetheless, this is a na\u00efve supposition. Racism is ingrained not only in the minds of people but in the structure of society itself. Our legal system, our prison system, our educational system, our housing system, and various other aspects of society are all racialized. Take, for example, Roediger\u2019s assessment of the housing market after the Federal Housing Act in the 1930s. Roediger shows how even capitalism\u2013a layer in the foundation of U.S. democracy\u2013is racialized by showing that the value of neighborhoods decreased and increased according to how it was racially organized. The more black people lived in a neighborhood the more the value of homes in that neighborhood would decrease. Abandoning the notion of race is not the solution to racism and white privilege. No matter how much we may attempt to make our legal language and documents racially neutral, race will always remain in the minds of people. Frankenberg\u2019s notion of race cognizance seems to be a more viable and productive option. At the least, we have to come to terms with race, not abandon it but be aware of it and understand it. Nonetheless, the general idea expressed in Fanon\u2019s notion of socio-therapy (change society to cure the patient) seems to be correct. However, the change is not the abandonment of race, but instead, a paradigm shift or a revolution in the way race and differences are understood."}, {"Url": "https://nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/06/16/how-fluid-is-racial-identity/race-and-racial-identity-are-social-constructs", "CluewebURLHash": "9FFEBC9BE9C6F77026F75528511F8FE8", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Race and Racial Identity Are Social Constructs - NYTimes.com", "Snippet": "Race is not biological.

Omi and Winant have both agreed that race is socially constructed in society. Ultimately this means that race is seen differently in different societies and different cultures. Media, politics, school, economy and family helps alter society\u2019s structure of race. In the viewing , also media as well as history seemed to create race by showing how social norms have evolved in different racial groups.\nFor example, \u201cRules shaped by our perception of race in a comprehensively racial society determine the presentation of self, distinction of status, and appropriate modes of conduct\u201d (Omi and Winant 20). In other words, people tend to make their own rules for categorizing racial groups. We humans (usually more powerful ones) have set these arbitrary divisions and then call them real. Race is defined differently within each culture. For example, as explained in the viewing, people in Africa see a person that is white in the United States as black.\nThis because they define their races by socioeconomic status not the color of ones skin. Race is a social construction. And as a social construction, race functions as a source of management that sustains the importance of certain groups and the maintenance of other groups. This concept only becomes reality when people behave in ways that perpetuate subordination. Race should be expressed as a concept but unfortunately people misuse race. Race has now replaced the older concept of culture.\nOrder custom essay Race as a Social Construct with free plagiarism report\nGET ORIGINAL PAPER\nAs a concept race came to be defined by superficial attributes like hair type and skin color. \u201cFilm and television, for example, have been notorious in disseminating images of racial minorities which establish for audiences what people from these groups look like, how they behave and who they are\u201d(Omi and Winant 23). Race is just an idea and or a biological myth. According to the viewing , humans don\u2019t differ much genetically. Actually humans are genetically the most similar species. Why are humans so genetically alike?\nHumans have not existed long enough and have yet to evolve into various subspecies. \u201cRace is indeed a pre-eminently socio-historical concept\u201d (Omi and Winant 21). So race is historically made and not biologically. There is nothing real about race, a social construct, unlike a river which is absolute. A river will escist regardless of people thinking, agreeing or accepting that it does exist. Race requires people to collectively agree that it does exist , unlike a river. Although race does not exist in the world in an objective way, it still is relevant in today\u2019s society.\nIt is obvious that race is real in society and it affects the way we view others as well as ourselves. Race is a social construct that is produced by the superior race and their power to regulate. \u201cThe category of \u2018white\u2019 was subject to challenges brought about by the influx of diverse groups who were not of the same Anglo-Saxonstock as the founding immigrants\u201d (Omi and Winant 24). Frankly, \u2018white\u2019 was the norm, the others were considered an outcast. The dominant group in society are the one whom created restriction for group membership by defining race as a biological factor. White is seen as a \u2018pure\u2019 category\u201d, as stated in the reading (Omi and Winant 21). Those who were \u2018black\u2019 were biologically inferior to a \u2018white\u2019 person. This is how the color line became about. Because of the color line , race was used to justify the captivity of the vastly growing free \u2018black\u2019 population early in United States society. \u201cDifferences in skin color and other obvious physical characteristics supposedly provide visible clues to differences lurking underneath\u201d (Omi and Winant 23).\nThe existence of racial ideology helps create racial sterotypes and myths. For example, in the viewing it was pointed out that American Jews reportedly dominated basketball during the first half of the 1900s. However , now it seems as if African Americans dominate the NBA. Concepts like \u2018Black athletic superiority\u2019 is the belief \u2018black\u2019 people have traits that have been acquired through genetic or een environmental factors. These factors help them excel over all other races in athletic competitions.\nThe theories of racial differences and their possible effect on athletic ability have been noticed since the nineteenth century. More interests were attracted to the subject soon after the 1935 Track Championships, were Jesse Owen\u2019s record breaking performance had shocked white Americans. \u201cTemperament, sexuality, intelligence, athletic ability, aesthetic preferences and so on are presumed to be fixed and discernible from the palpable mark of race\u201d (Omi and Winant 23). The dominant group in society has always defined race which sets every other race inferior.\nRace creates many differences in social status. Status is indicated by race. This can either include or exclude people from more social constructs. This can also prevent or allow certain powers or privileges. Race is a social construct fueled by agreement and acceptance. Throughout history race has been the core of our society. It is vital that people begin to realize that race is and will always be \u201can unstable and \u2018de centered\u2019 complex of social meanings constantly being transformed by political struggle\u201d (Omi and Winant 26).\nThis essay was written by a fellow student.

Chairman of the NAACP. Black dude. (The Walter White Project)\nAndrew Sullivan and Freddie Deboer have two pieces up worth checking out. I disagree with Andrew\u2019s (though I detect some movement in his position.) Freddie\u2019s piece is entitled \u201cPrecisely How Not to Argue About Race and IQ.\u201d He writes:\nThe problem with people who argue for inherent racial inferiority is not that they lie about the results of IQ tests, but that they are credulous about those tests and others like them when they shouldn\u2019t be; that they misunderstand the implications of what those tests would indicate even if they were credible; and that they fail to find the moral, analytic, and political response to questions of race and intelligence.\nI think this is a good point, but I want to expand it. Most of the honest writing I\u2019ve seen on \u201crace and intelligence\u201d focuses on critiquing the idea of \u201cintelligence.\u201d So there\u2019s lot of good literature on whether it can be measured, its relevance in modern society, whether intelligence changes across generations, whether it changes with environment, and what we mean when we say IQ. As Freddie mentions here, I had a mathematician stop past to tell me I needed to stop studying French, and immediately start studying statistics\u2014otherwise I can\u2019t possibly understand this debate.\nIt\u2019s a fair critique. My response is that he should stop studying math and start studying history.\nI am not being flip or coy. If you tell me that you plan to study \u201crace and intelligence\u201d then it is only fair that I ask you, \u201cWhat do you mean by race?\u201d It\u2019s true I don\u2019t always do math so well, but I understand the need to define the terms of your study. If you\u2019re a math guy, perhaps your instinct is to point out the problems in the interpretation of the data. My instinct is to point out that your entire experiment proceeds from a basic flaw\u2014 no coherent, fixed definition of race actually exists.\nThe history bears this out. In 1856, Ralph Waldo Emerson delineated the significance of race:\nIt is race, is it not, that puts the hundred millions of India under the dominion of a remote island in the north of Europe. Race avails much, if that be true, which is alleged, that all Celts are Catholics, and all Saxons are Protestants; that Celts love unity of power, and Saxons the representative principle. Race is a controlling influence in the Jew, who, for two millenniums, under every climate, has preserved the same character and employments. Race in the negro is of appalling importance. The French in Canada, cut off from all intercourse with the parent people, have held their national traits. I chanced to read Tacitus \u201con the Manners of the Germans,\u201d not long since, in Missouri, and the heart of Illinois, and I found abundant points of resemblance between the Germans of the Hercynian forest, and our Hoosiers, Suckers, and Badgers of the American woods.\nIndeed, Emerson in 1835, saw race as central to American greatness:\nThe inhabitants of the United States, especially of the Northern portion, are descended from the people of England and have inherited the traits of their national character \u2026 It is common with the Franks to break their faith and laugh at it The race of Franks is faithless.\nEmerson was not alone, as historian James McPherson points out. Southerners thought of themselves not only as a race separate from blacks, but as a race apart from Northern whites:\nThe South\u2019s leading writer on political economy, James B. D. De Bow, subscribed to this Norman-Cavalier thesis and helped to popularize it in De Bow\u2019s Review. As the lower-South states seceded one after another during the winter of 1860-61, this influential journal carried several long articles justifying secession on the grounds of irreconcilable ethnic differences between Southern and Northern whites. \u201cThe Cavaliers, Jacobites, and Huguenots, who settled the South, naturally hate, contemn, and despise the Puritans who settled the North,\u201d proclaimed one of these articles. \u201cThe former are a master-race; the latter a slave race, the descendants of Saxon serfs.\u201d The South was now achieving its \u201cindependent destiny\u201d by repudiating the failed experiment of civic nationalism that had foolishly tried in 1789 to \u201cerect one nation out of two irreconcilable peoples.\u201d\nSimilarly, in 1899 William Z. Ripley wrote The Races of Europe, which sought to delineate racial difference through head-type:\nThe shape of the human head by which we mean the general proportions of length, breadth, and height, irrespective of the \u201c bumps \u201d of the phrenologist is one of the best available tests of race known. Its value is, at the same time, but imperfectly appreciated beyond the inner circle of professional anthropology. Yet it is so simple a phenomenon, both in principle and in practical application, that it may readily be of use to the traveller and the not too superficial observer of men.\nTo be sure, widespread and constant peculiarities of head form are less noticeable in America, because of the extreme variability of our population, compounded as it is of all the races of Europe; they seem also to be less fundamental among the American aborigines. But in the Old World the observant traveller may with a little attention often detect the racial affinity of a people by this means.\nTwo years later, Edward A. Ross sought to apprehend \u201c The Causes of Race Superiority .\u201d He saw the differences between the Arab \u201crace\u201d and the Jewish \u201crace\u201d as a central illustration:\nIt is certain that races differ in their attitude toward past and future. M. Lapie has drawn a contrast between the Arab and the Jew. The Arab remembers; he is mindful of past favors and past injuries. He harbors his vengeance and cherishes his gratitude. He accepts everything on the authority of tradition, loves the ways of his ancestors, forms strong local attachments, and migrates little. The Jew, on the other hand, turns his face toward the future. He is thrifty and always ready for a good stroke of business, will, indeed, join with his worst enemy if it pays. He is calculating, enterprising, migrant and ambitious\nYou can see more of this here.\nOur notion of what constitutes \u201cwhite\u201d and what constitutes \u201cblack\u201d is a product of social context. It is utterly impossible to look at the delineation of a \u201cSouthern race\u201d and not see the Civil War, the creation of an \u201cIrish race\u201d and not think of Cromwell\u2019s ethnic cleansing, the creation of a \u201cJewish race\u201d and not see anti-Semitism. There is no fixed sense of \u201cwhiteness\u201d or \u201cblackness,\u201d not even today. It is quite common for whites to point out that Barack Obama isn\u2019t really \u201cblack\u201d but \u201chalf-white.\u201d One wonders if they would say this if Barack Obama were a notorious drug lord.\nWhen the liberal says \u201crace is a social construct,\u201d he is not being a soft-headed dolt; he is speaking a historical truth. We do not go around testing the \u201cIrish race\u201d for intelligence or the \u201cSouthern race\u201d for \u201chot-headedness.\u201d These reasons are social. It is no more legitimate to ask \u201cIs the black race dumber than then white race?\u201d than it is to ask \u201cIs the Jewish race thriftier than the Arab race?\u201d\nThe strongest argument for \u201crace\u201d is that people who trace their ancestry back to Europe, and people who trace most of their ancestry back to sub-Saharan Africa, and people who trace most of their ancestry back to Asia, and people who trace their ancestry back to the early Americas, lived isolated from each other for long periods and have evolved different physical traits (curly hair, lighter skin, etc.)\nBut this theoretical definition (already fuzzy) wilts under human agency, in a real world where Kevin Garnett, Harold Ford, and Halle Berry all check \u201cblack\u201d on the census. (Same deal for \u201cHispanic.\u201d) The reasons for that take us right back to the fact of race as a social construct. And an American-centered social construct. Are the Ainu of Japan a race? Should we delineate darker South Asians from lighter South Asians on the basis of race? Did the Japanese who invaded China consider the Chinese the same \u201crace\u201d?\nAndrew writes that liberals should stop saying \u201ctruly stupid things like race has no biological element.\u201d I agree. Race clearly has a biological element\u2014 because we have awarded it one. Race is no more dependent on skin color today than it was on \u201cFrankishness\u201d in Emerson\u2019s day. Over history, race has taken geography, language, and vague impressions as its basis.\n\u201cRace,\u201d writes the great historian Nell Irvin Painter, \u201cis an idea, not a fact.\u201d Indeed. Race does not need biology. Race only requires some good guys with big guns looking for a reason.\nTa-Nehisi Coates is a former national correspondent for The Atlantic.

Race has been documented as a concept developed in the 18th century to divide humans into groups often based on physical appearance, social, and cultural backgrounds. Race has been used historically to establish a social hierarchy and to enslave humans. Racial groups have no defined boundaries, but have a blurry and imprecise relationship with human genetic variation and population groups across the world.

(pdf)\nThe main problem facing us as students of race and racism is how to understand what we mean by race. There have been many efforts made to discredit race on the basis that it is outdated and dangerous pseudo-science, what Barbara and Karen Fields call a system based on \u2018folk thought\u2019 (Fields and Fields 2012, p. 6). However, as has been pointed out by scholars of race, beginning with the prescient work of W.E.B. Du Bois in the early 20th century (Du Bois 1903), merely disregarding race because it is not based in scientific fact, does little to eliminate the force that it continues to have in societies that have been marked by colonialism, slavery, and regimes of the border. In Dusk of Dawn Du Bois\u00a0called race a \u2018badge.\u2019 This badge is the one that all those who \u2018have suffered a long disaster and have one long memory\u2019 are forced to wear.\u00a0It is a result of the common memory of those who have shared experiences or who carry forth memories of \u2018discrimination and insult.\u2019 Those experiences and memories, for Du Bois, were of slavery, but racism in all contexts engenders similar \u2018kinships\u2019 which Du Bois insists are not biological but social: \u2018the physical bond is least and the badge of color relatively unimportant save as a badge.\u2019\nThe point to stress at the outset is that we cannot get rid of race as an analytical tool. To say this does not mean agreeing with the idea that human beings are organized according to racial groupings that are grounded in genetic differences between people that map onto our appearance. However, as a race scholar, I am struck by the fact\u00a0that, despite the many efforts by social scientists to\u00a0debunk race, it continues to make sense to so many people.\nFields and Fields, for example, remark on the fact that it is quite normal to hear people in the United States talk about blood as a measure of difference.\u00a0For example, Barack Obama was regularly pilloried for identifying as Black because having a White mother supposedly made him equally Black and White. Fields and Fields remark that it is utterly impossible to talk about blood quantum because obviously, being a liquid, blood cannot be separated into parts. However, this does not change the fact that not only do we talk about bloods as separable, but the quantification of different blood \u2018parts\u2019 was the basis for laws governing Indigenous populations in colonized countries, such as Australia and the US, as well as the infamous one-drop rule in the US, and the Nazi regime\u2019s assessment of the degree of Jewishness.\nSo, race broadly makes sense to people (despite making no sense) especially in countries where it has been\u00a0so central to how society and the economy are organized. Even when the language of genetic difference is not used, the fact that we see certain people occupying certain positions (e.g. low paid workers in cleaning, care work, security, food preparation and delivery, fruit picking, etc.) and that those people map onto groups that traditionally have been racialized as inferior creates an association between social location and racial\u00a0hierarchy. These associations are made even by those who do not think that there is anything intrinsic to the genetic makeup of Black women, for example, that means that they are more likely to be pushing a pram on behalf of a white CEO than be the CEO.\nFor many, it would be more correct to think about these social facts as more descriptive of differences in social class than race. However, as\u00a0race scholars and antiracists have argued, we cannot dissociate class from race. As Stuart Hall wrote in response to the Marxist argument that class analyses should trump race-based ones,\u00a0\u2018the structures\u00a0through which black labour is reproduced [\u2026]\u00a0are not simply \u201ccoloured\u201d by race; they work\u00a0through race\u2019 (Hall 1980: 340). In other words, race is structured into our understanding of why particular people occupy certain\u00a0positions in society and experience the world around them as they do. Having a race-based analysis of social relations opens us up to the understanding of why we cannot view the world from one perspective alone.\nThe dominance of white perspectives in Euro-American-Australasian societies not only perpetuates the view that the way in which white people experience the world can be generalized to everyone, but it also disqualifies racialized people\u2019s narration of their own experience. Aboriginal, Muslim, or Black workers, for example,\u00a0might certainly experience workplace exploitation as\u00a0workers, but their experience of work is also shaped by how they are perceived as Aboriginal, Muslim or Black, which, in a society such as Australia which has been founded on colonial dispossession and foundational whiteness, cannot be dissociated from their place in the labour market.\nRace as a social construct\nThe view of race as social rather than biological has been at the heart of sociological and anthropological studies of race since W.E.B. Du Bois. The social constructionist approach was fortified in the immediate post-war era when race was officially discredited as wrongheaded science by many academics.But the discrediting of race did not get rid of the problem of the need to have a language to describe the differences between human beings. The replacement of the language of race by that of culture has done little to overcome the fact that we still operate with totalizing ideas about human difference that draw connections between\u00a0variations among\u00a0groups in the human population (geographical location, skin colour, nationality, religion, ethnicity, etc.)\u00a0and supposedly innate abilities or destinies (intelligence, strength, prowess in sport, etc).\nThe orthodoxy in the social sciences is that race is socially constructed, has no basis in biological fact, but that it nonetheless has social meaning. Nonetheless, as has been observed by a number of commentators \u2013 most prominently Stuart Hall \u2013 saying that race is a social construction may not be as helpful as we would like to think. Barnor Hesse sums the problem up well when he asks, what is race the social construction of?\nThe usual answer to the question is, \u2018race is a construction of the idea that there is a biological racial hierarchy.\u2019 However, this does not answer the question, \u2018what is race?\u2019 \u2018In effect,\u2019 Hesse remarks, \u2018social constructionists do not have anything to say about race that is not already said by the biological discourses.\u2019 Hence, in his view, the social constructivist position does little more than to shore up the pseudoscience of biological racial discourse; the biological sciences\u2014the human genome project in particular\u2014have done more than social scientists to disprove the idea of race.\nHesse cites Ian Hacking\u2019s The Social Construction of What? in which he shows that social constructivist critiques usually contain three elements: that the thing being socially constructed is neither natural nor inevitable, that it is undesirable, and that it can be changed. Hesse argues that, to resolve the tautology posed by the formulation, \u2018race is a social construction of the idea of biological race,\u2019 we need an alternative account of race that goes beyond this circularity because \u2018our account of race as a social fact cannot be the same as the very thing we\u2019re discrediting.\u2019 So, race understood materially, for Hesse, is not socially constructed, but \u2018colonially assembled over a period of time.\u2019 Hesse explains that the assemblage of race over the past 500 years involves the constitution of Europeanness and non-Europeanness which, in some but not all instances, maps onto whiteness and non-whiteness. What is clear, he says, is that there is no way of reducing these divides to only the \u2018bodily or the biological.\u2019\nSo race acts as a way of summarizing the differences between populations from different parts of the world. But it is useless to think about it only as an idea; it comes into force as a practice, as a mechanism for sifting and classifying the world, declaring parts of it Terra Nullius (land without people) and placing\u00a0the populations living there outside the realms of humanity in the aim of colonial domination. Nonetheless, much of the debate about whether race is socially constructed or a biological fact in the social sciences\u00a0does not take into account the function of race in the\u00a0colonial context. Many of the discussions focus on whether or not race exists rather than on what race does, but the very discussion about whether or not race is really descriptive of differences between human groups exists because of the power of race to arrange and structure our understanding of the relationship between the different parts of the world and its people since the invasion of the Americas: a vicious circle.\nSo, we need better discussions of race, ones that are more historically grounded and that take us beyond the race as a social construction argument.\nThe problem is that because race-thinking has been put to such genocidal ends, there has been confusion between opposing racism and observing\u00a0difference. The observable fact is that there are differences between groups of people from different geographical locations across the world. The problem that race-thinking produces is\u00a0a) that they are conceptualized by white Europeans in reference to themselves; in other words, racial schema are always thought about in terms of difference from whiteness. So, in the context of expanding European power on the global stage in the 16th century, this cannot be neutral; b) because of this reference to whiteness, race evolved as a hierarchical scheme, with whites placing themselves at the top. So, observing differences between human beings is not the same as\u00a0being racist. Indeed, it can be quite problematic when you refuse to notice the differences between people, because this leads to a colourblind approach where everyone is treated as though they all had the same experiences and opportunities when in fact we know that this is not the case.\nWhy is race even still discussed? As Jonathan Marks writes in his blog post, \u2018A Rant on Race\u00a0and Genetics \u2018, The discovery that people in different places are different is a trivial one. At issue is the pattern of those differences and its relation to the classification of the human species.\u00a0To equate the existence of between-group variation to the existence of human races is to miss the point of race entirely.\u00a0 Race is not difference; race is meaningful difference.\nSo, what do we mean by meaningful difference? As Marks again says, \u2018at issue is\u00a0(cultural) decision about how much difference and what kinds of difference \u201ccount\u201d in deciding that this kind of a person is categorically different from that kind of a person.\u2019 In other words, we make differences in skin colour or\u00a0religious\u00a0practices mean something. The meaning that race gives is the association between appearance or religious practice, in these two cases, and a natural, recurring and transferable destiny that is said to be written into the very genetics of those we have categorized as race X or Y.\nJason Antrosio in his discussion of the limits of the idea of race as a social construction, points out that the biggest problem facing those of us who are opposed to the consequences of race is that, \u2018the most basic issues are ones of power and inequality that have not budged a bit (or worsened) since race was originally debunked as a biological-genetic category.\u2019 So, he asks, we have to judge\u00a0\u2018race as a\u00a0social construction\u2019 on the merits of whether or not it has been successful in \u2018budging\u2019 power and inequality; the answer for him is unequivocally, it has not. A principal reason for this is that race as a social construction is amenable to being a talking point for the Right. He writes that focusing our arguments on whether race is or is not about biology is meaningless outside of academia because \u2018underlying socioeconomic structural racism is unaltered.\u2019\nBecause I am a sociologist, and an antiracist, I am a lot less interested in the\u00a0minutiae of the arguments about race and genetics, and a lot more interested in the political implications.\nAn article by Clarence Gravlee, \u2018How race becomes biology: Embodiment of social inequality,\u2019 helps us to understand why debates about whether race is social or biological are largely using the wrong terminology. Gravlee writes that much of the problem of dealing with the persistence of race in societies, such as the US with which he is concerned, is because they constantly turn on the question, \u2018does race exist?\u2019 This leads to interminable debates about whether race has a basis in biology. In actual fact, we should be asking,\u00a0\u2018in what ways race exists as a sociocultural phenomenon\u00a0that has force in people\u2019s lives\u2014one with biological\u00a0consequences.\u2019 So, race is not biology but it may become biology. What does this mean?\nGravelee begins with defining race as \u2018\u2018a culturally structured, systematic\u00a0way of looking at, perceiving, and interpreting\u2019 reality (Smedly 2007). Race, also \u2019emerged from unique material circumstances\u00a0in English North America (Harris, 1964), and\u00a0racism remains embedded in social, political, and economic\u00a0structures in the United States (Feagin, 2006)\u2019 (Gravelee 2009: 48).\nGravlee explains that discussions about race and biology vs. culture operate on a confusion between genetics and biology. He illustrates this by turning to the biomedical research literature which, driven as it is by US-based scientists, often operates on the basis of there being an equivalence between the prevalence\u00a0of certain diseases among particular racial groups and \u2018underlying genetic makeup\u2019.\nGravlee proposes that we are faced with three challenges if we want to refute the reduction of genetics to biological race and go beyond repeating\u00a0that race is merely a social construct and give this statement some meaning.\nFirst, it is necessary to show why recent population genetic studies do not actually refute the claim that race does not account for \u2018global human genetic diversity\u2019 (Gravlee, p. 49-50). \u00a0Second, we need to look more seriously at the \u2018complex, environmental influences on\u00a0human biology\u2019 (ibid. p. 50).\u00a0Third, we need to return to the \u2018conventional\u00a0view of race as a cultural construct to stimulate\u00a0new research on the sociocultural dimensions of\u00a0race and racism\u2019 (ibid.).\nOn the first point, current evidence from population genetics, while demonstrating that there are more similarities than differences between groups traditionally defined as races, and that existing genetic variation does not map neatly onto these racial groups, they still allow for some degree of variation between them. This opens the door to those who want to retain race as a useful way of thinking about human genetic variation. The important point made by Gravlee is that saying that it is possible to identify clusters within the human population that can be mapped onto \u2018races\u2019 does not mean that these clusters are naturally occurring as racial theory implies. He also points out that more or less clusters have been identified by different people over time, further proving that there is nothing natural about identifying these clusters.\nAt this point, it is useful to pause and think about why it would be useful for some researchers to continue to use race as a way of distinguishing between groups in the population. There are several reasons. But a major one, identified also by Gravlee, is the utility of this approach to the biomedical profession. Fields and Fields discuss this in their book Racecraft when they write about\u00a0the ways in which diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, are presented as \u2018black diseases\u2019. They argue that this is underpinned by \u2018folk\u2019 assumptions about the particularities of \u2018black blood\u2019, because sickle cell disease, as defined in the 1972 Sickle Cell Control Act brought into effect in the US under Richard Nixon,\u00a0is \u2018an inherited blood disorder\u2019\u00a0(Fields and Fields 2012). Because of the aforementioned popular confusion between race, genetics and blood, this entered into the public consciousness through the tacit endorsement of scientists despite the fact that sickle cell anemia also affects groups who are not Black, often leading to their misdiagnosis.\nThe point is that it can be highly profitable to\u00a0suggest that groups designated as races suffer from particular diseases or suffer from then in particular ways based on a problematic connection drawn between race and genetics, and an even more problematic assumption that different \u2018races\u2019 have different kinds of blood!\nThe point according to Gravlee is that refuting the existence of race is not the same as saying that there is no such thing as human biodiversity. Furthermore, different groups in the population \u2013 traditionally thought of as races \u2013 do\u00a0suffer from diseases differently and may have higher prevalence of certain diseases than others. Gravlee\u2019s position is summarized by the statement, race is not biology, but race becomes biology. In other words, the very real fact that ideas of race produce inequities between racialized groups means that people, such as Aboriginal people in Australia or Black people in the US, get sick. Racism literally can make you sick. So, there is a biological effect of racism on the body, and moreover, this can be transmitted through the generations. So, to be clear, Black or Aboriginal people do not start off with a genetic predisposition to getting a particular disease which can be seen in generation after generation since time immemorial, as those who stick to their belief in \u2018race=genetics\u2019 would have it, rather the effects of\u00a0colonization, slavery and the resultant inequality and discrimination can begin to make generation after generation sick.\nAs Gravlee points out, the discrediting of race, particularly in anthropology, led to a silence about race. This has done us a disservice in our efforts to understand the continuing use of race and how to dismantle it. Gravlee makes two suggestions for his discipline of anthropology. First, we need to stop denying\u00a0human biological diversity.\nThe point is what do we do with the knowledge of this diversity. The diversity is not the problem, as such; the problem is the persistence of white supremacy based on the belief that this diversity is unequal. We cannot discuss diversity neutrally because it has itself become imbued with racial meaning.\nGravlee returns to the point that saying race is a cultural construct does not make it any less real. We should turn our attention to how it is made real; in other words to the uncomfortable truth that race is real because it has been endowed with meaning that has real effects in people\u2019s lives.\nI would argue that the sociology of race has always been focused on demonstrating how race is made real by examining its effects from a variety of perspectives with a central focus on the reproduction of race in institutions. However, within race theory, the question of whether race is\u00a0biological or cultural and the connected discussion of the social construction of race has sometimes hindered a fuller exploration of the question of why race persists to undergird so many of\u00a0the social, economic, cultural and political structures of colonial and former colonizing societies.\nGo to the Beyond hate crime: Perspectives on racism in Ireland main page\nDr Alana Lentin is an antiracist\u00a0race critical scholar.

These allegations stayed in the national news for the better part of a decade. Hapless day care workers were falsely convicted of running sex rings. Evidence of their guilt was manufactured as necessary. In hindsight, this episode looks absurd. How could anyone have believed that there were Satanic day care centers throughout the country? Yet at the time, many reasonable people were swept up in the delusion\u2014as were the prosecutors and elected officials who promised to put a stop to the fake problem. Such is the nature of moral panics. What looks like obvious absurdity from the outside seems totally reasonable to those on the inside.\nSome moral panics are mysterious in origin. Others are the product of specific ideas. Since about 2014, we have been facing a new moral panic surrounding race, gender, and sexuality. Unlike Satanic day cares, this one is not a complete fabrication. Bigotry is real. Yet the public perception of bigotry has surpassed the reality to such an extent that it has become a moral panic. White supremacy is said to be rampant. Black people should fear for their lives when going for a jog, one New York Times op-ed argued.\nYet as political scientist Eric Kaufmann lays out in this paper, the public has a mistaken perception of how much racism exists in America today. This misperception is not only driven by cognitive biases such as the availability heuristic, it is also driven by ideas. Critical race theory and intersectionality\u2014formerly confined to graduate seminars\u2014have seeped into corporate America and Silicon Valley, as well as into many K\u201312 education systems. With their spread has come an increase in the misperception that bigotry is everywhere, even as the data tell a different story: racism exists, but there has never been less racism than there is now.\nIf America\u2019s racial tensions ever heal, it will be because we were able to align our perceptions with our reality and leave moral panics at the door.\nExecutive Summary\nThis paper begins with a version of Tocqueville\u2019s paradox:[ 1] at a time when measures of racist attitudes and behavior have never been more positive, pessimism about racism and race relations has increased in America.\nWhy? An analysis of a wide variety of data sources, including several new surveys that I conducted, suggests that the paradox is best explained by changes in perceptions of racism rather than an increase in the frequency of racist incidents. That is, ideology, partisanship, social media, and education have inclined Americans to \u201csee\u201d more bigotry and more racial prejudice than they previously did. This is true not only regarding the level of racism in society but even of their personal experiences. My survey findings suggest that an important part of the reported experience of racism is ideologically malleable. Reports of increased levels of racism during the Trump era, for example, likely reflect perception rather than reality\u2014just as people have almost always reported rising violent crime when it has been declining during most of the past 25 years. In addition, people who say that they are sad or anxious at least half the time, whether white or black, are about twice as likely as others to say that they have experienced racism and discrimination.\nNone of this means that racism is an imaginary problem. However, efforts to reduce it should be based on strong empirical evidence and bias-free measures. The risks of overlooking racism are clear: injustice is permitted to persist and grow. Yet there are also clear dangers in overstating its presence. These go well beyond majority resentment and polarization. A media-generated narrative about systemic racism distorts people\u2019s perceptions of reality and may even damage African-Americans\u2019 sense of control over their lives.\nKey Findings Include:\nEight in 10 African-American survey respondents believe that young black men are more likely to be shot to death by the police than to die in a traffic accident; one in 10 disagrees. Among a highly educated sample of liberal whites, more than six in 10 agreed. In reality, considerably more young African-American men die in car accidents than are shot to death by police.\n\u2014Ideology, not education, influences the extent to which people are incorrect on police shootings and traffic accidents.\n\u2014Black Trump voters are almost 30 points more likely to get the question right than black Biden voters.\n\u2014Conservative whites are almost 50 points more likely to get it right than liberal whites.\n\u2014African-Americans who strongly agree that white Republicans are racist are 40 points more likely to get the question wrong than those who strongly disagree that white Republicans are racist.\nBlack Biden voters are twice as likely as black Trump voters to say that they personally experienced more racism under Trump than under Obama. Black Trump voters reported a consistent level of racism under both administrations. Black respondents who strongly agree that white Republicans are racist are 20\u201330 points more likely to say that they experience various personal forms of racism than African-Americans who strongly disagree that white Republicans are racist.\nReading a passage from critical race theory author Ta-Nehisi Coates results in a significant 15-point drop in black respondents\u2019 belief that they have control over their lives.\nA slight majority of African-Americans and whites overall felt that political correctness on race is demeaning to black people rather than necessary to protect them. Among blacks, the difference between liberals and conservatives was 3 points (51% of the liberals thought it was demeaning vs. 54% of the conservatives). Among whites, however, there was a nearly 20-point divide between liberals and conservatives (43% of the liberals thought it was demeaning vs. 62% of the conservatives).\nLiberal African-Americans with a college degree are nearly 30 points more likely to find a statement by a white person such as \u201cI don\u2019t notice people\u2019s race\u201d or \u201cAmerica is a colorblind society\u201d offensive than African-Americans without degrees who identify as conservative. Among whites, the gap between liberals and conservatives is 50 points.\nWhen asked to choose between a future in which racially offensive remarks were so heavily punished as to be nonexistent and one where minorities were so confident that they no longer felt concerned about racial insults, black respondents overall preferred, by a 53%\u201347% margin, the resilience option. White liberals preferred the punitive option, by a 71%\u201329% margin; black liberals chose the second option by just 6 points, 53%\u201347%.\nIn general, African-Americans\u2019 opinion on race issues appears to be less affected by ideology and partisanship than white opinion. In a 2015 Pew survey, 20 points separated \u201cvery conservative\u201d and \u201cvery liberal\u201d African- Americans on whether racism is a very big problem. The gap between \u201cvery conservative\u201d and \u201cvery liberal\u201d whites was 65 points; the gap between \u201cvery conservative\u201d and \u201cvery liberal\u201d Hispanics and Asians was 40 points.\nExposure to social media and other media appears to be related to survey respondents\u2019 views of both the national prevalence of racism and their personal experience of it.\nDOWNLOAD PDF\nIntroduction\nIs racism real or is it, to some significant degree, socially constructed? While it is important to be skeptical of social scientists who overstate the malleability of categories like race, there is no question that perception does play a role in how people view social reality. This paper uses survey data to make the case that racism in America lies, in significant measure, in the eyes of the beholder. This not only concerns people\u2019s perceptions of the prevalence of racism in society but even of their personal experience.\nIn their landmark work, The Social Construction of Reality, Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann argued that the dominant ideology in society shapes the way people think about the social world, defining roles, norms, and expectations. Ideology is central to the social constructionist argument, defining right and wrong, and what constitutes a violation of moral \u201creality\u201d; that is, the norms and social facts everyone \u201cknows\u201d to be true (even if they are not based on objective truth).[ 2]\nThe dominant ideology in today\u2019s cultural institutions is what I have elsewhere termed left-modernism, a hybrid worldview that applies socialist theories of conflict to identity categories first developed by liberalism.[ 3] From liberalism comes the idea that majorities are often tyrannical while racial, religious, gender, or sexual minorities require protection. From socialism comes the notion that society is best understood as a struggle between oppressive and oppressed groups. Freudianism, with its focus on the subjective, has also shaped left-modernism through its focus on psychological sensitivity, which has fused with left-modernism\u2019s outlook to produce demands not only for material but for therapeutic equality and safety.\nReligions typically concentrate on a handful of totemic issues. For example, conservative Christian politics has, over time, focused on causes such as restricting the sale of alcohol, the teaching of evolution, or the provision of abortion. Left-modernism is instead centered around a trinity of totemic categories: race, gender, and sexuality. Race stands at the apex of the system, producing what John McWhorter concludes is a religion of antiracism.[ 4] For Jonathan Haidt, the sacralization of race, sexuality, and gender lies at the heart of the progressive worldview.[ 5] This means that it becomes difficult to objectively assess the scientific validity of claims made about disadvantaged identity groups, lest one transgress the sacred values of the ideology and even be perceived as having committed an act of blasphemy.\nMoreover, racism itself is not a fixed term. While expanding the range of phenomena covered by a term like racism can make sense in some circumstances, we are arguably well past that point.\nGiven the prevalence of left-modernism in the elite institutions of society\u2014universities, much of the media, large corporations, and foundations\u2014there has been considerable cultural distortion in the definition of racism. Psychologist Nick Haslam calls the expanding meaning of clinical terms \u201cconcept creep,\u201d which applies also to concepts such as bullying, abuse, trauma, and mental disorder. Left-modernism\u2019s therapeutic ethos, combined with the centrality of race in its pantheon of sacred values, helps explain this \u201cconceptual stretching\u201d of racism.[ 6] For the writer Coleman Hughes, expanding the meaning of racism is part of an ideological project that seeks to heighten minority threat perceptions to underpin claims of harm that can justify silencing.[ 7] The endpoint of this logic is to criminalize such dissent as \u201chate.\u201d[ 8]\nThe Media and Public Perception of Racism\nIt is well known that the media, with their ability to frame events and social trends, have an impact on public opinion. This is especially the case when it comes to the visibility and political prominence of certain issues, what political scientists call issue \u201csalience.\u201d For example, there is a close relationship in Europe between media coverage of immigration and salience\u2014the number of people saying that immigration is the most important issue facing their country.\nThe same appears to be true for race. Gallup data show that the civil rights era of the 1950s and early 1960s, as well as the race riots in the late 1960s, saw the public salience of race spike (Figure 1 ). The public salience of race then remained muted until 1992, when the Los Angeles riots, in the wake of Rodney King\u2019s beating, sent questions of race to the top of 15% of the public\u2019s priority lists. Since 2014, a series of events (including the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown by a police officer; and the election of Donald Trump) pushed the race issue above 10% salience. In 2020, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the George Floyd/Black Lives Matter protests elevated race back to the top spot: it was named as the leading concern by nearly 20% of the public in mid-June 2020.\u00a0This was the highest salience level recorded for race since the late 1960s, eclipsing the Rodney King spike.\nSource: Frank Newport, \u201c Race Relations as the Nation\u2019s Most Important Problem ,\u201d Gallup, June 19, 2020\nMedia events affect the prominence of issues of race and racism in the public consciousness, but they also shape how people evaluate the quality of race relations. Other Gallup data show that during 2001\u201314, nearly 70% of Americans said that relations between whites and blacks were good. After the Ferguson protests, this fell to 47%, hovered in the low 50s between 2015 and 2019, and has since tumbled to 44% following the BLM protests (Figure 2 ).\nSource: Lydia Saad, \u201c U.S. Perceptions of White\u2013Black Relations Sink to New Low ,\u201d Gallup, Sept. 2, 2020\nThe Decline of Racist Attitudes\nThe increasing pessimism over race relations stands in contrast to the steady, long-term liberalization among white Americans across a range of racial attitudes measured in the leading General Social Survey (GSS) since 1972. In the 1970s, for example, nearly 60% of white Americans agreed with the statement that blacks shouldn\u2019t \u201cpush themselves where they\u2019re not wanted.\u201d This response had declined to 20% by 2002, when the question was discontinued. The share of white Americans who agree that it is permissible to racially discriminate when selling a home declined from 60% as late as 1980 to 28% by 2012.[ 9]\nApproval of black\u2013white intermarriage rose among whites from around 4% in 1958 to 45% in 1995 and 84% in 2013, according to Gallup.[ 10] In 2017, fewer than 10% of whites in a major Pew survey said that interracial marriage was a \u201cbad thing,\u201d[ 11] and, as Figure 3 shows, few now oppose a relative marrying someone of a different race. The actual share of intermarried newlyweds rose from 3% in 1967 to 17% in 2015.[ 12]\nFor decades, American National Election Studies (ANES) posed a question of whether minorities/ blacks should help themselves or whether the government should help them more. There was a gradual rise in support for government assistance to blacks during 1970\u20132016 of about a half-point on a seven-point scale.[ 13] Meanwhile, police killings of African-Americans declined by 60%\u201380% from the late 1960s to the early 2000s and have remained at this level ever since.[ 14 ]\u00a0Racist attitudes and behaviors have sharply declined, though the problem has not been eradicated.\nThe Racism Paradox\nThe increasingly sour national mood on race relations in the U.S. may likely be related to the higher salience of race since the 2014 Ferguson protests. While it is too early to be definitive, the emergence and rapid spread of social media may account for this. Combined with smartphone citizen journalism, social media mean that knowledge of white-police-on-black-suspect violence is more likely to circulate widely, where it can ignite riots and boost the salience of the race question. Thus, even as the number of such incidents is declining, each event is more likely to be captured alive and to possess a higher media multiplier effect.\nEvidence that social media may be shaping perceptions of racism is provided in Figure 4, which shows that black respondents on social media in 2016 were considerably more likely to report experiencing discrimination than those not on social media. This is a statistically significant effect that holds when controlling for age, education, income, partisanship, ideology, gender, and contact with whites. On questions about whether black people have experienced people acting suspicious of them or thinking that they are not smart, the gap between those on social media and those not on it reaches as high as 20 points.\nPeople who care passionately about an issue (or see it flagged in the media) tend to overestimate its prevalence. For example, Americans and Europeans routinely overestimate the population shares of minorities, immigrants, and Muslims while underestimating the white share. In France, the average person in 2016 thought that the country was 31% Muslim; the correct answer was 7.5%. In the U.S. and Canada, the same survey shows that people estimated their countries to be 17% Muslim, compared with the actual 1% and 3%, respectively. Anti-immigration whites overestimate more than liberal whites.[ 15] Meanwhile, minorities tend to overestimate their share of the population more than whites do because they extrapolate from their locale to the nation. Black respondents in a 2005 survey said that the U.S. was 38% black rather than the actual 12%, and Hispanics said that the country was 39% Hispanic rather than 13%.[ 16]\nIn terms of racial discrimination, a 2019 study asked people how many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s a black person would have to send out to get a callback from an employer if a white applicant gets one callback for every 10 applications. It found that Democrats thought that a black person would have to send 26 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to get one callback, while Republicans said 17. The correct answer was 15. Overall, blacks were not significantly more likely than whites to overestimate discrimination: partisanship, rather than race, is what apparently led to misperceptions.[ 17]\nPerceptions about trends over time are somewhat more accurate. In Western Europe, for example, concern about immigration is connected to actual immigration levels over time and tends to rise when inflows are high.[ 18] But this is not always the case. In the U.S., crime rates were flat between 1989 and the mid-1990s, and then fell every year until 2019. Unmoved, a majority of Americans in every year but two since 1989 said that crime had risen over the past year. In 2019, 64% of Americans said that crime had risen in the previous year, even though it had actually continued its gradual post-1990s decline.[ 19] Emotive issues that feature in the news affect people\u2019s perceptions of the size of a problem.\nThe Great Awokening\nVideos of interracial violence circulate on social media; yet this has not led to noticeably cooler feelings between America\u2019s racial groups in ANES surveys.[ 20] Something distinctive has changed with respect to perceptions of racism since 2014 that cannot be explained solely by technological change.\nIdeological shifts are an important independent factor to investigate when trying to explain the racism paradox. At the U.S. state level, Google searches for \u201cracism\u201d are highly correlated with searches for \u201csexism,\u201d which is, in turn, correlated with the Democratic share of the vote. Liberal states such as Vermont tend to come out highest on both indices, while southern and mountain states score lowest. Searches for \u201cracism,\u201d in short, serve as a useful barometer of left-modernism.\nWhile the salience of racism fluctuates with events, the use of the term \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cracism\u201d has increased in three waves since 1960. Figure 5, based on big data from Google\u2019s Ngram Viewer, tracks the popularity of terms in English-language books. It shows that the use of the term \u201cracism\u201d first rose sharply in the late 1960s, a time of New Left student activism. After reaching a plateau, it surged again and rose to a new level in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when political correctness and speech codes came into vogue. Then, around 2014, there was another upsurge, in tandem with the current period of left-modernist ferment. The use of terms such as racism (or racist/s) took off especially sharply in left-leaning media outlets such as Vox and the New York Times .[ 21]\nA 2018 report, \u201cHidden Tribes: A Study of America\u2019s Polarized Landscape,\u201d published by More in Common, found that \u201cProgressive Activists,\u201d who make up 8% of the U.S. population, are 3.5 times more active than the \u201cexhausted majority\u201d two-thirds of the population in posting political content on social media.[ 22] While the rise of social media, citizen journalism, and a surge in online partisan websites has been associated with what Matthew Yglesias calls the \u201cGreat Awokening,\u201d it is not associated with right-wing populist voting, which is stronger among older and less educated voters who use social media platforms less.[ 23] Many left-modernist ideas have older roots in critical theory, but technological change helped left-modernists organize and spread new moral innovations, such as \u201cmicroaggressions,\u201d or causes, such as gender recognition.[ 24]\nTo what extent the most recent \u201cAwokening\u201d would have occurred in the absence of social media is an open question. Whatever the case, the Great Awokening has coincided with a large-scale shift to the left in attitudes toward questions of race, diversity, and immigration, especially among white liberals. Thus, partisanship and ideology increasingly affect perceptions of racism. The importance of ideological differences in perceptions of racism is shown in Figure 6, which reveals that among white conservatives, there has been little to no increase since 1995 in the share who think that racism is a \u201cbig problem.\u201d White liberals show the greatest increase, with white moderates in between. The post-2014 trend (see Figure 2) of perceiving worse relations between whites and blacks is, therefore, less a reflection of statistical reality than of rising consciousness of racism, notably among liberals.\nDefying Reality by Stretching Perception\nThe split between liberals and conservatives in their perception of racism in society indicates that an individual\u2019s ideology shapes his estimate of the size of the problem. Racism thus contains an important socially constructed component.\nThere are important reasons that egalitarians may find it especially difficult to adjust their perceptions of racism to the reality of its decline. As Alexis de Tocqueville remarked almost two centuries ago in his classic Democracy in America:\nThe hatred that men bear to privilege increases in proportion as privileges become fewer and less considerable, so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely just when they have least fuel. . . . When all conditions are unequal, no inequality is so great as to offend the eye, whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of general uniformity; the more complete this uniformity is, the more insupportable the sight of such a difference becomes. Hence it is natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together with equality itself, and that it should grow by what it feeds on.[ 25]\nIn a similar vein, Coleman Hughes, in a pathbreaking 2018 essay, remarks on Tocqueville\u2019s paradox as it concerns racial liberalism in America: \u201cIt seems as if every reduction in racist behavior is met with a commensurate expansion in our definition of the concept. Thus, racism has become a conserved quantity akin to mass or energy: transformable but irreducible.\u201d[ 26]\nTocqueville\u2019s and Hughes\u2019s observations have now been confirmed scientifically as a variant of a wider phenomenon known as \u201cprevalence-induced concept change.\u201d This takes place when people reframe reality to conserve a concept into which they have been socialized. Citing work by Harvard University\u2019s Daniel Gilbert, British psychologist Peter Hughes (no relation to Coleman) writes:\n[W]hen participants were shown 800 human faces on a continuum of threatening to nonthreatening\u2014when the prevalence of threatening faces was reduced in one group, participants expanded their concept of threat to include faces which they had previously defined as nonthreatening. In a third study, participants were shown 240 proposals for scientific research that were rated on a continuum from very ethical to very unethical. When the prevalence of proposals defined as unethical were decreased for one group, the group expanded their concept of unethical to include proposals they had previously defined as ethical.[ 27]\nBlack Public Opinion\nMuch of the evidence about perceptions of racism so far comes from national samples, which are dominated by white respondents. Though sample sizes for African-Americans in such surveys are typically small and there are fewer black-only surveys, it is apparent that black opinion is characterized by a weaker ideological divide than exists within white opinion. Data from Pew, for example, show that among blacks, 75% of liberals, but also 55% of the smaller group of conservative blacks, say that discrimination makes it harder for blacks to get ahead (Figure 7 ). By contrast, 17% of \u201cvery conservative\u201d whites and 82% of \u201cvery liberal\u201d whites agree. A modest 20-point partisan difference among blacks balloons to 65 points among whites. Since 2016, several surveys show that white liberals place to the left of minorities on questions of race, diversity, and immigration.[ 28]\nThere is also a substantially larger ideological gap among whites than blacks when it comes to viewing racism as a serious problem. Pew\u2019s 2015 survey, profiled in Figure 8, found that \u201cvery liberal\u201d whites evince nearly as much concern over racism (76%) as African-Americans, while moderate (33%) and conservative (11%) whites view racism as a much less important problem. The ideological slope is greatest for whites, with over 60 points separating conservatives from \u201cvery liberal\u201d whites. The incline is less steep among Asians and Hispanics and gradual among blacks, with \u201cvery liberal\u201d and \u201cvery conservative\u201d blacks only differing 20 points in their assessment that racism is a very big problem (64% vs. 84%).\nAre White Republicans Racist?\nAnother way to appraise how partisanship can skew perceptions about race is to compare white and black responses to the \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d and \u201cwhite Democrats are racist\u201d questions fielded in a survey that I conducted on Qualtrics during April 20\u2013June 2, 2020 (see below, Original Surveys Conducted for This Report ).\nOriginal Surveys Conducted for This Report\nQualtrics (Qualtrics 1) Apr. 20\u2013June 2, 2020\nN=1770 | 844 black, 926 white respondents\nQuestionnaire\nQualtrics 2 Nov. 20\u2013Dec. 1, 2020\nN=801 | black respondents\nQuestionnaire\nProlific Academics (Prolific 1) July 4\u20135, 2018\nN=137 | black respondents\nQuestionnaire\nProlific 2 June 15, 2020\nN=196 | white respondents\nQuestionnaire\nProlific 3 Nov. 26\u2013Dec. 10, 2020\nN=572 | black respondents\nQuestionnaire\nProlific 4 Dec. 1, 2020\nN=391 | white respondents\nQuestionnaire\nDetails about the answers to various questions in these surveys are available upon request from the author.\n*Qualtrics is a survey firm that recruits survey participants according to demographic or other criteria specified by the client.

The bigger racial difference was among conservatives, where 10% of white conservatives but 36% of black conservatives said that white Republicans are racist, a 26-point difference. When it comes to the statement \u201cwhite Democrats are racist,\u201d 38% of white conservatives agreed, but only 28% of black conservatives agreed.\nResponses to this question among African-Americans, as will be explored below, are strongly associated with both national perceptions and reported personal experiences of racism.\nFatal Police Shootings\nThe likelihood of a young black man dying from a car accident is considerably higher than his being killed by police. Even among young men of all races being killed by police, shootings form only part of total killings.[ 29] Nevertheless, eight in 10 African-American respondents to the Qualtrics 2 survey (Nov. 20\u2013Dec. 1, 2020) believed that young black men are more likely to be shot to death by the police than to die in a traffic accident.[ 30] Only one in 10 disagreed.\nThis belief, at variance with reality, is not the result of counting respondents who are unsure of the answer jumping one way: there is a \u201cneither agree nor disagree\u201d option, but it was chosen by only one in 10 people. Nor is it a matter of educational level. Among the survey\u2019s noncollege graduates, 78% believe that police shooting are a more common cause of death than traffic accidents, but so do 76% of university graduates\u2014only 14% of whom contest this view. Neither age nor the share of African-Americans in a respondent\u2019s neighborhood significantly affected the results.\nWith regard to police shootings, however, political outlook did shape people\u2019s perceptions of social reality. For example, Qualtrics 2 found that while 53% of the black Trump voters (64 individuals) believed that police shootings are the leading cause of death for young black men, 81% of black Biden voters (597 individuals) did so, a statistically significant and powerful difference (Figure 9 ). While education and age made no significant difference in the respondents\u2019 answers to this question, partisan perceptions of racial attitudes played the most important role. Thus, 95% of African-Americans who \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d (22% of the sample) say that police kill more young black men than cars do, while 56% of blacks who \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d that \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d say this.[ 31]\nThe fact that politics matters more than education or age indicates that ideologically motivated reasoning[ 32] plays a role in governing perceptions of how frequently young black men are shot to death by the police. On the other hand, the fact that 53% of black Trump voters still agreed with the statement tells us that this belief is widespread and not simply a function of ideology.\nHowever, this perspective on an empirical question is not unique to African-Americans. Of the 391 white respondents in the Prolific 4 survey (Dec. 1, 2020), 70% of whites who \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d also believed that young black men are more likely to be shot to death by the police than to die in a car accident (Figure 10 ). This is noticeably higher than the 53% of black Trump voters in Qualtrics 2 and vastly higher than the 15% of white Trump voters in Prolific 4 who believe this.\nThe gap between Trump and Biden voters on the question about fatal police shootings is 28 points among African-Americans (81%\u201353%) but 38 points among whites (53%\u201315%) in Prolific 4. Education level was not a significant predictor of accuracy on this question. These results echo those that recently found that only about a fifth of liberals but close to half of conservatives gave the right answer to a question on how many unarmed black men were killed by police in 2019. Fully 54% of \u201cvery liberal\u201d Americans thought that more than 1,000 were killed compared with the actual figure of between 13 and 27.[ 33]\nTo be sure, African-Americans are more likely than whites to believe that the risk of young black men being shot to death by police is greater than dying in a traffic accident. However, ideology is about as important as race in influencing perceptions. Combining black and white responses to this question in Qualtrics 2 and Prolific 4, a person\u2019s race predicts 25% of the variation in beliefs while ideology, the 2020 presidential vote, and a person\u2019s view of whether \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d predicts 29%.[ 34]\nFigure 10 above compares data from two different samples, but Qualtrics 1 permits a comparison of blacks and whites on another question. That question was whether people agree or disagree with the statement, \u201cWhite males kill more people than any other group in the United States.\u201d In contrast to fatal police shootings, there is no clearly correct answer. While African- Americans commit slightly more murders than whites, the question could also be interpreted to encompass those who kill in other ways, such as through drinking and driving, in which case the statement is accurate. Results show that white liberals answer the question similarly to blacks (overall), with about half agreeing with the statement, while white conservatives diverge substantially, with 10% giving their assent.\nThe Social Construction of Personal Experience\nThough politics doesn\u2019t shape black opinion as much as white opinion, it remains the case that black views on national-level race issues also vary by ideology. The position of blacks as the traditional target of racial exclusion also means that focusing on black opinion can help us understand whether ideology affects people\u2019s perceptions of having personally been the target of racism. This is, in many ways, a \u201charder\u201d measure of reality than perceptions about racism in general because it concentrates on personal experience.\nFigure 4 showed that the use of social media heightened black perceptions that others had acted in racially biased ways toward them. This suggests that part of the racism paradox may have to do with new peer-to-peer technologies. Ideology could also be a factor, inducing liberal African-Americans to read more racism into their personal interactions, or recall more racist incidents, than black conservatives do.\nLooking at racism through the lens of social constructionism leads to a pair of testable propositions: first, that perceptions of whether one has experienced racism will be conditioned by ideology and partisanship; and second, that many minorities do not view socalled microaggressions as racist, while many whites who subscribe to left-modernist ideology do.\nPersonal Experience\nIn order to assess whether partisanship affects people\u2019s personal experience of racism, Qualtrics 2 asked African-Americans, \u201cHow often would you say that you experience racism in your daily life?\u201d[ 35] A similar share of both Biden (32%) and Trump (30%) voters responded that they experienced racism on at least a monthly basis. These results were similar to Qualtrics 1, showing that 26% of black Biden[ 36] voters and 25% of black Trump voters reported experiencing racism on at least a monthly basis.\nMuch later in the 80-question Qualtrics 2 survey, I asked, \u201cHow often would you say that you experienced racism in your daily life during Barack Obama\u2019s period in office, 2008\u201316?\u201d I then asked the same question about experiencing racism \u201cduring Donald Trump\u2019s period in office, from November 2016 until now.\u201d Biden voters\u2014the vast majority of the black sample\u2014 were twice as likely to say that they had experienced racism on at least a monthly basis (42%\u201321%) under Trump than under Obama (Figure 11 ).\nBlack Trump voters indicated a similar experience of racism under both administrations, but partisan prompts appear to have reduced personal reporting of racism among black Biden voters during the Obama years and increased it during the Trump years. The fact that Biden but not Trump voters deviated from their initial answer (when neither Trump nor Obama was mentioned) suggests that Democrats are largely responsible for changing their answers in response to partisan cues. The result is a partisan difference of 7 points in personal perceptions of racism during Obama\u2019s administration and 14 points under Trump.\nThe partisan gap between black Trump and Biden voters of 7\u201314 points widens to 37 points when we compare black voters who \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d with blacks who strongly disagree with this statement. Fully 56% of blacks who strongly agreed that \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d said that they experienced racism under Trump, compared with 19% among blacks strongly disagreeing with the statement.\nIf racist behavior was actually higher under Trump, this should affect both groups of black supporters in equal measure. Moreover, we shouldn\u2019t see a 10- point partisan difference between answers to the \u201chow much racism do you experience\u201d (answered in early November 2020) and \u201chow much under Trump\u201d versions of the question.[ 37] While it is possible that African-Americans who experienced more racism under Obama switched to Trump while those who encountered racism under Trump switched to Biden, this is a less convincing explanation than partisan motivated response bias. While black Trump voters may have a motive to underreport, the fact that their views align with their experience \u201ctoday,\u201d along with the fact that black Republicans tend to be moderate on race issues, suggests that political distortion is greater among black Democrats.\nThe extent to which personal and political perceptions of racism are connected can be glimpsed by comparing the reported personal experience of racism among left- and right-wing African-American respondents in Qualtrics 1 and 2. First, there is a liberal-conservative difference of 15 points in black people\u2019s perceptions of whether there is a lot of discrimination against black people in America.[ 38] This is an understandable relationship, given the national data reviewed in the first part of this report and the expected links between ideology and the national problems that it frames.\nBut it is surprising to see that ideological differences also appear in questions pertaining to personal experience. On four questions on the Qualtrics surveys mainly using wording from a 2017 NPR survey[ 39 ]\u2014people making negative comments or assumptions about you, acting afraid of you, police treating you unfairly, and being stopped and searched\u2014my analysis of the data shows an ideological divide within black America of 16\u201320 points when comparing those in the two liberal and two conservative categories on a 5-point liberal- to-conservative scale. In almost all cases, the results are statistically significant controlling for age, gender, education, and the share of African-Americans and holders of advanced degrees in a person\u2019s zip code.\nThese results accord with other findings. In the 2018 ANES pilot survey, women who are white Trump voters are around 20 points less likely to say that they experience sexism than their Clinton-voting counterparts. However, white Trump voters are nearly 20 points more likely than white Clinton voters to say that they have experienced at least \u201ca little\u201d racial discrimination.[ 40]\nPartisan Racial Misperception and Personal Experience of Racism\nPrevious research shows that partisans entertain wide misperceptions about the attitudes of the other party\u2019s voters. Republicans overestimate Democrats\u2019 hostility to the police, preference for open borders, and lack of patriotism by around 30 points. Democrats misperceive Republicans\u2019 level of hostility to Muslims and immigration by a similar amount.[ 41] As with misperception about whether black men are more likely to be shot to death by police or killed in a traffic accident, reports of personal experiences of racism are heavily shaped by partisan perceptions of outgroup racial bias.\nNo wonder, therefore, that African-Americans who \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that white Republicans are racist are far more likely to report personal discrimination than blacks who \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d that white Republicans are racist. On all but one question, there is an attitude gap in reported personal experience of at least 20 points. On the question of whether \u201cpolice have treated you unfairly for being black,\u201d the difference between those who strongly agree and disagree that \u201cwhite Republicans are racist\u201d reaches 34 points (Figure 12 ).\nIt is, of course, possible that personal experiences of racism have shaped attitudes toward Republicans and shifted personal ideology and voting behavior.\u00a0However, the fact that those who feel strongly that white Republicans are racist are considerably more likely to mistakenly believe that more young black men are shot to death by police than die in traffic accidents\u2014and that answers to the personal experience questions reflect the same pattern\u2014suggests that attitudinally motivated reasoning is the more plausible explanation.\nThese results of several surveys that I conducted, as well as evidence from other sources, indicate that personal and national perceptions of racism are interrelated. This could be because those who have personally experienced racism are more likely to see it as a national problem and identify as liberal, but it is more plausibly accounted for by black liberals being more likely to perceive personal encounters as racist\u2014or to recall them as such\u2014than conservative blacks do.\nThe partisan/ideological and attitudinal differences that exist in reported personal experiences of racism (Figures 11 and 12) are consistent with beliefs about how big the problem of racism is in the U.S. (Figures 6 and 8), the probability of agreeing that discrimination makes it harder for blacks to get ahead (Figure 7), and the misperception about lethal police shootings (Figures 9 and 10). To get a sense of how important ideology and partisanship are for variation in reported racism, we can compare their effect with that of race itself. This shows that ideological effects are not much smaller than the difference in reported racism between whites and blacks.\nDoes Critical Race Theory Disempower African-Americans?\nThe correlations between ideology and perceptions of racism, whether as a national sentiment or in terms of personal experience, raise two important questions: Might the emerging ideology of critical race theory (CRT) distort perceptions of racism among both blacks and whites? If so, what might this imply for the well-being of African-Americans?\nWriters such as Christopher Rufo and Coleman Hughes have drawn attention to many unfalsifiable and damaging claims of CRT. Much of this discussion focuses on CRT\u2019s generalizations about white people and the division that this seeds among the body politic.[ 42]\nBut there is another criticism: a possibly detrimental effect of CRT narratives on the black people whom it is ostensibly designed to help. John McWhorter regularly points out that the work of CRT authors such as Ibram X. Kendi, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Robin DiAngelo tends to endow whites with the power to change themselves while portraying blacks as passive subjects whose fate is dependent on the goodwill of white people.[ 43]\nIn order to assess the possible impact of CRT on black empowerment, I had part of the survey sample in Prolific 1 and Prolific 3 first read a passage from Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cLetter to My Son\u201d:[ 44]\nHere is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body\u2014it is heritage. This was the year you saw Eric Garner choked to death for selling cigarettes. . . . John Crawford was shot down for browsing in a department store. And you have seen men in uniform drive by and murder Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old child whom they were oath-bound to protect. And you know now, if you did not before, that the police departments of your country have been endowed with the authority to destroy your body. It does not matter if the destruction is the result of an unfortunate overreaction. It does not matter if it originates in a misunderstanding. It does not matter if the destruction springs from a foolish policy. Sell cigarettes without the proper authority and your body can be destroyed. Turn into a dark stairwell and your body can be destroyed. The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions. And now, in your time, the law has become an excuse for stopping and frisking you, which is to say, for furthering the assault on your body. But a society that protects some people through a safety net of schools, government-backed home loans, and ancestral wealth but can protect you only with the club of criminal justice has either failed at enforcing its good intentions or succeeded at something much darker.\nAnother group read no passage before answering, while a third group read a different passage that I composed:\nAfrican-Americans are the descendants of conquerors. Their ancestors were Bantu speakers: cattle-herders who swept out of West Africa. As Jared Diamond, scientist and renowned author of Guns, Germs and Steel (1997) writes, the Bantu, with their superior technology and resistance to animal-borne disease, displaced the lighter-skinned Khoisan (Bushmen) and pygmy indigenous peoples of southern and eastern Africa. The natives, writes Diamond, were largely wiped out by the Bantu through conquest, expulsion, interbreeding, killing, or epidemics. The same process of agriculturalists wiping out hunter-gatherers occurred with European settlement of the Americas. West Africans, many from sophisticated city states and kingdoms like the Ashanti Empire, had a long internal tradition of slavery and were active in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which could not have happened without them. Consider the case of Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, the first slave to be portrayed in London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery: \u201cWhat I learned about Diallo (and is strangely absent from the museum texts about him), is that his elite family were themselves slave traders.\u00a0In fact, he was kidnapped while returning home from selling some slaves. And, by a twist of fate, he was then sold to the very man he had been doing business with only days before. Even more astonishingly, after his supporters bought his freedom he returned to Africa in 1738 to work for the Royal Africa Company\u2014which was then active in the slave trade\u2014for the rest of his life.\u201d[ 45]\nI then asked respondents to indicate what their view was (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree, don\u2019t know) of the passage that they had read and to answer several questions on what psychologists refer to as the locus of control scale, which measures whether people feel able to control their lives or whether they think that their fate is determined by forces outside their control. Higher belief in one\u2019s ability to control one\u2019s fate is linked to positive mental health outcomes.\nThe measures were:\nWhen I make plans, I am almost certain that I can make them work.\nNo matter how much I try, I don\u2019t receive any credit for what I do.\nIt is my responsibility to make the most of my talents and abilities.\nCombining the results in Prolific 1 and Prolific 3 on the first statement show that 83% of blacks who did not read the Coates passage said that they could make their life plans work out\u2014while only 68% of those who read Coates said that they could do so (Figure 13 ). The impact of even one short passage of CRT was enough to reduce black respondents\u2019 sense of control over their lives.[ 46]\nProlific 3 measured responses to the second and third statements (Figure 14 ). It shows that reading the Coates passage had a significant disempowering effect on blacks on all three locus of control measures.[ 47]\nToward Black Resilience\nFor John McWhorter, critical race theory diminishes black people: \u201cIn supposing that Black people have no resilience, you are saying that Black people are unusually weak. You\u2019re saying that we are lesser. You\u2019re saying that we, because of the circumstances of American social history, cannot be treated as adults. And in the technical sense, that\u2019s discriminatory.\u201d[ 48]\nDo African-Americans share McWhorter\u2019s selfaffirming approach, or might they prefer the extra protection promised by CRT\u2019s program of affirmative action, linguistic penalties, and reeducation? To explore this further, I first asked the survey samples in Qualtrics 2 whether they agreed or disagreed with the following: \u201cBlacks will never be truly equal if society doesn\u2019t hold them to the same standards as others.\u201d Among the 801 black respondents, 68% agreed with this statement on a 7-point scale (strongly agree, agree, somewhat agree, neither degree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, disagree, strongly disagree), with only 14% disagreeing. Only a few points separated black liberals and black conservatives. There was a statistically significant difference by age, however, with 75% of blacks aged 18\u201330 agreeing with the statement, compared with 57% of those over age 60. Young African-Americans appear especially keen to be treated as equally competent and responsible citizens.\nMicroaggressions\nEven so, perhaps black Americans want to be psychologically protected from whites via stronger regulation of speech. CRT emphasizes surveillance and compliance measures to shift white people toward what they deem to be appropriately inoffensive language. The contention is that the way language constructs meaning reinforces racial power structures while offending the sensibilities of minorities.[ 49] In order to probe this, I posed this question in Qualtrics 1 and Qualtrics 2:[ 50]\nSometimes, white people try to be extremely sensitive when talking about racial issues. This is called political correctness. Which view comes closest to your own? I believe political correctness is: a) very demeaning to black people; b) somewhat demeaning to black people; c) somewhat necessary to protect black people; or d) very necessary to protect black people.\nThough some people may find political correctness (PC) both demeaning and necessary, a forced-choice question compels respondents to weigh which aspect is more important to them. In Qualtrics 1 (Apr. 20\u2013June 2, 2020), 56% of African-Americans and 57% of whites said that PC was demeaning to blacks, compared with 43% of whites and 44% of blacks who said that it was necessary to protect them. In Qualtrics 2 (Nov. 20\u2013Dec. 1, 2020), blacks also indicated that PC was demeaning rather than necessary, but by a smaller (51%\u201349%) margin.\nThere was no significant average difference in opinion between blacks and whites on this question, even after controlling for age, sex, ideology, education, and marital status. Instead, ideology, not race, shaped opinion on political correctness\u2014with ideological effects most pronounced among whites (Figure 15 ). Liberal-conservative ideology was significantly associated with answers to the PC question after controlling for age, gender, and education, though the strength of the association is greater among whites. Thus, white liberals and conservatives differed by nearly 20 points on the question while black liberals and conservatives disagreed by only 3 points.\nColumbia University sociologist Musa al-Gharbi, among others, has commented that most minorities are not offended by many of the \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d set out by University of California guidelines.[ 51] Responses from Qualtrics 2 largely comport with al-Gharbi\u2019s comment. When asked, \u201cWhat is your feeling when a white person says, \u2018I don\u2019t notice people\u2019s race\u2019?\u201d 32% of blacks replied that they were \u201cvery offended\u201d or \u201csomewhat offended,\u201d 22% said that they were \u201csomewhat pleased\u201d or \u201cvery pleased,\u201d and 47% said that they were \u201cneither pleased nor offended.\u201d\nHowever, when they were asked, \u201cWhat is your feeling when a white person says, \u2018America is a colorblind society\u2019?\u201d a slim majority of black respondents (51%\u2013 49%) said that they would be at least somewhat offended. Ideology figured in their responses. There was a 13-point gap between black liberals and conservatives (38%\u201325%) on the offensiveness of \u201cI don\u2019t notice people\u2019s race\u201d and a 21-point gap (63%\u201342%) on \u201cAmerica is a colorblind society\u201d (Figure 16 ). Here, education level was as strong a predictor as ideology as to whether a black person would be offended. University graduates were 12\u201319 points more likely to be offended than those without degrees, comparable with the 13\u201321- point gap between liberals and conservatives. University-educated liberals were 26\u201327 points more likely than conservatives without a degree to feel offended by these statements. In addition to ideology, attending college appears to have a distinct effect in sensitizing black respondents to microaggressions.\nThe ideological divide was, as expected, wider among whites. When Prolific 4 (Dec. 1, 2020) asked a sample of whites if they were offended \u201cwhen a white person says, \u2018I don\u2019t notice people\u2019s race\u2019 and when a white person says, \u2018America is a colorblind society,\u2019 \u201d the difference between liberals (who were offended) and conservatives (who were not) was a very large 44 points on \u201cI don\u2019t notice people\u2019s race\u201d and 57 points on \u201cAmerica is a colorblind society.\u201d These responses are about twice as high as the ideological split among African-Americans. Education made no significant difference in predicting white responses to the microaggression statements.\nAmerica, like other societies, may never be able to reduce the incidence of racist epithets to zero. Nonetheless, increasing the penalty for racially offensive language is likely to have at least some deterrent effect. Is it right to pursue this path even with diminishing returns? Perhaps, but an alternative avenue to explore is to emphasize African-Americans\u2019 resilience to whatever racism still remains\u2014as Jonathan Haidt contended, there is wisdom in the rhyme that \u201csticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me.\u201d[ 52] For Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning, this is the defining characteristic of the healthy dignity culture that replaced the older honor culture or today\u2019s campus-led victimhood culture.[ 53]\nWhen asked to choose between a highly punitive regime of antiracism and a world marked by minority resilience, it appears that a majority of African-Americans prefer a future marked by group resilience over one of external protection. Qualtrics 2 posed this question: \u201cIf you had to choose, which is your ideal society?\u201d\nMinorities have grown so confident that racially offensive remarks no longer affect them.\nThe price for being racist is so high that no one makes racially offensive remarks anymore.\nWhile it is naturally the case that people may agree with both statements, the priority given to one over the other tells us something important. Overall, black respondents chose the first option (which I call resilience) over the second option (punitive antiracism) by a 53\u201347 margin. However, there is a 15-point difference between black conservatives and black liberals on this question: 62% of black conservatives, but just 47% of black liberals, chose resilience. There was no statistically significant difference on the ideal society question by age, gender, or education.\nFigure 17 combines Qualtrics 2 (black-only respondents) with Prolific 2 and Prolific 4 (white-only respondents).\u00a0Once again, ideological breakdowns show a larger difference among whites than blacks: 63% of white conservatives, but only 29% of white liberals, favored the resilience option. While 53% of black liberals favored the punitive option, 71% of white liberals backed it\u2014a difference of nearly 20 points. Ideological differences on race are greater among the white population than among African-Americans. White liberals, it appears, are considerably more attached to a regime of punitive antiracism than African-Americans overall, a majority of whom prefer a future of minority resilience.\nCoda: Sad and Anxious People Report More Racism\nThroughout this report, I have emphasized two points: first, that racism has been amplified by ideological and media construction; and second, that it is partly in the eye of the beholder. While people\u2019s general psychological dispositions are less susceptible to social construction than their ideological outlook, personal psychology is also strongly connected to reported experiences of racism and discrimination.\nIn order to tap respondents\u2019 general level of depression and anxiety, I asked, \u201cHow often you would say that you feel sad or anxious?\u201d in Qualtrics 1 and 2. Replies were provided on a scale from \u201cnever\u201d through \u201calways\u201d sad or anxious. Those saying, \u201cabout half the time,\u201d \u201cmost of the time,\u201d or \u201calways\u201d made up 29% of the 1,028 white respondents and 26% of the 1,788 black respondents. These responses were then cross-tabulated with the agree/disagree responses to the statements \u201cHow often would you say that you experience racism in your daily life?\u201d and \u201cI have experienced a great deal of discrimination in my life.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, Africans-Americans reported experiencing more racism and discrimination than whites. It should also be noted that men, whether white or black, report experiencing more racism and discrimination than women. But it is striking that, regardless of race or measure, those who report being sad or anxious at least half the time are far more likely to report experiencing racism and discrimination (Figure 18 ). Controlling for age, gender, and education, the association of psychological sadness and anxiety with reported racism and discrimination is highly significant and is similar for whites and blacks. As the dotted lines show, the two lines track each other, with the saddest and most anxious whites and blacks reporting 20 points more racism. In fact, psychology is only somewhat less powerful than race in predicting reported racism. While it is not impossible that whites and blacks who experience racism report more sadness, the more likely explanation is that certain psychological states are correlated with reporting more negative experiences.\nConclusion\nThis paper began by noting the Tocquevillean paradox that concern about racism has risen even as racist attitudes and behaviors have declined. Across a range of surveys and questions, I found that ideology\u2014and, to a lesser degree, social media exposure and university education\u2014has heightened people\u2019s perceptions of racism. Depression and anxiety are linked to perceiving more racism. The level of racism in society reported by whites appears to be driven more by political leaning than the level reported by blacks. Nevertheless, ideology plays an important part among African-Americans in shaping national perceptions as well as reported personal experiences of racism.\nSurveys showed that liberal whites are more supportive of punitive CRT postulates than blacks, who are more likely to aspire to agency and resilience. Moreover, CRT appeared to have a detrimental effect on African- Americans\u2019 feeling of being in control of their lives. This makes CRT a poor choice for policymakers seeking to improve outcomes in the black community.\nFinally, my survey results indicate that as much as half of reported racism may be ideologically or psychologically conditioned, and the rise in the proportion of Americans claiming racism to be an important problem is largely socially constructed.\nNone of this means that racism has been eradicated. Nevertheless, the policy approach that follows from the findings in this paper is unlike the narrative of \u201csystemic\u201d racism that is increasingly prevalent in professional settings. This approach would replace the narrative common among activists and diversity administrators in elite institutions, which is based on anecdote-driven reasoning, sweeping CRT narratives, and conclusions drawn from bivariate race \u201cgaps.\u201d In their stead would come measurable indicators and tests to explain disparate racial outcomes that control for confounding factors such as educational qualifications, and in which claims of racism achieve validity only when alternative explanations such as qualification level fail to explain differences. Racial disparities that stem from education and class can be addressed with less contentious, race-neutral economic initiatives.\nWhere racial bias continues to manifest itself, mentoring, nudges such as name-blind CVs, and the use of randomized control trials to ascertain which interventions work should be favored over shaming, virtue-signaling, and quotas. The realization that all groups discriminate against all groups can also help lower the divisiveness of a debate often cast in binary \u201cmajority-minority\u201d terms. In Britain, a recent survey shows that nonwhites, who make up only 20% of the population, accounted for over 40% of reported ethnic and racial discrimination against black Britons.[ 54] Policymakers should avoid unnecessarily generalizing about, and impugning the reputation of, an entire racial group such as white Americans. Targeted, evidence-led, progress on correcting unexplained racial disparities\u2014as with the rougher treatment of black suspects by police or lesser likelihood of prescribing black people pain relief\u2014is vital, but policymakers should interpret subjective perceptions of racism with care.[ 55]\nEndnotes\nSee endnotes in PDF\nPhoto by\u00a0acoblund/iStock"}, {"Url": "https://mendeley.com/catalogue/87a1cb96-52a3-3cd1-8588-113689247c10", "CluewebURLHash": "34DB639344963BD4E10851F252721B41", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Race as Social Construct - preview & related info | Mendeley", "Snippet": "Abstract.

Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with \u201crace\u201d, following the Second World War, evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide. This questioning gained momentum in the 1960s during the U.S. civil rights movement and the emergence of numerous anti-colonial movements worldwide. They thus came to believe that race itself is a social construct, a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective reality but which was believed in because of its social functions. [109]\nCraig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000. Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1\u20133% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races. Venter said, \u201cRace is a social concept. It\u2019s not a scientific one. There are no bright lines (that would stand out), if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet.\u201d \u201cWhen we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences, it all falls apart.\u201d [110]\nStephan Palmi\u00e9 asserted that race \u201cis not a thing but a social relation\u201d; [111] or, in the words of Katya Gibel Mevorach, \u201ca metonym\u201d, \u201ca human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference.\u201d [112] As such, the use of the term \u201crace\u201d itself must be analyzed. Moreover, they argue that biology will not explain why or how people use the idea of race: History and social relationships will.\nImani Perry, a professor in the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University, has made significant contributions to how we define race in America today. Perry\u2019s work focuses on how race is experienced. Perry tells us that race \u201cis produced by social arrangements and political decision making.\u201d [113] Perry explains race more in stating, \u201crace is something that happens, rather than something that is. It is dynamic, but it holds no objective truth.\u201d [114]\nThe theory that race is merely a social construct has been challenged by the findings of researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine, published in the American Journal of Human Genetics as \u201cGenetic Structure, Self-Identified Race/Ethnicity, and Confounding in Case-Control Association Studies\u201d. [115] One of the researchers, Neil Risch, noted: \u201cwe looked at the correlation between genetic structure [based on microsatellite markers] versus self-description, we found 99.9% concordance between the two. We actually had a higher discordance rate between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome! So you could argue that sex is also a problematic category. And there are differences between sex and gender; self-identification may not be correlated with biology perfectly. And there is sexism.\u201d [116]\nBrazil\nPortrait \u201cReden\u00e7\u00e3o do Can\u201d (1895), showing a Brazilian family each generation becoming \u201cwhiter\u201d.\nCompared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century Brazil was characterized by a perceived relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. According to anthropologist Marvin Harris, this pattern reflects a different history and different social relations.\nBasically, race in Brazil was \u201cbiologized\u201d, but in a way that recognized the difference between ancestry (which determines genotype) and phenotypic differences. There, racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule, such as the one-drop rule, as it was in the United States. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only a very limited number of categories to choose from, [117] to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups. [118]\nOver a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone\u2019s skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry. [119] The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, a society that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of pardos, or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward, [120] and being seen as relatively \u201cwhiter\u201d as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America). [121]\nSelf-reported ancestry of people from\nRio de Janeiro, by race or skin color (2000 survey) [122]\nAncestry\nbrancos\npardos\npretos\nEuropean only\n48%\n6%\n\u2013\nAfrican only\n\u2013\n12%\n25%\nAmerindian only\n\u2013\n2%\n\u2013\nAfrican and European\n23%\n34%\n31%\nAmerindian and European\n14%\n6%\n\u2013\nAfrican and Amerindian\n\u2013\n4%\n9%\nAfrican, Amerindian and European\n15%\n36%\n35%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\nAny African\n38%\n86%\n100%\nFluidity of racial categories aside, the \u201cbiologification\u201d of race in Brazil referred above would match contemporary concepts of race in the United States quite closely, though, if Brazilians are supposed to choose their race as one among, Asian and Indigenous apart, three IBGE\u2019s census categories. While assimilated Amerindians and people with very high quantities of Amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as caboclos, a subgroup of pardos which roughly translates as both mestizo and hillbilly, for those of lower quantity of Amerindian descent a higher European genetic contribution is expected to be grouped as a pardo. In several genetic tests, people with less than 60-65% of European descent and 5-10% of Amerindian descent usually cluster with Afro-Brazilians (as reported by the individuals), or 6.9% of the population, and those with about 45% or more of Subsaharan contribution most times do so (in average, Afro-Brazilian DNA was reported to be about 50% Subsaharan African, 37% European and 13% Amerindian). [123] [124] [125] [126]\nIf a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be considered (e.g. that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one, unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African descent tend to classify themselves as mixed), more people would report themselves as white and pardo in Brazil (47.7% and 42.4% of the population as of 2010, respectively), because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80% of autosomal European ancestry, in average (also >35% of European mt-DNA and >95% of European Y-DNA). [123] [127] [128] [129]\nEthnic groups in Brazil (census data) [130]\nEthnic group\nwhite\nblack\npardo\n1872\n3,787,289\n1,954,452\n4,188,737\n1940\n26,171,778\n6,035,869\n8,744,365\n1991\n75,704,927\n7,335,136\n62,316,064\nEthnic groups in Brazil (1872 and 1890) [131]\nYears\nwhites\npardos\nblacks\nIndians\nTotal\n1872\n38.1%\n38.3%\n19.7%\n3.9%\n100%\n1890\n44.0%\n32.4%\n14.6%\n9%\n100%\nThis is not surprising, though: While the greatest number of slaves imported from Africa were sent to Brazil, totalizing roughly 3.5 million people, they lived in such miserable conditions that male African Y-DNA there is significantly rare due to the lack of resources and time involved with raising of children, so that most African descent originarily came from relations between white masters and female slaves. From the last decades of the Empire until the 1950s, the proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932, not much behind its neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million, [132] and it received more European immigrants in its colonial history than the United States. Between 1500 and 1760, 700.000 Europeans settled in Brazil, while 530.000 Europeans settled in the United States for the same given time. [133] Thus, the historical construction of race in Brazilian society dealt primarily with gradations between persons of majoritarily European ancestry and little minority groups with otherwise lower quantity there from in recent times.\nEuropean Union\nAccording to European Council:\nThe European Union rejects theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.\n\u2014\u2009 Directive 2000/43/EC [134]\nThe European Union uses the terms racial origin and ethnic origin synonymously in its documents and according to it \u201cthe use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such [racial] theories\u201d. [134] [135] Haney L\u00f3pez warns that using \u201crace\u201d as a category within the law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination. In the diverse geographic context of Europe, ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated with \u201crace\u201d. In European context, historical resonance of \u201crace\u201d underscores its problematic nature. In some states, it is strongly associated with laws promulgated by the Nazi and Fascist governments in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, in 1996, the European Parliament adopted a resolution stating that \u201cthe term should therefore be avoided in all official texts\u201d. [136]\nThe concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biologically distinct \u201craces\u201d, an idea generally rejected by the scientific community. Since all human beings belong to the same species, the ECRI (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) rejects theories based on the existence of different \u201craces\u201d. However, in its Recommendation ECRI uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to \u201canother race\u201d are not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation. The law claims to reject the existence of \u201crace\u201d, yet penalize situations where someone is treated less favourably on this ground. [136]\nFrance\nSince the end of the Second World War, France has become an ethnically diverse country. Today, approximately five percent of the French population is non-European and non-white. This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United States (roughly 28\u201337%, depending on how Latinos are classified; see Demographics of the United States). Nevertheless, it amounts to at least three million people, and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda. France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced, industrialized countries. Unlike the United States, Britain, or even the Netherlands, France maintains a \u201ccolor-blind\u201d model of public policy. This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups. Instead, it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities. It has, however, developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s. Until recently, French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech\u2014going much further than their American counterparts\u2014and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs, housing, and in provision of goods and services. [137]\nUnited States\nIn the United States, views of race that see racial groups as defined genetically are common in the biological sciences although controversial, whereas the social constructionist view is dominant in the social sciences. [138]\nThe immigrants to the Americas came from every region of Europe, Africa, and Asia. They mixed among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continent. In the United States most people who self-identify as African\u2013American have some European ancestors, while many people who identify as European American have some African or Amerindian ancestors.\nSince the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African\u2013Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as mulatto and octoroon. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with \u201cone drop\u201d of known \u201cBlack blood\u201d to be Black, regardless of appearance. 3 By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states. 4 Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of \u201cIndian blood\u201d (called blood quantum ). To be White one had to have perceived \u201cpure\u201d White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black. The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience. [139]\nThe decennial censuses conducted since 1790 in the United States created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into these categories. [140]\nThe term \u201cHispanic\u201d as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America to the United States. Today, the word \u201cLatino\u201d is often used as a synonym for \u201cHispanic\u201d. The definitions of both terms are non-race specific, and include people who consider themselves to be of distinct races (Black, White, Amerindian, Asian, and mixed groups). [141] However, there is a common misconception in the US that Hispanic/Latino is a race [142] or sometimes even that national origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Colombian, Salvadoran, etc. are races. In contrast to \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cHispanic\u201d, \u201cAnglo\u201d refers to non-Hispanic White Americans or non-Hispanic European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not necessarily of English descent.\n~\nReferences\nJump up ^Anemone, Robert L.

London, New York: The New Press. The genetic differences that exist among populations are characterized by gradual changes across geographic regions, not sharp, categorical distinctions. Groups of people across the globe have varying frequencies of polymorphic genes, which are genes with any of several differing nucleotide sequences. There is no such thing as a set of genes that belongs exclusively to one group and not to another. The clinal, gradually changing nature of geographic genetic difference is complicated further by the migration and mixing that human groups have engaged in since prehistory. Human beings do not fit the zoological definition of race. A mountain of evidence assembled by historians, anthropologists, and biologists proves that race is not and cannot be a natural division of human beings.\n^ Jump up to: a b Lieberman, L.; Kaszycka, K.

In contrast, the recent attention on decreasing health disparities uses race and ethnicity not as explanatory variables but as ways of examining the underlying sociocultural reasons for these disparities and appropriately targeting attention and resources on children and adolescents with poorer health.

To accept race-as-proxy, then, may be necessary but insufficient to solidify the future of race-based pharmacogenomics.\nJump up ^Graves 2011\nJump up ^Fullwiley 2011\nJump up ^Harpending 2006, p.\u00a0458 \u201cOn the other hand, information about the race of patients will be useless as soon as we discover and can type cheaply the underlying genes that are responsible for the associations.

Is it biological or a social construct?\nBy Nicole Mortillaro Global News\nPosted October 13, 2016 2:25 pm\nUpdated October 14, 2016 10:02 am\nIs there actually such a thing as different races?. Pixabay\nWhat is it to be Caucasian, black or Asian? Is there a difference at all besides the colour of one\u2019s skin?\nDuring the U.S. presidential election, race has been a hot-button topic throughout debates and numerous appearances by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump staff\u2019s social media posts include racism and talk of religious war\nTrump has\u00a0been accused of being a racist, even by members of his own party.\nHe has called illegal Mexican immigrants killers and rapists, said\u00a0a judge with Mexican heritage could not be impartial in a lawsuit against him and has called for a ban on immigration by Muslims to keep terrorists out of the country.\nBut\u00a0Trump\u2019s misgivings about race may be misplaced: most anthropologists and geneticists believe that there aren\u2019t differences at all between races.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThere is scientific evidence that suggests there may be more variation within races than between them, Dana Osborne, assistant professor at Ryerson University\u2019s Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures in Toronto said.\n\u201cIn this way, there is no genetic foundation for \u2018race\u2019 as it is popularly understood; that is to say based on \u2018phenotypic traits\u2019 or traits that are visible and observable by any conventional approach,\u201d Osborne told Global News.\nTweet This\nIt\u2019s important to note that, in 2003, as part of the Human Genome Project, researchers concluded that \u201c3 billion base pairs of genetic letters in humans were 99.9 percent identical in every person.\u201d\nWATCH: \u2018No racism, no hate\u2019: protester interrupts day 2 of Republican National Convention\n0:51 \u2018No racism, no hate\u2019: protester interrupts day 2 of RNC\n\u2018No racism, no hate\u2019: protester interrupts day 2 of RNC \u2013 Jul 19, 2016\nIn 2015, former geneticist Adam Rutherford wrote, \u201cWe now know that the way we talk about race has no scientific validity. There is no genetic basis that corresponds with any particular group of people, no essentialist DNA for black people or white people or anyone.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nREAD MORE: Public meeting on systemic racism takes place in Toronto\nIn a special for PBS, C. Loring Brace, a professor of anthropology made the point that, while humans may display some physical attribute that makes it obvious from which part of the world they originate (or at least their familial line), it doesn\u2019t lend itself to its value when it comes to survival.\nWATCH: History of humans altered with discovery in South Africa\nHuman fossil records suggest that humans evolved in sub-Saharan Africa. Then, about 180,000 years ago humans\u00a0began to split, migrating across the globe into Eurasia and North Africa and, eventually, beyond.\nOver time, and as far back as about 30,000 years ago, our genes evolved by natural selection, mainly as a result of learning to adapt to various environmental conditions as we were scattered across the globe.\nStory continues below advertisement\nWhen we think of natural selection, inevitably we\u2019re drawn to the works of Charles Darwin, specifically On the Origin of Species. While Darwin asserted that there were different races within non-human species, he didn\u2019t apply race in the way we have come to think about it to humans.\nHistory of races\nWhy have we sought to differentiate people between races?\n\u201cThe concept and application of \u2018race\u2019 as a concept has since its inception been inextricably linked to power,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cThis is particularly true when it came to the classification of \u2018types\u2019 of people that went hand-in-hand with things like colonization, missionization, and the expansion of empires, particularly out of Europe.\u201d\nOsborne notes that the concept of races itself has evolved over time, pointing to the influx of European immigrants into the eastern U.S. and Canada. At that time, Italians, Irish and Scots were all considered \u201cethnic whites,\u201d based on those\u00a0observable traits such as their colour, noses or face shape. Today, however, the idea of \u201cethnic whites\u201d has all but disappeared.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that people will stop judging people based on what is considered race, there may be a good reason not to.\n\u201cOne of the things that critical race theorists are interested in, and the goals of many scholars and activists of colour, are for members of our society to confront in full view the impacts of racial classification and racism, rather than sweeping them under the rug and taking up a stance of colourblindness,\u201d Osborne said.\nStory continues below advertisement\nIgnoring race, Osborne said,\u00a0\u201clessens the weight of a racist past and present while simultaneously stifling and erasing the experiences and voices of people of colour who ask us to confront, not ignore or minimize the impacts that racial classification and racism have had on our society and the peoples within it.\u201d\nFollow @NebulousNikki\n\u00a9 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS REPORT AN ERROR\nRace Evolution ethnicity concept of race +1"}, {"Url": "https://livinganthropologically.com/race-is-a-social-construction", "CluewebURLHash": "8267DA61CD81B52C08D72894448F6783", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000Race is a Social Construction\ue001: \ue000Race\ue001 and Genetics in ...", "Snippet": "\ue000Race\ue001 is a 'culturally constructed label that crudely and imprecisely describes real variation' (Relethford 2009,20) Click To Tweet It is important to spell out what that means, and what people were after with the \u201c\ue000race is a social construction\ue001\u201d phrase.", "Click_Cnt": 0.004, "CluewebID": "clueweb22-en0017-12-16919", "CluewebDocument": "Race is a Social Construction: Race and Genetics in Anthropology\nHome \u00bb Blog Posts \u00bb Biological Anthropology \u00bb Race & Genetics\nRace & Genetics\nUpdate 2021: Using the textbook Anthropology: What does it mean to be human? see my class on the idea that Human variation is more complicated than biological race and the YouTube lecture Evolution undermines race which attempts to explain why anthropologists believe (in shorthand) that \u201crace is a social construction\u201d:\nRace is a Social Construction\nWhen it comes to race and genetics, I usually avoid phrases like \u201crace is a social construction.\u201d Such phrases have become too much like mantras. They function too much like shortcuts. Anytime someone says \u201csocial construction\u201d it is going to be wildly misunderstood and misinterpreted. The idea that race is a social construction also often misses the point about the salience of racism, which is what makes race categories so durable.\nJohn H. Relethford provides a better phrase than \u201crace is a social construction.\u201d It is still concise but more accurate, and perhaps less susceptible to misinterpretation. Race is a \u201cculturally constructed label that crudely and imprecisely describes real variation\u201d (Race and global patterns of phenotypic variation 2009, 20).\nRace is a 'culturally constructed label that crudely and imprecisely describes real variation' (Relethford 2009,20) Click To Tweet\nIt is important to spell out what that means, and what people were after with the \u201crace is a social construction\u201d phrase. In this post I claim that although racial ideologues turn to popular genetic-sorting blogs such as Gene Expression and Dienekes for support, their posts demonstrate that these bloggers\nacknowledge the genetic clustering data exhibits much more complexity and tells a much more complex story of human movement and mixing than is popularly understood; and\ntherefore acknowledge that the lived experience of racial classification can be much more real than the kinds of genetic clustering they are outlining; so that\ncorrectly understood they are at least tacitly acknowledging that indeed \u201crace is a social construction.\u201d\nNow before any of these bloggers or the people who inhabit their comment streams jump in and crush me, I want to make clear that this is one reading of their posts. These comments apply to the main race and genetics bloggers and not necessarily to the comments.\nRace & Genetics\nI wrote this post in response to links to my blog which I did not solicit. One was from the 2012 comment stream on Non-overlapping magisteria for the social and biological? The first part of the post is quite sensible. It seems as if Razib Khan is basically agreeing with a comment that states \u201cI get the social science perspective that the socially constructed race is the category that is often much more \u2018real\u2019\u2013it is the lived experience of everyone in that group.\u201d To this long comment, and without wanting to take his words out of context, Khan says \u201cthis all sounds reasonable, and some of the points are of course factually correct (e.g., racial identity as it is lived is a real thing, irrespective of one\u2019s genetic heritage).\u201d However, at the end of the post Khan leads with the line \u201cwill social scientists stop citing \u2018Lewontin\u2019s Fallacy\u2019 in the near future?\u201d and goes on from there. This was the part that seems to have eventually led the comment stream over to my blog and to take my comments quite out of context.\nThe other links I did not solicit were from the Richard Dawkins Foundation website, when anthropologist Helga Vierich bravely initiated a discussion about race (the discussion has since been removed). In contrast to the above links, Vierich was trying to get to a real reading of the best anthropological research. However the comment stream features various levels of diatribe and misunderstanding.\nOn a page called \u201cRace Reconciled\u201d re-debunks race I attempted to summarize the key articles in the special May 2009 issue of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology titled Race Reconciled: How Biological Anthropologists View Human Variation. But what I would really like people to do\u2013anthropologists and non-anthropologists alike\u2013is to read the actual articles and grapple with the arguments. I\u2019ve so far seen more incorrect cites and misinterpretations from these articles than I\u2019ve seen accurate interpretations. I would really like that to change.\n\u201cRace is a social construction\u201d draws attention to how the social, legal, and political categories traditionally used to define \u201crace\u201d exhibit significant inter-society, within-society, and historical variability, so that these social categories are at best a crude appoximation of actually existing human biological variation.\nIn other words, it was not a denial of human biological variation and diversity. Nor was it necessarily a denial of how human biological variation might be structured, usually geographically. And it was especially and emphatically not a claim that these categories are not real. These social-political-legal categories of race have quite real lived effects, including quite real biological effects. This is something Clarence Gravlee details marvelously in How race becomes biology: Embodiment of social inequality. For an illuminating follow-up with ethnographic material, see Race and Consequence: \u201cReality\u201d and Social Constructs at the Torso and Oblong blog, which discusses how social categories become devastatingly real in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\nAs I cited above, Khan at Gene Expression seems to be at least agreeing with the lived importance of racial categorization, which can be quite distinct from biological variation.\nComputer software that finds genetic clusters did not prove anything about traditional race categories, and in fact proves that race is a social construction.\nThe idea that computer software verified race is a common misconception from the early 2000s, perpetuated and amplified by none other than Nicholas Wade. Some key genetic-analysis points of rebuttal are Human DNA sequences: More variation and less race (Long et al. 2009) and The global pattern of gene identity variation reveals a history of long-range migrations, bottlenecks, and local mate exchange: Implications for biological race (Hunley et al. 2009). However, these are difficult pieces to plow through and the arguments are complex.\nI have another favorite rebuttal:\nPerhaps the most celebrated confusion of geographic difference for race followed the publication of Genestic Structure of Human Populations (Rosenberg et al., 2002). The authors studied genetic variation in 1052 people from 52 populations and then asked a computer program called Structure to group the samples. When they asked it to produce two groups, Structure gave them EurAfrica and East Asia-Oceiania-America. When asked for three groups, Structure gave Europe, Africa, and East Asia-Oceania-America. When asked for four, it gave Europe, Africa, East Asia-Oceania, and America. When asked for five, it gave roughly the continents. And when asked for six, it gave the continents and the Kalash people of Pakistan. When asked for more (up to twenty groups), it gave more (Bolnick, 2008)\nThis was more or less what population geneticists had been doing with the human gene pool since the pioneering work of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1965). On the face of it, once again, this would seem to have little relevance for race. The user specifies the number of groups, and geographic proximity is the strongest predictor of similarity, so asking the computer to break the human species into five groups might reasonably be expected to yield groups roughly corresponding to the continents. And the Kalash people of Pakistan certainly do not have green skin and square heads; nor do they constitute a \u201cnatural\u201d contrast against Europeans or Africans. (Ten Facts about Human Variation 2010:270-271)\nInterestingly, Razib Khan\u2019s post Kalash on the human tree is also about how they seem to pop out. (Also interesting to note how Khan gets his share of racist comments as well.)\nOf course the long quote above is from Jonathan Marks, who on some of these blogs is rather like citing (Satan 1999:666) or even Lewontin 1972. Which brings up the next point.\nAnthropologists do not need to cast about for new arguments in the post-Lewontin\u2019s fallacy era. Anthropology had home-grown critiques of traditional race categorizations long before Lewontin and we have good post-2004 critiques as well. We do need to start reading, citing, and promoting the material we already have, but we do not need to scramble for new critiques to prove race is a social construction.\nAnthropologists were critiquing race long before Lewontin. One of my favorites is Franz Weidenreich in his 1946 book, Apes, Giants, and Man. Weidenreich does a devastating critique of racial classification with regard to so-called racial \u201cpurity.\u201d The critique is sometimes hidden under prose and photos that might seem race-centered to contemporary readers, but the text clearly demonstrates interconnectedness and how racial typologies are impossible. As I argue in a section called More mothers than Mitochondrial Eve, the excessive citing of Gould and Lewontin became problematic for anthropology, as it tended to ignore some of these earlier critiques. But those critiques are still there and deserve due consideration.\nMore importantly, as I have myself excessively cited above, is the need for anthropologists to refer to the post-2004 work that already exists. The issue of Lewontin is one key area of the \u201cRace Reconciled?\u201d symposium where there was not a consensus among biological anthropologists:\nThere was really only one fundamental difference of opinion among the symposium participants, which was about the precise nature of the geographic patterning of human biological variation. Many participants supported the views of Livingstone and Lewontin that continue to be central to thinking and teaching about human variation in biological anthropology. These views highlight the clinal nature of human biological variation and the fact that little neutral genetic variation is apportioned among human groups. Several participants also argued that human neutral genetic and phenotypic variation conforms to a pattern of isolation by distance, in which case there are no geographic discontinuities and therefore no races. Others questioned the empirical and theoretical bases for these views and suggested that geographic patterns of human genetic variation are the result of a complex combination of population splits, regional founder events, and local migration. This difference of opinion about the geographic structure of human biological variation and its evolutionary causes is reminiscent of the disagreement between Livingstone and Dobzhansky (1962), and it has important implications for reconstructing human population history and possibly for identifying the genetic component of multifactorial disease.( Race Reconciled?: How Biological Anthropologists View Human Variation, Edgar and Hunley 2009:2)\nStill, this was really the only big difference. On many other areas, including how \u201crace is not an accurate or productive way to describe human biological variation\u201d (Edgar and Hunley 2009:2) there was broad consensus.\nThere are some signs this message on race and genetics is getting through. In a September 2011 blog-post titled Latent admixture causes spurious serial founder effect, Dienekes Pontikos reviews an article by Hunley and Healy (two of the participants in \u201cRace Reconciled), The Impact of Founder Effects, Gene Flow, and European Admixture on Native American Genetic Diversity. At the end of his review, Pontikos concludes:\nTree models are orderly and well-behaved. It would be great if people behaved that way, because the math would be easier. But, people aren\u2019t laboratory mice that follow predefined paths in a maze: they mix with their neighbors, they split and move forward, but sometimes, they split and move backward. Hopefully, H&H\u2019s paper will lead to an increased appreciation of admixture in the human story, beyond the case of the Americas.\nThen, in the July 2012 Admixture matters, Pontikos declares: \u201cIt\u2019s time to give up trees and embrace networks!\u201d\nIn other words\u2013at least my intepretation\u2013is that we are likely to discover a whole lot more complexity, because indeed people have never been laboratory mice (or perhaps are more like mice than we think!). A similar issue emerges in Khan\u2019s analysis of Clusters where they \u201cshouldn\u2019t be\u201d: \u201cThe ADMIXTURE software transformed a clearly hybridized population into its own \u2018ancestral\u2019 population.\u201d\nWhich surely makes me wonder where exactly do the lines get drawn between hybridized and ancestral? Doesn\u2019t that software seem to require quite a bit of reading and interpretation? Maybe even a bit of\u2026 art?\nFollow-ups to \u201cRace is a Social Construction\u201d\nRace redux: What are people \u201ctilting against\u201d?\nSocial Construction of Race = Conservative Goldmine.\nUpdate 2021: Using the textbook Anthropology: What does it mean to be human? see my class on the idea that Human variation is more complicated than biological race and the YouTube lecture Evolution undermines race which attempts to explain why anthropologists believe (in shorthand) that \u201crace is a social construction\u201d:\nLiving Anthropologically\n466 subscribers\nEvolution Undermines Race\nWatch later\nShare\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

In the past decade, we've learned that Boas, Lewontin and Gould have all engaged in fraud in an attempt to prove \"race doesn't exist.\"\nIt seems that the preferred MO of the Boasian Cultural Marxists is deceit and disinformation.\nBut what can one expect?\nWe all know race is real:\nAs Karl Popper once noted, only someone so wrapped up in an ideology tries to deny the obvious.  The \"race is a social construct\" crowd are in a politically correct war against reality.\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Francois,\nI delayed approving this comment for a while, because your accusations about Boasian Cultural Marxists sound an awfully lot like some guy named Dave over on Jon Marks blog. The accusations of deceit and disinformation against say Boas are pretty strange, considering Boas was always publishing his raw data so people could reanalyze and disagree.\nIn any case, the assertion that \"we all know race is real\" should be seen against a recent post by Razib Khan, Human Races May Have Biological Meaning, But Races Mean Nothing About Humanity. Near the end, Khan asserts that in fact \"Race, the way we have traditionally thought of it, is indeed a social construction. But whether racial groups are purely a biological myth is debatable.\" Note how different that is from your assertion. And then note this line: \"The key issue is to move beyond the term race.\" In other words, far from the assertion that \"we all know race is real,\" we see that in fact one of the key proponents of genetic analysis is hardly making a convincing case for perpetuating the idea.\nHenry Harpending \u2022 9 years ago\nJason the accusation of deceit against Boas is not without foundation.  Dick Jantz at Tennessee dug out Boas' original measurements of head dimensions on migrants which were the basis of his famous paper claiming that head form was changing in the new environment of the US.  Turns out that the data showed no such thing at all.  Fraud?  Honest mistake?  Sparks and Jantz paper is here.\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Henry,\nThank you for the comment. I am aware of the Sparks and Jantz piece, but don't think it should be pressed to do more than it claims. As they write, \"We make no claim that Boas made deceptive or ill-contrived conclusions.\"\nYou must of course know that Gravlee et al. did a similar re-analysis and came to quite different conclusions:\nAs Boas hypothesized, our results show that children born in the U.S. environment are markedly less similar to their parents in terms of head form than foreign-born children are to theirs. . . . This finding thus corroborates Boas\u2019s overarching conclusion that the cephalic index is sensitive to environmental influences and, therefore, does not serve as a valid marker of racial phylogeny. (Gravlee et al. 2003:135 ).\nAlso Jantz revisited Boas in 2010, and actually concluded Boas was correct about the differential influence of immigrant environment on cranial changes:\nChange in Hebrew cranial indices resulted from abandoning the practice of cradling infants in America. U.S.-born Sicilian children experienced an environment worse than the one in Europe, and consequently experienced impaired growth. We conclude that the changes Boas observed resulted from specific behavioral and economic conditions unique to each group. (Jantz and Logan 2010:702)\nScaryLarry \u2022 9 years ago\nare German Shepards a social construct?\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Scary Larry, well yes obviously German Shepherds are socially constructed. But to say that does not deny there are real dogs in the world, that there is real variation among dog varieties, and that understanding the human role in creating the German Shepherd doesn't make anything possible--that social construct is very real. For more, please read Anthropology, Sex, Gender, Sexuality: Gender is a Social Construction.\nvimothy \u2022 9 years ago\nIs anything _not_ a social construct?\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nCertainly in some ways we could say that all human knowledge about the world will inevitably entangle with the social. However, what is important here is not the general declaration but the particulars of how it happens and its implications in the world. Explaining how German Shepherds are socially constructed is probably of little importance. Understanding race and gender is a somewhat different issue.\nvimothy \u2022 9 years ago\nWhat needs unpacking is not the social construction \"German Shepherds,\"  but rather \"social construction\" itself. Since everything that can be described is eo ipso a social construction (including the phrase \"social construction\"), why is it necessary to say, or to be able to say, things like, \"the white race is a social construction,\" or, \"the Japanese people are a social construction,\" \"Palestine is a social construction,\" \"Jason Antrosio is a social construction,\" etc, etc?\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Vimothy, the issue really is about the specifics here. It is probably never *necessary* to say any of those things, but sometime it is important to describe how certain social constructions, but not others, have come to be.\nvimothy \u2022 9 years ago\nHere's another thought: are you familiar with the concept of homo sacer? The figure of homo sacer is like that of the medievil outlaw, someone who can be killed without tribunal or adjudication--a kind of non-person, someone who doesn't legally exist. *Anything* can be done to someone who doesn't exist.\nNow, let's say that a race ceases to exist, for some arbitrary reason. It could be \"the white race\" or \"the Ainu\" or \"the French\" or \"Tartars\" or whoever you like according to whatever definition of race you like. Since race is a \"social construct\", does it matter if this particular race ceases to exist?\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Vimothy, again it depends upon the context and the specifics. Indeed when certain groups are defined into or out of legal existence, it can have very real effects. In other cases, it may not matter so much.\nHenry Harpending \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Helga, thanks for the note.\nEric is the first person out of all of them to insist that plasticity is important.  He is perplexed I agree, as most of us are.  It seems that Fisher in 1918 got it right and we are all coming back to the standard quantitative genetic model of a very large number of loci each with small effect on a trait. It is just AgSci 101 but no one takes Ag Sci any more.\nThe breastfeeding effect may or may not be real.  It is easy to dismiss because the data are observational: perhaps brighter women are more likely to breastfeed.  The finding does make sense but the evidence is far from clean.\nI thought that the Weiss and Long paper was all right but along with all the other papers in that group there was an undercurrent of self-righteous preening and posturing, which I despise.  It was painfully clear that no one disagrees about any of the data, so the whole lot frankly comes across as word salad.\nTaking off my scientist hat and putting on my citizen hat, let me propose an analogy to what I think I see in all this.  Imagine that in North America there is a subpopulation (I would say race in conversation with colleagues) that is green. They don't do very well in school nor in the job market since they are sluggish, some of them, and lots of them seem to have a mysterious swelling in their necks.\nThey are the target of earnest social improvers with double doses of Head Start and the like.  Everyone agrees that their problems are caused by discrimination against green people.\nOne day someone notices that their environment over the last few millennia was a region with very high iodine concentrations.  That person proposes experimenting with extra iodine supplementation for green people.  He is immediately shunned and denounced as a racist since the idea of a biological problem is unthinkable.  Goiter could be handled in no time at all but it never happens.\nMy sense of the whole race argument is that it is just like claiming that iodine would be racist in my imaginary sociology.\nMaybe I am just too grouchy and pessimistic in my old age.\nBest, Henry\nHelga Vierich \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Henry; sorry to be so late getting back to this discussion.  You were grouchy and pessimistic before, so it can not be age. I assume it is the \"default setting\" of a person who tends to be smarter than everyone else they talk too.  I suppose you have read about growing awareness of Vit D deficiencies among dark skinned\u2026(ahem) green people, especially among pregnant women, especially as this just might account for the higher rates of physical and cognitive disorders?  In other words, we might have found out what the \"iodine\"problem is.  There has also been an alarm call on this issue for groups where women tend to overdress.  Their babies are often severely deficient in Vit. D.\nSee: Low pre-natal vitamin D doubles schizophrenia risk (http://www.physorg.com/news...,\nMaternal Serum Vitamin D Levels During Pregnancy and Offspring Neurocognitive Development (http://pediatrics.aappublic..., Study links vitamin D, race and cardiac deaths (http://www.physorg.com/news...,\nArab-American women need supplement to boost dangerously low vitamin D levels (http://www.physorg.com/news...,\nNew evidence shows low vitamin D levels lead to Parkinson's disease, (http://www.physorg.com/news...\nCancer: Vitamin D in a New Light \u00ab Quantum Pranx (http://quantumpranx.wordpre...\nVitamin D levels lower in African-Americans, research finds, BMC Evolutionary Biology | Full text | (http://www.sciencedaily.com...\nSchizophrenia and Vitamin D Related Genes Could Have Been Subject to Latitude-driven Adaptation ( http://www.biomedcentral.co...,\nVitamin D deficiency may play a role in depression (http://www.medical-hypothes... ),\nIs there convincing biological or behavioral evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to brain dysfunction?

If you know how to correct this, please do)\nJason Antrosio \u2022 9 years ago\nHi Helga, Hi Henry, thank you for returning to this thread and the additional comments. I've been meaning to compose a longer reply regarding Turkheimer. Like Helga, I don't necessarily read it as \"throwing in the towel.\" In fact, one could read it quite the opposite, as Turkheimer's attempt to assimilate genetics to things social science has already understood: \"Genomics is only now learning a hard lesson that social scientists had to learn a long time ago: sometimes prediction is just prediction\" (2011:240).\nIn any case, what has always been very puzzling to me--especially after this conversation on Razib's blog got transformed into something very different after Jerry Coyne--is why the terminology of race will inevitably resurface, always appearing and reappearing on both sides of the equation. Take, for example, this sentence from Razib's latest posting about race on The Crux: \"Race, the way we have traditionally thought of it, is indeed a social construction. But whether racial groups are purely a biological myth is debatable.\" Razib then says that \"The key issue is to move beyond the term race\" but it is tremendously unclear anyone will be doing that soon.\nThe question is why. I would argue that the reappearance of race on both sides of that equation cannot be because of the science. There is hardly some sort of pristine race concept in biology that really helps us understand human difference. But I think Henry's comment above about the sluggish green people, as combined with comments from JB and Chuck on my follow-up to this post reveals the reason why race will inevitably appear and re-appear. It's about social policy and politics, mostly in the US, with a small international component.\nAs I mentioned above, I'm working on these issues for a much longer piece, but it's going to take some time. I appreciate the additional comments and will check in again when that's ready.\nDavid Reed \u2022 10 years ago\nTo my mind we need to address the misuse of race categorization in medical genetics. There is a persist naive approach that is too often taken. I see it as a big failing in disease genetics. Often ancestry is completely assumed through self-identified race, with no other consideration. There is very little attention given to admixture models, population history, the  evolution of the genetic loci in question, etc. It is all swept under the self-identified race classification, as though that provides the best way to group individuals for case-control comparison. For example, in what sense is Hispanic equivalent to Asian as a racial category suitable for genetic disease association research?\nHenry Harpending \u2022 10 years ago\nCan you give us some examples?  My thought would be that one should use what information is available, taking careful family histories, race, or whatever.\nI understand that there is a drug called Bidil that is approved for African-Americans (is this right?).  If so, and if I were a Somali, I would be pretty wary of taking it without knowing more than I do.  I would presume that the difference between the ecology of tropical Africa and the ecology of the Horn would be pretty obvious to any physician and that he would not push Bidil on Somalis but I sure don't know.\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nA quick search on Bidil and anthropology led me to this great post by John Hawks, Race and medicine: the BiDil trial (2005). As Hawks puts it \"Blacks have good reason to be suspicious of studies like this, and not only for a historical reason. Race is a miserable substitute for the knowledge of alleles and genotypes in a study like this one.\"\nOne advantage to bringing down the cost of actual allele and genotype sequencing is it makes it less necessary to rely on race as \"a miserable substitute\" for better analysis. Barbujani and Colonna 2010 make a similar statement:\nPopulations are indeed structured in the geographical space but, when it comes to predicting individual DNA features, labels such as \u2018European\u2019, \u2018Asian\u2019 and the like are misleading because members of the same group, Watson and Venter in this case, can be very different. Indeed, the only safe way to know what is in a person\u2019s DNA is to study that person\u2019s DNA, and this is now both feasible and cheap. (Human genome diversity: frequently asked questions, 292)\nHelga Vierich \u2022 9 years ago\nHenry I just went back and reread the Still Missing paper. I don't think he is throwing in the towel, he just sounds totally perplexed. He makes no mention of the way that plasticity is built in to all the chains of missing links between the individual genome and the final phenotype and its behaviour. We now know that being breastfed can alter a child's IQ, for Pete's sake. And the people doing the genome analyses forget that the genes are not everything, they are just the starting point of the organism. What is the most impotent environmental factor to which the organism must adapt?  It is culture. Please give me some feedback on this, if you can spare the time. By the way, what did you think of Weiss and Long's paper?\nHelga Vierich \u2022 10 years ago\nI have read Henry Harpending's papers, particularly those touching on race, with interest over the years, partly because they are so good, and partly because I have fond memories of him and Pat Draper, (for the help they offered me, when i was first undertaking fieldwork among the Kua in Botswana,) over that memorable lunch with Richard Lee. I have a question for him, if he returns to this blog.  What can we do to bring non-anthropologists, particularly evolutionary biologists and psychologists up to speed with cutting edge genetic information in Anthropology?  We are so far from \"popular\" concepts of race now, I know, but how to get the message out there so that other scientists do not get bogged down (again?) in confusions arising from the differences between human variation (including plasticity) and social constructs of race?\nHenry Harpending \u2022 10 years ago\nHi Helga.  I enjoyed your back and forth on the Dawkins website.  I really do not think that there is much we can do to \"bring non-anthropologists up to speed....\" since I think most of them are way ahead of us.  While I appreciate Jason's response to my questions in a post of his following this one, I am still left with the feeling that anthropologists are tilting at windmills that everyone else has bypassed long ago.\nI have to say that if I were the emperor of Anthropology I would jump start our colleagues by imposing a strict moratorium on papers about race.  This would (hope!) force them to confront current issues in the wider literature.\nFor a start I would have everyone read\npeople.virginia.edu/~ent3c/...\nby Eric Turkheimer, much of it about the \"Visscher program\".  Turkheimer is a first-rate psychologist and a leader among the skeptics of the Rushton-Jensen view of human cognitive differences.  One can read this article as him throwing in the towel, more or less.\nBest, Henry\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nDear Professor Harpending,\nMany thanks for stopping by my blog and commenting. It's quite an honor.\nRazib has posted the articles from the Race Reconciled symposium in a zip file here: http://www.gnxp.com/wp/wp-c...\nPlease let me know if that doesn't work.\nI believe your comments deserve fuller treatment than would be appropriate for a comment-stream reply. I'm working on that as a new post and apologize for the delay in responding.\nThank you again,\nJason\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nFinally--here's the new post-- Race redux: What are people \u201ctilting against\u201d?\nThank you for suggesting Guido Barbujani--very helpful!\nHenry Harpending \u2022 10 years ago\nThis is a note of thanks for your gracious engagement with Razib: we certainly need more discussion of this caliber.\nI do have a request for you.  I have been reading the same papers on this topic for 40 years, and nothing changes.  In particular, no one disagrees about the data, and Lewontin's Fst is the same as it was way back then.  Many, including yourself, are concerned with correcting 'traditional' or 'popular' concepts of race.  What are these?  You mention that you encounter these in your undergraduates.  Interestingly I don't.  A careful description of just what people like those in the AAPA symposium are tilting against would sure help.  Razib's distinction between the science of race and people's lived perception or race is helpful, but I would think science has little or nothing to say about the latter, it being more in the domain of humanities and of cultural anthropology.\nApparently, as you say above, the only disagreement about anything at the AAPA symposium (it is behind the Wiley paywall for me) is about how lumpy the pudding is.  Surely there are ways to measure the lumpiness and answer the question.  Guido Barbujani, for example, is an old hand at issues like this.  Why chatter about something when one can come up with a ruler and measure it?\nSeinundZeit \u2022 10 years ago\nAn interesting perspective on these issues from a population-genetic vantage point is this old (yet eerily relevant, and vindicated) paper from Alan R. Templeton http://www.unl.edu/rhames/c.... In all honesty, there is no real debate when it comes to \"race\". Frank B. Livingstone cleared this up long ago. Nay, the basic principles of Darwinian theory have crystal clear implications for any kind of biological Platonism. It is (and has been for a long time) axiomatic that all living humans belong to a single subspecies, and the isolation-by-distance model is amongst the most consistently demonstrated conceptualizations produced by population genetics in relation to our species (and perhaps the most predictive). Nobody can honestly argue with either our status as Homo sapiens sapiens, or with isolation-by-distance. The resurrection of multiregional theory further augments both of these notions. Clades and trees have been dead for a long time, and clines and trellises are where all the research points to (for humans at least). There is no better place to apply Darwinian theory and abandon Platonism than our own species. As for Structure/Frappe/Admixture-like software, I think this paper clears up a lot of issues in a reasonable way http://genome.cshlp.org/con....\nrazib \u2022 10 years ago\narguing against platonism is a strawman. no geneticist believes this. that's the stupid public. as for humans, isolation-by-distance was stronger a few years ago, and looks to get moderately weaker as a null in the next few years from what i can tell (papers to be published, blah, blah). i assume you'll update your awesome knowledge of the field appropriately ;-)\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nHi Razib,\nIndeed, as I wrote in my post, there was one fundamental difference in the \"Race Reconciled\" Symposium between those favoring isolation-by-distance and others arguing for new models. However, the co-authors of Non-Darwinian estimation: My ancestors, my genes' ancestors in Genome Research (2009) are quite aware of this critique and yet emerge with arguments that cannot be readily dismissed as strawmen.\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nDear SeinundZeit,\nThank you for stopping by and many thanks for these references. I love Templeton's work--we really should have listened to him more carefully on understanding multiregional theory, and I'm glad you pointed me to this paper. I'm also very glad you pointed out the paper by Weiss and Long. It exactly raises the issues that I've been trying to ponder during my browsing of the genetic-clustering blogs. Tremendously helpful.\nrazib \u2022 10 years ago\nBut I seriously wonder whether that means a real understanding of that discourse or just some kind of vague parroting of received wisdom. Also, I find people really wanting to believe lines like \u201crace is a social construction\u201d because they really want to believe we already (or should) live in a colorblind society, and so they readily use this discourse to deny any reality to the lived experience of race and inequalities organized around racial categories.\nyes, lots of parroting. no to the issue of color blind society. most geneticists are conventionally liberal, so accept the standard stuff about white privilege, etc (at least rhetorically). what you're talking about applies to conservatives (fyi, i'm a conservative).\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nHi Razib,\nInteresting observations. This may help explain--my perception--why some people on your site feel so persecuted, perhaps not just from social science but within the conventionally liberal geneticist world.\nMy observations are mostly from undergraduates, so a bit different take...\nrazib \u2022 10 years ago\n. This isn\u2019t mirrored in biologists (maybe I mean geneticists or some other more specific term) knowledge of the social sciences discussions of race.\nthe social science discourse is culturally normative amongst educated people. most geneticists know (whether they accept race as useful or not, which is separate).\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nHi Razib, thank you for the comment. It may be the case that certain parts of the social science discourse are \"culturally normative.\" But I seriously wonder whether that means a real understanding of that discourse or just some kind of vague parroting of received wisdom. Also, I find people really wanting to believe lines like \"race is a social construction\" because they really want to believe we already (or should) live in a colorblind society, and so they readily use this discourse to deny any reality to the lived experience of race and inequalities organized around racial categories.\nwhosyourboi \u2022 10 years ago\nI can't help but feel that social scientists in general and social anthropologists in particular are constantly having to account for a biological concept of race, such as there is one. This seems to be because biological discussions of race reach the general public (unfortunately often filtered through preexisting stereotypes of race and ethnicity). This leads to a reasonable aquaintence with the biological discussion, in fact it is often the biological subject about which social anthropologists are most informed. This isn't mirrored in biologists (maybe I mean geneticists or some other more specific term) knowledge of the social sciences discussions of race. This wouldn't really be important if biological research went on in a social vacuum but clearly it doesn't. No suggestions or condemnations here, just an observation and a lament.\nJason Antrosio \u2022 10 years ago\nHi, thank you for the comment. Based on my sojourn into the Gene Expression comment stream, I am inclined to both agree and disagree. It seems that at least some of the people doing up these gene-clustering accounts see social scientists as completely oblivious to the biological discussions, but that they know what is going on in the social sciences. Based on the fact that I haven't seen too much discussion in the social sciences of developments like \"Lewontin's Fallacy\" (not saying that this is definitively proven, just saying it has been under-discussed), it does not seem like social scientists have enough knowledge of some of the biological discussions. However and conversely, I have not found much acknowledgement from there of some of the post-Lewontin developments in anthropology.\nrazib \u2022 10 years ago\nWhich surely makes me wonder where exactly do the lines get drawn between hybridized and ancestral? Doesn\u2019t that software seem to require quite a bit of reading and interpretation? Maybe even a bit of\u2026 art?\nalso, if you know pop gen and the assumptions in the programs the results are easier to interpret. e.g., the long branch of the kalash and mozabites are cuz the program doesn't take into account the different rates of genetic drift of different pops.\nrazib \u2022 10 years ago\nWhich surely makes me wonder where exactly do the lines get drawn between hybridized and ancestral?

Your comment about species is definitely interesting and would have been part of another point, but I ran out of steam. It does seem curious to me with all we are learning biologically about species boundaries being more permeable than usually imagined--and of course with the Neandertal and Denisovan admixture results--that it's a strange time to be ramping up the delineation of sub-species or race. I write a bit more about this in the page on Denisovans and Neandertals as human races which suggests--following Milford Wolpoff--that Neandertals are best seen as a true \"human race.\"\nThanks again,\nJason\nrazib \u2022 10 years ago\nIt does seem curious to me with all we are learning biologically about species boundaries being more permeable than usually imagined\nif you talk to plant biologists they wouldn't have been surprised. the 'species concepts' are highly problematic. they're useful though. but context specific.\nCategories\nAnthropologists\nAnthropology Blogs\nAnthropology Courses\nArchaeology\nBiological Anthropology\nCultural Anthropology\nDiscuss White Privilege\nMoral Optimism\nScathing Anthropology\nWhat is Anthropology?\nTags\nagriculture ambushing anthropology anthropology branding assessment capitalism cultural relativism culture David Brooks Denisovans education empathy Eric Wolf ethnobiogeny evolution fieldwork gender genetics globalization gun violence human nature immigration introduction to anthropology Jared Diamond Latin America Michel-Rolph Trouillot natural selection Neandertals niche construction Nicholas Wade occupy planning political economy politics primates primatology race race mixing racism Ruth Benedict sex sexuality Sidney Mintz sports textbooks Tim Ingold\nRecommended Products\nLiving Anthropologically uses the GeneratePress blogging theme combined with Social Warfare share plug-in.

Figuring that the statement was simply being used as an indication of how ridiculous and harmful racism is, I was on board with it. I even used it in conversation a couple times.\nDuring a discussion in another course, a fellow student of color mockingly repeated the phrase, \u201cRace is a social construct.\u201d At first, I had to wonder why this phrase was worthy of mockery. Perhaps some people find it too lofty, I thought. But soon I realized that the idea of race as a social construct can sometimes bring us to a conclusion that is anything but progressive.\nYes, race is socially constructed rather than biologically based. Bill Nye has said so himself. From a scientific standpoint, he is right. However, I fear many people will use his sentiment, and other similar ideas, as a way to discount racism. Many people mistakenly view the term \u201csocial construct\u201d as being synonymous with non-existent. As a result, people take this view even further by trying to silence people of color when we speak about instances of racism or take pride in our racial identities.\nA while back, my Facebook News Feed was filled with friends sharing a spoken word poem by a black poet named Patrick Ea, in which he says, \u201cI am not black; you are not white.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cThese labels were made up to divide us,\u201d and he challenges his audience to shed racial labels.\nI\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that I found parts of the video beautiful. But I can\u2019t ignore the glaring problem. The poem disregards a large chunk of history. The poet says that race was created to divide us, but that\u2019s only part of the story. Race was constructed as a means to justify the oppression and economic exploitation of people of color, and that\u2019s the important part that leads his argument astray. Within the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen Raven-Symon\u00e9 choosing not to identify as African-American in what turned out to be the first of many controversial comments. This mentality of shedding one\u2019s racial identity to create a \u201ccolorblind society\u201d may be the result of some not understanding the context in which race is discussed as socially constructed.\nThis lack of contextualizing and understanding is what makes so many people of color cringe at the expression \u201crace is a social construct,\u201d as my classmate did. For some of us, hearing that idea sets off the \u201calarm.\u201d The alarm is a term coined by W.E.B. DuBois that is described accurately by Nicholas Powers in the following passage from his article for the Indypendent, titled \u201cWhy I Yelled at the Kara Walker Exhibit\u201d:\nThe \u2018alarm\u2019 is a reflex most minorities have, it\u2019s a rising anxiety that signals you are surrounded by people too privileged to know they\u2019re hurting you. Or who would not care if they did. It can beep quietly. Or blare like a foghorn. The alarm is part of the psychological package that W.E.B. Du Bois described in his 1903 book The Souls of Black Folk as, \u2018double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\u2019s self through the eyes of others.\u2019\nIf you are a member of any oppressed group, this feeling is probably familiar.\nThe reason the alarm goes off upon hearing that \u201crace is a social construct\u201d is not because of the statement itself\u2014rather, it is because of the fear of what is likely to come out of the person\u2019s mouth next. It is all too common for this same person to tell us to \u201cstop making everything about race.\u201d Many people believe the only way to end racism is to throw away the concept of race altogether. However, what many people of color hear is: We should not be proud of our racial identities.\nWhat many people who believe in \u201ccolorblindness\u201d do not understand is that many people of color are now proud to wear the labels that were once used to stigmatize us. It shows what we have prevailed through years of oppression, but others think identifying this way is just further fueling racism. Thinking critically about race does not contribute to racism. And a colorblind society is not the solution to racism. In fact, the conclusion we reach should be quite the opposite. The only way to fully end racism is to think about race critically and frequently. We need to realize that racism lives within every one of us and within many facets of our society. Then we need to work to fix it.\nThis includes talking about who constructed the idea of race and why. Europeans used race to justify their colonization and oppression of people of color. It was the justification for murders, rapes, conquest, slavery and many other forms of dehumanization. Because of this so-called \u201csocial construct,\u201d white supremacy has continued to poison our society for centuries. The lives, opinions, and well-being of people of color are valued significantly less than those of whites. Although race was \u201cconstructed\u201d centuries ago, innocent Black men, women, and children are still beaten and killed by authorities every day.\nMany white people view race as having a significant correlation to human worth, and have for centuries. Conveniently deciding to ignore race now can\u2019t undo all of that oppression. If white supremacists are treating people of color as if we\u2019re lesser beings, the way to counter this is not by saying, \u201cRace isn\u2019t even real.\u201d That\u2019s hardly a strong enough argument against the oppression people of color continue to experience. To be on the right side of history, we must fight back by calling people out when they say or do something racist. We must let them know their opinions are based on harmful ideas created years ago to justify the dehumanization of people of color.\nYes, race is a social construct. No, that does not make it\u2014or the impact of racism\u2014 trivial.\nSo does this mean people should stop saying that race is a social construct? After all, the phrase itself is not inherently racist, but it can be associated with racist ideas that involve silencing the voices of people of color. I believe that if there\u2019s a common association between a phrase and a problematic idea, then using the phrase may lead to criticism. When oppressed people hear something associated with an oppressive concept, the alarm goes off in our heads. This is the same alarm that sounds when we experience microagressions, which cause us to feel less safe or comfortable, even if we are not experiencing direct or overt bigotry.\nOf course, one may acknowledge the roots of how race was constructed in hopes of moving towards ways we can end racism. So, what is the most effective way of doing this? First, it\u2019s important that we point to the origin of this construct and its harmful effects on today\u2019s society. We need to direct our anger at the oppressor, not the oppressed. Then, we need to truly assess the way we look at race. While we should never \u201cstop seeing color,\u201d we need to change the way we see it. We need to remove the lens through which we see whiteness as the default. If race was constructed, then whiteness was constructed too.\nBecause race was socially constructed by Europeans, white people are seen as \u201craceless,\u201d whereas people of color are racialized. This leads us to see white people through the lens of personhood before race, while not giving people of color the same treatment. We end up seeing people of color as representatives of their respective races instead of as unique individuals. Ultimately, this rhetoric dehumanizes people of color and perpetuates racism.\nIt needs to be understood that people of color talking openly about our racial identities is not the same as reinforcing racism. It is the result of being proud of our success and tenacity after being placed at the bottom of a social hierarchy. People of color have adapted to being racialized by owning the labels that society gave us, and this is an important part of fighting racism. It fuels us to enter white spaces unabashedly while also creating our own.\nDismantling racism is a complex issue, but one thing is for sure: Racism is very real and we all need to challenge it within our society. We need not focus on the fact that race does not exist biologically, but rather on the fact that race was created to instill a horrible social hierarchy that continues to exist. Race exists to keep people of color out of power and ultimately to strip us of our basic human rights. The fact that race is a social construct is a reason that we should be talking about it, not a reason to ignore it. \u201cRace is a social construct\u201d shouldn\u2019t be the end of a conversation about race. It should be the beginning.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nZola Ray is passionate about exploring race, gender and other aspects of the human experience through her writing.

Now, the view of race as a social construct is not necessarily wrong, depending on what one means by \u2018race\u2019, and especially by \u2018social construct\u2019. Yet as I\u2019ve proposed elsewhere, scientists are often poor communicators, and the reality of what they\u2019re arguing can be muddied by everything from word choice to an inability to meaningfully parse definitions. Usually, the science, itself, is not at fault. It is really the packaging of science to an even less sophisticated audience that\u2019s at issue, particularly when it deals with a highly politicized topic whose buzzwords are valued over nuance and hard data. No, race is not a social construct, but what does this mean, exactly? Moreover, what does it mean politically? Finally, what should it mean for liberals who are uncomfortable with what is, at bottom, a simple misunderstanding of their own principles?\nPrior to deconstructing all this, let us look at the key claims, and \u2013 perhaps even more importantly \u2013 how these claims get articulated. The position of the American Anthropological Association is clear- race\u2019s primary importance is social rather than biological. The issue, however, is that one can construe any number of sentences, within, as either attesting to or rejecting the existence of race as a taxonomic category. This is unfortunate, and many political activists have latched on to the statement as \u2018proof\u2019 that race is biologically meaningless. Others, like this study from 2012, note that the sentence \u201cNo races exist now or ever did\u201d found only 17% agreement among scientists 40 years ago, with 53% agreeing today. Yet even 53% is still a far cry from ideological certainty on the Left about what is, in essence, a semantic question whose answer might very well change based on the conceptual categories the word calls to mind.\nIn \u2018pop\u2019 science, writers often lay out some of the most common objections to race, which, while on one level quite valid, are also quite incomplete. There is much to comb through (most of it not worth the time), but I\u2019ve distilled them into six basic arguments laid out in ascending order of correctness. If anyone gets tripped up by my handling of earlier points, read all of my responses to them, first, to get a better sense of the science:\n1. There is no race gene, which means the genetic underpinnings of race are quite tenuous\nThe first part of this statement is obvious, and undeniable. There is no \u2018race\u2019 gene because race is not any one thing. Rather, it is a genetic complex which encompasses everything from skin color, to disease propensity/resistance, to facial proportions, to the distribution of sweat glands, hair color, and more. No, you cannot simply use one marker for determining race and ancestry, but the more genetic markers are used, the greater the likelihood (in fact, it is a near-certainty) of being able to trace one\u2019s roots. By contrast, there is no such thing as a \u2018gay\u2019 gene. Yet would liberals be comfortable arguing that therefore there is NO genetic basis for sexual preference? Obviously, there is, much to right-wing dismay, although it is not the simplification progressives wish it to be, either, partly because- from a political standpoint- it ought not matter either way. There is also no such thing as the \u2018basketball\u2019 or \u2018math\u2019 gene, although it would be silly to suggest that at least the predisposition for a given skill, all other variables being equal, has no genetic basis whatsoever. In the same way, race is, to the naked eye, a very rough but pragmatic way of dividing some (actually, a tiny fraction of) human characteristics that, due to accidents of evolution, happen to be quite visible much of the time, despite being none too salient from a purely biological standpoint. Yet \u2018salience\u2019 is a very different quality from \u2018existence\u2019, and it is their conflation that is often at the heart of such disagreements.\n2. Race-based thinking has been quite dangerous in the past, and any attempts to further use such is simply\u2026 [insert moral panic here]\nThis is absolutely true, but also misleading. In short, while it is true that race-based thinking has and will continue to be abused for questionable political goals, the solution cannot be to shy away from biology-first discussions of race\u2026if only we engage in such for the purpose of discrediting them. It really bears repeating that the reason why liberals tend to hate concepts like human nature or sexual dimorphism is because they don\u2019t understand their own politics. Liberals ought not preach tolerance and equality due to a proposed lack of innate differences, but in spite of them: meaning, whatever we might discover of human variation should not figure into deeper issues of rights and dues. Otherwise, this would degrade liberalism into mere right-wing lunacy, which is often their de facto position because- whether they admit it or not- it strikes so many of them as reasonable, since they lack an intellectual framework from which to rebut it.\n3. It is difficult, if not impossible, to categorize races genetically, or to merely \u2018eyeball\u2019 them, partly because the concept itself changes over time\nNow, this is where things get interesting, since we can actually start to deal in nuance. First, for a good layman\u2019s perspective on all this, I\u2019d recommend watching this short video on race and genetics. Note what is said about midway in- that, from a purely genetic basis, we can (if we so choose) split the races into our modern, conventional denominations with good accuracy. This is important, since it is a de facto admission of race, even as the video\u2019s comments are filled with ideologues who wish to cherry-pick the data for their own agenda.\nSecond, to get a deeper appreciation of why this is so, let us now consider Lewontin\u2019s Fallacy, A.W.F. Edwards\u2019s classic response to Richard Lewontin\u2019s thesis on human variation. Edwards\u2019s objection, in short, is that while the bulk of human variation is in fact overwhelmingly non-racial, as Lewontin claims, the pattern of this variation has tell-tale signs that indicate racial categories\u2026if, again, we so wish to tap them over other, more salient categories. This is why complaining about a missing race gene is pointless when we could simply look at genetic clustering. To quote the Wikipedia link directly:\nEdwards argued that while Lewontin\u2019s statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different\u00a0alleles (variants of a particular gene) at an individual\u00a0locus\u00a0(the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time. This happens because differences in the frequency of alleles at different loci are correlated across populations\u2014the alleles that are more frequent in a population at two or more loci are correlated when we consider the two populations simultaneously. Or in other words, the frequency of the alleles tends to cluster differently for different populations.\nThis is undeniable, and yet, I\u2019m often amused to the silly responses to A.W.F. Edwards. Turning back to the Wikipedia page, it is only the now-nutty Richard Dawkins who makes genuine sense in his critique \u2013 even if one might disagree with Dawkins\u2019s concept of \u2018taxonomic significance\u2019 being defined by anything that\u2019s merely \u2018informative\u2019. This is technically true, but opens up taxonomy to an almost infinite reduction that becomes less and less useful the deeper one goes, which is the spirit of Edwards\u2019s original comment.\nKaplan and Winther note that Edwards is in fact correct, even as Lewontin\u2019s argument still holds true. They note, for instance, that Edwards\u2019s conclusions do not imply that racial categories are the most basic level of human distinction. But one merely needs to look at Dawkins\u2019s objection to Edwards\u2019s dismissal of racial taxonomy as \u2018non-salient\u2019 to see that Edwards was not arguing for a basic human distinction to begin with. The issue, then, is less with Kaplan and Winther than it is the way that opponents of race might latch on their critique as a critique of Edwards, himself, which \u2013 by not dealing with his real point \u2013 cannot even be a genuine criticism. It is merely a distillation of Edwards\u2019s own beliefs on an unrelated topic. Jonathan Marks and several other anthropologists are likewise quoted as if in response to Edwards, even though, again, they are simply shedding light on the claims\u2019 surrounds, and not engaging with the claims as written.\nReading further, Dorothy Roberts throws out a series of red herrings meant to distract one from the argument. It is strange, indeed, to read any number of correct claims, from the thinness of purely racial variation in terms of total genetic makeup, to her assertion that no racial group has an exclusive claim on a genetic marker, as if any of this has anything to do with what\u2019s under discussion. The question Edwards addressed was NOT whether it makes good taxonomic sense to categorize people into races, but whether we can. The answer, of course, is that we can, and do, even if one could then (and only then) argue that it is a non-salient method of categorization.\nIn other words, we are getting a lot of uncomfortable circling about the issue, and yet, I am not exactly sure why it must be at all uncomfortable. To say \u2018 Edwards is right, but\u2026 \u2019 implies that Edwards\u2019s argument cannot, as stated, be consistent with a liberal position on race. This is simply untrue, as I\u2019ve already pointed out, and a misunderstanding of both liberalism and science.\n4. \u2018Population\u2019 is a better term for race than \u2018race\u2019\nThis is actually something I can get behind, provided there is some mechanism to prevent the slippery-slope thinking I\u2019ve outlined. \u2018Race\u2019, obviously, is a very loaded word, with implications that often go well beyond what is scientifically reasonable. It is, in that sense, a poor way of communicating genetic makeup. At the same time, \u2018population\u2019 has the contextual disadvantage of having been hijacked by activists who, while denying the underlying basis of race, nonetheless use it in instances where the word \u2018race\u2019 might mean the same thing. The trick, then, is to re-organize public perceptions of what race is, not by sanitizing it, but treating it as no more (and no less!) than what we know it to be. A change of language can be useful to this end, as long as it is not used as a mask for reality.\n5. The conventional notion of race is a very crude and biologically arbitrary way of categorizing human beings\nThe first part of the statement is true. Given that there are, literally, a million ways we can categorize human beings, from height, to eye color, to intelligence, to predisposition for patellar dislocation, with many potential categories having more intrinsic genetic weight than the genetics of race, there is something going on here other than science. But is it \u2018arbitrary\u2019? Perhaps, although one must limit one\u2019s definition of \u2018arbitrary\u2019 to pure salience in that case: meaning, there are better categories out there, not that this category has no intrinsic basis.\n6. There is a great deal of human genetic variation, but only a fraction of it (perhaps 6%) can be ascribed race\nThis is the least controversial of the six claims, and both the start and end point for better understanding race, as well as settling on a better way of discussing it. Consider, really, what the above means- if there is a consistent percentage of genetic material that can reliably be patterned into racial categories, the implicit admission is that there is a predictable and quantifiable basis for \u2018race\u2019, period. There is, obviously, a lot more that can be said here, but at least this much cannot be denied, and any position that hopes to occlude this fact would be dishonest.\nSecond, this 6% racial variation is- depending on whom you ask- either salient, or not. Those, for example, who know nothing of evolution and the origins of human intelligence will assert genuine intellectual gaps between races, while those who are troubled even a little by the concept of race might suppose this variation is purely limited to skin color. Yet when I say this variation is unimportant, I mean exactly that- it will, by itself, tell you next to nothing about the salient features of a human being. It will tell you only what we have evolved to accept as salient, which is ethnicity. This may be hard to understand, but ethnicity in the Ancestral Environment meant a lot more than skin color. It also meant- with decent probability- that \u2018this\u2019 person was a potential threat, or \u2018that\u2019 person a potential ally who might share both your values as well as your taboos. As Joseph Henrich writes in The Secret Of Our Success:\nFinally, the psychological machinery that underpins how we think about \u2018race\u2019 actually evolved to parse ethnicity, not race. You might be confused by this distinction since race and ethnicity are so often mixed up. Ethnic-group membership is assigned based on culturally-transmitted markers, like language or dialect. By contrast, racial groups are marked and assigned to perceived morphological traits, like skin color or hair form, which are genetically transmitted. Our folk-sociological abilities evolved to pick out ethnic groups or tribes. However, cues such as skin color or hair form can pose as ethnic markers in the modern world because members of different ethnic groups sometimes also share markers like skin color or hair form, and racial cues can automatically and unconsciously \u2018trick\u2019 our psychology into thinking that different ethnic groups exist. And this by-product can be harnessed and reified by cultural evolution to create linguistically labeled racial categories and racism.\nUnderlining this point is the fact that racial cues do not have cognitive priority over ethnic cues: when children or adults encounter a situation in which accent or language indicate \u2018same ethnicity\u2019 but skin color indicates \u2018different race,\u2019 the ethnolinguistic markers trump the racial markers. That is, children pick as a friend someone of a different race who speaks their dialect over someone of the same race who speaks a different dialect. Even weaker cues like dress can sometimes trump racial cues. The tendency of children and adults to preferentially learn and interact with those who share their racial markers (mistaken for ethnic cues) probably contributes to the maintenance of cultural differences between racially marked populations, even in the same neighborhood.\nMy point is that because of culture-gene coevolution, humans reliably develop the psychological equipment to map and navigate a world of immense cultural diversity. However, in mapping the social world around us using both our own observation and culturally acquired categories, our folk-sociological system, like our visual system, errs on the side of providing us with only the essential landmarks and main avenues around us, while ignoring lots of detail. Thus, the dynamically shifting gradations and clines of cultural variation are often rendered as a snapshot in stark relief.\nNow we\u2019re getting closer to an actual theory of race that liberals can work with, rather than embarrassing themselves with poor word choice and wishful thinking. Yes, it is perfectly acceptable to say that white and black people might, as a purely psychological tendency, prefer their own in-groups- provided, of course, that they grow up believing themselves to really be part of that group. The first point is a constant, but the second is pure acculturation. Yet if this is admitted, it must also be admitted that this tendency is nothing more than a cognitive bias no different from the other biases we have had to shutter. \u2018Race realists\u2019 (i.e., alt-right dummies) like to say \u2018tough luck\u2019, and propose wholesale segregation as a means of getting over this problem. Yet this is would be as logical as giving into the cognitive bias which offers women preferential treatment in criminal courts, or cult leaders power over their followers. These are, obviously, human failings to be weeded out, not embraced out of some vaginal approach to life\u2019s difficulties.\nThese, then, are my recommendations. First, scientists ought to take a deep breath and stop putting out well-meaning but poorly executed statements on race. If publications write misleading headlines that are not in line with a more nuanced understanding of anthropology (\u201crace does not exist\u201d), scientists ought to push back, and stop giving straws for racist morons to grasp. If anything, the perception of science as politically-motivated is going to be far more damaging than putting out the whole story and merely hoping for the best. The point is that racists will find ad hoc rationalizations for anything, and in anything- this is how ideology works! Worrying about a subsection of idiots does nothing but encourage pandering, which brings everyone else down too.\nSecond, there ought to be at least a few universally agreed-upon statements on race for both scientists as well as laypersons, even if that means the willfully ignorant might do their best to cherry-pick. Put another way, if there is no point of departure, there is also no real aim. Yet science has a goal. What is it? Once this question is treated seriously, the following will no longer be too controversial:\n1.\u00a0 There is a vast and quantifiable difference between the words \u2018salient\u2019 and \u2018real\u2019 that should never be confused.\n2. Race is not a social construct, but real, at least in the sense that we can reliably corral human beings into racial categories according to patterns in a tiny fraction of their genetic makeup.\n3. Although we can taxonomically divide people into races, the deeper question is whether we in fact should, given the existence of hundreds of other potentially more salient categories.\n4. This is not a political project, but a scientific one, since liberal principles should remain unchanged even with the discovery of racial hierarchies.\nThe question now, I guess, is whether liberals are self-secure enough to truly believe #4. Ask yourself, really, whether you\u2019d feel comfortable advocating for equal treatment even in the face of some unfortunate race-based group tendency. If not, you best practice your best salute, and leave liberalism to the liberals.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAlex Sheremet\nI am a writer and video essayist, as well as the author of Woody Allen: Reel To Real.\nPREVIOUS POST\n\u2190 Analysis Of Hart Crane\u2019s BLACK TAMBOURINE\nNEXT POST\nReview Of Woody Allen\u2019s STARDUST MEMORIES (1980) \u2192\n\u2192\nAlex Sheremet December 17, 2019 at 2:20 pm\nNew scientific discoveries from the past decade should be taken into account when discussing the concept of race. Since the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010, it has come to light that about 1-2% of the genomes of modern humans descended from the last successful Out of Africa migration (50-70k years ago), that is to say Eurasian populations and their derivatives, are composed of introgressed Neanderthal DNA. This proportion varies across populations, but is virtually non-existent in Sub-Saharan African populations. North Africans populations that received genes from Eurasians migrating back to Africa have a negligible signature of Neanderthal admixture.\nYes, this is all 100% true- notice that you made a simple, factual description. So far, there\u2019s no normative recommendation, except for the need to add this information to our discussion of race. Then you say this:\nFrom what we know of the Neanderthals, their average cranial capacity was about 1600 cm3 for men and 1300 cm3 for women. This is about 20% greater than modern human averages. From extensive measurements, we know that SSA\u2019s have the smallest average cranial capacity, with Europeans and East Asians having greater cranial capacities, on average and in that order. It just so happens that this is also the order of Neanderthal admixture proportion (~0% for SSA, 1.8-2.4% for West Eurasians, 2.3-2.6% for East Asians).\nWhy do you feel it relevant to bring up Neanderthal brain size? This is non-salient, as it says nothing reliable about a species\u2019s cognitive ability. Yes, Neanderthals had bigger brains, but sperm whales have the biggest brains of all. Oh, but it\u2019s the brain/body mass ratio that\u2019s important; well, mice and human beings have a similar brain/body mass ratio. Then there\u2019s actual brain structures themselves and other confounding variables. For example, Homo floresiensis not only had a small brain, but also a brain/body mass ratio similar to apes. Yet they were making and using tools similar to that of Homo erectus, indicating that there\u2019s more going on than just brain size.\nThe point is that you\u2019ve latched on to a physical feature which might have been important, or might in fact have the same salience as blond hair. Yet you chose to discuss one over the other without first making a case for the salience of one over the other. Why?\nAlso, out of all the potentially salient physical features you could have listed, you chose the exact one that sub-Saharans happen to lack, then used the more flattering phenotype associated with that missing feature, as opposed to bringing attention to a less desirable phenotype of that feature. Why?\nWe have also discovered the existence of other extinct hominin species that contributed to modern human genomes. After the Neanderthals, the most important archaic species is the Denisovans. We have discovered that up to 6% of the genomes of Oceanian populations can be traced back to Denisovan introgression. They also contributed to East Asian and Amerindian populations on the order of <0.2%. Modern Tibetans received genes adapted for survival in high altitudes from the Denisovans.\nOk, but unremarkable.\nTo suggest that these genetic differences, which go down to the level of (sub-)species, do not affect any physiological or cognitive faculties, or behavioral tendencies, across populations is absurd. Especially, if you look at these parameters in the aggregate and highest and lowest bounds.\nThey may have had effects on human behavior, but with only a small % of- say- Neanderthal DNA across human beings, you have no way to know which genes get expressed, what they entail, and how deeply they are mediated by their surroundings vis-a-vis the environment of adaptation. What if, after thousands of generations, the only Neanderthal DNA that could survive in Homo sapiens is that which does not express itself outside of the bounds of what we now term \u2018human\u2019? There\u2019s little reason to emphasize this admixture over (say) the long-term effects of not having local beasts of burden. This means that, yes, all groups have distinctions, they have slightly different combinations of ancestral genes, this can effect behavior, but the same exact thing could have been said about *identical* groups spread into different environments- the \u2018randomization\u2019, therefore, is the same, when you no longer ignore expression.\nThis means you don\u2019t even have to go back to Neanderthal DNA. You can simply find the most violent tribe over 100 miles, map their genome, see the % in others, then construct the same fantastical narrative for them as anyone.\nAlso, the problem with saying \u2018cognitive abilities\u2019 is that you must now supply a fresh theory of intelligence that is consistent with the idea of group cognitive differences across Homo sapiens. *Human* intelligence, as distinct to us, came about in an environment where Homo sapiens was winning the evolutionary game year after year, with the biggest threat to human beings now other human beings, and the greatest advantages lay in extremely nuanced socialization. This was the same everywhere, as all human beings found anywhere had out-competed everything around them. Thus, the cognitive functions that we\u2019d consider most salient (i.e., \u2018most human\u2019) and broadly relevant to survival came from cognitive equipment long in place. Be careful of how much actual work the study of \u201ccognitive faculties\u201d entails, IF you wish to say something knowable and falsifiable about cognitive differences.\nIt should also be noted that \u201cpeople today are genetically more different from people living 5,000 years ago than those humans were different from the Neanderthals who vanished 30,000 years ago, according to anthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin.\u201d\nWell, yeah, the further back in time you go, the closer we all are to the same prokaryotes.\nGiven that human evolution has accelerated in the past 10k years, to the point where the term \u201cmodern human\u201d seems like it should describe something more recent than the 200k+ year old \u201cspecies\u201d it\u2019s meant to describe now, we should go further than just re-thinking our definition for \u201crace.\u201d The terms \u201cspecies\u201d and \u201csub-species\u201d are in need of reevaluation as well.\nSure, but it\u2019s hard to figure out what the categories ought to be, since you can draw the line almost anywhere. Did the 21st century create a new human species? It seems like it, but there\u2019s zero chance of being able to isolate and understand those genes any time soon. What about the advent of city life next to hunter-gatherer life, even if only spaced 1000 years apart? Both gene and gene expression would probably be altered. Is that 1000 year disconnect a new species? This is why speciation is so controversial to begin with.\nAt the rate that new discoveries are happening in fields like paleoanthropology, archaeogenetics and population genetics, as well as cultural shifts regarding these issues (see:Brexit)\u2026\nWhat do you mean by, see Brexit? What are the cultural shifts of Brexit, what do they have to do with those fields, and what are they saying about those fields?"}, {"Url": "https://study.com/learn/lesson/social-construction-race-ethnicity.html", "CluewebURLHash": "FF081009771040727726E4A4C3C76514", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "What Is a Social Construct? | Social Construct: Examples ...", "Snippet": "As mentioned above, \ue000race\ue001 is a powerful \ue000social\ue001 \ue000construct\ue001 for explaining physical, or phenotypical, differences among people.

K. Page.\nAuthor Information\nGo to:\nBackground\nImproving patient safety and other dimensions of health care quality requires change at all four levels of the health care system: (1) the experience of patients during their interactions with individual clinicians; (2) the functioning of small units (microsystems) of care delivery such as surgical teams or nursing units; (3) the practices of organizations that house the microsystems; and (4) the environments of policy, payment, regulation, accreditation, and other factors external to the actual delivery of care that shape the context in which health care organizations deliver care. 1 Several groundbreaking Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports have spurred substantial actions at each of these levels to bring about improvements in patient safety and overall quality.\nThese IOM reports began as the product of the unique Committee on the Quality of Health Care in America created by the IOM in 1998 in response to the accumulating number of studies documenting that the way in which health care has been delivered has not kept pace with the advances in medical technology and our growing knowledge about diseases and how to effectively treat them. The committee\u2019s first report, To Err Is Human, was stunning. This report documented that not only was health care often of poor quality, it was actually unsafe. The report said that between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths every year (more than deaths from breast cancer, AIDS, or motor vehicle accidents) were caused by problems in the way the health care system was designed, not from \u201cbad\u201d doctors, nurses, or other health care workers. 2\nThe report\u2019s message and recommendations for building safer systems of care delivery across the entire U.S. health care system primarily addressed the changes needed at the fourth level of the health care system\u2014where policy, payment, regulation, accreditation, and similar external factors shape the delivery of health care. a Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, the Senate Committee on Appropriations began hearings on medical errors and patient safety.\nAs a result of those hearings, Congress directed the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to lead a national effort to combat medical errors and improve patient safety. AHRQ subsequently established a research and demonstration program to fund research to determine the causes of medical errors and to develop models that minimize the frequency and severity of errors; mechanisms that encourage reporting, prompt review, and corrective action; and methods to minimize paperwork. 3\nGo to:\nNurse Working Conditions\nNursing personnel represent the largest component of the health care workforce. Licensed nurses and unlicensed nursing assistants represent approximately 54 percent of all U.S. health care workers (e.g., physicians, nurses, dentists, allied health professionals, technicians and technologists, and other health care assistants). 4 Registered nurses (RNs) alone constitute approximately 23 percent of the entire health care workforce\u2014the largest portion among all health care workers. These 2.2 million RNs provide health care to individuals in virtually all locations in which health care is delivered\u2014hospitals; long-term care facilities; ambulatory care settings, such as clinics or physicians\u2019 offices; and other settings, including the private homes of individuals, schools, and workplaces. In U.S. hospitals, approximately one of every four hospital employees is a licensed nurse. 5 Although constituting the largest contingent in the health care workforce, nurses are in short supply and competition for them is strong.\nAs part of its portfolio of research and demonstrations, AHRQ contracted with the IOM to study key aspects of the work environment of nurses that likely impact patient safety and identify potential improvements that would likely increase patient safety. AHRQ further directed the IOM to address three issues that have received much attention in Federal and State policy arenas: extended work hours and fatigue, mandatory overtime, and regulation of nurse staffing levels.\nThe report produced by the IOM in response to this charge, Keeping Patients Safe: Transforming the Work Environment of Nurses, 6 is significant for three reasons:\nIt documents the key role that nurses (the largest component of the health care workforce) play in patient safety and makes specific recommendations for changing their work environments to improve patient safety.\nIt highlights the role that an organization\u2019s governing boards, executive leadership, other management personnel, and practices play in patient safety by shaping organizational work environments.\nIt identifies generic workplace processes and characteristics that threaten or protect patient safety, not just with respect to nurses\u2019 actions, but by affecting the actions of all health care practitioners.\nKeeping Patients Safe\u2019s recommendations are addressed to those parties that most directly shape work environments: health care organizations, Federal and State regulators, labor organizations, as well as other leaders in health care and nursing education. (The recommendations are reproduced in the section below, \u201cRecommendations for Promoting Patient Safety in the Work Environments of Nurses.\u201d) However, individual nurses can also use the recommendations of this report to improve work environments in ways that keep patients safe from errors in their health care. The evidence presented in Keeping Patients Safe identifies factors that all nurses should take into consideration in selecting the health care organization in which to be employed, in participating in labor-management discussions, and in interacting in their employing organizations\u2019 efforts to reduce health care errors.\nGo to:\nPractice Implications\nKeeping Patients Safe identifies eight overarching safeguards to protect patient safety that need to be in place within all health care organizations in which nurses work: (1) organizational governing boards that focus on safety; (2) the practice of evidence-based management and leadership; (3) effective nursing leadership; (4) adequate staffing; (5) provision of ongoing learning and clinical decisionmaking support to nursing staff; (6) mechanisms that promote interdisciplinary collaboration; (7) work design practices that defend against fatigue and unsafe work; and (8) a fair and just error reporting, analysis, and feedback system with training and rewards for patient safety (see Table 1 ).\nTable 1\nNecessary Patient Safeguards in the Work Environment of Nurses\nKeeping Patients Safe \u2019s 18 recommendations describe actions health care organizations, governmental policymakers, labor organizations, and other leaders in health care and nursing should take to promote patient safety in nurse work environments. While not directed principally to individual nurses in clinical practice, the recommendations also can be used by nurses to leverage improvements in patient safety. Specifically, the recommendations have corollary questions (presented in Table 2) that nurses should ask of prospective and current employers.\nTable 2\nQuestions Nurses Should Ask Prospective (and Current) Employers About Patient Safety\nGo to:\nRecommendations for Promoting Patient Safety in the Work Environments of Nurses b\nRecommendations for Transformational Leadership and Evidence-Based Management\nCreating work environments for nurses that are most conducive to patient safety will require fundamental changes throughout many health care organizations (HCOs) in terms of how work is designed, how personnel are deployed, and how the very culture of the organization understands and acts on the science of safety. These changes require leadership capable of transforming not just physical environments, but also the beliefs and practices of both nurses and other health care workers providing patient care and those in the HCO who establish the policies and practices that shape those environments\u2014the individuals who constitute the management of the organization.\nLeadership will need to assure the effective use of practices that (1) balance the tension between production efficiency and reliability (safety), (2) create and sustain trust throughout the organization, (3) actively manage the process of change, (4) involve workers in decisionmaking pertaining to work design and work flow, and (5) use knowledge management practices to establish the organization as a \u201clearning organization.\u201d To this end, the committee makes the following recommendations:\nRecommendation 4-1. c\nHCOs should acquire nurse leaders for all levels of management (e.g., at the organization-wide and patient care unit levels) who will:\nParticipate in executive decisions within the HCO.\nRepresent nursing staff to organization management and facilitate their mutual trust.\nAchieve effective communication between nursing and other clinical leadership.\nFacilitate input of direct-care nursing staff into operational decisionmaking and the design of work processes and work flow.\nBe provided with organizational resources to support the acquisition, management, and dissemination to nursing staff of the knowledge needed to support their clinical decisionmaking and actions.\nRecommendation 4-2\nLeaders of HCOs should take action to identify and minimize the potential adverse effects of their decisions on patient safety by:\nEducating board members and senior, midlevel, and line managers about the link between management practices and safety.\nEmphasizing safety to the same extent as productivity and financial goals in internal management planning and reports and in public reports to stakeholders.\nRecommendation 4-3\nHCOs should employ management structures and processes throughout the organization that:\nProvide ongoing vigilance in balancing efficiency and safety.\nDemonstrate trust in workers and promote trust by workers.\nActively manage the process of change.\nEngage workers in nonhierarchical decisionmaking and in the design of work processes and work flow.\nEstablish the organization as a \u201clearning organization.\u201d\nBecause HCOs vary in the extent to which they currently employ the above practices and in their available resources, the committee also makes the following recommendation:\nRecommendation 4-4\nProfessional associations, philanthropic organizations, and other organizational leaders within the health care industry should sponsor collaboratives that incorporate multiple academic and other research-based organizations to support HCOs in the identification and adoption of evidence-based management practices.\nMaximizing Workforce Capability\nMonitoring patient health status, performing therapeutic treatments, and integrating patient care to avoid health care gaps are nursing functions that directly affect patient safety. Accomplishing these activities requires an adequate number of nursing staff with the clinical knowledge and skills needed to carry out these interventions and the ability to effectively communicate findings and coordinate care with the interventions of other members of the patient\u2019s health care team. Nurse staffing levels, the knowledge and skill level of nursing staff, and the extent to which workers collaborate in sharing their knowledge and skills all affect patient outcomes and safety.\nRegulatory, internal HCO, and marketplace (consumer-driven) approaches are traditionally advocated as methods to achieve appropriate staffing levels. The committee determined that each of these approaches has limitations as well as strengths; their coordinated and combined use holds the most promise for achieving safe staffing levels. The committee also took particular note of the need for more accurate and reliable staffing data for hospitals and nursing homes to help make these efforts more effective and to facilitate additional needed research on staffing. Finally, the committee identified a need for more research on hospital staffing for specific types of patient care units, such as medical-surgical and labor and delivery units. The committee therefore makes the following recommendations:\nRecommendation 5-1\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) should update existing regulations established in 1990 that specify minimum standards for registered and licensed nurse staffing in nursing homes. Updated minimum standards should:\nRequire the presence of at least one RN within the facility at all times.\nSpecify staffing levels that increase as the number of patients increase, and that are based on the findings and recommendations of the DHHS report to Congress, Appropriateness of Minimum Nurse Staffing Ratios in Nursing Homes \u2013 Phase II Final Report.7\nAddress staffing levels for nurse assistants, who provide the majority of patient care.\nRecommendation 5-2\nHospitals and nursing homes should employ nurse staffing practices that identify needed nurse staffing for each patient care unit per shift. These practices should:\nIncorporate estimates of patient volume that count admissions, discharges, and \u201cless than full-day\u201d patients in addition to a census of patients at a point in time.\nInvolve direct-care nursing staff in determining and evaluating the approaches used to determine appropriate unit staffing levels for each shift.\nProvide for staffing \u201celasticity\u201d or \u201cslack\u201d within each shift\u2019s scheduling to accommodate unpredicted variations in patient volume and acuity and resulting workload. Methods used to provide slack should give preference to scheduling excess staff and creating cross-trained float pools within the HCO. Use of nurses from external agencies should be avoided.\nEmpower nursing unit staff to regulate unit work flow and set criteria for unit closures to new admissions and transfers as nursing workload and staffing necessitate.\nInvolve direct-care nursing staff in identifying the causes of nursing staff turnover and in developing methods to improve nursing staff retention.\nRecommendation 5-3\nHospitals and nursing homes should perform ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of their nurse staffing practices with respect to patient safety, and increase internal oversight of their staffing methods, levels, and effects on patient safety whenever staffing falls below the following levels for a 24-hour day:\nIn hospital ICUs\u2014one licensed nurse for every two patients (12 hours of licensed nursing staff per patient day).\nIn nursing homes, for long-stay residents\u2014one RN for every 32 patients (.75 hours per resident day), one licensed nurse for every 18 patients (1.3 hours per resident day), and one nurse assistant for every 8.5 patients (2.8 hours per resident day).\nRecommendation 5-4\nDHHS should implement a nationwide, publicly accessible system for collecting and managing valid and reliable staffing and turnover data from hospitals and nursing homes. Information on individual hospital and nursing home staffing at the level of individual nursing units and the facility in the aggregate should be disclosed routinely to the public.\nFederal and State nursing home report cards should include standardized, case-mix\u2013adjusted information on the average hours per patient day of RN, licensed, and nurse assistant care provided to residents and a comparison with Federal and State standards.\nDuring the next 3 years, public and private sponsors of the new hospital report card to be located on the Federal government website should undertake an initiative\u2014in collaboration with experts in acute hospital care, nurse staffing, and consumer information\u2014to develop, test, and implement measures of hospital nurse staffing levels for the public.\nMoreover, the knowledge base on effective clinical care and new health care technologies is increasing rapidly, making it impossible for nurses (and other clinicians) to incorporate this information into their clinical decisionmaking and practice without organizational support. Organizational studies and research on exemplary work environments indicate the importance of investment in ongoing employee learning by employers. The committee therefore makes the following recommendation:\nRecommendation 5-5\nHCOs should dedicate budgetary resources equal to a defined percentage of nursing payroll to support nursing staff in their ongoing acquisition and maintenance of knowledge and skills. These resources should be sufficient for and used to implement policies and practices that:\nAssign experienced nursing staff to precept nurses newly practicing in a clinical area to address knowledge and skill gaps.\nAnnually ensure that each licensed nurse and nurse assistant has an individualized plan and resources for educational development within health care.\nProvide education and training of staff as new technology or changes in the workplace are introduced.\nProvide decision support technology identified with the active involvement of direct-care nursing staff to enable point-of-care learning.\nDisseminate to individual staff organizational learning as captured in clinical tools, algorithms, and pathways.\nFinally, in response to evidence on inconsistent interprofessional collaboration among nursing staff and other health care providers, the committee makes the following recommendation:\nRecommendation 5-6\nHCOs should take action to support interdisciplinary collaboration by adopting such interdisciplinary practice mechanisms as interdisciplinary rounds, and by providing ongoing formal education and training in interdisciplinary collaboration for all health care providers on a regularly scheduled, continuous basis (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or semiannually).\nDesign of Work and Workspace To Prevent and Mitigate Errors\nNurses\u2019 work processes and workspaces need to be designed to make them more efficient, less conducive to the commission of errors, and more amenable to detecting and remedying errors when they occur. The work hours of a minority of nurses, in particular, are identified as a serious threat to the safety of patients. The effects of fatigue include slowed reaction time, lapses of attention to detail, errors of omission, compromised problem solving, reduced motivation, and decreased energy for successful completion of required tasks. Other safety-sensitive industries have acknowledged and taken action to defend against these effects by limiting the number of shifts or hours worked in a week.\nChanging work patterns will require attention from HCOs, regulatory bodies, State boards of nursing, schools of nursing, and nurses themselves. Accordingly, the committee makes the following recommendation:\nRecommendation 6-1\nTo reduce error-producing fatigue, State regulatory bodies should prohibit nursing staff from providing patient care in any combination of scheduled shifts, mandatory overtime, or voluntary overtime in excess of 12 hours in any given 24-hour period and in excess of 60 hours per 7-day period. To this end:\nHCOs and labor organizations representing nursing staff should establish policies and practices designed to prevent nurses who provide direct patient care from working longer than 12 hours in a 24-hour period and in excess of 60 hours per 7-day period.\nSchools of nursing, State boards of nursing, and HCOs should educate nurses about the threats to patient safety caused by fatigue.\nEnabling nursing staff to collaborate with other health care personnel in identifying high-risk and inefficient work processes and workspaces and (re)designing them for patient safety and efficiency is also essential. Moreover, documentation practices are in great need of redesign. However, this cannot be accomplished solely by nursing staff and internal HCO efforts. As many documentation practices are driven by external parties, such as regulators and oversight organizations, these entities will need to assist in the redesign of documentation practices. To address these needs, the committee makes the following recommendations:\nRecommendation 6-2\nHCOs should provide nursing leadership with resources that enable them to design the nursing work environment and care processes to reduce errors. These efforts must directly involve direct-care nurses throughout all phases of the work design and should concentrate on errors associated with:\nSurveillance of patient health status.\nPatient 1transfersand other patient hand-offs.\nComplex patient care processes.\nNon\u2013value-added activities performed by nurses, such as locating and obtaining supplies, looking for personnel, completing redundant and unnecessary documentation, and compensating for poor communication systems.\nRecommendation 6-3\nHCOs should address handwashing and medication administration among their first work design initiatives.\nRecommendation 6-4\nRegulators, leaders in health care; and experts in nursing, law, informatics, and related disciplines should jointly convene to identify strategies for safely reducing the burden associated with patient and work-related documentation.\nCreating and Sustaining a Culture of Safety\nEmploying a nursing workforce strong in numbers and capabilities and designing their work to prevent errors will not be sufficient to fully safeguard patients. The largest and most capable workforce is still fallible, and the best-designed work processes are still designed by fallible individuals. Patient safety also requires an organizational commitment to vigilance to prevent potential errors, and to the detection, analysis, and redress of errors when they occur.\nA variety of safety-conscious industries have made such a commitment and achieved substantially lower rates of errors by doing so. These organizations place as high a priority on safety as they do on production; all employees are fully engaged in the process of detecting high-risk situations before an error occurs. Management is so responsive to employees\u2019 detection of risk that it dedicates time, personnel, budget, and training resources to bring about changes needed to make work processes safer. Employees also are empowered to act in dangerous situations to reduce the likelihood of adverse events. These attitudes and employee engagement are so pervasive and observable in the behaviors of these organizations and their employees that an actual culture of safety exists within the organization. These organizational cultures are effective because they (1) recognize that the majority of errors are created by systemic organizational defects in work processes, not by blameworthy individuals; (2) support staff; and (3) foster continuous learning by the organization as a whole and its employees.\nHCOs should redouble their efforts to create such cultures of safety within their work environments. Such efforts require a long-term commitment because they necessitate changes in the attitudes and behaviors of both organizations and people. Time is needed to enact an initial change, evaluate, refine, and enact further change. Strong organizational leadership is also essential. The safety of patients needs to be a stated and visible priority, with every organizational member understanding that each is fallible, even with the best of intentions, as are the processes used. Moreover, establishing a fair and just culture in responding to errors reduces workers\u2019 fear and disincentives to report errors and near misses. As a result, nursing staff is more inclined to be vigilant for errors and near misses, with a view toward learning from each event and strengthening the culture of safety accordingly. Action also is needed from State boards of nursing and Congress to enable strong and effective cultures of safety to exist. To these ends, the committee makes the following recommendations:\nRecommendation 7-1\nHCO boards of directors, managerial leadership, and labor partners should create and sustain cultures of safety by implementing the recommendations presented previously and by:\nSpecifying short- and long-term safety objectives.\nContinuously reviewing success in meeting these objectives and providing feedback at all levels.\nConducting an annual, confidential survey of nursing and other health care workers to assess the extent to which a culture of safety exists.\nInstituting a de-identified, fair, and just reporting system for errors and near misses.\nEngaging in ongoing employee training in error detection, analysis, and reduction.\nImplementing procedures for analyzing errors and providing feedback to direct-care workers.\nInstituting rewards and incentives for error reduction.\nRecommendation 7-2\nThe National Council of State Boards of Nursing, in consultation with patient safety experts and health care leaders, should undertake an initiative to design uniform processes across States for better distinguishing human errors from willful negligence and intentional misconduct, along with guidelines for their application by State boards of nursing and other State regulatory bodies having authority over nursing.\nRecommendation 7-3\nCongress should pass legislation to extend peer review protections to data related to patient safety and quality improvement that are collected and analyzed by HCOs for internal use or shared with others solely for purposes of improving safety and quality.\nResearch Implications\nFinally, the committee notes that changing health care delivery practices to increase patient safety must be an ongoing process. Research findings and dissemination of practices that other HCOs have found successful in improving patient safety will help HCOs as learning organizations add to their repertoire of patient safety practices. This report calls attention to several areas in which, at present, information is limited about how to design nurses\u2019 work and work environments to make them safer for patients. Research is needed to provide better information on nursing-related errors, means of achieving safer work processes and workspace design, a standardized approach to measuring patient acuity, information on safe staffing levels for different types of patient care units, effective methods to help night shift workers compensate for fatigue, information on what limits should be imposed on successive days of working sustained work hours, and collaborative models of care. Accordingly, the committee makes the following recommendation:\nRecommendation 8-1\nFederal agencies and private foundations should support research in the following areas to provide HCOs with the additional information they need to continue to strengthen nurse work environments for patient safety:\nStudies and development of methods to better describe, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the work nurses perform in different care settings.\nDescriptive studies of nursing-related errors.\nDesign, application, and evaluation (including financial costs and savings) of safer and more efficient work processes and workspace, including the application of information technology.\nDevelopment and testing of a standardized approach to measuring patient acuity.\nDetermination of safe staffing levels within different types of nursing units.\nDevelopment and testing of methods to help night shift workers compensate for fatigue.\nResearch on the effects of successive work days and sustained work hours on patient safety.\nDevelopment and evaluation of models of collaborative care, including care by teams. d\nGo to:\nConclusion\nNurses are in a key position to improve patient safety, not just through their individual patient care actions as clinicians, but by exercising their leverage as much-desired employees in the labor marketplace. If nurses ask the above questions of their prospective employers, and incorporate the responses they receive into their selection of their place of employment, they will be able to exert significant influence within the health care system, as health care organizations come to appreciate the ability to recruit nurses as an additional important reason for making the types of organizational changes needed to provide safe patient care.\nGo to:\nFootnotes\na\nThe Committee\u2019s second report, Crossing the Quality Chasm \u2014 A New Health System for the 21st Century, addressed health care quality in all its dimensions: effectiveness, timeliness, patient centeredness, efficiency, and equity (in addition to safety).

However, there isn't a direct flow of knowledge from research into practice. When I ask nurses where the \u201cevidence\u201d to guide the development of \u201cevidence-based care\u201d comes from, I get an interesting array of answers, from \u201cresearchers\u201d to blank stares, as if there's no connection between the worlds of researchers and bedside nurses.\nIf research evidence informs our nursing practice, why doesn't it come from all of us? Nurses are inquisitive, think critically about their patients\u2019 care, and want to know the best treatments for their patients\u2014all of which makes them perfectly suited for research. Though the majority of nurses don't have the training to conduct research projects without assistance, they know how to ask questions and they know which questions need answering.\nYet research is often perceived as something undertaken by others far removed from the front lines of nursing practice. I believe that many nurses\u2019 notions about who does or doesn't do research are rooted in our identity as nurses, which often manifests in a belief that \u201cgood\u201d nurses are not researchers but instead have excellent clinical skills and can manage any crisis on a unit. A 2007 study by Woodward and colleagues in the Journal of Research in Nursing found that nurse clinicians engaged in research often perceive a lack of support from nurse managers and resentment from colleagues who see the research as taking them away from clinical practice.\nThe distinction often drawn between nursing research and clinical practice is mirrored in the inconsistent translation of research evidence into practice. Despite widespread promotion of evidence-based practice in nursing, creation of new translational research roles for nurses in major medical centers, and Medicare reimbursement policies in the United States tied to implementation of specific evidence-supported practices, studies continue to suggest much room for improvement. In a September 2014 article in this journal, Yoder and colleagues noted that researchers have consistently found that \u201cnurses who valued research were more likely to use research findings in practice.\u201d Such observations suggest a need for a much stronger link between nurse clinicians and the development of research into best practices. Though this has been discussed for years, I do not yet see research as having infiltrated fundamental views of what constitutes \u201cnursing work.\u201d\nMy discussions with frontline nurses and nurses involved in research have led me to ask three key questions that need addressing before we can fully integrate research into our professional identity. These are:\nHow can nurses strive for high-quality research without focusing on randomized controlled trials?\nWhat are the barriers to and challenges of being involved in research and how can we address these?\nHow can nurses at varying education levels be involved in research?\nNurses could turn many quality improvement (QI) projects into research. Research may be viewed as a continuum, with formal projects at one end and QI projects somewhere along the continuum. Though nurses may not think that QI projects would be of interest to others, with increased understanding of the research process and greater institutional support, some QI projects could easily become research projects.\nMore bedside nurses are likely to engage in research if\nnursing education is strengthened.\ntime away from direct care is allocated for conducting research activities.\nconsultant resources such as methodologists and biostatisticians are available to staff.\ninstitutional and organizational support of research are strengthened.\nMany nurses are intimidated by research, but change is possible if we stop seeing research as someone else's job and start making it a part of who we are and what we do. This will pave the way to evidence-based practice truly becoming the norm.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Each study evaluated an intervention method in an acute hospital setting that aimed to improve patient care and protect the wellbeing of nursing staff; these included a team-based practice development programme, a relational care training intervention for healthcare assistants, a regular bedside ward round (intentional rounding), and monthly group meetings during which staff discussed the emotional challenges of care. The remaining articles in this series will explore the results of the studies and how they can be applied to nursing care during, and after, the coronavirus pandemic.\nCitation: Bridges J et al (2020) Research that supports nursing teams 1: how research can improve patient care and nurse wellbeing.

What is not always given much attention by nursing teams and managers is the \u2018taken-for-granted\u2019 context in which individual nurses work \u2013 the way nursing care is organised, the learning opportunities available to the team and the attention paid to staff wellbeing. It may be possible to change these to support nurses and the care on which they lead and deliver, but opportunities may be missed to think differently about them. The evidence base is growing in this area but does not always reach those nurses who are managing and delivering care.\nThis is the first in a series of four articles highlighting nursing research findings that can directly inform the management and delivery of nursing care in acute hospital settings. The articles highlight four studies that were funded after publication of Francis\u2019 (2013; 2010) reports on the independent and public inquiries into care failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. However, as this series will argue, the inquiries\u2019 findings have relevance for nursing practice during, and beyond, the coronavirus pandemic, as nursing teams regroup and reset what they do in response to a rapidly changing care environment.\nUsing research evidence to improve patient care\nChange in the complex, adaptive system of healthcare is usually incremental, rather than transformative, and it is unusual for events to lead to a \u2018phase transition\u2019, in which radical and transformative change occurs (Braithwaite et al, 2017). Arguably the coronavirus pandemic has stimulated a phase transition in healthcare (and in wider society), disrupting certainties about healthcare and how it should, and can, be delivered. As we move through this system shock, there are opportunities to think about new ways of working; however, it is also important to retain the valuable knowledge gained from other events that have affected the healthcare system.\nThe lessons learned from the care failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust during the late 2000s and the inquiries that followed had an important impact on hospital nursing and the wider system, stimulating reflection, innovation and research to improve nursing care quality. The evidence generated as a result, some of which is explained below, is a reminder of aspects of care that are at risk of being overlooked during the current pandemic. These include the:\nComplexities of caring for older people;\nImportance of nurses\u2019 relational work;\nImportance of nursing care, especially when there is no surgical/medical \u2018cure\u2019.\nIn the absence of a cure for Covid-19, nursing is at the forefront of the supportive care needed by people with the most severe symptoms. As such, it is important to draw on evidence that supports good nursing care and how best to support nurses\u2019 wellbeing, which can be negatively affected by their caring work.\nResearch studies investigating intervention\nThe research world responded to the Francis inquiries: the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded several studies to inform policy and practice improvements in this area. The research delivered through four such studies (Box\u00a01) \u2013 each of which was led by an author of this article \u2013 is summarised below.\nBox 1. The four studies\nCreating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care (CLECC)\nThis study trialled a pilot intervention focusing on team building and understanding patient experiences. Participants felt it improved their capacity to be compassionate.\nChief investigator: Jackie Bridges\nFull study report available here\nOlder People\u2019s Shoes\nThis study trialled an interactive programme to help healthcare assistants (HCAs) get to know older people and understand the challenges they face. The programme was well received by participants, especially as HCAs\u2019 training needs are often overlooked.\nChief investigator: Antony Arthur\nFull study report available here\nIntentional Rounding\nThis study aimed to evaluate how intentional rounding works in diverse ward and hospital settings. Participants expressed concern that rounding oversimplifies nursing, and favoured a transactional and prescriptive approach over relational nursing care.\nChief investigator: Ruth Harris\nFull study report available here\nSchwartz Center Rounds\nThis study aimed to understand the unique features of Schwartz Rounds, comparing them with 11 similar interventions. Attending rounds increased staff members\u2019 empathy and compassion for colleagues and patients, and improved their psychological health.\nChief investigator: Jill Maben\nFull study report available here\nStudy 1: Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care\nBridges et al (2018) investigated the feasibility of implementing a team-based practice development programme into acute care hospital settings. Under the Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care (CLECC) programme, all registered nurses and healthcare assistants (HCAs) from participating teams attended a study day, with a focus on team building and understanding patient experiences. A senior nurse educator supported the teams to try new ways of working on the ward, including holding regular, supportive discussions on improving care. Each ward manager attended learning groups to develop their compassionate care leadership role, and two team members received additional training in carrying out observations of care and feeding back to colleagues.\nThe programme was piloted on four wards in two English hospitals, with two control wards continuing with business as usual. Researchers interviewed staff and observed activities related to the project to understand whether these could be easily put into practice and whether changes were needed. They also tested evaluation methods, including ways to measure compassion and ensuring enough older patients could be recruited to a future study.\nThe study found that the CLECC programme can be made to work with nursing teams on NHS hospital wards and that staff felt it improved their capacity to be compassionate. Researchers also learned they could improve the programme to help staff continue using it, for example, by helping senior nurses to understand their role in supporting staff with this.\nStudy 2: Older People\u2019s Shoes\nArthur et al (2017) studied the feasibility of a relational care training intervention for HCAs to improve the relational care of older people in acute hospitals. They initially conducted a telephone survey of acute NHS hospitals in England to understand what training HCAs received. They undertook group interviews with older people and individual interviews with HCAs and staff working with them to establish what participants thought should be included in HCA training. Training was highly variable and focused on new, not existing, staff; relational care was not a high priority.\nIn response to their findings, the study team designed and produced an innovative interactive training programme called Older People\u2019s Shoes, which aimed to encourage HCAs to consider how to get to know older people and understand the challenges they face. A train-the-trainer model was used to allow the intervention to be viable beyond the testing sites. To see whether they could formally test this new training, the team conducted a pilot cluster-randomised trial in 12 wards from three acute hospitals; it concluded that a larger study to examine whether changes in patient outcomes could be observed would be challenging, but possible.\nOlder People\u2019s Shoes was well received by participants. This was particularly so for the HCAs, whose training needs were often overlooked or restricted to mandatory requirements, where the focus is almost exclusively on safety.\nStudy 3: Intentional Rounding\nOriginating in the US, intentional rounding is a timed, planned intervention that aims to address fundamental elements of nursing care through a regular bedside ward round. Harris et al\u2019s (2019) study aimed to explain which aspects of intentional rounding work, for whom and under what circumstances. It aimed to do this by exploring how intentional rounding works when used with different types of patient, by different nurses, in diverse ward and hospital settings, and whether and how these differences influence outcomes. The study methods included:\nAn evidence review to create a theory of why intentional rounding may work;\nA national survey of how intentional rounding had been implemented;\nA case study evaluation exploring the perspectives of senior managers, health professionals, patients and carers;\nObservations of intentional rounding being undertaken;\nAn analysis of costs.\nThe national survey found that 97% of NHS trusts had implemented intentional rounding, although with considerable variation: fidelity to the intentional rounding protocol was observed to be low. All nursing staff thought intentional rounding should be tailored to individual patient need and not delivered in a standardised way. Few felt intentional rounding improved either the quality or frequency of their interactions with patients; they perceived the main benefit of intentional rounding to be the documented evidence of care delivery, despite concerns that documentation was not always reliable. Patients and carers valued the relational aspects of communication with staff, but this was rarely linked to intentional rounding. It is suggested these results should feed into a wider conversation and review of intentional rounding.\nStudy 4: Schwartz Center Rounds\nThese were developed in the US to support healthcare staff to deliver compassionate care by helping them to reflect on their work. Schwartz Rounds are monthly group meetings, in which staff discuss the emotional, social and ethical challenges of care in a safe environment. The number of organisations hosting Schwartz Rounds has increased markedly over recent years.\nMaben et al (2018) conducted a study to evaluate Schwartz Rounds and understand how the system works. The study used mixed methods, including:\nAn evidence review to understand the unique features of Schwartz Rounds;\nA comparison with 11 other similar interventions, such as action learning sets;\nA national survey of 48 staff running Schwartz Rounds in 46 organisations, using telephone interviews to discuss how these had been implemented;\nA survey of 500 staff in 10 organisations to examine how Schwartz Rounds affect work engagement and wellbeing;\nA case study evaluation investigating the perspectives of people who shared their stories at Schwartz Rounds (panellists), audience members who listened and contributed, facilitators, and people who did not attend.\nThe researchers also observed preparation meetings, actual Schwartz Rounds and steering group meetings to determine how the rounds worked, and under which circumstances they worked optimally.\nTheir survey found psychological health improved in those attending Schwartz Rounds but not in those who did not attend. Participants described Schwartz Rounds as interesting, engaging and supportive. How they were run varied, creating different levels of trust and safety, and who attended varied \u2013 frontline staff found attendance difficult.\nIt was concluded that Schwartz Rounds are a \u2018slow intervention\u2019 that increases its impact over time and creates a safe, reflective space for staff to talk together confidentially. In the staff observed, attending Schwartz Rounds increased their empathy and compassion for colleagues and patients, supported them in their work and helped them make changes in practice.\nApplying research findings\nThe findings from the above studies not only tell us about the impact of each of these four interventions, but also highlight the changes required to better support nursing teams to deliver high-quality care. Written by nursing professors, who were the chief investigators on each of these studies, this series will bring together the findings from the four studies to:\nHighlight the impact of care organisation and related learning opportunities on nurses and on care delivery, as well as the need for staff wellbeing interventions to support nurses;\nSignpost to practical, evidence-based ways in which individuals and teams can improve support for nurses and nursing care;\nPose questions that individuals and teams can ask in the context of the coronavirus pandemic to optimise support for nurses and care.\nThe series is part of a collaboration funded by the NIHR to bring the findings of the individual studies to a wider audience; more details about the collaboration and the individual projects can be found at go.soton.ac.uk/cn4. This work will culminate in an event, due to be held in spring 2021, to engage a range of stakeholders in considering how nursing policy and practice should respond to the findings.

Nursing is no different, and nursing research has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. Nurses with research skills are equipped for evidence-based practice to ensure better standards for caregiving.\nRegistered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN) programs cover research in depth. Nurses completing an online RN to BS in Nursing degree program can apply their practical experience to improve healthcare via research. Students who are particularly passionate about the research aspect of nursing may even go on to become nurse researchers.\nResearch Is a Vital Part of 21st Century Nursing Education\nNurses teach, organize community health, work in business, and of course, work in the clinical setting. Research is important for all of these areas, and nurses should be a part of that research.\nResearch and scientific inquiry also help students develop analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. If they observe a consistent pattern of a practice, procedure or method that helps patients, they can pursue those discoveries and either conduct or propose a study on those issues. It does not mean they need to act like lab assistants or constantly look for ways to change things; it means that they have the power to approach their jobs with a critical eye.\nNursing research is vital to improving healthcare delivery and outcomes. Understanding the research process helps nurses approach any job with critical thinking skills.\nThis is one of the reasons that Magnet hospitals seek nurses with BSNs. Even in clinical positions, nurses who can focus on issues with a critical eye and employ creative problem-solving strategies in difficult situations are in demand. Because clinical situations present many difficult problems and decisions, research and analytical skills help nurses perform clinical duties better.\nThe Role of Nurses in Research\nBSN-prepared nurses can work as members of research teams to coordinate and manage research, collect data, ensure the well-being of study participants, and present at conferences. In other words, they can take a central role in the research process.\nResearch might take place in a clinical, university or community setting, with nurses studying ways to improve and streamline patient care. Health systems and outcomes research examines the availability and quality of healthcare services in a community and is vital to understanding and improving community health. Nursing education researchers study how students best learn nursing skills. Like any other researcher, they might start their careers as assistants, later developing and leading their own projects.\nClinical experience is vital to success as a nurse researcher, so students in online RN to BSN programs are particularly well-equipped to enter this field. They have experience with patients and may already have ideas about what works and what does not.\nBSN-prepared nurses who enjoy research may also choose to enter the field of nursing research. Nurse researchers support and coordinate studies related to a wide range of clinical, community and education issues. Research organizations, pharma companies, teaching hospitals, and government agencies are some examples of job settings for nurse researchers. Whether in the hospital or public health environments, providers use this research to evaluate and improve healthcare for millions of people.\nLearn more about the URI online RN to BS in Nursing program.\nSources:\nJournal of Nursing Education: The Importance of Nursing Research\nBSNedu.org: The Scope of Nursing Research\nNational Institute of Nursing Research: What Is Nursing Research?\nRN Journal: Conducting Nursing Research\nEveryNurse.org: How to Become a Research Nurse\nHave a question or concern about this article?

In tandem, it is imperative for professional nurses to have an understanding of research principles as it would help them undertake research or at the very least be better consumers of research. This would help them stay informed and result in overall patient outcome (AACN, 2008). Similarly, it is indeed critical to complete this course as it helps us understand the role that nursing research plays in our profession and the various principles underpinning research.

Historically health care and more specifically, nursing care, was based on tradition. In other words, we simply replicated what had been previously done in nursing, without question to the support of evidence for what we were doing or the impact on patient outcomes. As nursing has evolved and the expectation for continually improving patient outcomes has come to the forefront, a greater emphasis has been placed on implementing nursing care that is supported through the use of the best research available. Evidence-based practice incorporates many additional sources of data that may contribute to improved nursing care.\nEvidence-based practice goes beyond nursing research in considering other sources of documentation that may improve nursing care. Research published by other disciplines is included (e.g., medical research and social research), as well as nonresearch data that may contribute to practice (e.g., financial data and clinical experts). This is prudent at a time when the complexity of health problems is increasing, and the discovery of new data is more rapid than ever before (Research for Best Practice Box 24.1 ).\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established evidence-based practice centers and clinical practice guidelines that are available through the Internet. These resources include the most current information on completed evidence reports and practice guidelines as well as those that are in progress (see www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/overview/index.html and www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/index.html ). However, not all aspects of practice have been evaluated to date. Therefore, the decision to implement an evidence-based practice protocol that does not have a formal report requires a dedicated commitment on the part of all those involved. The steps in applying evidence-based practice include definition of the problem; identifying, reviewing, and evaluating the data applicable to the problem; designing a practice change based on the data; and implementing the change in nursing practice, while recognizing the nurse\u2019s experience and patient preferences (see Relevant Websites and Online Resources ).\nStep 1: Define the Problem\nAs nursing professionals who will be responsible for implementing an EBP protocol with the goal of improving patient outcomes, we must first recognize and fully define the problem.\nStep 2: Identify, Review, and Evaluate the Data Applicable to the Problem\nNurses must be able to locate and evaluate research studies that will serve as the foundation of any potential EBP protocol. The specific nursing practice that will be changed, in addition to the practice context, will determine the types of data included for review.\nStep 3: Design a Practice Change Based on the Data While Incorporating the Clinical Expertise of the Nurse and Patient Preferences\nPrepare a written plan for the new nursing practice. The plan needs to be consistent with your practice context to be effective. For maximum benefit, the plan will also require the consensus of those who will implement it.\nStep 4: Implement the Change in Nursing Practice\nMove the new plan into nursing practice on a defined schedule. Staff in-services may be required so that those involved can fully understand the change. Monitor and evaluate the implementation process. Moreover, as noted by Melnyk and Fineout-Overholt (2005), EBP must recognize the great experience that nurses bring to the practice setting and patient input and preferences if successful implementation is to be realized (Fig. 24.1 ).\nRESEARCH FOR BEST PRACTICE BOX 24.1 Wound Care\nPractice Issue\nThe increased acuity of patient needs, combined with advances in wound care, have the potential to create frustrating situations for the new graduate nurse. It is essential for the new graduate to prevent pressure ulcers and provide wound care that reflects current best practice measures and the newest advances in technology.\nImplications for Nursing Practice\n1. Approximately 2.5 million pressure ulcers occur each year in the United States, adding an estimated burden of more than $11 billion in expenditures, with reported estimated costs of between $500 and $150,000 per individual pressure ulcer (AHRQ, 2014; NPUAP, 2014 ).\n2. Approximately 60,000 patients die annually from complications of pressure ulcers (AHRQ, 2012; Salcido et\u00a0al., 2012).\n3. Wound care has emerged as a specialty practice for RNs (Wound Ostomy Continence Nursing Certification Board, 2016).\n4. Wound care needs and procedures can vary significantly across practice settings (Bolton & Baine, 2012).\n5. New graduate RNs are more competent in patient care and less competent in clinical reasoning, recognizing limits, and seeking help.\n6. New graduate RNs are more likely to use written information, care guidelines, and agency-specific policies to guide their practice.\n7. New graduate RNs are more competent with using technology to seek answers and specific information related to current patient care practices.\nConsidering This Information\nWhat can you do to keep up-to-date on wound care treatments?\nReferences\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).\u00a0Are we ready for this change?\u00a0Retrieved from. www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/pressureulcertoolkit/putool1.html ,\u00a02014.\nBolton\u00a0L.L,\u00a0Baine\u00a0W.B.\u00a0Using science to advance wound care practice: Lessons from the literature.

At a recent staff meeting, Mario and his co-workers learned that their unit s rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was greater than rates in many other hospitals. Concerned by this, Mario volunteered to work on this project. He began with a review of the literature. Using a nursing literature database, Mario was able to find a number of research studies conducted in the past few years that examined the same issue. Additionally, he found that multiple professional organizations had issued evidence-based guidelines to reduce the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. After reading these articles, Mario drafted a set of clinical practice guidelines based on these articles that reflected the unique needs of his unit and its patient population. Mario then presented his guidelines to the nursing staff and provided short educational in-service sessions on their application. The staff agreed to adhere to these new practice guidelines for a period of 3 months. At the end of that time, they would compare their incidence of VAP using the new clinical guidelines with the incidence of VAP using the old clinical guidelines.\nFIG. 24.1 Model of evidence-based clinical decision making. Reprinted with permission from Potter, P. A., Perry, A. G., Stockert, P. A., Hall, A. M., & Ostendorf, W. R. (2017). Fundamentals of nursing (9th ed.). St. Louis: Elsevier, p. 53.\nAt the end of the 3-month period, Mario and his co-workers were pleased to find a significant decrease in the occurrence of VAP among their patients. Working with nursing administration, Mario s proposed clinical practice guidelines became the new standard of care on his unit.\nThe Need for Nursing Practice Based on Research\nIn the recent past, there has been a continuing increase in costs associated with the delivery and receipt of health care in the United States. At the same time, there has been more and more scrutiny of how those health care dollars are spent. The decision of which health care treatments receive funding from health care insurance is now based primarily on documentation of favorable patient outcomes. In addition, patients want to know that the dollars they spend on health care will help them to get well and feel better\u2014they want to purchase something that works for them. Nurses must be able to demonstrate that the nursing care they provide is cost-effective and improves the health of patients. As we continue to move to a health care setting that recognizes the importance of patient care that utilizes the most current and appropriate evidence, we must understand how research utilization will assist us in meeting the goal of improving patient outcomes through EBP.\nWhat is Nursing Research Utilization?\nThe ability to transfer research into clinical practice is essential for ensuring quality in nursing. The process of research utilization involves transferring research findings to clinical nursing practice. In the process of research utilization, the emphasis is on using existing data (findings or evidence) from previous nursing research studies to evaluate a current nursing practice. A major component of the process is reviewing completed nursing research studies that have been published in the literature. In contrast, conducting new research involves the collection of new data to answer a specific clinical practice question. Nursing research utilization is a step-by-step process incorporating critical thinking and decision making to ensure that a change in practice has a sound basis in nursing science.\nWhat Are the Steps for Nursing Research Utilization?\nStep 1: Preutilization\nThe first step in the application of nursing research to nursing practice is the recognition that some aspect of nursing practice could be done in a safer, more efficient, more beneficial, or simply a different way. This begins an exploratory phase in which nursing colleagues in the practice setting are consulted regarding their opinions about the need to find a new approach for some aspect of nursing practice. An early question should be: \u201cIs the current practice research based?\u201d When current practice is research based, the next question should be \u201cIs the research on which the practice is based current?\u201d (e.g., the specific details of taking temperatures with mercury thermometers became outdated when digital thermometers were used exclusively in practice).\nA second phase of Step 1 is consensus building, which is used to identify the specific practice to be changed. In this phase, the incorporation of the principles of change theory will increase the possibility of success. (See Chapter 10 for information about the challenges of change.) In any practice setting in which there are several nurses, a change will be more acceptable if those affected are included in the decisions related to the change. Clear communication and teamwork are essential elements of this process. Group consensus is crucial for the successful application of research findings.\nThe third and final phase of Step 1 delineates the aspect of nursing practice that will be changed into a concise statement of the practice problem. This statement will answer the question, \u201cIn our current nursing practice, what do we want to change, improve, or make more efficient?\u201d The narrower and more specific the statement of the practice problem, the easier your task will be in Step 2.\nStep 2: Assessing\nThe second step in research utilization is the identification and critical evaluation of published research that is related to the practice problem you have identified (Fig. 24.2 ). Nursing literature is searched to identify those studies that address your practice problem. Although some studies may have explored the exact practice problem that you are examining, it is likely that most research will have approached the problem from a different point of view. Your task will be to analyze and critically evaluate the research reports to determine which findings are adaptable to your practice problem and context.\nWhile reviewing the literature for research reports that have examined your practice problem, it is essential that the research reports you are reviewing are peer-reviewed to ensure credibility. Peer-reviewed or refereed research studies are different from popular sources and non\u2013peer-reviewed research reports, in that the research manuscript is submitted to a scholarly journal where it is reviewed by a panel of experts (peer reviewers or referees) in that respective field or area of study. An editorial board that is not expert in the content area under study typically reviews non\u2013peer-reviewed reports (e.g., editorials, newsletters, opinion statements). Additionally, peer-reviewed articles have a designated manuscript format, which includes an abstract, research problem/objective, methodology, data collection, discussion, conclusion, and references; whereas non\u2013peer-reviewed or popular/trade journals do not ascribe to a specific formatting style (NCSU Libraries, 2014 ). So, you might be asking yourself, \u201cWhat does the peer-review process involve and what are my chances of publishing a research report in a peer-reviewed journal?\u201d North Carolina State University (NCSU) offers an overview of the peer-review process via an online video available at www.lib.ncsu.edu/tutorials/peerreview/.\nFIG. 24.2 Nine out of ten nurses recommend\u2026.\nOnly gold members can continue reading.

A leader of this movement is Dr. Nancy Blake, Nursing Director for Critical Care Services at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, Associate Editor of the Journal of Pediatric Nursing, and a member of the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Communication and Dissemination Advisory Panel, which is working to get patients involved in research to improve outcomes.\nDr. Blake is encouraging and supporting nurses to get involved in research to build a solid base of evidence on which to build stronger practices. Ultimately, this will benefit not only patients and their families but the inter-professional teams in hospitals. It will also add a vital new perspective to the peer-reviewed research that acts as a foundation for developing knowledge in healthcare.\nHere, Dr. Blake writes about how nurse researchers use the knowledge they uncover to improve care.\nAlarms in neonatal and pediatric units can cause undue stress for parents. Elsevier\u2019s Chrysanne Lowe contributed this photo of her daughter as a 28-week premie who spent 2 months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of UC San Diego Health.\nA baby lies in a hospital bed hooked up to medical devices that buzz and ring as a respirator pumps air rhythmically into her small body. Her parents sit close by, watching and waiting for a change. A nurse comes to explain what the care plan is for the day \u2013 changes in medication, tests to run and continued monitoring. She has spent the night caring for the baby and noted a few improvements in his vital signs. The parents are comforted, though still concerned.\nWhen an alarm sounds, the nurse explains to the parents that it\u2019s nothing to worry about \u2013 the oxygen in the child\u2019s blood has just dipped below the average adult range but is nowhere near the danger zone. Having recently completed a research project on alarms in neonatal and pediatric units, the nurse knows they can cause undue stress for the parents. She makes a note to adjust the settings on the alarm so they\u2019re appropriate for the child\u2019s age range and standard vital signs.\nNurses play a vital role in the education of patients and their families, helping them adjust to life after the hospital. A new generation of nurse researchers is conducting research that informs evidence-based practices to improve patient care.\nElsevier is celebrating the unsung, the unseen and the as yet unknown. We are proud to support collaboration and innovation every day through information and smart tools and in special ways, like this collaboration between Findacure and Elsevier. For more stories about the people and projects empowered by knowledge, we invite you to visit Empowering Knowledge.\nGenerating new knowledge\nAt Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, there are 22 nurses with PhDs and several working towards them at UCLA. The general public might be surprised that so many nurses are conducting research.\nYes, nurses do research. In order to have evidence-based practice, we need evidence. And with their knowledge and hands-on experience, nurses can theorize, hypothesize, structure studies, and collect evidence that leads to better care. The goal of nursing research is to achieve better care standards and applications for patients and families.\nTake the oxygen saturation alarm. When children have cardiac arrests, the cause is usually respiratory problems, except for children with primary cardiac disease including congenital heart disease. In a child with a congenital heart defect, the oxygen saturation in their blood may never be higher than 90 percent because their blood doesn\u2019t flow through the lungs way it would in a child with a normal heart. However, the default alarms on most monitors are set above 90 percent, which is the limit for adults. Knowing this and researching the effect of constant alarms give nurses insights that can lead to better care.\nHospitals should be healing environments, so you don\u2019t want alarms going off all the time. If I\u2019m a parent and the alarm is going off and people aren\u2019t coming right away, I\u2019ll be concerned. I won\u2019t know if it\u2019s a false alarm. Healthcare workers need to understand which alarms they have and how to monitor them appropriately to reduce false alarms.\nIn fact, often equipment for pediatrics is different than equipment for adults.\nOne of the challenges facing pediatric nurses is that the machines and equipment they use in hospitals are based on the average population, which is made up mostly of adults. For the most part, children are healthy, whereas geriatric patients spend more time in the hospital. When manufacturers develop equipment, sometimes there isn\u2019t the rigor of looking at the wide spectrum of patients, partly because clinical staff are not working with the research and development staff. By getting involved in research projects, nurses can help make sure the equipment used for children is more suitable.\nI\u2019ve done a lot of work with biomedical engineers to give them feedback. For example, if they\u2019re developing equipment for us, we need to make sure it works with the nurse\u2019s workflow. An engineer who develops medical devices explained to me that we need to make sure the nurse\u2019s mental model matches the bioengineer\u2019s mental model. It\u2019s important to have pediatric nurses doing research with manufacturers and patients to understand their unique needs. This assures that the equipment can be used as the developers intended it to be used.\nNurses in research and higher education\nA growing number of nurses are getting PhDs and doing research, according to a 2014 survey by American Association of Colleges of Nursing AACN):\nThe survey found a significant growth in research-focused doctoral programs (i.e., PhD, DNS), which climbed to 134 programs in 2014.\nEnrollment in PhD nursing programs increased by 3.2 percent over the previous year with 5,290 students enrolled in 2014.\nSince 2004 when the DNP movement began to take shape, enrollment in research-focused doctoral programs has increased by 53.8 percent.\nResearch to support evidence-based practice \u2013 for all ages\nI started working in pediatrics as a student nurse and was immediately drawn to working with children. People tend to think it\u2019s more difficult working with sick children, especially in end-of-life care, but that has not been my experience.\nWhen I worked with adults 25 years ago, it was really sad for me to see an 80-year-old man who died after he and his wife had been married for 55 years; that was equally as sad to me as what we see here in pediatrics. But kids are resilient and they are very positive and upbeat until the very last minute. There are also more positive stories working with children. Supporting them and their families at the end of life, you feel valued and can walk away knowing you made the end of life for somebody the best it could be.\nOf course, the aim is to reduce mortality and get patients healthy again. This is where research comes in: as researchers, nurses can find and share new knowledge to support evidence-based practice. It\u2019s not the same as running clinical trials; nurses can really work closely with patients and families to find out how to treat them better.\nSometimes that means changing a practice that\u2019s been standard for decades. For example, for years it was best practice to sleep babies on their bellies rather than their backs, in case they vomited and choked. But today, following extensive research into sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the advice is to sleep babies on their backs.\nWhen it comes to policy, it\u2019s important not to waste time reinventing the wheel. If nurses are developing a policy or procedure, they can go to a database and search for the latest relevant research. At all hospitals, policies and procedures are revisited every three years, and when this happens, nurses need to find three to five relevant studies on the topic to see if there has been a change. SIDS is an example of why policies need to keep up with research.\nI\u2019ve been a nurse since 1980, and things have changed. We\u2019ve done things before the evidence and found out we need to do them differently. When I was a new nurse, we put babies on their stomachs, and now with research they\u2019re saying no, you don\u2019t do that. As nurses, when we discharge newborn babies from hospitals, we make sure the parents understand that the best place you can put the babies to sleep is on their backs.\nSome people are still practicing the old way because they haven\u2019t heard about the research and how important it is. Because of this, it\u2019s vital not only for nurses to carry out the research, but also to disseminate it \u2013 at conferences, in academic papers and even by sharing the results with their families, neighbors and colleagues. As more and more nurses get involved in research, the balance is shifting \u2013 where previously there were one or two \u201cexperts\u201d who spoke at conferences, many more nurses are now presenting their research.\nChanging opinions of nurses \u2013 and new opportunities\nPublic opinion is slower to shift, though, and this partly because the media sometimes projects nurses not in the best light. And nurses are trying to get the word out that they have to be better educated, that most nurses are educated to a bachelor\u2019s level at a minimum. The general public trusts nurses and things are changing, but people don\u2019t understand the rigor of the education nurses have to go through.\nDespite the lack of public knowledge about what it means to become educated as a nurse, people trust nurses, and this can have a positive impact on patients\u2019 understanding and acceptance of research-based information. Since working on my PhD, which I completed in 2012, I look at things completely differently. When I read articles, for example, I don\u2019t take the findings for granted but look at how they did the research, their methodology. Is it sound? Are there flaws in the way they collected samples or set up the study, or did they use an unreliable tool?\nThat kind of critical thinking means filtering information before passing it on to patients. In fact, doing research changes the way I interact with patients. When I\u2019ve done research, I can share that knowledge with them. We\u2019re trying to train more and more nurses right out of school to look at the literature in this way to make sure we\u2019re basing our knowledge and advice on sound research.\nThere\u2019s already a lot we know about patient care from evidence generated by nurses, and this is likely to increase in the future. At Children\u2019s Hospital, there is an endowment to provide grants for nurses to do research, and to give them protected time to work on it; when time is allocated for nursing staff, it is usually based on having them at the bedside, not taking research into account.\nNew graduates go through a 22-week residency program, which includes an evidence-based project. They do a performance improvement project that has been identified as something the nurses want to improve in their units, and they focus on an area the staff have questions about or that is problematic. At the end, they present a poster. Many of those nurses want to immediately go on and do a research project on this problem.\nIt\u2019s very exciting to see them wanting to get more information and do research at this facility. They own it, and they\u2019re excited about it, and they like to share it.\nOne key factor in ensuring more nurses get involved in research is building strong inter-professional teams. On a neonatal intensive care unit, for example, babies on respirators don\u2019t have early experiences of sucking because they have a breathing tube, so an occupational therapist works with them to help them develop that reflex. If research is being done on sucking, it\u2019s not done by the nurse in isolation but in collaboration with the occupational therapist.\nTraditionally, research coming out of hospitals has been led by physicians, but this is changing.\nA lot of large funding is still for physicians, but more and more nurse researchers are doing research with physicians as a strong inter-professional team. It\u2019s important that we strive for this \u2013 nurses look at things with a slightly different lens, and it brings a different scope to the research. I would also like to see more physicians invite nurses to participate in their research, as it would enrich the results and strengthen the team.\nContributor\nNancy Theresa Blake, PhD, RN, CCRN, NEA-BC, FAAN.\nDr. Nancy Blake has been Nursing Director of Critical Care Services at the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles since 1995, where she is responsible for the administrative, clinical, quality and fiscal activities in the critical care services and nursing areas of several departments.

According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), nursing research has helped advance nursing practice, shape health policy and improve health on a global scale.\nNursing Research Adds a Unique Perspective to Healthcare\nNursing research does not replace traditional research; it instead enhances it. According to ExploreHealthCareers.org, nurse researchers conduct studies, analyze and share data with the health care community. They also contribute articles to academic journals and write grant proposals to gain funding. In this respect, their work resembles that of a traditional scientific researcher.\nThe primary difference is that nurse research\u201d\u201cpart of the curriculum of the online MSN program at Lamar University \u201c\u201cis more practical in nature and provides immediate benefits to patients. ExploreHealthCareers.org says nurse researchers use their findings to deliver more efficient and effective nursing care, improve quality of life for patients with chronic illnesses, and promote healthy lifestyles.\nNurses perhaps have the most intimate understanding of patients\u2019 various physical, emotional and socioeconomic needs. This knowledge gives them a unique perspective as researchers; it allows them to ask pertinent research questions and analyze data that will specifically improve patient health and wellbeing.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Nursing Research?\nNurse researchers conduct studies that make significant contributions to the nation\u2019s healthcare model. Some of these studies are identified in \u201c10 Landmark Nursing Research Studies,\u201d a report from The National Institute of Nursing Research.\nFor example, one study looks at the correlation between childhood obesity and cardiovascular disease. Dr. Joanne Harrell, a nurse researcher, led a team that studied 1,200 of the state\u2019s school children. They gave one control group eight weeks of classes in which they taught the children about a heart-healthy lifestyle\u201d\u201ctopics included diet, exercise and the consequences of smoking.\nAfter the eight weeks, the children in this control group significantly improved their knowledge of a healthy lifestyle. They experienced physical improvements, including lower cholesterol and body fat, increased aerobic power, and a smaller rise in diastolic blood pressure.\nOther studies mentioned in the report focus on health issues that affect a variety of populations. Some of these include helping to reduce high blood pressure in inner-city African-American men, improving outcomes for elderly patients after a hospital stay, and learning how to assist low-income women and their children via home visits.\nThe Path to Nursing Research\nAccording to the article \u201cYour Guide to Graduate Nursing Programs\u201d prepared by the AACN, principle researchers must have a doctoral degree. Most nurse researchers, however, begin their careers as assistants, which requires a master\u2019s degree.\nAn online MSN program can help you prepare for a career as a nurse researcher. One of the courses offered by Lamar University\u2019s online MSN program, MSNC 5311 Nursing Research, teaches students to analyze research methods, design research, collect data and apply their findings to benefit the nursing practice.\nNurses with advanced research skills can continue to advocate and care for patients by designing and assisting with scientific studies. The findings from these studies have positive and immediate effects on different populations, including minorities, school-aged children and the elderly. Nursing research provides an opportunity for nurses to use their scientific skills while continuing to serve the immediate needs of their patients.\nLearn more about the Lamar University online MSN in Nursing Administration program.\nSources:\nAmerican Association of Colleges of Nursing\nExploreHealthCareers.org\nNational Institute of Nursing Research\nHave a question or concern about this article?

But most importantly, how is nursing best placed to maximise the benefits which evidence-based care can bring?\nResearch has been used to legitimise nursing as a profession, education has been radically reformed to reflect a research base, and academic nurses have built their careers around it. However, despite the length of time that research has been on the agenda and the influential bodies involved, only a moderate proportion of nurses use research as a basis for practice. 1 What has gone wrong?\nPart of the difficulty is that although nurses perceive research positively, 2 they either cannot access the information, or cannot judge the value of the studies which they find. 3 This journal has evolved as a direct response to the dilemma of practitioners who want to use research, but are thwarted by overwhelming clinical demands, an ever burgeoning research literature, and for many, a lack of skills in critical appraisal. Evidence-Based Nursing should therefore be exceptionally useful, and its target audience of practitioners is a refreshing move in the right direction. The worlds of researchers and practitioners have been separated by seemingly impenetrable barriers for too long. 4\nTiptoeing in the wake of the movement for evidence-based medicine, however, we must ensure that evidence-based nursing attends to what is important for nursing. Part of the difficulty that practitioners face relates to the ambiguity which research, and particularly \u201cscientific\u201d research, has within nursing. Ambiguous, because we need to be clear as to what nursing is, and what nurses do before we can identify the types of evidence needed to improve the effectiveness of patient care. Then we can explore the type of questions which practitioners need answers to and what sort of research might best provide those answers.\nWhat is nursing about?\nIncreasingly, medicine and nursing are beginning to overlap. There is much talk of interprofessional training and multidisciplinary working, and nurses have been encouraged to adopt as their own some tasks traditionally undertaken by doctors. However, in their operation, practice, and culture, nursing and medicine remain quite different. The oft quoted suggestion is that doctors \u201ccure\u201d or \u201ctreat\u201d and that nurses \u201ccare\u201d, but this is not upheld by research. In a study of professional boundaries, the management of complex wounds was perceived by nurses as firmly within their domain. 5 Nurses justified their claim to \u201ccontrol\u201d wound treatment by reference to scientific knowledge and practical experience, just as medicine justifies its claim in other areas of treatment. One of the most obvious distinctions between the professions in this study was the contrast between the continual presence of the nurse as opposed to the periodic appearance of the doctor. Lawler raises the same point, and suggests that nurses and patients are \u201ccaptives\u201d together. 6 Questioning the relevance of scientific knowledge, she argues that nurses and patients are \u201cfocused on more immediate concerns and on ways in which experiences can be endured and transcended\u201d. This highlights the particular contribution of nursing, for it is not merely concerned with the body, but is also in an \u201cintimate\u201d and ongoing relationship with the person within the body. Thus nursing becomes concerned with \u201cuntidy\u201d things such as emotions and feelings, which traditional natural and social sciences have difficulty accommodating. \u201cIt is about the interface between the biological and the social, as people reconcile the lived body with the object body in the experience of illness.\u201d 7\nWhat sort of evidence does nursing need?\nThese arguments suggest that nursing, through its particular relationship with patients and their sick or well bodies, will rely on many different ways of knowing and many different kinds of knowledge. Lawler's work on how the body is managed by nurses illustrates this. 6 She explains how an understanding of the physiological body is essential, but that this must be complemented by evidence from the social sciences because \u201cwe also practice with living, breathing, speaking humans.\u201d Moreover, this must be grounded in experiential knowledge gained from being a nurse, and doing nursing. Knowledge, or evidence, for practice thus comes to us from a variety of disciplines, from particular paradigms or ways of \u201clooking at\u201d the world, and from our own professional and non-professional life experiences.\nPicking the research design to fit the question\nScientists believe that the social world, just like the physical world, is orderly and rational, and thus it is possible to determine universal laws which can predict outcome. They propose the idea of an objective reality independent of the researcher, which can be measured quantitatively, and they are concerned with minimising bias. The other major paradigm is interpretism/naturalism which takes another approach, suggesting that a measurable and objective reality separate from the researcher does not exist; the researcher cannot therefore be separated from the \u201cresearched\u201d. Thus who we are, what we are, and where we are will affect the sorts of questions we pose, and the way we collect and interpret data. Furthermore, in this paradigm, social life is not thought to be orderly and rational, knowledge of the world is relative and will change with time and place. Interpretism/naturalism is concerned with understanding situations and with studying things as they are. Research approaches in this paradigm try to capture the whole picture, rather than a small part of it.\nThis way of approaching research is very useful, especially to a discipline concerned with trying to understand the predicaments of patients and their relatives, who find themselves ill, recovering, or facing a lifetime of chronic illness or death. Questions which arise in these areas are less concerned with causation, treatment effectiveness, and economics and more with the meaning which situations have\u2014why has this happened to me? What is my life going to be like from now on? The focus of these questions is on the process, not the outcome. Data about such issues are best obtained by interviews or participant observation. These are aspects of nursing which are less easily measured and quantified. Moreover, some aspects of nursing cannot even be formalised within the written word because they are perceived, or experienced, in an embodied way. For example, how do you record aspects of care such as trust, empathy, or \u201cbeing there\u201d? Can such aspects be captured within the confines of research as we know it?\nQuestions of causation, prognosis, and effectiveness are best answered using scientific methods. For example, rates of infection and thrombophlebitis are issues which concern nurses looking after intravenous cannulas. Therefore, nurses might want access to a randomised controlled trial of various ways in which cannula sites are cleansed and dressed to determine if this affects infection rates. Similarly, some very clear economic and organisational questions might be posed by nurses working in day surgery units. Is day surgery cost effective? What are the rates of early readmission to hospital? Other questions could include: what was it like for patients who had day surgery? Did nurses find this was a satisfying way to work? These would be better answered using interpretist approaches which focus on the meaning that different situations have for people. Nurses working with patients with senile dementia might also use this approach for questions such as how to keep these patients safe and yet ensure their right to freedom, or what it is like to live with a relative with senile dementia. Thus different questions require different research designs. No single design has precedence over another, rather the design chosen must fit the particular research question.\nResearch designs useful to nursing\nNursing presents a vast range of questions which straddle both the major paradigms, and it has therefore embraced an eclectic range of research designs and begun to explore the value of critical approaches and feminist methods in its research. 8 The current nursing literature contains a wide spectrum of research designs exemplified in this issue, ranging from randomised controlled trials, 9 and cohort studies, 10 at the scientific end of the spectrum, through to grounded theory, 11 ethnography, 12 and phenomenology at the interpretist/naturalistic end. 13 Future issues of this journal will explore these designs in depth.\nMaximising the potential of evidence-based nursing\nEvidence-based care concerns the incorporation of evidence from research, clinical expertise, and patient preferences into decisions about the health care of individual patients. 14 Most professionals seek to ensure that their care is effective, compassionate, and meets the needs of their patients. Therefore sound research evidence which tells us what does and does not work, and with whom and where it works best, is good news. Maximum use must be made of scientific and economic evidence, and the products of initiatives such as the Cochrane Collaboration. However, nurses and consumers of health care clearly need other evidence, arising from questions which cannot be framed in scientific or economic terms. Nursing could spark some insightful debate concerning the nature and contribution of other types of knowledge, such as clinical intuition, which are so important to practitioners. 15\nIn summary, in embracing evidence-based nursing we must heed these considerations:\nNursing must discard its suspicion of scientific, quantitative evidence, gather the skills to critique it, and design imaginative trials which will assist in improving many aspects of nursing\nWe must promulgate naturalistic/interpretist studies by indicating their usefulness and confirming/explaining their rigour in investigating the social world of health care\nMore research is needed into the reality and consequences of adopting evidence-based practice. Can practitioners act on the evidence, or are they being made responsible for activities beyond their control?\nIt must be emphasised that those concerns which are easily measured or articulated are not the only ones of importance in health care. Space is needed to recognise and explore the knowledge which comes from doing nursing and reflecting on it, to find new channels for speaking of concepts which are not easily accommodated within the discourse of social or natural science\u2014hope, despair, misery, love.\nReferences\n\u21b5\nBostrum J, Suter WN.

Over the past few decades though, evidence-based practice has emerged as the gold standard of care and greatly influenced Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) coursework.\nWhat Is Evidence-Based Practice?\nEvidence-based practice (EBP) is a patient-centered approach founded on independent scientific research, clinical expertise, standardized practice and patient experiences. Nurses and other healthcare providers who utilize this approach must consider the most recent healthcare research when determining the course of care and treatment.\nThe field of nursing earned recognition as an applied science in the 1960s, and research efforts intensified. The accumulation of research may have led to increasing knowledge levels; however, healthcare leaders began to express concern at the widening gap between the ideal healthcare environment and what patients were actually experiencing, despite healthcare reform and a rise in access. Moreover, they were worried that the growing amount of scientific background and research was not being transferred and applied consistently to clinical patient care, thereby failing to meet the goal of improved and consistent outcomes.\nIn response, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), formerly the Institute of Medicine (IOM), issued Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century. This report noted prior research that indicated the current system was causing preventable harm. It also reiterated the need for uniformity across the healthcare system to ensure that all patients were receiving the highest quality of care no matter where they sought treatment. To reach that goal, it was theorized that incremental changes would not be enough \u2014 a complete overhaul would be necessary. One of the recommendations was to implement EBP.\nHow Is Evidence-Based Practice Used in Nursing?\nThe transition to EBP has impacted nursing in several ways. First, nursing education has changed. Colleges and universities have altered their BSN program curricula to incorporate EBP. Students pursuing the degree, even through accelerated online RN to BSN programs, will find coursework that focuses not only on increasing a nurse\u2019s overall knowledge base, but also on the importance of professional accountability. These programs emphasize critical thinking skills and encourage students to consider the patient\u2019s clinical, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as relevant scientific research.\nThe growing use of EBP has also led to a greater interest in and emphasis on nursing research. While bachelor\u2019s programs may contain at least one course related to nursing research, students may find it beneficial to further hone their skills. Although research may not frequently be a task assigned to entry-level nurses, it can be helpful to know about new and emerging scientific data since it can have a more direct influence on current and future professional nursing practices than in the past.\nBecoming familiar with various research methodologies may prepare nurses for careers away from the bedside. With the accumulation of clinical experience and the completion of a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, nurses will find many more opportunities in research. These roles are often more independent and require less patient contact. Nurse researchers may design studies or trials, collect and review data, and write and publish their findings.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Evidence-Based Practice?\nThe ultimate goal of the EBP movement is to standardize and improve access and quality of care across the healthcare system. Certain patient and nurse benefits include the following:\nImproved patient outcomes. The heavy focus on raising the overall quality of care may lead to improved outcomes and health for patients. Using the most current healthcare research can help minimize complications associated with chronic illness and prevent additional illness or disease.\nLower costs of care. Roughly one in four Americans are living with multiple chronic illnesses and the cost of caring for these patients can often be substantial. Using EBP\u2019s patient-centered approach may help eliminate unnecessary costs linked to treating chronically ill patients as well as reduce expenses for healthier patients, too.\nSuperior nursing skills. Incorporating EBP throughout a nurse\u2019s education and clinical experiences develops more advanced critical thinking and decision-making skills. Nurses are better able to adapt to situations, utilize informatics and work in interdisciplinary teams. They also feel a greater sense of confidence and pride in their work.\nAdvancing Patient Care\nEvidence-based practice has become an integral component of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care. Nursing students in an RN to BSN program will learn EBP theories and apply this knowledge in their careers. Offering benefits to both patients and nurses, evidence-based practice is helping to lead the way in advancing patient care.\nLearn more about Mississippi College\u2019s online RN to BSN program.\nHave a question or concern about this article?

An essential trait of a caring, competent practitioner is questioning standard procedure and determining how to improve it. Nursing concerns are the heart of nursing research.\nWhat Is Nursing Research?\nAccording to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, rigorous nursing research provides a body of knowledge that helps advance nursing practice. The findings of such scientific inquiry may also help shape health policy and contribute to global healthcare. Nursing professionals are committed to the health and well-being of everyone. The research they conduct often has lasting impacts.\nThe National Institute of Nursing Research says that nursing research uncovers knowledge to build the foundation of clinical practice and reinforce the following:\nPrevent disease and disability.\nManage symptoms of illness.\nEnhance end-of-life care.\nAccording to the website Nursing World, nurses use research to effect positive outcomes for their patients and for others within the healthcare system. As patients\u2019 needs become more complex and healthcare systems become more varied, nurses use evidence-based care by incorporating their own nursing research with their professional experience and a patient\u2019s preferences. Nurses may conduct their own research, use research in their everyday practice and teach others using existing research.\nScientific Inquiry\nThe American Association of Colleges of Nursing uses three classifications of nursing research. These include clinical research, nursing education research and health systems and outcomes research. Clinical research looks at care for individuals across the spans of their entire lives, and nurses can carry out this research in any clinical setting. Nursing education research examines how students learn the nursing profession. Finally, health systems and outcomes research focuses on the quality, quantity and costs of healthcare services, including how to improve the delivery of care. These three areas provide the full scope of nursing research.\nRole of Nursing Research in Online Programs\nStudents who enroll in online nursing programs may take courses in research that will help improve their skills. Courses in nursing research may introduce research design and analysis, giving the student a basis for learning how to examine, apply and utilize current knowledge. These courses also include evidence-based practice, and the student will receive an overview of current issues in knowledge development.\nToday\u2019s healthcare system is complex, and patients have increasingly varied needs. Developing solutions for the health issues of diverse populations requires providers with many different perspectives. Those enrolled in online nursing programs may become professionals who understand the need for nursing research and how to incorporate it into their own practice.\nLearn more about the UNCW online RN to BSN program.\nSources:\nRetrieved from Evidence-Based Practice.

This plan complements the ambitions set out in Saving and Improving Lives: The Future of UK Clinical Research Delivery and will form part of NHS England and NHS Improvements contribution to the delivery of this vision.\nFulfilling this ambition will strengthen and expand nurses\u2019 contribution to health and care outcomes through research of global significance.\u00a0 This \u00a0provides the scientific basis for: the care of people across the lifespan;\u00a0 during illness, through to recovery and at the end of life, preventing illness, protecting health and promoting wellbeing\nThere are 5 themes underpinning the vision:\nAligning nurse-led research with public need \u2013 so the portfolios of relevant funders reflect the research priorities of patients, carers, service users, residents, the public and our profession.\nReleasing nurses\u2019 research potential \u2013 to create a climate in which nurses are empowered to lead, use, deliver and participate in research as part of their job, and the voice of the profession is valued.\nBuilding the best research system \u2013 so that England isthe best place for nurses to lead, deliver and get involved in cutting-edge research.\nDeveloping future nurse leaders of research \u2013 to offer rewarding opportunities and sustainable careers that support growth in the number and diversity of nurse leaders of research.\nDigitally-enabled nurse-led research \u2013 to create a digitally-enabled practice environment for nursing that supports research and delivers better outcomes for the public.\nNext steps\nThe plan will be delivered in three phases: discover, build and sustain. A detailed implementation plan, (which has developed with the profession, our partners and the public) will follow this strategic plan in Spring 2022, and set out what we will deliver in 2022 and 2023.\nTogether we can work towards a future where research led by nurses is business as usual in health and care settings.

Putting EBP into action, however, is another story. Implementation of EBP varies widely among healthcare staff, from novice nurses to seasoned professionals.\nHowever, educational preparation can make a difference. Associate and diploma nursing programs typically focus on developing clinical skills. BSN programs, such as the online RN to BSN at Eastern Michigan University (EMU), build on those skills to prepare nurses at a higher level. This includes an emphasis on EBP as a decision-making approach to care.\nWhat Is Evidence-Based Practice?\nThere is no single definition of EBP. Lippincott's Why Evidence-Based Practice? defines EBP simply as \"the thorough use of current best research-based evidence in making decisions about patient care.\"\nThe Institute of Medicine, or IOM, (now the National Academy of Medicine) takes a wider view, defining EBP to mean that \"to the greatest extent possible, the decisions that shape the health and health care of Americans \u2014 by patients, providers, payers, and policy makers alike \u2014 will be grounded on a reliable evidence base, will account appropriately for individual variation in patient needs, and will support the generation of new insights on clinical effectiveness.\"\nIf the triple aim in healthcare comes to mind, that is because EBP supports each goal of this framework:\nImproving the patient experience\nImproving population health\nReducing healthcare costs\nThe quadruple aim adds a fourth goal \u2014 improving the work life of nurses and other healthcare providers, something every RN can get behind. Bernadette Mazurek Melnyk, PhD, RN, CPNP/PMHNP, FNAP, FAAN, calls EBP the \"secret sauce to enable us to get to that quadruple aim.\"\nWhat Are Barriers to EBP?\nEBP is recognized as a transformational force in healthcare. What keeps EBP from being the standard for clinical decision-making? Workplace culture is part of the problem. As Laura Wallis explains in an American Journal of Nursing article, implementing EBP means getting past \"we've always done it this way.\"\nWallis discusses a survey by Bernadette Mazurek Melnyk and her colleagues that assessed \"readiness and willingness\" to implement EBP. Only 34.5% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their co-workers consistently used EBP. In addition to lack of organizational support, barriers to EBP include:\nTime limitations\nResistance to EBP by work colleagues and nurse leaders/managers\nLack of educational opportunities to develop knowledge and skills for EBP\nLack of access to knowledgeable mentors, resources and tools for EBP\nThe survey found that nurses recognize the value of EBP, but they need help adopting it.\nWhat Are Some Implementation Strategies?\nEBP is not a new approach. In 2003, the IOM identified EBP as one of five\u00a0core competencies for providing optimum care. The IOM set a goal that by 2020, 90% of clinical decisions\u00a0will be supported by EBP.\nThis goal is still in the works, but the following story shows one strategy that helps: earning a BSN.\nBlogging for Nurse.com, Alexander Alvaro Salinas, BSN, RN, shared the experience of being corrected by a seasoned nurse for not aspirating a syringe during an intramuscular injection. Salinas supported his decision with research, explaining that \"aspirating intramuscularly is no longer a standard of practice since no evidence supports its practice and it can cause trauma to patients.\"\nBSN graduates are known for their professional-level skills, including in EBP. Coursework in EMU's RN to BSN, for example, emphasizes:\nNursing research and the importance of evidence-based nursing practice\nEthical issues involved in research\nAdequacy and application of existing research\nCritical thinking and actions of EBP in nursing\nA study published in The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety backs up the benefits of a BSN to boost EBP implementation. The study compared differences in quality and safety preparedness between associate and bachelor's degree graduates. BSN grads reported being significantly better prepared in 12 of 16 topics, including EBP.\nMentoring helps to build a supportive culture in the nursing workplace. Mentoring is often seen as experienced RNs teaching novice RNs. But as the study suggests, new BSN grads can be a valuable resource for nurses of any age when it comes to EBP.\nAn Advisory Board \"daily briefing\" identifies additional strategies for implementing EBP:\nModify EBP for available resources. EHR order sets, for example, can promote EBP. A healthcare organization without this capability can achieve similar outcomes with paper checklists.\nKeep patient-centered goals in mind. For example, shorter hospital stays can reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Focusing on \"optimizing recovery\" instead can reduce the risk of rushing patients out the door.\nBuilding the knowledge to integrate EBP can give RNs confidence that they are providing the best care, even in the most complex situations.

Nurses are vital to the American health care system, and without their expertise and skills, millions of patients would not receive the care and comfort that they need.\nHowever, nursing education does not always have to lead to a career at the bedside. In fact, there is a career option that allows nurses to influence the practice of nursing as a whole and to improve outcomes for patients across the spectrum, from individuals to communities.\nNurse researchers play a vital role in all aspects of health care delivery, from policy development to nurse education to community health best practices. They contribute to the foundational knowledge important to all nurses, and they support the notion of evidence-based care that forms the backbone of health care delivery.\nMost entry-level nurses aren\u2019t responsible for conducting or interpreting research. In fact, even baccalaureate level nursing education programs tend to focus on preparing nurses to care for patients safely and effectively. For that reason, nurses who wish to do more in terms of research tend to pursue advanced degrees, most commonly a doctorate in nursing.\nPractice vs. Research-Based Ph.D. Programs\nNo discussion of nursing research would be complete without at least a short mention of the difference between practice-based and research-based programs. As the name implies, a practice based nursing doctorate program is dedicated to developing nurses\u2019 expertise in practice, and giving them the tools they need to interpret research and apply it to patient-care. Research-based doctorate programs, on the other hand, focus on training nurses to actually conduct the research necessary to develop the practices and policies that drive health care delivery. These nurses are trained in study design and implementation, qualitative and quantitative research methods, and the analytical skills necessary to interpret and evaluate research. Their expertise isn\u2019t so much in actually putting the new knowledge to use, but in discovering the evidence that leads to better outcomes.\nThe Importance of Ongoing Research\nThe face of health care in America is changing. Not only are people living longer than ever, they are living with diseases and conditions that even a few decades ago would have been considered fatal. Economic and social factors are major determinants of health care access, delivery, and quality. Technology is changing the way that disease is being diagnosed and treated. In short, there is an ongoing need for health care providers to evaluate current best practices and develop new protocols based on their findings.\nThat\u2019s where nursing research comes in. Some of the reasons such efforts are important include:\nImproved Nursing Education. Nursing education needs to center around the most up-to-date, evidence-based practices. Nurse research identifies ways to make nurse education more effective.\nImproved Health Care Delivery. Nurse research looks at how health care is delivered, and how that influences the cost and quality of the service, as well as the experience of patients and families.\nIt investigates the factors that influence access to health care and looks to identify solutions that will improve the overall delivery system.\nImproved Outcomes. Modern nursing is evidence-based, and nurse research seeks to identify the treatment protocols that are most effective for patients across the spectrum. Nursing research differs from biomedical research, which seeks to identify the causes and treatments for disease. Nursing research looks at the overall health of patients; it considers disease within the lenses of health promotion, rehabilitation, and restoration, and looks for better ways to provide care and comfort that meet patients\u2019 needs.\nNurse researchers take what medical researchers discover about disease and expand it to investigate the social, emotional, and behavioral aspects to help develop protocols that improve outcomes and overall quality of life.\nImproved Leadership. Nurse leadership is a primary goal of the American Nurses Association, which has called for more nurse education focused on leadership. Nurse research helps identify new practices for nurses, so they can become more effective health care leaders and advocates for both their patients and overall health care improvement.\nNursing research plays a vital role in today\u2019s health care environment. By taking a more scientific and analytical approach to the practice of nursing, not only do outcomes for patients improve, but the entire field and practice of nursing does as well.\nPosted In Nurse\nTags Nursing Specialties\nAbout Jasmine Howard\nI am freelance writer who touches on various topics and niches that relate to my everyday life.

Nursing Times; 107: online edition, 26 April.\nClinical research is essential for continually improving standards of patient care. From the position where there was a dearth of research, the oral/maxillofacial research team at Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust has built up a rapidly increasing portfolio of trials. Research nurses have played a pivotal role in this initiative.\nKeywords: Research nurse, Teamwork, Patient advocacy\nThis article has been double-blind peer reviewed\n5 Key Points\nClinical research is vital for finding new treatments and improving patient care. Research nurses are at the forefront of this process.\nResearch nurses need a thorough understanding of the research process and terminology, and in-depth knowledge of the specialty under investigation.\nThe nurses play a key role as patient advocate, ensuring patients\u2019 safety and protection, and that patients are well supported throughout the research study.\nResearch nurses need a wide range of skills including management and organisational skills, teaching and mentoring, communication and IT.\nCollaboration and cooperation with other researchers and members of the multidisciplinary team is crucial for successful research.\nResearch is an indispensable part of a modern, effective health service and essential to the provision of effective and safe health and social care (Royal College of Nursing, 2009; Department of Health, 2005). The NHS is an excellent environment for clinical research, because access to healthcare is equal regardless of patients\u2019 background.\nExperience at Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust has shown us that without dedicated research nursing staff it is difficult to succeed in clinical research. By developing a team with research nurses at the core we have substantially increased recruitment to clinical trials recruitment and obtained a phase 3 clinical trial grant from Cancer Research UK. This article discusses our experience of developing a new clinical research team.\nThe trust\u2019s maxillofacial unit plays a leading role in treating patients with head and neck cancers. Treatment for these cancers is often intensive and may involve major surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It can have a dramatic effect on patients\u2019 quality of life and they often need extensive support from a multidisciplinary team of health professionals. Research is essential to continue improving every aspect of their care, from earlier diagnosis to increased survival and from developing more effective treatments to helping patients with all their physical, social, psychological and emotional needs afterwards.\nResearch activity in the maxillofacial unit\nUntil recently, the unit undertook little research activity. However, in 2006 a new consultant surgeon with an interest in clinical research was appointed, and since then the number of clinical trials has increased, as has the number of patients recruited into trials. Within two years, four studies were opened and 120 patients enrolled. We now have five trials open and are hosting a new Cancer Research UK-funded multicentre trial. Fig 1 shows the increase in clinical research activity.\nFig 1. Increases in clinical research activity\nSetting up and running a clinical trial is a complex process that takes time, planning and resources. All research involving humans is also strictly regulated to ensure participants\u2019 safety and wellbeing.\nGetting started in research is both exciting and challenging. One of the most valuable lessons we have learned is that teamwork is crucial. All members of our team have their own unique skills and expertise to contribute; this includes participants themselves, whose first-hand knowledge of being a patient can give researchers better insight into important issues to address that may be overlooked by clinicians. Collaboration with other researchers and experts is also important part - several of the unit\u2019s current projects are being run jointly with other hospitals and universities.\nResearch support\nIn recognition of the benefits of promoting cooperation in research, the government established The National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) in and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to provide support and advice for anyone wishing to undertake clinical research. The NIHR has set up a portfolio of high-quality studies adopted by the institute. Recruitment into these studies is one way by which research teams are assessed and funding is awarded.\nWithin Bradford Teaching Hospitals the Bradford Institute for Health Research (BIHR) is led by an academic professor with a medical background. Shortly after the new consultant was appointed, he set about building a clinical research team for the specialty. Funding from the BIHR, NCRN and NIHR enabled us to recruit 1.3 whole-time equivalent (WTE) research nurses to the maxillofacial research team. This core group of one consultant surgeon and 1.3 WTE research nurses worked with the rest of the head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team to increase our clinical trial activity, and we have since received funding for another WTE research nurse and a research administrator. Our own CRUK funded multicentre trial will recruit a clinical trial coordinator and we are shortly to appoint a clinical research fellow\nThe role of the research nurse\nComing into the world of clinical research from hands-on care provision involved a steep learning curve for the nurses. A solid foundation based on years of experience in nursing is vital to the role, but it requires a wide range of additional skills and knowledge.\nThe research nurse\u2019s job is complex, varied and interesting. Although the principal investigator (PI) has ultimate responsibility for any study, it is often research nurses who coordinate its day-to-day management. This means leadership and organisational skills and a flexible and adaptable approach are vital. Since the nurses may at times work alone, they also need to be able to prioritise and to make decisions. As Poston and Buescher (2010) explain, research nurses are at the fulcrum of clinical trials. They not only need a comprehensive understanding of the specialty in which they are working, but also an extensive knowledge of the research process and research-related legislation. In addition, they need a variety of computer-based skills, especially in the use of word processing, spreadsheets, database and presentation software, and the ability to undertake internet searches.\nThe many duties of a research nurse include preparing trial protocols and other trial-related documentation, submitting study proposals for regulatory approval, and coordinating the initiation, management and completion of the research.\nEnsuring patients give fully informed consent before being enrolled to trials is fundamental to the role. This encapsulates screening for potential participants at outpatients clinics and multidisciplinary team meetings, making sure patients are given all the information they need and that they fully understand the purpose of the study, any potential risks and benefits and what will happen to them if they agree to participate. It must also be made clear to patients that they do not have to participate and are free to withdraw at any time without it affecting their treatment or care in any way. For this, nurses need an ability to give clear explanations, along with excellent communication and interpersonal skills.\nOnce patients are enrolled to a trial, the research nurse may be responsible for randomisation, and for collecting and recording data. Quality and reproducibility of data are two of the key principles of ethically sound research. All data must be accurate and complete for the results of the study to be valid, and research nurses often have responsibility for this aspect whether it be entering data themselves or checking that all records are correct and up to date. This requires attention to detail, a meticulous approach and a high level of integrity.\nPrompt reporting of adverse events is fundamental to patient protection and a responsibility of the research nurse. These may be any unfavourable change in health or suspected side-effect experienced by a participant, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment they are receiving (European Medicines Agency, 2002).\nIn the event of a patient suffering any untoward occurrence such as significant disability, incapacity or death, any life-threatening event, hospitalisation or prolongation of hospital stay or any form of congenital abnormality, a serious adverse event must be declared within 24 hours of the researchers becoming aware of it. If there is any possibility of harm being done to participants as a result of being in a trial, it is essential to identify it quickly and take appropriate action, which may even mean closing the trial prematurely.\nFinally, research nurses may also act as teachers, mentors and advisors to other health professionals, or to give presentations at conferences and other meetings.\nPatient protection\nPatient advocacy is one of the most important of the research nurse\u2019s responsibilities. The International Conference Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guide emphases the protection, safety and wellbeing of trial participants must be a priority - no one taking part in clinical trials should be harmed. \u00a0Anyone working in clinical research must, therefore, have up-to-date training in GCP (European Medicines Agency, 2002) and act according to the tenets of The Declaration of Helsinki\u2019s Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (WMA, 2008). This stipulates that participants\u2019 health and wellbeing must take precedence over all other interests. GCP training must be maintained on a two-yearly basis either by attending a one-day course, or through an online e-learning course with assessment.\nConclusion\nFrom a position whereby there was a dearth of research, the Bradford Head and Neck Department has steadily built up an increasing portfolio of clinical trials. The key lesson learnt from building our portfolio of clinical trials has been the importance of teamwork, which is vital to the success of clinical research. \u00a0Every member of the team has a significant part to play but research nurses are the lynchpin of our team.

They are a necessity for the provision of safe, high-quality clinical care. Nurses today are caring for patients who have complex, culturally diverse health care needs, making the\u00a0importance of critical thinking in nursing even more\u00a0paramount.\nThe growing body of research, patient acuity, and complexity of care demand higher-order thinking skills. A lack of experience can limit a nurse\u2019s ability to reason, think and judge, which can pose a hazard to patients.\nTherefore, expert nursing performance is dependent upon continual learning and evaluation of performance. For over 50 years, nursing education has emphasized critical thinking as an essential nursing skill. Professional and regulatory bodies in nursing education have required that critical thinking be component of all nursing curricula.\nEarn Your MSN-FNP Part-Time For Less than $30k\nWhat is Critical Thinking in Nursing?\nThe National League for Nursing Accreditation Commission (NLNAC) has defined critical thinking as \u201cthe deliberate nonlinear process of collecting, interpreting, analyzing, drawing conclusions about, presenting, and evaluating information that is both factually and belief based.\nThis is demonstrated in nursing by clinical judgment, which includes ethical, diagnostic, and therapeutic dimensions and research.\u201d Critical thinking in nursing involves applying knowledge and experience to identify patient problems and directing clinical judgments by selecting from alternatives, weighing evidence, using intuition, and by pattern recognition. It includes questioning, data collection, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, inference, inductive and deductive reasoning, intuition, application, creativity, and verification.\nA nurse who thinks critically utilizes core cognitive thinking skills and justification based on evidence to carry out actions that result in positive patient outcomes.\nCore Cognitive Critical Thinking Skills\nSkillful nurses can think critically because they possess the following characteristics: motivation, perseverance, fair-mindedness, innovation, creativity, flexibility, intuition, and deliberate and careful attention to thinking. The expert critical thinker uses the following core cognitive critical thinking skills:\nInterpretation involves clarifying the meaning of patient data. Interpretation may include determining the significance of laboratory values, vital signs, and physical assessment data as well as understanding the meaning of a patient's behavior or statements.\nAnalysis is determining the patient's problems based on assessment data. At times, the actual problem cannot be validated initially, but several hypotheses can be identified.\nEvaluation is identifying expected nursing care outcomes and assessing whether or not they are met. If not met, the nurse ascertains the reason, allowing for the revision of actions and goals.\nInference is about making deductions about information. For example, the nurse uses careful monitoring to determine when a patient's health status improves or declines. Inferences are created through the concepts and assumptions the nurse brings to the table.\nExplanation is the ability to justify actions. The nurse implements interventions based on research or other sources of evidence. Explanation includes the application of nursing theories and models, an appropriate ethical framework, and research-based knowledge from nursing and the sciences.\nSelf-regulation is the process of assessing one's practice and adjusting or improving it if necessary. Nurses must be able to plan, execute, monitor, and evaluate their learning and develop an awareness of their abilities. This creates self-directed lifelong learners.\nCritical Thinking Pitfalls\nCritical thinking can fall by the wayside when patient care is dictated by prejudice, preferences, self-interests, or fear. When the critical thinking process is not understood and applied correctly, nurses\u2019 clinical judgment may be inaccurate and associated with inappropriate interventions that can lead to poor patient outcomes.\nNurses with poor critical thinking skills frequently fail to detect impending patient deterioration. This results in \u2018failure to rescue,\u2019 defined as mortality of patients who experience a hospital-acquired complication, which can occur for a multitude of reasons.\nNurses may have difficulty differentiating between a clinical problem that requires immediate attention and one that is less acute. Errors can also occur when a large amount of complex data must be processed in a time sensitive manner.\nHow to Improve Critical Thinking Skills in Nursing\nLearning to provide safe and quality health care requires experience, technical expertise, critical thinking skills, and clinical judgment. The high-performance expectation of nurses is dependent upon continual learning, professional accountability, independent and interdependent decision making, and creative problem-solving abilities.\nNurses can gain the necessary expertise by engaging in self-reflective and collegial dialogue about professional practice, volunteering on committees and task forces, and attending continuing education opportunities, conventions, and conferences. It requires commitment and motivation to develop the core cognitive skills central to critical thinking.\nAnyone can develop these skills by practicing, nurturing, and reinforcing them over time. To start, nurses can focus on the \u2018five rights\u2019 of clinical reasoning (also known as critical thinking):\nRight cues are the available patient information (i.e., handoff reports, patient history, previous nursing/medical assessments), current clinical assessment data, and the recall of nursing knowledge.\nRight patient refers to the process of identifying and prioritizing a patient at risk of critical illness or a severe adverse event.\nRight time means nurses identify clinically at-risk patients promptly and carry out nursing interventions at the right time and in the right sequence.\nRight action occurs when the nurse decides which part of the plan takes priority, who should carry out the nursing actions, which procedures and policies are involved, and who should be notified.\nRight reason indicates that the reasoning is ethical, legal, and professional. \u2018\u2018Right\u201d may refer to the right conclusion being reached, or it may refer to the process, or preferably both.\nThe importance of critical thinking in nursing cannot be overstated. Patients are diverse; their clinical presentations are unique. Nurses must be capable of making rational clinical decisions and solving problems in order to provide safe, high-quality care.\nCritical thinking is vital for nurses to meet the challenges of caring for increasingly complex patients.

If you\u2019re launching a business, the odds are against you: Two-thirds of start-ups never show a positive return. Unnerved by that statistic, a professor of entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School set out to discover ...\nMost start-ups don\u2019t succeed: More than two-thirds of them never deliver a positive return to investors. But why do so many end disappointingly? That question hit me with full force several years ago when I realized I couldn\u2019t answer it.\nThat was unnerving. For the past 24 years, I\u2019ve been a professor at Harvard Business School, where I\u2019ve led the team teaching The Entrepreneurial Manager, a required course for all our MBAs. At HBS I\u2019ve also drawn on my research, my experiences as an angel investor, and my work on start-up boards to help create 14 electives on every aspect of launching a new venture. But could I truly teach students how to build winning start-ups if I wasn\u2019t sure why so many were failing?\nI became determined to get to the bottom of the question. I interviewed or surveyed hundreds of founders and investors, read scores of first- and third-person published accounts of entrepreneurial setbacks, and wrote and taught more than 20 case studies about unsuccessful ventures. The result of my research is a book, Why Startups Fail, in which I identify recurring patterns that explain why a large number of start-ups come to nothing.\nMy findings go against the pat assumptions of many venture capital investors. If you ask them why start-ups fall short, you will most likely hear about \u201chorses\u201d (that is, the opportunities start-ups are targeting) and \u201cjockeys\u201d (the founders). Both are important, but if forced to choose, most VCs would favor an able founder over an attractive opportunity. Consequently, when asked to explain why a promising new venture eventually stumbled, most are inclined to cite the inadequacies of its founders\u2014in particular, their lack of grit, industry acumen, or leadership ability.\nPutting the blame on the founders oversimplifies a complex situation. It\u2019s also an example of what psychologists call the fundamental attribution error \u2014the tendency for observers, when explaining outcomes, to emphasize the main actors\u2019 disposition and for the main actors to cite situational factors not under their control\u2014for example, in the case of a failed start-up, a rival\u2019s irrational moves.\nPutting scapegoating aside, I identified six patterns of failure, which I describe fully in my book. In this article I\u2019ve chosen to focus on two of them in greater detail, for two reasons: First, they\u2019re the most common avoidable reasons why start-ups go wrong. I\u2019m not interested in clearly doomed ventures with no chance of success or even promising start-ups that were felled by unexpected external forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Rather, I\u2019ve focused on ventures that initially showed promise but subsequently crashed to earth because of errors that could have been averted. Second, the two patterns are the most applicable to people launching new ventures within larger companies, government agencies, and nonprofits, which makes them especially relevant to HBR readers. I\u2019ll explain each pattern more fully, illustrate it with a case study, explain when it\u2019s most likely to occur, and suggest ways to steer clear of it. (To learn more about the other common reasons for failure, see the following sidebar.)\nFour Other Patterns That Doom Start-ups\nFalse positives. \n   Early-stage entrepreneurs often misinterpret signals about market demand. Beguiled by an ...\nGood Idea, Bad Bedfellows\nAs I\u2019ve noted, VCs look for founders with the right stuff: resilience, passion, experience leading start-up teams, and so forth. But even when such rare talent captains a new venture, there are other parties whose contributions are crucial to it. A broad set of stakeholders, including employees, strategic partners, and investors, all can play a role in a venture\u2019s downfall.\nIndeed, a great jockey isn\u2019t even necessary for start-up success. Other members of the senior management team can compensate for a founder\u2019s shortcomings, and seasoned investors and advisers can likewise provide guidance and useful connections. A new venture pursuing an amazing opportunity will typically attract such contributors\u2014even if its founder doesn\u2019t walk on water. But if its idea is merely good, a start-up may not become a talent magnet.\nConsider the case of Quincy Apparel. In May 2011 two former students of mine, Alexandra Nelson and Christina Wallace, came to me for feedback on their start-up concept. I admired both of them and was impressed with their idea, which identified an unmet customer need: Young professional women had a hard time finding affordable and stylish work apparel that fit them well. Nelson and Wallace, who were close friends, devised a novel solution: a sizing scheme that allowed customers to specify four separate garment measurements (such as waist-to-hip ratio and bra size)\u2014akin to the approach used for tailoring men\u2019s suits.\nFollowing the lean start-up method, Nelson and Wallace then validated customer demand using a textbook-perfect minimum viable product, or MVP\u2014that is, the simplest possible offering that yields reliable customer feedback. They held six trunk shows at which women could try on sample outfits and place orders. Of the 200 women who attended, 25% made purchases. Buoyed by these results, the cofounders quit their consulting jobs, raised $950,000 in venture capital, recruited a team, and launched Quincy Apparel. They employed a direct-to-consumer business model, selling online rather than through brick-and-mortar stores. At this point I became an early angel investor in the company.\nKalle Gustafsson/Trunk Archive\nInitial orders were strong, as were reorders: An impressive 39% of customers who bought items from Quincy\u2019s first seasonal collection made repeat purchases. However, robust demand required heavy investment in inventory. Meanwhile, production problems caused garments to fit poorly on some customers, resulting in higher-than-expected returns. Processing returns and correcting production problems put pressure on margins, rapidly depleting Quincy\u2019s cash reserves. After Quincy tried and failed to raise more capital, the team trimmed the product line, aiming to simplify operations and realize efficiencies. However, the business lacked enough funding to prove out the pivot, and Quincy was forced to shut down less than a year after its launch.\nSo why did Quincy fail?\nQuincy\u2019s founders had a good idea. The venture\u2019s value proposition was appealing to target customers, and the business had a sound formula for earning a profit\u2014at least over the long term, after shaking out the bugs in production. The team had credible projections that customers in priority segments, who\u2019d accounted for more than half of Quincy\u2019s sales, would each have a lifetime value of over $1,000\u2014well in excess of the $100 average cost to acquire a new customer. (Quincy\u2019s out-of-pocket marketing costs were kept low by social-network-fueled word of mouth and enthusiastic media coverage.)\nWere Wallace and Nelson simply poor jockeys? Temperamentally, their fit with the founder role was good. They were sharp and resourceful and had complementary strengths. Wallace, who was responsible for marketing and fundraising, had a big vision and the charisma to sell it. Nelson, who led operations, was deliberate and disciplined. However, the founder team wobbled in two important ways. First, unwilling to strain their close friendship, Wallace and Nelson shared decision-making authority equally with respect to strategy, product design, and other key choices. This slowed their responses when action was required. Second, neither founder had experience with clothing design and manufacturing.\nA broad set of stakeholders, including employees, strategic partners, and investors, all can play a role in a venture\u2019s downfall.\nApparel production entails many specialized tasks, such as fabric sourcing, pattern making, and quality control. To compensate for their lack of industry know-how, the founders hired a few apparel company veterans, assuming that they\u2019d fill multiple functions\u2014as jack-of-all-trades team members do in most early-stage start-ups. However, accustomed to the high levels of specialization in mature apparel companies, Quincy\u2019s employees weren\u2019t flexible about tackling tasks outside their areas of expertise.\nQuincy outsourced manufacturing to third-party factories, which was not unusual in the industry. But the factories were slow to meet production commitments for entrepreneurs who had no industry reputation, required unusual garment sizing, and placed small orders. This meant shipping delays for Quincy.\nInvestors also played a role in Quincy\u2019s demise. The founders had aimed to raise $1.5 million but managed to secure only $950,000. That was enough to fund operations for two seasonal collections. Before launching, the founders had correctly assumed that at least three seasons would be needed to fine-tune operations. Quincy had some traction after two seasons but not enough to lure new backers, and the venture capital firms that had provided most of its money were too small to commit more funds. Furthermore, the founders were disappointed with the guidance they got from those VCs, who pressured them to grow at full tilt\u2014like the technology start-ups the investors were more familiar with. Doing so forced Quincy to build inventory, burning through cash before it had resolved its production problems.\nIn summary, Quincy had a good idea but bad bedfellows: Besides the founders, a range of resource providers were culpable in the venture\u2019s collapse, including team members, manufacturing partners, and investors.\nCould this outcome have been avoided? Perhaps. The founders\u2019 lack of fashion industry experience was at the root of many problems. It took time for Wallace and Nelson to master the complexities of apparel design and production. Without industry connections, they couldn\u2019t leverage their professional networks to recruit team members or count on past relationships with factory managers to ensure prompt delivery. And without an industry track record, they had difficulty finding investors willing to bet on first-time founders.\nAn ideal solution would have been to bring in another cofounder with apparel industry experience. Nelson and Wallace tried to do this, without success. They did have some advisers who could offer guidance\u2014but adding more would have helped. In a postmortem analysis, Quincy\u2019s founders also concluded that they could have sidestepped operational problems by outsourcing their entire design and production process to a single factory partner. Likewise, rather than raising funds from venture capital firms, they could have sought financial backing from a clothing factory. A factory with an equity stake in Quincy would have expedited its orders and worked harder to correct production problems. Also, the factory owners would have known how to pace the growth of a new apparel line, in contrast to Quincy\u2019s VCs, who pressured the team for hypergrowth.\nMany entrepreneurs who claim to embrace the lean start-up canon actually adopt only part of it, neglecting to research customer needs.\nQuincy\u2019s troubles shed some light on the attributes that may make start-ups vulnerable to this particular failure pattern. Entrepreneurs\u2019 lack of industry experience will be especially problematic when large, lumpy resource commitments are required, as they are in apparel manufacturing: Quincy\u2019s founders had to design a multistep product process from scratch, and revising such a process is disruptive once it\u2019s in place. Another factor was ever-shifting fashion trends; the founders had to commit to garment designs and then build inventory for an entire collection many months before it went on sale.\nWith such challenges, learning by doing can result in expensive mistakes. Compounding the pressure, investors prefer to mete out capital one chunk at a time, waiting to see if the business can stay on the rails. If the start-up stumbles or stalls, follow-on financing may not be forthcoming from existing investors, and potential new investors will be scared off. Pivoting to a better solution isn\u2019t feasible when it requires large amounts of capital along with weeks or months to see if new approaches are working. In that situation entrepreneurs have no room for big errors, but a lack of industry experience makes missteps all the more likely.\nFalse Starts\nI have long been an apostle of the lean start-up approach. But as I dug deeper into case studies of failure, I concluded that its practices were falling short of their promise. Many entrepreneurs who claim to embrace the lean start-up canon actually adopt only part of it. Specifically, they launch MVPs and iterate on them after getting feedback. By putting an MVP out there and testing how customers respond, founders are supposed to avoid squandering time and money building and marketing a product that no one wants.\nYet by neglecting to research customer needs before commencing their engineering efforts, entrepreneurs end up wasting valuable time and capital on MVPs that are likely to miss their mark. These are false starts. The entrepreneurs are like sprinters who jump the gun: They\u2019re too eager to get a product out there. The rhetoric of the lean start-up movement\u2014for example, \u201claunch early and often\u201d and \u201cfail fast\u201d\u2014actually encourages this \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d behavior.\nThe online dating start-up Triangulate experienced this syndrome in 2010. Its founder, Sunil Nagaraj, had originally intended to build a matching engine\u2014software that Triangulate would license to existing dating sites such as eHarmony and Match. The engine would automatically extract consumers\u2019 profile data\u2014with their permission\u2014from social networks and media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, and Netflix. The engine would then use algorithms to pair up users whose tastes and habits suggested that they might be romantically compatible. But VCs wouldn\u2019t back the plan. They told Nagaraj, \u201cCome back after you\u2019ve signed a licensing deal.\u201d\nTo prove to potential licensees that the matching engine worked, Nagaraj decided to use it to power Triangulate\u2019s own dating site, a Facebook app that would also leverage the rich user data available to Facebook\u2019s platform partners. VCs now showed interest: Nagaraj raised $750,000 and launched a dating site called Wings. The site was free to use and earned revenue from small payments made by users who sent digital gifts or messages. Wings soon became Triangulate\u2019s main event; the licensing plan went on the back burner.\nKalle Gustafsson/Trunk Archive\nWings automatically populated a user\u2019s profile by connecting to Facebook and other online services. It also encouraged users to invite their friends to the site as \u201cwingmen\u201d who could vouch for them\u2014and provide a viral boost to the site\u2019s growth. Less than a year after launching Wings, however, Nagaraj\u2019s team abandoned both the matching engine and the wingman concept. Users found more value in recommended matches that were based on potential partners\u2019 physical attractiveness, proximity, and responsiveness to messages\u2014criteria routinely employed by existing dating sites. The wingman role, meanwhile, was not delivering hoped-for virality and made the site cumbersome to navigate. Furthermore, many users were uncomfortable making their dating life an open book to their friends.\nA year after launch, Wings\u2019 user base was growing, but user engagement was much lower than expected. As a result, revenue per user fell far short of Nagaraj\u2019s original projections. Also, with limited virality, the cost of acquiring a new user was much higher than his forecast. With an unsustainable business model, Nagaraj and his team had to pivot once again\u2014this time, with cash balances running low. They launched a new dating site, DateBuzz, that allowed users to vote on elements of other users\u2019 profiles\u2014before seeing their photos. This addressed one of the biggest pain points in online dating: the impact of photos on messaging. On a typical dating site, physically attractive individuals get too many messages, and other users get too few. DateBuzz redistributed attention in ways that boosted user satisfaction. Less-attractive individuals were contacted more often, and attractive users still got plenty of queries.\nEntrepreneurs should conduct a competitive analysis, including user testing of existing solutions, to understand the strengths and shortcomings of rival products.\nDespite this innovation, DateBuzz\u2014like Wings\u2014had to spend far more than it could afford to acquire each new user. Lacking confidence that a network effect would kick in and reduce customer acquisition costs before cash balances were exhausted, Nagaraj shut down Triangulate and returned $120,000 to investors.\nSo why did Triangulate fail?\nThe problem was clearly not with the jockey or his bedfellows. Nagaraj had raised funds from a topflight VC and had recruited a very able team\u2014one that could rapidly process user feedback and in response iterate in a creative and nimble manner. Weak founders rarely attract strong teams and smart money. This was not a case of \u201cright opportunity, wrong resources,\u201d as with Quincy\u2019s failure. Rather, Triangulate\u2019s demise followed the opposite pattern: \u201cwrong opportunity, right resources.\u201d\nA clue about the cause of Triangulate\u2019s failure lies in its three big pivots in less than two years. On one hand, pivots are foundational for lean start-ups. With each iteration, Nagaraj\u2019s team had heeded the \u201cfail fast\u201d mantra. The team also followed the principle of launching early and often\u2014putting a real product into the hands of real customers as fast as possible.\nBut there\u2019s more to the lean start-up approach than those practices. Before entrepreneurs begin to build a product, lean start-up guru Steve Blank insists, they must complete a phase called \u201ccustomer discovery\u201d\u2014a round of interviews with prospective customers. (See \u201cWhy the Lean Start-up Changes Everything,\u201d HBR, May 2013.) Those interviews probe for strong, unmet customer needs\u2014problems worth pursuing. In Nagaraj\u2019s postmortem analysis of Triangulate\u2019s failure, he acknowledged skipping this crucial step. He and his team failed to conduct up-front research to validate the demand for a matching engine or the appeal of the wingman concept. Nor did they conduct MVP tests akin to Quincy\u2019s trunk shows. Instead they rushed to launch Wings as a fully functional product.\nBy giving short shrift to customer discovery and MVPs, Triangulate\u2019s team fell victim to a false start\u2014and turned the \u201cfail fast\u201d mantra into a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the team members had spoken to customers at the outset or tested a true MVP, they could have designed their first product in ways that conformed more closely to market needs. By failing with their first product, they wasted a feedback cycle, and time is an early-stage entrepreneur\u2019s most precious resource. With the clock ticking, one wasted cycle means one less opportunity to pivot before money runs out.\nWhy do founders like Nagaraj skip up-front customer research? Entrepreneurs have a bias for action; they\u2019re eager to get started. And engineers love to build things. So entrepreneurs who are engineers\u2014like Nagaraj and his teammates\u2014often jump into creating the first version of their product as fast as they can. Furthermore, at the risk of stereotyping, I\u2019d offer that many engineers are simply too introverted to follow Blank\u2019s advice and get out of the building to learn from prospective customers.\nFounders without technical training also fall victim to false starts. They hear repeatedly that having a great product is crucial, so they bring engineers on board as soon as they can. Then, feeling pressure to keep those expensive engineers busy, they rush their product into development.\nThe good news is that false starts can easily be avoided by following a structured, three-step product design process.\n1. Problem definition.\nBefore commencing engineering work, entrepreneurs should conduct rigorous interviews with potential customers\u2014at which they resist the temptation to pitch their solutions. Feedback on possible solutions will come later; instead the focus should be on defining customers\u2019 problems. Also, it\u2019s important to interview both likely early adopters and \u201cmainstream\u201d prospects who may be inclined to purchase later. Success will hinge on attracting both groups, whose needs may differ. If their needs do vary, entrepreneurs will have to take the differences into account when formulating a product road map.\nIn addition, entrepreneurs should conduct a competitive analysis, including user testing of existing solutions, to understand the strengths and shortcomings of rival products. Likewise, surveys can help start-up teams measure customer behaviors and attitudes\u2014helpful data when segmenting and sizing the potential market.\n2. Solution development.\nOnce entrepreneurs have identified priority customer segments and gained a deep understanding of their unmet needs, the team\u2019s next step should be brainstorming a range of solutions. The team should prototype several concepts and get feedback on them through one-on-one sessions with potential customers. Most teams start with crude prototypes, reject some and iterate, and then refine the ones that seem promising, gradually producing \u201chigher fidelity\u201d versions that more closely resemble the future product in functionality and look and feel. Prototype iteration and testing continue until a dominant design emerges.\n3. Solution validation.\nTo evaluate demand for the favored solution, the team then runs a series of MVP tests. Unlike the prototype review sessions during step 2\u2014conducted across the table with a single reviewer\u2014an MVP test puts an actual product in the hands of real customers in a real-world setting to see how they respond. To avoid waste, the best MVPs have the lowest fidelity needed to get reliable input\u2014that is, they provide no more \u201clooks like\u201d polish and \u201cworks like\u201d functionality than are strictly necessary. Early MVP tests may take things further, assessing demand for a planned product through a Kickstarter campaign or by soliciting letters of intent to purchase from business-to-business customers.\nSuccess with the product design process may require a shift in the founders\u2019 mindset. At a venture\u2019s outset many entrepreneurs have a preconceived notion of the customer problems they\u2019ll address and the solutions. They may fervently believe they\u2019re on the right path. But during the product design process, they should avoid being too emotionally attached to a specific problem-solution pairing. Entrepreneurs should stay open to the possibility that the process will uncover more-pressing problems or better solutions.\nMaintaining Balance\nOf course, there is no way for founders to know which deadly trap they may face as they launch. Familiarizing oneself with these two dominant failure patterns can help. But so too can understanding why they afflict start-ups so frequently.\nPart of the answer is that the behaviors that conventional wisdom holds make a great entrepreneur can paradoxically increase the risk of encountering these failure patterns. It\u2019s important for an entrepreneur to maintain balance. Guidance based on conventional wisdom is good\u2014most of the time\u2014but it shouldn\u2019t be followed blindly. Consider the following advice given to many first-time founders and how it can backfire:\nJust do it!\nGreat entrepreneurs make things happen and move fast to capture opportunity. But a bias for action can tempt an entrepreneur to truncate exploration and leap too soon into building and selling a product, as I\u2019ve explained. When that happens, founders may find themselves locked prematurely into a flawed solution.\nBe persistent!\nEntrepreneurs encounter setbacks over and over. True entrepreneurs dust themselves off and go back at it; they must be determined and resilient. However, if persistence turns into stubbornness, founders may have difficulty recognizing a false start for what it is. They likewise may be reluctant to pivot when it should be clear that their solution isn\u2019t working. Delaying a pivot eats up scarce capital, shortening a venture\u2019s runway.\nBring passion!\nA burning desire to have a world-changing impact can power entrepreneurs through the most daunting challenges. It can also attract employees, investors, and partners who\u2019ll help make their dreams a reality. But in the extreme, passion can translate into overconfidence\u2014and a penchant to skip critical up-front research. Likewise, passion can blind entrepreneurs to the fact that their product isn\u2019t meeting customer needs.\nBootstrap!\nBecause resources are limited, entrepreneurs must conserve them by being frugal and figuring out clever ways to make do with less. True enough, but if a start-up cannot consistently deliver on its value proposition because its team lacks crucial skills, its founders must decide whether to hire employees with those skills. If those candidates demand high compensation, a scrappy, frugal founder might say, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to do without them\u201d\u2014and risk being stuck with bad bedfellows.\nGrow!\nRapid growth attracts investors and talent and gives a team a great morale boost. This may tempt founders to curtail customer research and prematurely launch their product. Also, fast growth can put heavy demands on team members and partners. If a team has bad bedfellows, growth may exacerbate quality problems and depress profit margins.\n. . .\nIt\u2019s fashionable in start-up circles to speak glibly about failure as a badge of honor or a rite of passage\u2014just another phase of an entrepreneur\u2019s journey. Perhaps doing so is a coping mechanism, or perhaps failure\u2019s ubiquity inures those in the business world to its true human and economic costs. I\u2019ve counseled dozens of entrepreneurs as they shut down their ventures. Raw emotions are always on display: anger, guilt, sadness, shame, and resentment. In some cases the founders were in denial; others just seemed depressed. Who could blame them, after having had their dreams dashed and their self-confidence shattered? In my work I try to help people come to terms with failure, but I can tell you that at ground zero, there\u2019s no way to avoid the fact that it hurts. It also can destroy relationships. When they founded Quincy Apparel, Nelson and Wallace vowed not to let conflict over the business threaten their close friendship. But after clashing over how to wind the company down, they weren\u2019t on speaking terms for two years. (Their relationship has since been repaired.)\nFailure also takes a toll on the economy and society. A doomed venture ties up resources that could be put to better use. And it acts as a deterrent to would-be entrepreneurs who are more risk-averse, have financial obligations that make it hard to forgo a paycheck, or face barriers when raising capital\u2014which is to say, many women and minorities. To be sure, failure will (and should) always be a reality for many entrepreneurs. Doing something new with limited resources is inherently risky. But by recognizing that many failures are avoidable and follow the same trajectory, we can reduce their number and frequency. The payoff will be a more productive, more diverse, and less bruising entrepreneurial economy.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was adapted from the book Why Startups Fail: A New Roadmap for Entrepreneurial Success, by Tom Eisenmann (Currency, 2021).\nA version of this article appeared in the May\u2013June 2021 issue of Harvard Business Review.\nTom Eisenmann is the Howard H.

Here are some common symptoms:\nThere is not a compelling enough value proposition, or compelling event, to cause the buyer to actually commit to purchasing. Good sales reps will tell you that to get an order in today\u2019s tough conditions, you have to find buyers that have their \u201chair on fire\u201d, or are \u201cin extreme pain\u201d. \u00a0 You also hear people talking about whether a product is a Vitamin (nice to have), or an Aspirin (must have).\nThe market timing is wrong. You could be ahead of your market by a few years, and they are not ready for your particular solution at this stage. For example when EqualLogic first launched their product, iSCSI was still very early, and it needed the arrival of VMWare which required a storage area network to do VMotion to really kick their market into gear. Fortunately they had the funding to last through the early years.\nThe market size of people that have pain, and have funds is simply not large enough\nReason 2: Business Model Failure\nAs outlined in the introduction to Business Models section, after spending time with hundreds of startups, I realized that one of the most common causes of failure in the startup world is that entrepreneurs are too optimistic about how easy it will be to acquire customers. They assume that because they will build an interesting web site, product, or service, that customers will beat a path to their door. That may happen with the first few customers, but after that, it rapidly becomes an expensive task to attract and win customers, and in many cases the cost of acquiring the customer (CAC) is actually higher than the lifetime value of that customer (LTV).\nThe observation that you have to be able to acquire your customers for less money than they will generate in value of the lifetime of your relationship with them is stunningly obvious. Yet despite that, I see the vast majority of entrepreneurs failing to pay adequate attention to figuring out a realistic cost of customer acquisition. A very large number of the business plans that I see as a venture capitalist have no thought given to this critical number, and as I work through the topic with the entrepreneur, they often begin to realize that their business model may not work because CAC will be greater than LTV.\nThe Essence of a Business Model\nAs outlined in the Business Models introduction, a simple way to focus on what matters in your business model is look at these two questions:\nCan you find a scalable way to acquire customers\nCan you then monetize those customers at a significantly higher level than your cost of acquisition\nThinking about things in such simple terms can be very helpful. I have also developed two \u201crules\u201d around the business model, which are less hard and fast \u201crules, but more guidelines. These are outlined below:\nThe CAC / LTV \u201cRule\u201d\nThe rule is extremely simple:\nCAC must be less than LTV\nCAC = Cost of Acquiring a Customer\nLTV = Lifetime Value of a Customer\nTo compute CAC, you should take the entire cost of your sales and marketing functions, (including salaries, marketing programs, lead generation, travel, etc.) and divide it by the number of customers that you closed during that period of time. So for example, if your total sales and marketing spend in Q1 was $1m, and you closed 1000 customers, then your average cost to acquire a customer (CAC) is $1,000.\nTo compute LTV, you will want to look at the gross margin associated with the customer (net of all installation, support, and operational expenses) over their lifetime. For businesses with one time fees, this is pretty simple. For businesses that have recurring subscription revenue, this is computed by taking the monthly recurring revenue, and dividing that by the monthly churn rate.\nBecause most businesses have a series of other functions such as G&A, and Product Development that are additional expenses beyond sales and marketing, and delivering the product, for a profitable business, you will want CAC to be less than LTV by some significant multiple. For SaaS businesses, it seems that to break even, that multiple is around three, and that to be really profitable and generate the cash needed to grow, the number may need to be closer to five. But here I am interested in getting feedback from the community on their experiences to test these numbers.\nThe Capital Efficiency \u201cRule\u201d\nIf you would like to have a capital efficient business, I believe it is also important to recover the cost of acquiring your customers in under 12 months. Wireless carriers and banks break this rule, but they have the luxury of access to cheap capital. So stated simply, the \u201crule\u201d is:\nRecover CAC in less than 12 months\nReason 3: Poor Management Team\nAn incredibly common problem that causes startups to fail is a weak management team. A good management team will be smart enough to avoid Reasons 2, 4, and 5.\u00a0 Weak management teams make mistakes in multiple areas:\nThey are often weak on strategy, building a product that no-one wants to buy as they failed to do enough work to validate the ideas before and during development. This can carry through to poorly thought through go-to-market strategies.\nThey are usually poor at execution, which leads to issues with the product not getting built correctly or on time, and the go-to market execution will be poorly implemented.\nThey will build weak teams below them. There is the well proven saying: A players hire A players, and B players only get to hire C players (because B players don\u2019t want to work for other B players). So the rest of the company will end up as weak, and poor execution will be rampant.\netc.\nReason 4: Running out of Cash\nA fourth\u00a0major reason that startups fail is because they ran out of cash. A key job of the CEO is to understand how much cash is left and whether that will carry the company to a milestone that can lead to a successful financing, or to cash flow positive.\nMilestones for Raising Cash\nThe valuations of a startup don\u2019t change in a linear fashion over time. Simply because it was twelve months since you raised your Series A round, does not mean that you are now worth more money. To reach an increase in valuation, a company must achieve certain key milestones. For a software company, these might look something like the following (these are not hard and fast rules):\nProgress from Seed round valuation: goal is to remove some major element of risk. That could be hiring a key team member, proving that some technical obstacle can be overcome, or building a prototype and getting some customer reaction.\nProduct in Beta test, and have customer validation. Note that if the product is finished, but there is not yet any customer validation, valuation will not likely increase much. The customer validation part is far more important.\nProduct is shipping, and some early customers have paid for it, and are using it in production, and reporting positive feedback.\nProduct/Market fit issues that are normal with a first release (some features are missing that prove to be required in most sales situations, etc.) have been mostly eliminated. There are early indications of the business starting to ramp.\nBusiness model is proven. It is now known how to acquire customers, and it has been proven that this process can be scaled. The cost of acquiring customers is acceptably low, and it is clear that the business can be profitable, as monetization from each customer exceeds this cost.\nBusiness has scaled well, but needs additional funding to further accelerate expansion. This capital might be to expand internationally, or to accelerate expansion in a land grab market situation, or could be to fund working capital needs as the business grows.\nWhat goes wrong\nWhat frequently goes wrong, and leads to a company running out of cash, and unable to raise more, is that management failed to achieve the next milestone before cash ran out. Many times it is still possible to raise cash, but the valuation will be significantly lower.\nWhen to hit Accelerator Pedal\nOne of a CEO\u2019s most important jobs is knowing how to regulate the accelerator pedal. In the early stages of a business, while the product is being developed, and the business model refined, the pedal needs to be set very lightly to conserve cash. There is no point hiring lots of sales and marketing people if the company is still in the process of finishing the product to the point where it really meets the market need. This is a really common mistake, and will just result in a fast burn, and lots of frustration.\nHowever, on the flip side of this coin, there comes a time when it finally becomes apparent that the business model has been proven, and that is the time when the accelerator pedal should be pressed down hard. As hard as the capital resources available to the company permit. By \u201cbusiness model has been proven\u201d, I mean that the data is available that conclusively shows the cost to acquire a customer, (and that this cost can be maintained as you scale), and that you are able to monetize those customers at a rate which is significantly higher than CAC (as a rough starting point, three times higher). And that CAC can be recovered in under 12 months.\nFor first time CEOs, knowing how to react when they reach this point can be tough. Up until now they have maniacally guarded every penny of the company\u2019s cash, and held back spending. Suddenly they need to throw a switch, and start investing aggressively ahead of revenue. This may involve hiring multiple sales people per month, or spending considerable sums on SEM. That switch can be very counterintuitive.\nReason 5: Product Problems\nAnother reason that companies fail is because they fail to develop a product that meets the market need. This can either be due to simple execution. Or it can be a far more strategic problem, which is a failure to achieve Product/Market fit.\nMost of the time the first product that a startup brings to market won\u2019t meet the market need. In the best cases, it will take a few revisions to get the product/market fit right. In the worst cases, the product will be way off base, and a complete re-think is required. If this happens it is a clear indication of a team that didn\u2019t do the work to get out and validate their ideas with customers before, and during, development."}, {"Url": "https://forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2019/05/01/why-start-ups-fail", "CluewebURLHash": "474A9F63C96A37EC605A2F47E4000353", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000Why Startups Fail\ue001 - Forbes", "Snippet": "Oftentimes\ue000 the lack of integration and alignment between these two\ue001 groups of people is why startups fail.

But startup failures are far more common. CB Insights found that 70% of upstart tech companies fail. And consumer hardware startups fail even more frequently, with 97% ultimately dying or becoming \u201czombies.\u201d The CB Insight analysts wanted to understand why so many startups fail, so they dug into the \u201cpost-mortems\u201d written by founders, investors, and journalists of nearly 300 startup failures. Here\u2019s what they found:\nThe number one reason why start-ups fail was \u201cno market need.\u201d\nGetty\nNine of the top 20 reasons for startup failures \u2013 and five out of the top 10 \u2013 were related to customers \u2013 not meeting customers\u2019 needs, not listening to them or even ignoring them.\nIn fact, the number one reason why start-ups fail was \u201cno market need.\u201d In other words, there was no customer.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the founders of the failed Treehouse Logic, a visual configurator platform company, discovered. They wrote, \u201cStartups fail when they are not solving a market problem...We had great technology, great data on shopping behavior, great reputation as a though leader, great expertise, great advisors, etc, but what we didn\u2019t have was technology or business model that solved a pain point in a scalable way.\u201d\nAnother customer-related challenge that felled startups was product design that didn\u2019t meet customers\u2019 needs. A founder of GameLayers blamed its failure on this. \u201cUltimately I believe PMOG lacked too much core game compulsion to drive enthusiastic mass adoption,\u201d he observed. They needed to \u201cmake something that was easier to have fun with, within the first few moments of interaction\u201d instead of getting caught up in more \u201cabstruse\u201d features.\nIf only the start-up founders had listened to the customers they were trying to serve. The folks at eCrowds, a web content management system company, admitted not prioritizing customer input, saying, \u201cWe spent way too much time building it for ourselves and not getting feedback from prospects \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get tunnel vision.\u201d Similarly, VoterTide founders wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get tricked into thinking your thing is cool. You have to pay attention to your customers and adapt to their needs.\u201d\nNearly the same number of reasons for failure \u2013 seven of the top 20 -- were related to the people and/or culture of the company.\nSometimes failure was the result of not having the right people on board. The founders of Standout Jobs wrote in their post-mortem, \u201c\u2026The founding team couldn\u2019t build an MVP on its own. That was a mistake. If the founding team can\u2019t put out product on its own (or with a small amount of external help from freelancers) they shouldn\u2019t be founding a startup.\u201d\nOther times, the lack of alignment among the founders and/or their investors was to blame. In a lengthy recap of what happened at web development firm ArsDigita, cofounder Philip Greenspun explained several points of misalignment between him, other company leaders, and the company\u2019s VCs, including partnership deals, product new rollout timing and organizational structure.\nThe lack of focus or passion or both doomed other upstarts. The postmortem for MyFavorites observed that, \u201cUltimately when we came back from SXSW, we all started losing interest, the team was all wondering where this was eventually going.\u201d\nOf note, only two of the top 20 reasons that startups failed was due to money, or lack thereof. It\u2019s not surprising, though, if you think about it. Business is fundamentally a human endeavor \u2013 humans trying to connect to other humans. Products, technology, business models, funding \u2013 success in these dimensions are the result of getting people right. So ultimately start up success comes down to people \u2013 the people inside the organization and the people outside it (customers).\nOftentimes the lack of integration and alignment between these two groups of people is why startups fail. The biggest, most tragic failures happen when people inside the company don\u2019t care about customers, or don\u2019t cultivate a culture centered on the customer. Take NewsTilt, a news website for independent professional journalists. It failed less than two months after being funded by Y Combinator because its founders weren\u2019t interested in the domain they had built their company around -- and that led them to produce a product that didn\u2019t meet customers\u2019 needs.\nOne of NewsTilt\u2019s founders confessed, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say we didn\u2019t really care about journalism. We started by building a commenting product which came from my desire for the perfect commenting system for my blog. This turned into designing the best damn commenting system ever, which led to figuring out an ideal customer: newspapers\u2026But we didn\u2019t really care about journalism, and weren\u2019t even avid news readers\u2026And how could we build a product that we were only interested in from a business perspective.\u201d\nLet these findings serve as warnings for aspiring entrepreneurs. People must be your priority and they must be aligned. Your customers and your people drive your business. Ignore them at your own peril.\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

However, we did begin to see a pattern to these stories.\nAnd so after sifting through the post-mortems, we identified the top 12 reasons startups fail.\nSince many startups offered multiple reasons for their failure, you\u2019ll see that the chart highlighting the top reasons doesn\u2019t add up to 100% (it far exceeds it).\nFollowing the chart is an explanation of each reason and relevant examples from the post-mortems.\nthe top 12 reasons startups fail\nFrom lack of product-market fit to disharmony on the team, we break down the top 12 reasons for startup failure by analyzing 110+ startup failure post-mortems.\nEmail*\nThere is certainly no survivorship bias here. But many very relevant lessons for anyone in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this type of data-driven analysis would not be possible without a number of founders being courageous enough to share stories of their startup\u2019s demise with the world. So a big thank you to them.\n12. Burned out/lacked passion\nWork-life balance is not something that startup founders often get, so the risk of burning out is high. Burnout was given as a reason for failure 5% of the time. The ability to cut your losses where necessary and redirect your efforts when you see a dead end \u2014 or lack passion for a domain \u2014 was deemed important to succeeding and avoiding burnout, as was having a solid, diverse, and driven team so that responsibilities can be shared.\nWhat can make conversations about burnout difficult, especially in Silicon Valley, is the widespread belief that building a successful company will always involve some degree of possibly hazardous overwork. As former Uber board member and CEO of Thrive Global Arianna Huffington puts it:\n\u201cThe prevalent view of startup founders in Silicon Valley is a delusion that in order to succeed, in order to build a high-growth company, you need to burn out.\u201d\nAmid the pandemic, burnout became even more prevalent among tech workers: 68% of tech employees said they felt more burned out working from home, according to a survey by Blind.\nVarious founders have spoken up about how damaging burnout can be. Former Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad said,\n\u201cI think people are unprepared for how hard and awful it is going to be to start a company. I certainly was.\u201d\nAt DaWanda, stagnation in both growth and team interest led to the company\u2019s eventual closure. Founder and CEO Claudia Helming shared this message on the company\u2019s website:\n\u201cIn the last quarter of 2017 we reached profitability and have since been working to cover our costs. At the same time, we had to admit that our growth is stagnating and that we can hardly manage by our own efforts to grow the number of sales on our platform to the desired extent \u2013 even our restructuring last year could not change this \u2026 Additionally, we haven\u2019t managed to implement enough innovative new ideas over the past few years.\nDaWanda is not insolvent. However, we have realised that the risk of no longer being able to keep up is simply too big.\u201d\nDoughbies, which raised $670,000 for an on-demand cookie delivery service in 2013, also cited a lack of passion from its founders and team as one of the reasons for its failure. The company appeared to be doing well, with 36% gross margins and 12% net profit at the time it shut down. The problem, as CEO Daniel Conway put it, was that there wasn\u2019t massive growth or enough interest in running the business:\n\u201cUltimately we shut down because our team is ready to move on to something new.\u201d\n11. Pivot gone bad\nPivots like Burbn to Instagram or ThePoint to Groupon can go extraordinarily well. Or they can start you down the wrong road.\nAs The Verge reported on Inboard Technology \u2018s failed pivot:\n\u201cThe startup was one of the highest-profile competitors to top electric skateboard company Boosted, and last year announced plans to enter the electric scooter market \u2014 a push that seems to have doomed Inboard.\nFounder (and now-former CEO) Ryan Evans told The Verge his team had locked down \u2018a very large order\u2019 from \u2018one of the largest European scooter operators,\u2019 which explains why the company quickly pivoted away from trying to sell its first e-scooter directly to consumers earlier this year. But Evans said the development timeline for Inboard\u2019s e-scooter \u2018outstretched\u2019 its financial runway.\u201d\nAfter investors refused to inject more funds, the company was forced to shut down.\nFor Frances Dewing, the founder of Rubica, a last-ditch attempt to save her cybersecurity startup from failure amid Covid-19 led her to pivot from focusing on consumers and small businesses to larger companies.\nIn the end, the new direction didn\u2019t ring true with investors:\n\u201cWe were all really surprised given how relevant and needed this is right now,\u201d Dewing said. \u201cInvestors didn\u2019t agree with that or see it in the same way.\u201d\n10. Disharmony among team/investors\nDiscord with a co-founder was a fatal issue for startup post-mortem companies. But acrimony isn\u2019t limited to the founding team, and when things go bad with a board or investor, it can get ugly pretty quickly, as evidenced in the case of Hubba.\nDouglas Soltys writes for BetaKit:\n\u201cConsidered for most of the decade one of Toronto\u2019s hottest startups, Hubba hit choppy waves in 2018, as the company lost its chief technology officer and chief marketing officer in an three-month span, in addition to two rounds of layoffs which saw headcount reduced by almost half.\nIt is unclear to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic had hampered Hubba\u2019s growth and customer base. However, one source BetaKit spoke with claimed a months-long battle between [Hubba CEO and founder Ben] Zifkin and Hubba\u2019s board of directors regarding the ongoing viability of the company.\u201d\nAt Pellion Technologies, the end came more quietly, as its major backer Khosla Ventures lost faith in the company\u2019s ability to execute:\n\u201cAccording to former employees, all of whom requested anonymity, Khosla Ventures lost confidence that Pellion could make enough money serving a niche market. The lithium-metal technology worked for products like drones, but the big money in the battery world is in the automotive sector. Investors weren\u2019t willing to sink the money needed to develop the battery for electric vehicles.\u201d\nIn March 2019, Khosla decided the company would be shut down and removed Pellion\u2019s name from its online firm portfolio.\n9. Poor product\nSometimes, it all comes down to the product \u2014 and a flawed one was enough to sink companies in 8% of cases.\nAccording to a Forbes investigation into finance and accounting platform ScaleFactor,\n\u201cScaleFactor used aggressive sales tactics and prioritized chasing capital instead of building software that ultimately fell far short of what it promised, according to interviews with 15 former employees and executives. When customers fled, executives tried to obscure the real damage.\u201d\nBad things also happen when you ignore what users want and need, whether consciously or accidentally.\nHere\u2019s what Shoes of Prey wrote about its vision to enable consumers to personalize their own shoes :\n\u201cWe learnt the hard way that mass market customers don\u2019t want to create, they want to be inspired and shown what to wear. They want to see the latest trends, what celebrities and Instagram influencers are wearing and they want to wear exactly that \u2014 both the style and the brand.\u201d\nthe top 12 reasons startups fail\nFrom lack of product-market fit to disharmony on the team, we break down the top 12 reasons for startup failure by analyzing 110+ startup failure post-mortems.\nEmail*\n8. Product mistimed\nIf you release your product too early, users may write it off as not good enough, and getting them back may be difficult if their first impression of you is negative. And if you release your product too late, you may have missed your window of opportunity in the market.\nAs Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, CEO of autonomous trucking tech startup Starsky Robotics said,\n\u201cTiming, more than anything else, is what I think is to blame for our unfortunate fate. Our approach, I still believe, was the right one but the space was too overwhelmed with the unmet promise of AI to focus on a practical solution. As those breakthroughs failed to appear, the downpour of investor interest became a drizzle.\u201d\nVR platform Vreal intended to build a virtual reality space for video game streamers to hang out with their viewers and raised almost $12M in its 2018 Series A. However, the available hardware and bandwidth capabilities didn\u2019t evolve as fast as the company had expected, and though it delivered on its promise, Vreal struggled to attract any significant usage:\n\u201cUnfortunately, the VR market never developed as quickly as we all had hoped, and we were definitely ahead of our time. As a result, Vreal is shutting down operations and our wonderful team members are moving on to other opportunities.\u201d\nFor some companies on our list, an unforeseen factor like the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to product untimeliness. AI-powered vending machine startup Stockwell AI shut down in July 2020 as consumers stayed at home and avoided surface contact. The company\u2019s CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch,\n\u201cRegretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st. We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible. While this wasn\u2019t the way we wanted to end this journey, we are confident that our vision of bringing the store to where people live, work and play will live on through other amazing companies, products and services.\u201d\n7. Not the right team\nA diverse team with different skill sets was often cited as being critical to the success of a company. Failure post-mortems often lamented that \u201cI wish we had a CTO from the start\u201d or wished that the startup had \u201ca founder that loved the business aspect of things.\u201d\nAt Fieldbook, which shut down after failing to build a sustainable business model for its database product, co-founder Jason Crawford wrote in his post-mortem blog post that the company\u2019s inability to make key hires was one of the reasons for its downfall:\n\u201cI was blindsided by the difficulty of hiring. Hiring was something I\u2019d done successfully for years, including in the early days of Fieldbook and in a previous startup. But at a time when every engineer wanted to work on AI, self-driving cars or cryptocurrencies, a SaaS startup with modest, sporadic growth wasn\u2019t very attractive. I knew that investors would need to see strong, consistent growth before our Series A, but I didn\u2019t expect that engineers would need to see it to even join before Series A.\u201d\nLack of experience, combined with mismanagement, was one of the factors behind the downfall of Katerra, the high-flying construction startup which raised nearly $1.5B in funding. As The Information summarizes,\n\u201cThe SoftBank-backed startup said it could slash the cost of building and renovating apartments, luring big-name investors. But the company, run by a tech veteran with no previous construction experience, ignored escalating problems and at one point tried to burnish revenue information shown to its board and financial backers.\u201d\nFor Stratolaunch, the passing of its founder meant the company wasn\u2019t able to continue on in the same way, as Failory reported:\n\u201cDespite everything looking great on paper and the best of minds working together on this project, nothing could have predicted Paul Allen\u2019s passing away in October of 2018, which would soon spell out the same fate for Stratolaunch. It became clear that Stratolaunch had been powered only by the vision of its founder, which wasn\u2019t necessarily shared by those left in power after him .\u201d\n6. Pricing/cost issues\nPricing is a dark art when it comes to startup success, and startup post-mortems highlight the difficulty in pricing a product high enough to eventually cover costs but low enough to bring in customers.\nHey Tiger struggled to find the right balance in its effort to produce high-quality chocolate and address inequities in the cocoa industry, writing,\n\u201cBut like any start up, there comes a time when you need to take a hard look at the company\u2019s long term viability. Although we designed a business that customers absolutely love, it proved hard to scale into the profitability it needed to be a sustainable social enterprise. As the scale of our chocolate production grew, so did the tensions between the very things that made Hey Tiger special. Ultimately while succeeding in one goal, we couldn\u2019t make the other.\u201d\nThe 2019 shutdown of genetic testing and scientific wellness startup Arivale came as a surprise to many partners and customers, but the reason behind the company\u2019s failure was simple: the price of running the company was too high compared to the revenues it brought in:\n\u201cOur decision to terminate the program today comes despite the fact that customer engagement and satisfaction with the program is high and the clinical health markers of many customers have improved significantly. Our decision to cease operations is attributable to the simple fact that the cost of providing the program exceeds what our customers can pay for it. We believe the costs of collecting the genetic, blood and microbiome assays that form the foundation of the program will eventually decline to a point where the program can be delivered to consumers cost-effectively. Regrettably, we are unable to continue to operate at a loss until that time arrives\u2026\u201d\n5. Regulatory/legal challenges\nSometimes a startup can evolve from a simple idea and enter a world of legal complexities that can ultimately shut it down.\nWidely regarded as one of Kickstarter\u2019s greatest failures, Coolest Cooler finally ceased operations in December 2019 after floundering for 5 years (and failing to deliver its coolers to more than 20,000 people). In a project update, the team blamed the trade war:\n\u201cAs you may know, late last year the U.S. government imposed 10% tariffs on many products imported from China. \u2026 However, as of early summer, the \u201ctrade war\u201d continued, and the tariff was increased to 25% which affected our entire Coolest product line.\u201d\nMobile savings app Beam met its end quickly after falling afoul of the Federal Trade Commission. FTC Acting Director of Consumer Protection Daniel Kaufman stated at the time of its shut down of the company:\n\u201cThe message here is simple for mobile banking apps and similar services: Don\u2019t lie about your customers\u2019 ability to get their money when they need it.\u201d\nSmart luggage manufacturer Bluesmart also fell victim to legal challenges. The company shut down in 2018 after most major US airlines enacted a policy requiring all airline travelers to remove lithium-ion batteries from their checked luggage:\n\u201cWe have bittersweet news to share. The changes in policies announced by several major airlines at the end of last year\u2014the banning of smart luggage with non-removable batteries\u2014put our company in an irreversibly difficult financial and business situation. After exploring all the possible options for pivoting and moving forward, the company was finally forced to wind down its operations and explore disposition options, unable to continue operating as an independent entity.\u201d\n4. Flawed business model\nMost failed founders agree that a business model is important \u2014 staying wedded to a single channel or failing to find ways to make money at scale left investors hesitant and founders unable to capitalize on any traction gained.\nAs Lumina Networks, a provider of open-source software for telecom networks, wrote,\n\u201cEssentially, revenue continued to flow to proprietary vendors. The switch to open source did not take place at a pace anywhere close to the speed that would enable us to operate and grow our business, despite commitments from many to the contrary. We have also found that Covid-19 has actually redirected funds away from automation projects and into building-out raw infrastructure, further delaying adoption.\u201d\n\u201cSelling Lumina to a proprietary vendor who is naturally antithetical to our mission proved an impossible task and for this reason we must now close our business,\u201d it concluded.\nAt Aria Insights, the concept of outfitting drones with sensors to collect data from extreme environments seemed promising. But while the company got off the ground and found a few high-profile investors \u2014 including Bessemer Venture Partners \u2014 it ultimately couldn\u2019t find a compelling use for that data, and, therefore, couldn\u2019t adequately monetize its business model:\n\u201cCyPhy Works rebranded as Aria Insights in January 2019 to focus more on using artificial intelligence and machine learning to help analyze data collected by drones. \u2018A number of our partners were collecting and housing massive amounts of information with our drones, but there was no service in the industry to quickly and efficiently turn that data into actionable insights,\u2019 Lance Vanden Brook, former CyPhy and current Aria CEO said at the time of the rebranding.\u201d\nVarious music startup post-mortems also pointed to the difficulty of finding a viable business model in the industry as a reason for startup failure.\nUK-based blockchain music startup JAAK pointed to several reasons for its undoing, including its scaling challenges, in a series of Tweets on the company\u2019s corporate account:\n\u201c6 years is a long time in startups, especially pre-revenue ones, and, ultimately, we failed to secure the funding required to get to market. Markets change and we didn\u2019t change quickly enough.\nI have a Notion full of painful lessons about why we failed but I\u2019ll save those for another day.\ntl;dr: users > partners, no premature scaling.\u201d\nthe top 12 reasons startups fail\nFrom lack of product-market fit to disharmony on the team, we break down the top 12 reasons for startup failure by analyzing 110+ startup failure post-mortems.\nEmail*\n3. Got outcompeted\nDespite the platitudes that startups shouldn\u2019t pay attention to the competition, the reality is that once an idea gets hot or gets market validation, others may try to capitalize on the opportunity. And while obsessing over the competition is not healthy, ignoring it was also a recipe for failure in 20% of the startup failures.\nSilas Adekunle of Reach Robotics talked about shutting down after being unable to make it in the hypercompetitive consumer hardware industry in his post-mortem message,\u00a0stating:\n\u201cThe consumer robotics sector is an inherently challenging space \u2013 especially for a start-up. Over the past six years, we have taken on this challenge with consistent passion and ingenuity. From the first trials of development to accelerators and funding rounds, we have fought to bring MekaMon to life and into the hands of the next generation of tech pioneers. Unfortunately, for Reach Robotics, in its current form at least, today marks the end of that journey.\u201d\nCo-founder John Rees also weighed in:\n\u201cI\u2019m still taking stock of it all but the short version is that it is true what they say \u2013 that \u2018hardware is hard\u2019 and consumer hardware is even harder due to the reliance on the Christmas sales period.\u201d\nChildren\u2019s apparel delivery service Mac & Mia found itself in a tough spot, facing competition from highly successful companies like Stitch Fix, and shut down only a year after its 2018 launch:\n\u201cMac & Mia faced a host of competitors in the children\u2019s delivery box space, including the aforementioned Stitch Fix, which launched its kids clothing service in 2018. Stitch Fix went public in 2017 and has a market cap around $2.7 billion. At least 20 other upstarts have launched similar delivery services for children\u2019s clothes.\u201d\n2. No market need\nTackling problems that are interesting to solve rather than those that serve a market need was cited as the No. 2 reason for failure, noted in 35% of cases.\nMobile-focused streaming service Quibi, which shut down in October 2020 just 6 months after launching and raising a mammoth $1.8B, found itself in this position. As reported in the Wall Street Journal, founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and chief executive Meg Whitman said in a letter to employees at the time of the shutdown:\n\u201c\u2026[T]here were \u2018one or two reasons\u2019 for Quibi\u2019s failure: The idea behind Quibi either \u2018wasn\u2019t strong enough to justify a stand-alone streaming service\u2019 or the service\u2019s launch in the middle of a pandemic was particularly ill-timed. \u2018Unfortunately, we will never know, but we suspect it\u2019s been a combination of the two.'\u201d\nCEO Justin Kan of Atrium was direct about the difficulty of disrupting law firms, telling TechCrunch in an interview,\n\u201cIf you look at our original business model with the verticalized law firm, a lot of these companies that have this kind of full stack model are not going to survive,\u201d Kan explained. \u201cA lot of these companies, Atrium included, did not figure out how to make a dent in operational efficiency.\u201d\nFor a company like wedding dress retailer Brideside, Covid-19 obviated the need for its offerings:\n\u201cWith two-thirds of weddings cancelled in 2020 and an uncertain year ahead, our chapter has come to an end.\u201d\nA month after Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell, and Robert Morris started the Y Combinator seed accelerator in 2005, they picked \u201cmake something people want\u201d as their motto.\nOur study shows that failing to do this is one of the easiest ways to guarantee startup failure.\n1. Ran out of cash/failed to raise new capital\nMoney and time are finite and need to be allocated judiciously. For the startups on our list, running out of cash \u2014 tied with the inability to secure financing/investor interest \u2014 was the top reason startups cited for their failure.\nIn September 2019, augmented reality startup Daqri shut down after burning through more than $250M in funding and failing to raise a new round from investors:\n\u201cDaqri faced substantial challenges from competing headset makers, including Magic Leap and Microsoft, which were backed by more expansive war chests and institutional partnerships. While the headset company struggled to compete for enterprise customers, Daqri benefited from investor excitement surrounding the broader space. That is, until the investment climate for AR startups cooled.\u201d\nDespite fostering partnerships with Boeing, General Electric, and NetJets, aeronautical engineering startup Aerion Corporation was unable to convince investors of its potential:\n\u201cThe AS2 supersonic business jet program meets all market, technical, regulatory and sustainability requirements, and the market for a new supersonic segment of general aviation has been validated with $11.2 billion in sales backlog for the AS2.\nHowever, in the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements to finalize the transition of the AS2 into production.\nGiven these conditions, the Aerion Corporation is now taking the appropriate steps in consideration of this ongoing financial environment.\u201d\nEuropean budget airline Wow Air met a similar fate; Chairman Skuli Mogensen wrote to employees:\n\u201cWe have run out of time and have unfortunately not been able to secure funding for the company\u2026 I will never be able to forgive myself for not taking action sooner.\u201d\nIf you aren\u2019t already a client, sign up for a free trial to learn more about our platform."}, {"Url": "https://startups.com/library/expert-advice/why-do-startups-fail", "CluewebURLHash": "26DD195D3601A5269AD266BC91C0BACA", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000The 13 Top Reasons Why Startups Fail\ue001 | \ue000Startups\ue001.com", "Snippet": "The biggest reasons why startups fail is\ue000 they create a product that the market just doesn\u2019t want.\ue001 Product/market fit is essential .

To help you avoid that fate, here are the top reasons why startups\u00a0fail.\nDecember 14th, 2017 | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By: Emma McGowan\nFail fast. Fail forward. Those are just two of the mantras you\u2019ll see hanging in startup offices and incubators across the globe. In the startup world, a failure is considered a learning opportunity, at the least; a feather in the cap of the Founder, at best. We fetishize failure. We normalize it.\nBut as much as we talk a good game about failure, the reality is that failing sucks. Just as no one goes into their wedding day planning for divorce, no one starts a company thinking, \u201cYeah, this one will just be my starter. I\u2019ll get it right next time.\u201d No wants to fail, and yet the majority of startups do fail.\nAccording to an examination of startup businesses (by which they mean new companies in general) in the United States conducted by Statistic Brain, almost all new companies fail: 50 percent after five years and 70 percent after 10 years. Their data found that 46 percent of all companies in the US fail due to \u201cincompetence.\u201d That category includes everything from \u201cemotional pricing\u201d to \u201cno experience in record-keeping\u201d to \u201cnonpayment of taxes.\u201d The next 30 percent failed due to \u201cunbalanced experience or lack of managerial experience\u201d, followed by 11 percent failing due to \u201clack of experiences in line of goods or services.\u201d\nBut while the failure rate for new companies in general is high, they\u2019re nowhere near the failure rates of startups. A commonly cited number is \u201c90 percent of all startups fail,\u201d but one study by Harvard Business School senior lecturer Shikhar Ghosh found that the number might be closer to 75 percent. The \u201creal\u201d number is probably somewhere in between the two.\nRegardless, it\u2019s very high. So why is that?\nWhy do startups fail?\nWhile we can all share anecdotes about why startups we know failed, let\u2019s take a look at the one actual study examining why startups fail. CB Insights analyzed 101 startup \u201cpostmortems\u201d \u2014 you know, those Medium posts Founders do when their company goes under \u2014 to determine what the most common causes of startup failure were.\nAccording to their findings, here are the top 13 reasons why startups fail, along with some stories from the Startups.co community that we hope will help other Founders who are trying to make it into that 20 (or so) percent that succeed.\n1. No Market Need (42%)\nThe biggest reasons why startups fail is they create a product that the market just doesn\u2019t want. Product/market fit is essential. Maybe they\u2019ve figured out a solution to their own problem and didn\u2019t take into account that other people didn\u2019t have the problem, too. Maybe there were already better products out there. Or maybe the market just wasn\u2019t ready for it. Or, maybe, the world just didn\u2019t need what they were putting out there.\n\u201cIn 2009 I spend $63,000, hired six part-time employees and spent nine months on a product,\u201d Jevin Maltais, of the Built In A Day podcast, tells Startups.co. \u201cThen I launched\u2026 To no one. \u00a0The idea was to show everything happening on a map within three street blocks from you: all events, pictures and tweets. Turns out, no one cared enough about the problem I was trying to solve, and there was no path for it to make money. Lesson learned: Talk to people before you build anything!\u201d\n2. Ran Out of Cash (29%)\nAnother big issue? Running out of money before you can get anywhere. Even the lucky companies that land funding can find themselves staring down a very short runway, debating whether or not they\u2019ll be able to afford the rent on their coworking space next month.\n\u201cAt age 27, I started a business using money in my savings account,\u201d Lyneir Richardson CEO of Chicago TREND and Executive Director of the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development at Rutgers University Business School, tells Startups.co.\n\u201cMy business grew rapidly from $600,000 in revenue to over $7 million. I was recognized by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a Young Entrepreneur of the Year.\n\u201cBut I had three major problems. First, I had a low profit margin on the product that I was selling. \u00a0Second, I had a lot of payroll costs. Third, there was a long lag time between sales and no consistent recurring revenue. I now know that these are classic symptoms of a company with poor cash flow. \u00a0The saying is that \u2018Cash is King,\u2019 but in my view, the saying should be \u2018Cashf Flow is King.\u2019 \u00a0Ultimately, I had to sell the assets of my company at a discount, and I went out of business.\u201d\n3. Not the Right Team (23%)\nThe clich\u00e9 in startup land is that a startup is like baby \u2014 and your Co-Founder is your spouse. And, like a lot of clich\u00e9s, there\u2019s a lot of truth in it. Your team can make-or-break your startup, as 23 percent of failed startups know all too well.\n\u201cI once tried to get a startup going,\u201d Stephen Gibson, Founder of the startup review site Vyteo, tells Startups.co. \u201cI joined with a partner and we began working on new projects. Every couple weeks or so he wanted to work on a new project, leaving the previous one behind. Over a short span of time we had three to four projects in the works. We obviously didn\u2019t get anywhere and eventually went our separate ways. Having the right team and partner-fit is essential to getting things off the ground.\u201d\n4. Get Outcompeted (19%)\nWhether it\u2019s one of the big companies doing exactly what you do or smaller companies killing you with a thousand little bites, getting outcompeted is the reason why 19 percent of startups fail. (And regardless of who\u2019s doing the outcompeting, it sucks.)\n\u201cMy Sportswear brand, VO2 Sportswear, failed due to a combination of running out of cash and cheap entrants into the market,\u201d Matt Tomkin of Tao Digital Marketing tells Startups.co. \u201cWe had grown to the point where we had built significant, to a startup, overheads which needed to be paid every month. We ended up having to try and compete with a flood of back-bedroom businesses that seemed to be happy to make pennies rather than pounds on the kit they were supplying. We just couldn\u2019t compete with this type of approach.\u201d\n5. Pricing/Cost Issues (18%)\nThe best way to figure out how to price your product is to put a price on it and see what happens. Do you get a huge number of signups, suggesting that maybe you could raise the price? Does no one bite, suggesting you need to lower the price? Can you meet your company\u2019s costs while simultaneously meeting that sweet spot of not too expensive and not too cheap?\nUnfortunately, one reason why startups fail is because they can\u2019t. It\u2019s a balancing act \u2014 and tipping to either side can mean failure for your company.\n6. Poor Product (17%)\nSometimes, startup Founders just come up short when it comes to product. That could be because they don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re doing. It could also be because they didn\u2019t understand their field properly before jumping in, as was the case for Jenni Schwanenberg, Innovation Evangelist of mantro GmbH, in her previous company.\n\u201cWe wanted to create a hardware device that measures your consumption to give you a better price option,\u201d Jenni says. \u201cBut doing the unit economics, we found out: There is a totally different dynamic in the market. Users can save 100 Euro for one time \u2014 and then nothing anymore. So we would create a product that had no recurring revenue and was basically useless to us.\nWe already worked on a hardware device and customer interviews for about three month when we found out and we put a full stop on the project.\u201d\n7. Need/Lack Business Model (17%)\nBusiness models aren\u2019t sexy. They aren\u2019t fun. But they are very, very necessary for the success of a startup. Unfortunately, 17 percent of startups failed because they didn\u2019t learn this lesson soon enough.\n\u201cCreate a business plan first so that you can stay focused and remain true to your long-term goals,\u201d Deborah Sweeney, CEO of MyCorporation.com, tells Startups.co. \u201cBusiness plans are typically 30 to 40 pages long, requiring time to draft up and objectively view the feasibility of your business. They cover everything from what your business does/offers to a (projected) timeline for your goals along with an analysis on your target audience and examination of your cash flow. Once you have the plan in place, you can really get the ball rolling on the business.\u201d\n8. Poor Marketing (14%)\nNo matter how great your product is, it\u2019s going to fail if no one knows about it. Poor marketing is a major reason a lot of startups fail and one that I personally get a lot of questions about. While you don\u2019t necessarily need a professional PR team at the beginning, learn from the failed startup pile and don\u2019t ignore marketing. (Yes, even when you\u2019re bootstrapping.)\n\u201cWe ignored marketing,\u201d AR/VR Expert Antony Vitillo tells Startups.co. \u201cAt the beginning, we just wrote code, but over time we discovered that marketing is as important as the product. If you don\u2019t market properly, no one knows about your product and so no one can buy it, even if it is the best product in the world. Spreading the word may seem a waste of time, but it is fundamental for a business to survive.\u201d\n9. Ignore Customers (14%)\nI can\u2019t emphasize enough how important user feedback is to the startup journey, from the first germ of an idea through product develop and testing. I\u2019m a firm believer in launching early with a minimum viable product and testing, testing, testing. When we\u2019re talking about why startups fail, I\u2019m actually surprised that this number isn\u2019t higher than 14 percent.\n\u201cMy three Co-Founders and I had developed an app for restaurants that allowed their customers to order and pay for their food independently of a waiter\u2014by using the app,\u201d Felicia Schneiderhan, Founder of 30 Seconds to Fly, tells Startups.co. \u201cWe had won a major competition in New York and got accepted to the reputable NYU Summer Launchpad accelerator. After six months of working day and night trying to find customers, however, we decided to shut down the company.\nThere were multiple reasons why our concept didn\u2019t work. The most important one was that we missed product market fit. Our target market were small independent restaurants in New York City. These restaurants had many pain points, from inventory management to diminishing margins. They did not, however, even consider the option of saving personnel cost by replacing their waiters with technology. Let alone were they willing to pay for a technology like that. After we had talked to more than 200 small restaurant owners and managers we understood that the human touch and personal connection they had with their customers was one of their core value propositions. Our product clearly did not match that market segment.\u201d\n10. Product Mistimed (13%)\nSome startups launch before their time and either the market or the technology just isn\u2019t there yet. Others launch too late, although they might not know yet that it\u2019s too late. That\u2019s what happened to Bob Smith, Founder of Drive & Grow Rich, a monthly CD subscription service, in 2007. At age 33, Smith was pulling in $10 million a year.\nCan you guess where this is going?\nYou got it: Technology killed the monthly CD subscription star.\n11. Lose Focus (13%)\nBuilding a company takes time, effort, money and \u2014 focus. If you\u2019re the type to get easily distracted or you have trouble finishing what you started, your startup might end up with the 13 percent who fell under this category of why startups fail.\n\u201cTen years ago, my partner Hern\u00e1n Amiune and I started with our first startup, the first online peer to peer credit platform in Latin America,\u201d Cristian Rennella, CEO and Co-Founder of elMejorTrato.com, tells Startups.co. \u201cThe idea was excellent, the team also (two programmers with a lot of free time) and we even managed to raise USD 120,000 of investment, which at that time was a crazy lot of money! The reason for failure? Lack of focus!\n\u201cUnfortunately the media sells you the dream of overnight success but that is a plain lie. To do something big, you must dedicate a huge amount of time and effort. Remember: if you want to do something great without failing on the road, your best ally is to have focus! Forget the advantage of first movers, focus on who is still standing after the war.\u201d\n12. Disharmony on Team/Investors (13%)\nYou know how it can sometimes be a terrible idea to be roommates with your best friend? It seems like a great plan \u2014 you love each other! You like hanging out! They\u2019re pretty clean! \u2014 but when you actually move in, you end up losing your best friend and having to find a new place to live.\nThat kind of strife can also happen on a startup founding team or between startup Founders and their investors. Either way, it\u2019s a quick recipe for startup failure.\n\u201cDuring the financial crisis in 2008 I had a startup which was focused on raising money for private equity, trading and investment advisory services,\u201d Irina Lunina, CEO and Co-Founder at miramom tells Startups.co. \u201cWe had an amazing first six months and made a company profitable early on, but I did bump heads with my Co-Founder. Everyone has different work ethics, some work hard to make things happen and some just ride the wave. When I realized that I pull all the weight, then I really did not want to split profits with someone who just pretended to work. So, problems started and we split.\u201d\n13. Pivot Gone South (10%)\nPivoting is another natural part of the startup lifespan: You launch a product, do some user testing, find out it\u2019s not the right product/market fit, and you pivot to something else. In some cases, that pivot is what saves the company. But for others, the pivot takes Founders in the direction of one of those other reasons why startups fail listed above.\nThe Final 7 Reasons Startups Fail\nThe CB Insights report actually found 20 reasons why startups fail, but we decided only ones over 10 percent had earned in-depth coverage today. For those of you who are interested, the other seven reasons why startups fail are:\n14. Lack Passion (9%)\n15. Bad Location (9%)\n16. No Financing/Investor Interest (8%)\n17. Legal Challenges (8%)\n18. Don\u2019t Use Network/Advisors (8%)\n19. Burnout (8%)\n20. Failure to Pivot (7%)\nAnd despite all of my talk about fetishizing failure, I\u2019m going to leave you with these wise words from serial entrepreneur Marcus Harjani, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of FameMoose.\n\u201cI have learned over the years that the idea of failure is not only very personal to one\u2019s context, but actually failure doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Marcus says. \u201cEvery perceived failure in business is a chance to better hone one\u2019s approach. Sure, having to close doors on the business is \u2018a failure\u2019 of sorts, but the true failure is if one doesn\u2019t learn why that happened, and runs head first into the same situation again.\u201d\nHere that, Founders? Don\u2019t let fear of failure scare you into never trying. Instead, learn from your mistakes and carry it forward. That\u2019s doing failure the startup way. We here at Startups.co also have a bunch of tools that can help you avoid failure, whether it\u2019s your first startup or your fiftieth.\nYou can engage with each one individually or, if you\u2019re ready to really kick failure\u2019s butt, you can bundle all tools on the Startups.co platform together to take advantage of significant bundle pricing discounts.\nCheck them out:\nStartups.co Master Classes: In-depth business lessons and videos\nBizplan: Industry-leading business planning software\nZirtual: Online virtual assistant services\nClarity: Expert startup mentors available to chat\nLaunchrock: Platform for acquiring early customers\nFundable: Crowdfunding platform\nStartups Live: Bi-weekly Slack chat with other startup Founders\n(And for those of you who are good at math, you\u2019ll notice that these percentages didn\u2019t perfectly add up to 100%. That\u2019s because some startups cited multiple reasons because, you know, this stuff is complicated .)\nAbout the Author\nEmma McGowan\nEmma McGowan is a full time blogger and digital nomad has been writing about startups, living with startup people, and basically breathing startups for the past five years.

That question caught\u00a0Harvard Business School professor Tom Eisenmann by surprise when he realized he couldn\u2019t answer\u00a0it.\nSo he launched a multiyear research project to find out. In Why Startups Fail, Eisenmann reveals his findings: six distinct patterns that account for the vast majority of startup failures.\n\u2022 Bad Bedfellows. Startup success is thought to rest largely on the founder\u2019s talents and instincts. But the wrong team, investors, or partners can sink a venture just as quickly.\n\u2022 False Starts.

Despite the pressure to \u201cget big fast,\u201d hypergrowth can spell disaster for even the most promising ventures.\n\u2022 Help Wanted. Rapidly scaling startups need lots of capital and talent, but they can make mistakes that leave them suddenly in short supply of both.\n\u2022 Cascading Miracles. Silicon Valley exhorts entrepreneurs to dream big.

Rarely is a business so in tune with its niche that it can float along with minimal effort.\u00a0But why do so many businesses fail?\u00a0For that matter, how many of them actually do fail?\u00a0The reasons run deep, but here is what you should know before starting your own business.\nKey Takeaways\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a \"small\" business as one with 500 employees or less. 1\nAs of March 2021, only 80% of startups survived after one year. 2\nAccording to business owners, reasons for failure include money running out, being in the wrong market, a lack of research, bad partnerships, ineffective marketing, and not being an expert in the industry.\nWays to avoid failing include setting goals, accurate research, loving the work, and not quitting.\nHow Many New Businesses Fail?\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as an operation with fewer than 500 employees.\u00a0That means there are a lot of businesses out there that are technically \u201csmall\u201d even though they seem very large. These small businesses, as per the definition, make up 47.1% (latest information as of 2017) of the working population in the U.S., so their growth and success are vital to the U.S. economy. 1\nThere are currently 31.7 million small businesses in the United States, which make up 99.9% of all U.S. businesses. 1 Many small businesses start up every month but the failure rate is high. As of 2021, 20% failed in the first year, 50% within five years, and 65% within 10 years. 2\nGiven the number of businesses that start up, why do such a high percentage of them fail ?\nReasons for Failing\nIf you poll former business owners, you will get a wide variety of reasons as to why their businesses failed.\nMoney Ran Out: This widely given reason doesn\u2019t really explain why a business failed. The money ran out because it stopped coming in, so why did the cash flow dry up?\u00a0Was it due to poorly managed costs or because sales weren't high enough? Money running out also relates to an inability to obtain financing or further financing needed to sustain a business, especially in the early days, until a business can start generating profits.\nWrong Market: Too many people try to start a business targeting everyone as their demographic. This doesn\u2019t work out well. Next, they try to target everyone in their town. Again, too broad. The more narrowly defined your niche is, the easier it will be to market to the right audience .\nLack of Research: You have to know what your customers want.\u00a0Too many would-be entrepreneurs go into the market thinking they have a great service or product to offer, but they fail to realize that nobody wants that service or product.\u00a0By doing your homework and researching your market, you will know exactly how to meet your potential customers\u2019 needs.\nThe Small Business Administration considers a business a startup when it hires at least one employee. 1\nBad Partnership: Often, when starting a business, a partner is needed.\u00a0One of you is an expert in one area, and the other is an expert in another one.\u00a0Your ideas for the company will conflict, and without a clear resolution, it starts internal strife. You work harder and your partner works less, but your partner thinks they are working harder than you. Ultimately, the business dissolves because the partnership didn\u2019t work.\u00a0By having a clear business plan that lays out the duties of each partner, you can avoid most conflicts before they even arise.\nBad Marketing: It could be said that a business boils down to two aspects: marketing and bookkeeping. If you excel at both, it doesn\u2019t matter what you are selling or offering because someone will buy it. The sad truth is that most entrepreneurs know their craft and little else. Instead of fumbling through your marketing campaign, hire out that aspect of your business. It costs money, but if done right, it will bring in much more than what you spent.\nNot an Expert: Too many entrepreneurs start their business because they need a job.\u00a0They have a vague idea of what they are doing, and they think that because they\u2019re better than their peers, they should make a living doing it.\u00a0The sad truth is that without business skills and real expertise, these entrepreneurs are destined to struggle.\nHow to Avoid Failing\nIt seems that most businesses are destined for failure.\u00a0But there are key points to not becoming one of the 20% that fails right off the bat. 2\nSet Goals: Know exactly where you need to be and where you want to be.\u00a0Without a goal, you\u2019re just wandering aimlessly.\nResearch: Know everything about your market.\u00a0Know what customers want. Know that they will pay $9 but not $10. Know their incomes, their desires, and what makes them tick.\u00a0The more you know, the more you can pitch to them.\nLove Your Work: If you don\u2019t love what you do, it will show.\u00a0You must be passionate about your business, or it will just be a job.\nDon\u2019t Quit: No matter how great of a business you have, you are going to have downtimes.\u00a0There will be periods when things are dragging along and you question your decision to embark on this path.\u00a0This is a time to put in extra hours, press harder, and make it work.\nThe Bottom Line\nMany startups fail within the early years, indicating that many things need to go right for a business to succeed. Fortunately, you can be one of the 80% that thrive in the first year. 2 To do this, you need to follow the tips outlined above, and, most importantly, you have to test your idea, do your homework, and make sure it will work before you jump in with both feet.\nCorrection-May 11, 2022: This article previously misstated the percentage of business failures throughout the years.\nArticle Sources"}, {"Url": "https://bbva.com/en/why-do-startups-fail", "CluewebURLHash": "85F6840110E5C87F1B5116ED7F2E3BF9", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why do startups fail? | BBVA", "Snippet": "The main reason behind the failure of startups is clear: they\ue000 simply fail to offer a product or service the market wants.\ue001 This was the cause cited by 42 percent of the entrepreneurs for the closure of their business in the cases examined by CB Insights.", "Click_Cnt": 0.015, "CluewebID": null, "CluewebDocument": null}, {"Url": "https://proteanthinker.com/why-startups-fail", "CluewebURLHash": "E1D64580DF6DC88B066219ED011545C3", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "17 Reasons Behind Why Startups Fail That You Must Know", "Snippet": "The reason behind \ue000why startups fail\ue001 every year can give an insight into how a \ue000startup\ue001 owner can be among those 10% of \ue000startups\ue001 that succeed.", "Click_Cnt": 0.015, "CluewebID": null, "CluewebDocument": null}, {"Url": "https://wilburlabs.com/blueprints/why-startups-fail", "CluewebURLHash": "125EDD66C1C01E9B2BC3DBF06E1760CC", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "\ue000Why Startups Fail\ue001 | Lessons From 150 Founders | Wilbur Labs", "Snippet": "\ue000Why Startups Fail\ue001.

Our goal is to identify and share clear learnings on this, and the timing could not be more critical.\nIn 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service received more than 4.4 million applications for new businesses according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 1 In the second, third, and fourth quarters, business formation topped every quarter since 2005. Although COVID-19 has shuttered almost 30% of small businesses, it is simultaneously responsible for the 21st century\u2019s greatest surge in entrepreneurship. 2\nFor would-be founders, there\u2019s no avoiding the undeniable: sustained success is statistically unlikely. Nearly a fifth of new businesses shut down in their first year according to BLS data. 3 Even with venture backing, a staggering three-quarters of startups fail according to research by Shikhar Ghosh of Harvard Business School. 4 However, fear of failure shouldn\u2019t prevent anyone from starting a business.\nOne great way to raise the odds of startup success is to learn from current and past entrepreneurs. Towards that end, Wilbur Labs surveyed more than 150 startup founders about the pressures that threatened their businesses. We also pulled records of 350 startup failures from CB Insights and Autopsy then analyzed them for patterns. The resulting insights can help founders improve their odds of success this year and beyond.\nWhen founders solve significant problems and avoid preventable failures, everyone stands to benefit. In that spirit, we\u2019ll examine why startups fail (i.e., shutdown permanently) and how they overcome potential failures.\nWhy Startups Fail\nAbout 70% of entrepreneurs will face potential business failure based on our survey of more than 150 founders. Nearly 66% will face this potential failure within 25 months of launching their company. Almost 77% of respondents who faced potential failure said it was due \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to COVID-19.\nBased on a novel analysis of data from CB Insights and Autopsy, we identified the reasons that founders cite for failure. 5,6 Keep in mind: this is self-reported data.\nMore than one-third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure. Second to that, founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest. In other words, if they managed to generate more revenue, spend less money, and/or raise capital through alternative channels, their startups might have survived.\nRunning out of money seems related to the third most common reason for failure: no business plan or model. Perhaps founders mistakenly believe that a business plan will slow them down or limit their agility. Or, maybe they expect to exit before there\u2019s pressure to be profitable. Such founders are likely to bank on their next funding round, an acquisition, or a major enterprise deal for survival. If those don\u2019t materialize, there\u2019s no plan B.\nAlthough most startups cannot expect to generate profits immediately, they should have a break-even point and a plan to reach it. As former Google CEO Eric Schmidt often says, \u201cRevenue solves all known problems.\u201d Revenue can also solve unknown problems, as the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated.\nRevenue generation also proves that a startup is solving a significant problem in a sustainable way. If no one will pay for the solution, more financing won\u2019t necessarily change that. There is simply no better measure of product-market fit and competitiveness than revenue.\nBased on the data, strong business planning with an eye towards profitability is the surest way to avoid failure. When Wilbur Labs surveyed 150+ founders about their recommendations for preventing failure, they tended to agree:\nNearly 30% of respondents urged founders to do more research prior to launch, while roughly 22% recommended building a stronger business plan. Even though running out of money is the leading cause of failure, relatively few (13.5%) founders recommend financing as a way to prevent that.\nIn a free-response section where respondents could enter any advice for founders, this theme persisted. A quarter of responses emphasized research, planning, and/or preparation. Only 6% said \u201cjust do it\u201d or \u201cgo for it.\u201d\nWe encourage founders to look at Wilbur Labs\u2019 Concept Evaluation \u2014 our version of a business plan \u2014 which you can view in our post, How to Turn an Idea Into a Business.\nReasons for Startup Failure Over Time\nLaunching a business is never easy. But do the dominant causes of failure change over time? To find out, we plotted the prevalence of each reason for failure across the last six years.\nAlthough the causes of startup failure changed significantly in a mere six years, challenges with money and financing remained the top reasons for failure. In fact, they have grown more troublesome since 2014, even as venture investment totals break new records annually.\nVenture money is not distributed evenly, however. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and PitchBook note that \u201cmega deals\u201d (venture investments of $100M or more) account for a growing proportion of the total \u2014 about 45% in 2020, up from 40% in 2019. 7,8 Unless VCs are lined up to invest, depending on the next venture round is an ever-riskier survival strategy for startups.\nSome causes of failure have grown more prevalent since 2014, including a lack of market need. That doesn\u2019t mean the world is running out of startup ideas (see How to Get Startup Ideas, a Wilbur Labs post addressing this topic in detail). Rather, that may reflect a lack of cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity among founders and investors. The sense of increasing competition may suggest that too many founders have piled into red oceans without enough differentiation. Notice that a lack of market need and mistimed products spiked only in 2020. COVID-19 throttled startups that could not adapt to socially distanced living.\nEither way, long gone are the days when founders could launch an app or product and users would swarm to try it. There\u2019s too much noise out there. Solving real problems that serve people better is even more critical now, given the sheer number of products competing daily for attention.\nLegal challenges have also been on the rise, perhaps due to increasing regulation of digital companies. Before Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018, UK small businesses each spent an average of 600 hours to prepare. 9 Early on in a venture, any distraction from building a product and serving customers can be deadly. Encouragingly, fewer founders say their network, scale, team, UX, marketing, or lack of focus are barriers to success compared to six years ago. Maybe startup development is becoming more professional and systematic. Failure to pivot is another barrier in decline. Nearly 30% of startups reported this being a cause for their failure in 2014, but six years later, just under 15% reported the same. Founders willing to pivot tend to raise their odds of success, as the next set of data demonstrates.\nStartup Founders and Pivot Strategies\nIn our survey of 150 founders, 55% reported pivoting to avoid failure. Less than half felt confident in their likelihood of success when the pivot took place. Even so, nearly 75% of the founders who pivoted said it was successful.\nDuring a pivot, founders should build the plane as they fly it. The team must learn from mistakes, iterate, and adapt quickly \u2014 before the money runs out. Presumably, founders who invest in identifying and mitigating future risks have better odds of not only pivoting but surviving the process.\nBut which pivots work and why? Which strategies save companies?\nA majority of founders pivoted by updating or improving their business plan. As noted earlier, a bad business plan is the third most common cause of failure and is linked to running out of money, the most frequently reported reason for failure.\nFew startups launch with a bulletproof, immutable plan. Rather, successful founders create a plan and improve it continuously as market conditions and customer feedback demand. Changing the business plan can lead to the second and third most popular strategies: improving the existing product or launching a new one.\nAlmost 13% of founders said they attempted to pivot by securing additional funding or investors. This is a rarer pivot but an important one given how commonly startups fail by running out of money or by failing to secure more funding. While capital-intensive businesses (e.g., clean industrial technologies) may depend on external financing for longer than average, most startups can avoid this dicey pivot by focusing on their business model and revenue.\nAdvice From Other Founders\nThe odds are stacked against startups. But by studying other founders\u2019 mistakes, aspiring entrepreneurs can anticipate and manage preventable failures. With this in mind, Wilbur Labs asked startup founders to indicate the advice they would give to other entrepreneurs.\nThe leading suggestions are fundamental rules of startup survival: learn from mistakes, listen to customers, and ensure that there is a market for your product.\nLess common but noteworthy is how many founders recommend looking for outside help in the form of legal advice (29%), networking (28%), consultants (28%), and a team with diversified skills (22%).\nDespite the stereotype, successful founders are not rugged individualists living off Walden Pond. They surround themselves with experts and mentors who have encountered and solved the challenges endemic to building any startup. Founders who learn from these advisors can focus on their own vision rather than on reinventing the wheel.\nSupporting Startup Success\nAlthough failure is disappointing, two-thirds of the founders who faced potential failure would be willing to launch another venture.\nHaving examined why startups fail, how founders pivot, and what they advise in retrospect, what conclusion can we draw for aspiring entrepreneurs?\n1. Research, plan, and prepare better. In retrospect, 51.3% of the surveyed founders thought they were adequately prepared when they launched their startup. No wonder so many advised better planning. \u201cResearch, research, research. Research your market,\u201d said one founder. To that we offer an addendum: turn all that research into a business plan.\n2. Do not leave money to chance. Founders often run out of capital, struggle to generate revenue, spend on the wrong things, and/or fail to attract investors. Businesses are well-equipped to solve big problems because they are (supposed to be) self-sustaining. Revenue from solving problems enables the business to operate long-term without external support. The surest way to avoid financial failure is to develop a business model with a predictable path to revenue and profitability.\n3. P ivots raise the odds of success. In the moment, less than half of founders who pivoted felt good about their odds of success. They persevered, nonetheless, and a stunning 75% of founders who pivoted did so successfully. Perhaps their willingness to pivot is more telling than the exact strategy they used.\n4. Learn from shared mistakes. The purpose of this study was to learn from other founders\u2019 mistakes. Coincidentally, the most popular piece of advice from founders to aspiring entrepreneurs was to learn from mistakes. As one founder advised, \u201cMistakes are not the problem; the problem is not correcting them.\u201d\nAlthough your solution to a problem may blaze new trails, remember that other founders have taken the same journey of launching a startup. All founders share common challenges. By studying past success and failures, aspiring entrepreneurs can improve their odds of success and avoid missteps that frequently lead to failure. Founders who heed this collective knowledge can reserve their focus for problems unique to their market and product.\nEntrepreneurs are made, not born. Hard work, drive, and absolute determination can make up for gaps in skills and experience. The rest is learned by doing, making mistakes, and adapting along the way.\nMethodology\nThe primary source for this study was a proprietary survey of 156 startup founders from December 2020. 81 founders identified as male and 75 as female. They ranged in age from 22 to 78 and averaged 43.5 years old.\nWilbur Labs administered this survey digitally, utilizing a mix of multiple-choice and open-answer questions. The survey\u2019s main limitation is the reliance on founders self-reporting, which is faced with issues, like attribution, exaggeration, telescoping, and recency bias.\nThis project also utilizes information gathered from CB Insights and Autopsy. To investigate causes of startup failure, our team analyzed CB Insights\u2019 Startup Failure Post-Mortems list and determined the most common reasons that 368 startups ceased to do business, organizing our findings within several overarching categories (e.g., \u201cran out of cash\u201d).\nSources\n1.

MARKET PROBLEMS\nWhen startups fail, it's usually not because they run out of money. It's because they didn't solve a problem that customers want to be solved.\nThere are three problems with most early-stage startups:\nThey don\u2019t know what their customers really need, they can\u2019t do anything about it, and no one really cares anyway.\nMost startups fail because the founders don\u2019t pay attention to this simple formula.\nThe first thing you need to do is understand your customers' real need and then create something that solves those needs. The second part might be harder than you think.\n2. Business Model Failure\nThere are a number of reasons why startups fail, but most people miss the major reasons. This article will highlight some of them so you can avoid these mistakes when starting a startup yourself.\nThe second mistake is not understanding the market and where they want to be in it. You have to understand what works in your industry and position your business accordingly. If you want to start a new company,\nI highly recommend reading this book called Positioning: \u2018The Battle for Your Mind' by Al Ries and Jack Trout\u00a0. It\u2019s an old book from 1981, but still relevant today.\n3. Poor Management Team\nA) One of the biggest reasons why startups fail is due to a lack of a good management team. The first step for a potential investor is to look at your management team and see if they have what it takes. This means that you should put together a good team that has a proven track record.\nIf you don\u2019t have a great team, then you should consider getting one from outside by hiring top talent from other companies. But make sure that those talented people are aligned with your goals and will help bring those goals to pass. You should also make sure these individuals are passionate.\nB) A lot of startups fail because the management team is a bunch of poor leaders. But how do you know if your company has a bad leadership team? The following are some signs to look for in your own business.\nFor example, imagine that you have a new employee who starts out doing great work. In the beginning, he follows through on tasks and gets along well with other employees, but after three months he begins to slack off. He doesn\u2019t complete assignments on time and his attitude toward co-workers starts to sour. This is bad!\n4. Running Out Of Cash\n\"Running out of cash is the number one reason startups fail,\" says Alex Nussen, a venture capitalist at DN Capital in London.\nOnly 7% of businesses make it past 5 years and only 1 in 10 make it to year 8. However, we\u2019re starting to see more and more companies making it past that \u201c5-year mark\u201d because they have found innovative ways to avoid running out of cash. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a startup or not, learning how to run a business without going broke is important for any entrepreneur.\n5. Product Problems\nToday\u2019s world is all about solving problems. As an entrepreneur, it is your job to solve the problems of your customers. You may have the best product or service for them but if you fail to address their real problems, then there is no way that they will buy from you.\nIt\u2019s crucial to avoid these pitfalls so that your startup doesn\u2019t fall apart before it even gets off the ground.\nRead more from ILLUMINATION"}, {"Url": "https://amazon.in/why-startups-fail-roadmap-entrepreneurial/dp/0593137027", "CluewebURLHash": "F3E9A909BD3B980EABE278628F72C425", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Why Startups Fail: A New Roadmap for Entrepreneurial Success ...", "Snippet": "In \ue000Why Startups Fail\ue001, Eisenmann reveals his findings: six distinct patterns that account for the vast majority of \ue000startup\ue001 failures. \u2022 Bad Bedfellows. \ue000Startup\ue001 success is thought to rest largely on the founder\u2019s talents and instincts.", "Click_Cnt": 0.008, "CluewebID": null, "CluewebDocument": null}, {"Url": "https://innovation.mit.edu/news-article/harvard-business-review-why-start-ups-fail", "CluewebURLHash": "152CD08EF23CC215A1366985EB1DA64E", "UrlLanguage": "en", "Title": "Harvard Business Review: Why Start-ups Fail - MIT ...", "Snippet": "Consequently, when asked to explain why a promising new venture eventually stumbled, most are inclined to cite the inadequacies of its founders\u2014in particular, their lack of grit, industry acumen, or leadership ability.

But why do so many end disappointingly? That question hit me with full force several years ago when I realized I couldn\u2019t answer it.\nThat was unnerving. For the past 24 years, I\u2019ve been a professor at Harvard Business School, where I\u2019ve led the team teaching The Entrepreneurial Manager, a required course for all our MBAs. At HBS I\u2019ve also drawn on my research, my experiences as an angel investor, and my work on start-up boards to help create 14 electives on every aspect of launching a new venture. But could I truly teach students how to build winning start-ups if I wasn\u2019t sure why so many were failing?\nI became determined to get to the bottom of the question. I interviewed or surveyed hundreds of founders and investors, read scores of first- and third-person published accounts of entrepreneurial setbacks, and wrote and taught more than 20 case studies about unsuccessful ventures. The result of my research is a book, Why Startups Fail, in which I identify recurring patterns that explain why a large number of start-ups come to nothing.\nMy findings go against the pat assumptions of many venture capital investors. If you ask them why start-ups fall short, you will most likely hear about \u201chorses\u201d (that is, the opportunities start-ups are targeting) and \u201cjockeys\u201d (the founders). Both are important, but if forced to choose, most VCs would favor an able founder over an attractive opportunity. Consequently, when asked to explain why a promising new venture eventually stumbled, most are inclined to cite the inadequacies of its founders\u2014in particular, their lack of grit, industry acumen, or leadership ability.\nPutting the blame on the founders oversimplifies a complex situation. It\u2019s also an example of what psychologists call the fundamental attribution error \u2014the tendency for observers, when explaining outcomes, to emphasize the main actors\u2019 disposition and for the main actors to cite situational factors not under their control\u2014for example, in the case of a failed start-up, a rival\u2019s irrational moves.\nPutting scapegoating aside, I identified six patterns of failure, which I describe fully in my book. In this article I\u2019ve chosen to focus on two of them in greater detail, for two reasons: First, they\u2019re the most common avoidable reasons why start-ups go wrong. I\u2019m not interested in clearly doomed ventures with no chance of success or even promising start-ups that were felled by unexpected external forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Rather, I\u2019ve focused on ventures that initially showed promise but subsequently crashed to earth because of errors that could have been averted. Second, the two patterns are the most applicable to people launching new ventures within larger companies, government agencies, and nonprofits, which makes them especially relevant to HBR readers. I\u2019ll explain each pattern more fully, illustrate it with a case study, explain when it\u2019s most likely to occur, and suggest ways to steer clear of it.\nGood Idea, Bad Bedfellows\nAs I\u2019ve noted, VCs look for founders with the right stuff: resilience, passion, experience leading start-up teams, and so forth. But even when such rare talent captains a new venture, there are other parties whose contributions are crucial to it. A broad set of stakeholders, including employees, strategic partners, and investors, all can play a role in a venture\u2019s downfall.\nIndeed, a great jockey isn\u2019t even necessary for start-up success. Other members of the senior management team can compensate for a founder\u2019s shortcomings, and seasoned investors and advisers can likewise provide guidance and useful connections. A new venture pursuing an amazing opportunity will typically attract such contributors\u2014even if its founder doesn\u2019t walk on water. But if its idea is merely good, a start-up may not become a talent magnet.\nConsider the case of Quincy Apparel. In May 2011 two former students of mine, Alexandra Nelson and Christina Wallace, came to me for feedback on their start-up concept. I admired both of them and was impressed with their idea, which identified an unmet customer need: Young professional women had a hard time finding affordable and stylish work apparel that fit them well. Nelson and Wallace, who were close friends, devised a novel solution: a sizing scheme that allowed customers to specify four separate garment measurements (such as waist-to-hip ratio and bra size)\u2014akin to the approach used for tailoring men\u2019s suits.\nFollowing the lean start-up method, Nelson and Wallace then validated customer demand using a textbook-perfect minimum viable product, or MVP\u2014that is, the simplest possible offering that yields reliable customer feedback. They held six trunk shows at which women could try on sample outfits and place orders. Of the 200 women who attended, 25% made purchases. Buoyed by these results, the cofounders quit their consulting jobs, raised $950,000 in venture capital, recruited a team, and launched Quincy Apparel. They employed a direct-to-consumer business model, selling online rather than through brick-and-mortar stores. At this point I became an early angel investor in the company.\nKalle Gustafsson/Trunk Archive\nInitial orders were strong, as were reorders: An impressive 39% of customers who bought items from Quincy\u2019s first seasonal collection made repeat purchases. However, robust demand required heavy investment in inventory. Meanwhile, production problems caused garments to fit poorly on some customers, resulting in higher-than-expected returns. Processing returns and correcting production problems put pressure on margins, rapidly depleting Quincy\u2019s cash reserves. After Quincy tried and failed to raise more capital, the team trimmed the product line, aiming to simplify operations and realize efficiencies. However, the business lacked enough funding to prove out the pivot, and Quincy was forced to shut down less than a year after its launch.\nSo why did Quincy fail?\nQuincy\u2019s founders had a good idea. The venture\u2019s value proposition was appealing to target customers, and the business had a sound formula for earning a profit\u2014at least over the long term, after shaking out the bugs in production. The team had credible projections that customers in priority segments, who\u2019d accounted for more than half of Quincy\u2019s sales, would each have a lifetime value of over $1,000\u2014well in excess of the $100 average cost to acquire a new customer. (Quincy\u2019s out-of-pocket marketing costs were kept low by social-network-fueled word of mouth and enthusiastic media coverage.)\nWere Wallace and Nelson simply poor jockeys? Temperamentally, their fit with the founder role was good. They were sharp and resourceful and had complementary strengths. Wallace, who was responsible for marketing and fundraising, had a big vision and the charisma to sell it. Nelson, who led operations, was deliberate and disciplined. However, the founder team wobbled in two important ways. First, unwilling to strain their close friendship, Wallace and Nelson shared decision-making authority equally with respect to strategy, product design, and other key choices. This slowed their responses when action was required. Second, neither founder had experience with clothing design and manufacturing.\nA broad set of stakeholders,\nincluding employees, strategic\npartners, and investors, all can play\na role in a venture\u2019s downfall.\nApparel production entails many specialized tasks, such as fabric sourcing, pattern making, and quality control. To compensate for their lack of industry know-how, the founders hired a few apparel company veterans, assuming that they\u2019d fill multiple functions\u2014as jack-of-all-trades team members do in most early-stage start-ups. However, accustomed to the high levels of specialization in mature apparel companies, Quincy\u2019s employees weren\u2019t flexible about tackling tasks outside their areas of expertise.\nQuincy outsourced manufacturing to third-party factories, which was not unusual in the industry. But the factories were slow to meet production commitments for entrepreneurs who had no industry reputation, required unusual garment sizing, and placed small orders. This meant shipping delays for Quincy.\nInvestors also played a role in Quincy\u2019s demise. The founders had aimed to raise $1.5 million but managed to secure only $950,000. That was enough to fund operations for two seasonal collections. Before launching, the founders had correctly assumed that at least three seasons would be needed to fine-tune operations. Quincy had some traction after two seasons but not enough to lure new backers, and the venture capital firms that had provided most of its money were too small to commit more funds. Furthermore, the founders were disappointed with the guidance they got from those VCs, who pressured them to grow at full tilt\u2014like the technology start-ups the investors were more familiar with. Doing so forced Quincy to build inventory, burning through cash before it had resolved its production problems.\nIn summary, Quincy had a good idea but bad bedfellows: Besides the founders, a range of resource providers were culpable in the venture\u2019s collapse, including team members, manufacturing partners, and investors.\nCould this outcome have been avoided? Perhaps. The founders\u2019 lack of fashion industry experience was at the root of many problems. It took time for Wallace and Nelson to master the complexities of apparel design and production. Without industry connections, they couldn\u2019t leverage their professional networks to recruit team members or count on past relationships with factory managers to ensure prompt delivery. And without an industry track record, they had difficulty finding investors willing to bet on first-time founders.\nAn ideal solution would have been to bring in another cofounder with apparel industry experience. Nelson and Wallace tried to do this, without success. They did have some advisers who could offer guidance\u2014but adding more would have helped. In a postmortem analysis, Quincy\u2019s founders also concluded that they could have sidestepped operational problems by outsourcing their entire design and production process to a single factory partner. Likewise, rather than raising funds from venture capital firms, they could have sought financial backing from a clothing factory. A factory with an equity stake in Quincy would have expedited its orders and worked harder to correct production problems. Also, the factory owners would have known how to pace the growth of a new apparel line, in contrast to Quincy\u2019s VCs, who pressured the team for hypergrowth.\nMany entrepreneurs who claim to\nembrace the lean start-up canon\nactually adopt only part of it,\nneglecting to research customer\nneeds.\nQuincy\u2019s troubles shed some light on the attributes that may make start-ups vulnerable to this particular failure pattern. Entrepreneurs\u2019 lack of industry experience will be especially problematic when large, lumpy resource commitments are required, as they are in apparel manufacturing: Quincy\u2019s founders had to design a multistep product process from scratch, and revising such a process is disruptive once it\u2019s in place. Another factor was ever-shifting fashion trends; the founders had to commit to garment designs and then build inventory for an entire collection many months before it went on sale.\nWith such challenges, learning by doing can result in expensive mistakes. Compounding the pressure, investors prefer to mete out capital one chunk at a time, waiting to see if the business can stay on the rails. If the start-up stumbles or stalls, follow-on financing may not be forthcoming from existing investors, and potential new investors will be scared off. Pivoting to a better solution isn\u2019t feasible when it requires large amounts of capital along with weeks or months to see if new approaches are working. In that situation entrepreneurs have no room for big errors, but a lack of industry experience makes missteps all the more likely.\nFalse Starts\nI have long been an apostle of the lean start-up approach. But as I dug deeper into case studies of failure, I concluded that its practices were falling short of their promise. Many entrepreneurs who claim to embrace the lean start-up canon actually adopt only part of it. Specifically, they launch MVPs and iterate on them after getting feedback. By putting an MVP out there and testing how customers respond, founders are supposed to avoid squandering time and money building and marketing a product that no one wants.\nYet by neglecting to research customer needs before commencing their engineering efforts, entrepreneurs end up wasting valuable time and capital on MVPs that are likely to miss their mark. These are false starts. The entrepreneurs are like sprinters who jump the gun: They\u2019re too eager to get a product out there. The rhetoric of the lean start-up movement\u2014for example, \u201claunch early and often\u201d and \u201cfail fast\u201d\u2014actually encourages this \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d behavior.\nThe online dating start-up Triangulate experienced this syndrome in 2010. Its founder, Sunil Nagaraj, had originally intended to build a matching engine\u2014software that Triangulate would license to existing dating sites such as eHarmony and Match. The engine would automatically extract consumers\u2019 profile data\u2014with their permission\u2014from social networks and media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, and Netflix. The engine would then use algorithms to pair up users whose tastes and habits suggested that they might be romantically compatible. But VCs wouldn\u2019t back the plan. They told Nagaraj, \u201cCome back after you\u2019ve signed a licensing deal.\u201d\nTo prove to potential licensees that the matching engine worked, Nagaraj decided to use it to power Triangulate\u2019s own dating site, a Facebook app that would also leverage the rich user data available to Facebook\u2019s platform partners. VCs now showed interest: Nagaraj raised $750,000 and launched a dating site called Wings. The site was free to use and earned revenue from small payments made by users who sent digital gifts or messages. Wings soon became Triangulate\u2019s main event; the licensing plan went on the back burner.\nKalle Gustafsson/Trunk Archive\nWings automatically populated a user\u2019s profile by connecting to Facebook and other online services. It also encouraged users to invite their friends to the site as \u201cwingmen\u201d who could vouch for them\u2014and provide a viral boost to the site\u2019s growth. Less than a year after launching Wings, however, Nagaraj\u2019s team abandoned both the matching engine and the wingman concept. Users found more value in recommended matches that were based on potential partners\u2019 physical attractiveness, proximity, and responsiveness to messages\u2014criteria routinely employed by existing dating sites. The wingman role, meanwhile, was not delivering hoped-for virality and made the site cumbersome to navigate. Furthermore, many users were uncomfortable making their dating life an open book to their friends.\nA year after launch, Wings\u2019 user base was growing, but user engagement was much lower than expected. As a result, revenue per user fell far short of Nagaraj\u2019s original projections. Also, with limited virality, the cost of acquiring a new user was much higher than his forecast. With an unsustainable business model, Nagaraj and his team had to pivot once again\u2014this time, with cash balances running low. They launched a new dating site, DateBuzz, that allowed users to vote on elements of other users\u2019 profiles\u2014before seeing their photos. This addressed one of the biggest pain points in online dating: the impact of photos on messaging. On a typical dating site, physically attractive individuals get too many messages, and other users get too few. DateBuzz redistributed attention in ways that boosted user satisfaction. Less-attractive individuals were contacted more often, and attractive users still got plenty of queries.\nEntrepreneurs should conduct a\ncompetitive analysis, including\nuser testing of existing solutions, to\nunderstand the strengths and\nshortcomings of rival products.\nDespite this innovation, DateBuzz\u2014like Wings\u2014had to spend far more than it could afford to acquire each new user. Lacking confidence that a network effect would kick in and reduce customer acquisition costs before cash balances were exhausted, Nagaraj shut down Triangulate and returned $120,000 to investors.\nSo why did Triangulate fail?\nThe problem was clearly not with the jockey or his bedfellows. Nagaraj had raised funds from a topflight VC and had recruited a very able team\u2014one that could rapidly process user feedback and in response iterate in a creative and nimble manner. Weak founders rarely attract strong teams and smart money. This was not a case of \u201cright opportunity, wrong resources,\u201d as with Quincy\u2019s failure. Rather, Triangulate\u2019s demise followed the opposite pattern: \u201cwrong opportunity, right resources.\u201d\nA clue about the cause of Triangulate\u2019s failure lies in its three big pivots in less than two years. On one hand, pivots are foundational for lean start-ups. With each iteration, Nagaraj\u2019s team had heeded the \u201cfail fast\u201d mantra. The team also followed the principle of launching early and often\u2014putting a real product into the hands of real customers as fast as possible.\nBut there\u2019s more to the lean start-up approach than those practices. Before entrepreneurs begin to build a product, lean start-up guru Steve Blank insists, they must complete a phase called \u201ccustomer discovery\u201d\u2014a round of interviews with prospective customers. (See \u201cWhy the Lean Start-up Changes Everything,\u201d HBR, May 2013.) Those interviews probe for strong, unmet customer needs\u2014problems worth pursuing. In Nagaraj\u2019s postmortem analysis of Triangulate\u2019s failure, he acknowledged skipping this crucial step. He and his team failed to conduct up-front research to validate the demand for a matching engine or the appeal of the wingman concept. Nor did they conduct MVP tests akin to Quincy\u2019s trunk shows. Instead they rushed to launch Wings as a fully functional product.\nBy giving short shrift to customer discovery and MVPs, Triangulate\u2019s team fell victim to a false start\u2014and turned the \u201cfail fast\u201d mantra into a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the team members had spoken to customers at the outset or tested a true MVP, they could have designed their first product in ways that conformed more closely to market needs. By failing with their first product, they wasted a feedback cycle, and time is an early-stage entrepreneur\u2019s most precious resource. With the clock ticking, one wasted cycle means one less opportunity to pivot before money runs out.\nWhy do founders like Nagaraj skip up-front customer research? Entrepreneurs have a bias for action; they\u2019re eager to get started. And engineers love to build things. So entrepreneurs who are engineers\u2014like Nagaraj and his teammates\u2014often jump into creating the first version of their product as fast as they can. Furthermore, at the risk of stereotyping, I\u2019d offer that many engineers are simply too introverted to follow Blank\u2019s advice and get out of the building to learn from prospective customers.\nFounders without technical training also fall victim to false starts. They hear repeatedly that having a great product is crucial, so they bring engineers on board as soon as they can. Then, feeling pressure to keep those expensive engineers busy, they rush their product into development.\nThe good news is that false starts can easily be avoided by following a structured, three-step product design process.\n1. Problem definition. Before commencing engineering work, entrepreneurs should conduct rigorous interviews with potential customers\u2014at which they resist the temptation to pitch their solutions. Feedback on possible solutions will come later; instead the focus should be on defining customers\u2019 problems. Also, it\u2019s important to interview both likely early adopters and \u201cmainstream\u201d prospects who may be inclined to purchase later. Success will hinge on attracting both groups, whose needs may differ. If their needs do vary, entrepreneurs will have to take the differences into account when formulating a product road map.\nIn addition, entrepreneurs should conduct a competitive analysis, including user testing of existing solutions, to understand the strengths and shortcomings of rival products. Likewise, surveys can help start-up teams measure customer behaviors and attitudes\u2014helpful data when segmenting and sizing the potential market.\n2. Solution development. Once entrepreneurs have identified priority customer segments and gained a deep understanding of their unmet needs, the team\u2019s next step should be brainstorming a range of solutions. The team should prototype several concepts and get feedback on them through one-on-one sessions with potential customers. Most teams start with crude prototypes, reject some and iterate, and then refine the ones that seem promising, gradually producing \u201chigher fidelity\u201d versions that more closely resemble the future product in functionality and look and feel. Prototype iteration and testing continue until a dominant design emerges.\n3. Solution validation. To evaluate demand for the favored solution, the team then runs a series of MVP tests. Unlike the prototype review sessions during step 2\u2014conducted across the table with a single reviewer\u2014an MVP test puts an actual product in the hands of real customers in a real-world setting to see how they respond. To avoid waste, the best MVPs have the lowest fidelity needed to get reliable input\u2014that is, they provide no more \u201clooks like\u201d polish and \u201cworks like\u201d functionality than are strictly necessary. Early MVP tests may take things further, assessing demand for a planned product through a Kickstarter campaign or by soliciting letters of intent to purchase from business-to-business customers.Success with the product design process may require a shift in the founders\u2019 mindset. At a venture\u2019s outset many entrepreneurs have a preconceived notion of the customer problems they\u2019ll address and the solutions. They may fervently believe they\u2019re on the right path. But during the product design process, they should avoid being too emotionally attached to a specific problem-solution pairing. Entrepreneurs should stay open to the possibility that the process will uncover more-pressing problems or better solutions.\nMaintaining Balance\nOf course, there is no way for founders to know which deadly trap they may face as they launch. Familiarizing oneself with these two dominant failure patterns can help. But so too can understanding why they afflict start-ups so frequently.\nPart of the answer is that the behaviors that conventional wisdom holds make a great entrepreneur can paradoxically increase the risk of encountering these failure patterns. It\u2019s important for an entrepreneur to maintain balance. Guidance based on conventional wisdom is good\u2014most of the time\u2014but it shouldn\u2019t be followed blindly. Consider the following advice given to many first-time founders and how it can backfire:\nJust do it! Great entrepreneurs make things happen and move fast to capture opportunity. But a bias for action can tempt an entrepreneur to truncate exploration and leap too soon into building and selling a product, as I\u2019ve explained. When that happens, founders may find themselves locked prematurely into a flawed solution.\nBe persistent! Entrepreneurs encounter setbacks over and over. True entrepreneurs dust themselves off and go back at it; they must be determined and resilient. However, if persistence turns into stubbornness, founders may have difficulty recognizing a false start for what it is. They likewise may be reluctant to pivot when it should be clear that their solution isn\u2019t working. Delaying a pivot eats up scarce capital, shortening a venture\u2019s runway.\nBring passion! A burning desire to have a world-changing impact can power entrepreneurs through the most daunting challenges. It can also attract employees, investors, and partners who\u2019ll help make their dreams a reality. But in the extreme, passion can translate into overconfidence\u2014and a penchant to skip critical up-front research. Likewise, passion can blind entrepreneurs to the fact that their product isn\u2019t meeting customer needs.\nBootstrap! Because resources are limited, entrepreneurs must conserve them by being frugal and figuring out clever ways to make do with less. True enough, but if a start-up cannot consistently deliver on its value proposition because its team lacks crucial skills, its founders must decide whether to hire employees with those skills. If those candidates demand high compensation, a scrappy, frugal founder might say, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to do without them\u201d\u2014and risk being stuck with bad bedfellows.\nGrow! Rapid growth attracts investors and talent and gives a team a great morale boost. This may tempt founders to curtail customer research and prematurely launch their product. Also, fast growth can put heavy demands on team members and partners. If a team has bad bedfellows, growth may exacerbate quality problems and depress profit margins.\n. . .\nIt\u2019s fashionable in start-up circles to speak glibly about failure as a badge of honor or a rite of passage\u2014just another phase of an entrepreneur\u2019s journey. Perhaps doing so is a coping mechanism, or perhaps failure\u2019s ubiquity inures those in the business world to its true human and economic costs. I\u2019ve counseled dozens of entrepreneurs as they shut down their ventures. Raw emotions are always on display: anger, guilt, sadness, shame, and resentment. In some cases the founders were in denial; others just seemed depressed. Who could blame them, after having had their dreams dashed and their self-confidence shattered? In my work I try to help people come to terms with failure, but I can tell you that at ground zero, there\u2019s no way to avoid the fact that it hurts. It also can destroy relationships. When they founded Quincy Apparel, Nelson and Wallace vowed not to let conflict over the business threaten their close friendship. But after clashing over how to wind the company down, they weren\u2019t on speaking terms for two years. (Their relationship has since been repaired.)\nFailure also takes a toll on the economy and society. A doomed venture ties up resources that could be put to better use. And it acts as a deterrent to would-be entrepreneurs who are more risk-averse, have financial obligations that make it hard to forgo a paycheck, or face barriers when raising capital\u2014which is to say, many women and minorities. To be sure, failure will (and should) always be a reality for many entrepreneurs. Doing something new with limited resources is inherently risky. But by recognizing that many failures are avoidable and follow the same trajectory, we can reduce their number and frequency. The payoff will be a more productive, more diverse, and less bruising entrepreneurial economy.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was adapted from the book Why Startups Fail: A New Roadmap for Entrepreneurial Success, by Tom Eisenmann (Currency, 2021).\nA version of this article appeared in the May\u2013June 2021 issue of Harvard Business Review.\nRead more onEntrepreneurship or related topicEntrepreneurial management\nTom Eisenmann is the Howard H.

Explained [2020 Updated]\nW\nBy: Saumya Uniyal\nLast modified: February 13, 2020\nDespite being one of the top startup ecosystems in the world, India is also home to 90% of startups that fail within 5 years of inception. In this article, we'll learn what makes them lag behind in the race to the top.\nWhy startups fail in India: Despite being one of the top startup ecosystems in the world, India is also home to 90% of startups that fail within 5 years.\nIndia, in recent years, has emerged to become one of the largest startup hubs in the world, marking its place at the third spot in the Hurun\u2019s Global Unicorn List 2019, following China and the US (1 ). However, according to a report by IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, over 90% of the Indian startups fail within merely 5 years of inception (2 ).\nSo, what is the reason that leads to failure of startups in India, despite being one of the biggest startup unicorns in the world? There are multiple layers to this answer and cannot be elaborated in one way possible.\nIn this article, we\u2019ve tried to work our way out on digging up and extracting the reasons why startups fail in India, despite being offered a startup-friendly environment by the authorities. While some start loose, others become over-enthusiastic in their entrepreneurial journey, which leads to ultimate startup failures.\nNote: Startups in India often imitate western ideas, generate employment, and shut down due to lack of funds. (3)\n7 Reasons Why Startups Fail in India:\nThere are several reasons why startups fail in India, which is further subdivided into another stream of reasons. If you\u2019re an entrepreneur willing to invest and start a new business, ensure you go through the reasons given below to help you gain a headstart in the startup ecosystem.\n1. When a founder\u2019s under-confident\nConfidence undoubtedly goes a long way. Indian founders of startups, especially the ones who commence on their first-ever entrepreneurial journey, find entrepreneurship a nerve-wracking experience.\nA founder needs to remain confident in his endeavors, which helps in keeping the morale of the team high, in turn, constituting to building an awesome startup.\nNote: Sometimes, when you lack confidence, follow the ideology of \u2018 Fake it till you make it \u2018 by imitating confidence, competence & an optimistic mindset.\n2. When a business model lacks innovation\nAll the businesses that have been able to conquer the startup ecosystem are the ones that contained innovation. However, despite innovation being the central element of a startup, the majority of the startups lack it altogether.\nIndian startups are mostly copying or imitating the business ideas from successful companies abroad, which one of the reasons why our country has witnessed a significant dip in the overseas investment funding in Indian startups.\nNote: Attempt to use the business model design techniques through four epicenters of business model innovation \u2013 ideation, visualization, prototyping, and scenario building.\n3. When the market niche is saturated\nIndia, being one of the most populous countries in the world, is oversaturated with products and services that entered the market in multiple forms ages ago. It is challenging, but not impossible, to discover an untapped industry in the Indian ecosystem, which constitutes a successful startup.\nNote: Try to look for market gaps and brings solutions fulfilling the gap to the table.\n4. When one functions on negative cash flow & working capital\nA business must maintain a continuous cash flow to run his/her business smoothly without any interruptions. A negative working capital not only demotivates the team but also results in either shutting down the business operation due to a lack of funds or seeking investment opportunities in the cut-throat investment marketplace.\nNote: Negative cash flow doesn\u2019t necessarily mean losses. It just directs towards a mismatch of expenditure and income.\n5. When one works on forceful expansion\nMany times, when a startup starts functioning with increasing sales, the core team often ends up taking executive decisions with their hearts and not minds. Do not think about expansion, at least until you reach your adequate gross profit margin or else get ready to take a dip in the losses.\nNote: Prefer not to make rash decisions and ensure makin g executive decisions whilst discussing consequences with your core team .\n6. When there\u2019s a lack of motivated team\nA business runs successfully with a team of highly motivated individuals willing to put in their hard work and effort into making the business a success. Build a team of enthusiastic, energetic, and talented individuals that help in executing your plan and vision to turn your startup success into a reality.\nNote: Instead of leading the team, try being a part of the team, which helps to build a bond with your team members, in turn, creating a robust work environment.\n7. When the feedback isn\u2019t taken seriously\nMany businesses consider customers their god in India as they bring in income and help in running their household. The majority of the startups have adopted customer-oriented business models where customer satisfaction is regarded as the key priority of the company. Take customer feedback and improve upon it if you don\u2019t want your customer base to shift to using the services of your competitor.\nNote: Customer feedback adds value to your relationship with them, and by improving upon their complaints, you display the importance a customer holds in your business.\nConclusion\nWhile commencing on an entrepreneurial journey requires a level of courage, staying stable and growing in your venture is another challenge that needs to be addressed. Ensure you hold your grounds while working on making your startup successful and remains optimistic, no matter how hard the situation gets. Overall, these were some of the reasons why startups fail in India.\nSaumya Uniyal\n+ posts\nA passionate writer with bachelor\u2019s in the field of English & Journalism.

Top 9 Reasons And How Entrepreneurs Can Avoid It\nStartups\nWhy Startups Fail? Top 9 Reasons And How Entrepreneurs Can Avoid It\nJigna Padhiar 8 min\nIndia has the third-largest\u00a0ecosystem for startups, yet\u00a080-90% of Indian startups fail within the first 5 years of their inception. Wondering why startups fail? We found some of the key reasons behind the same and ways in which entrepreneurs could challenge these startup failure situations.\nHere are 9 reasons why startups fail & steps you can take to avoid the same:\n1) Lack of innovation\nAccording to a survey, 77% of venture capitalists think that Indian startups lack innovation or unique business models. A study conducted by IBM Institute for Business Value found that 91% of startups fail within the first five years and the most common reason is \u2013 lack of innovation.\nAlthough India is said to have the third-largest startup ecosystem, it doesn\u2019t have meta-level startups such as some of the big names like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Indian startups are also known for replicating global startups, rather than creating their own startup models.\nAmong the most innovative Indian startups would be startups like ChaiPoint, Ola, Saathi, and Swiggy, according to a list of 50 most innovative companies in the world.\nHow can startups avoid this?\nInnovation in business helps in numerous ways: beat the competition, stand out from the rest, helps solve problems easily and increases productivity. Here are a few points that startups must consider:\nAvoid emulating existing successful global startup ideas in India without proper research and understanding of the Indian market. Startups need expert technical and innovation talent.\nThink about the long-term sustenance of the idea before venturing into ideas that are trending.\nFind the right resources to drive the startup with innovation.\n2) Lack of funds\nIn 2018, bike rental startup, Tazzo, shut shop. The reason, as given by one of its funding partners, was a failed product-market fit that led to drying up of funding. Even though the startup had raised a\u00a0considerable amount of funds, the lack of a profitable business model led to the startup shutting down.\nThere are millions of startup ideas floating around. But to turn ideas into reality requires finance. Those that do procure funding need scalable and profitable models to make the startup grow. Lack of funding is one of the key reasons why startups fail.\nInsufficient cash is a roadblock that leads many startups to shut down. For those startups that receive seed funding, the inability to raise follow-on funds is one of the biggest reasons why startups fail.\nWhat are the key factors to consider?\nStartups must have effective business and revenue models.\nStartups must focus on revenue and profit as much as products/services from the beginning.\nFunds must be spent judiciously.\n3) Lack of focus\nWhen Bill Gates and Warren Buffet were asked about one factor that was responsible for their success, both replied with one word: focus. To understand how focus can help, let\u2019s look at an example.\nGrubhub is a food delivery startup. From the beginning, the company decided to focus only on food delivery. There\u2019s a lot of other services that a company like that could offer- pick up of food, catering, and more, but the founders chose to focus on just delivery. The result? They could execute technically and operationally and grow the business successfully.\nHere\u2019s how startups could maintain focus:\nLook for feedback, both, good and bad.\nDo not go all out. Decide and focus on one thing at a time.\nArticles you may like:\nTop 11 business strategy books that will help you grow your business\nEffective lead generation ideas that every startup should try\n4) Product Market Fit\nA large number of startups fail for the simplest reason \u2013 the consumers have no need for its products. Does your product provide value to consumers? Are there consumers for your product?\nIs your product aligned with the innovative ideas that your company is based on? A lot of times startups attempt to quickly develop products that have no demand or try to expand the market for a product.\nGuide to conducting an extensive startup market research\nHow can you avoid this?\nGain an in-depth understanding of who your customers are and what they feel about your product.\nFind new customers via word of mouth before jumping into creating expensive marketing plans.\nEstablish a relationship with your customers.\nYou can\u2019t please everyone, nor should you try to.\n5) Leadership gaps\nMost startups are driven by the vision of its founders and core team members. However, having a good idea is far less important than knowing how to lead a brand, a company, and a team. Lack of vision and strong leadership is another common reason why startups fail.\nAs mentioned in the Harvard Business Review, \u201c While a principled founding team can create a great company, an enduring company requires a system of leadership that is implemented very early in its history.\u201d Some entrepreneurs may have leadership qualities, while others may have to develop them over time. This can be one of the reasons why startups fail.\nHow can you avoid this?\nIf you do not have leadership skills, delegate the role to someone else who would do it better than you.\nStudy leadership, practice it.\nFind a mentor to help you build leadership skills.\nStartup Handbook: Build A Business From Scratch\nGet instant access to this ebook on building a business from scratch worth $19 absolutely FREE!\n6) Lack of agility\nToday, we live and function in an always-on culture. One needs to, always, keep up with the complexities and changes. In such a culture, agility can bring a competitive advantage to startups.\nIn 2015, India\u2019s largest consumer goods producer, Hindustan Unilever Limited, decided to partner with startups. The reason they did so might surprise you. They did it to regain agility. The move helped the company imbibe agility and the adaptive mentality with which startups are known to function.\nStartups can have a number of teething issues. Besides that, they constantly face challenges, to which, they need to find solutions. Change is inevitable and hence, it is most important for startups to remain adaptive and agile in order to progress.\nStartups can ensure agility within the organisation by practising the following:\nContinuous learning\nHaving a fluid workforce\nResearch and development\nBe willing to let your ideas change\n7)\u00a0Business model failure\nA good product, an impressive website, and huge ad spends- a number of entrepreneurs assume that these factors are going to be enough to attract customers and business. They ignore the fact that customer acquisition and customer retention come at high costs and the startup needs a foolproof business model to sustain and profit.\nHere are two questions where entrepreneurs can begin in order to build a suitable business model:\nDoes your startup have a scalable way to acquire customers? Can you find one?\nCan you monetise those customers once acquired? Will the revenue from that customer outdo the cost of acquisition of that customer?\nArticles you may like:\n17 innovative business advertising ideas in shoestring budget\n7 ways to find the right startup mentor who can help you scale\n8) Lack of talent & competency\nSurprising, but 23%\u00a0of startups fail due to lack of talent and skill. It is one of the most easily solvable issues, one would assume. However, it is not. The reasons?\n1) Startups spend a lot of time and effort in recruiting the right candidates. In situations of bad hiring choices, startups may face the challenge of replacing the hire with a better candidate.\n2) Most times startups are cash strapped and cannot afford to hire experts or experienced employees who come at a high price.\nRelated: How to hire employees during your initial startup days\nWhat could startups do to tackle this issue?\nPlan their hiring processes with utmost care.\nCreate alternative working methods such as work on freelance-basis or on a project basis model with expert professionals.\nMake hiring processes stricter and intense by giving the candidates a real issue to solve.\n9) Ignoring customers\nQuite often startup founders have too much to handle \u2013 funding, recruitments, overall management of the organisation, and more. Customers may not even feature in their to-do lists. This is a big problem, which entrepreneurs fail to realise and can very well be the reason why startups fail.\nWhen startups are committed to being customer-centric, their decision-making becomes easy, their focus gets narrowed down and their popularity increases from word of mouth \u2013 as explained in an article in the Harvard Business Review. Moreover, customers know what they want and can help startups better their products and services.\nHere\u2019s what to do:\nDo not ignore customers.\nAddress customer queries, concerns, and feedback.\nAddressing your startup\u2019s drawbacks and challenges will only help you on the path to growth.

You see a lot of startups trying to ape the marketing strategy of other startups.\nIndia Startups are doing a damn bad job of copying models of startups of other countries.\nQuoting from an article \u201cSince 2015, as many as 1,503 startups have closed down in India. And the major reason is due to the replication of Western business models, and not lack of subsequent funding from the investors,\u201d says Rishabh Lawania, founder of Xeler8, a market intelligence platform recently acquired by a Chinese venture capital firm.\u201d\nThat sums up my analysis in one quote :).\nMoney Troubles:\nsad-businessman-with-no-money \u2013 why-startups-fail\nRule No.1: Never lose money.\nRule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.\u201d \u2013 Warren Buffet\nYou are bound to have money troubles if you:\nDo not plan your business finances in a planned way.\nMix your personal finances with business money.\nYou pay your office expenses with personal money and vice versa.\nYou Spend like a King on unnecessary stuff.

All you will have is a copy of invoices from ad agencies and salary slips of employees who worked to fulfill your dream.\nAnd you won\u2019t be able to sell any one of them to make something of your bad decisions.\nLose money to clients by not getting paid on time or bad project delivery.\nA lack of Money will put your startup in an ICU.\nYou will not have money to pay your staff. You will not have money to pay the rent. And none of the two entities likes to wait. We worked in government for a good 3 years without realizing how much the government can choke fund flow.\nThe salaries were delayed.\nOffice rent was never paid on time. We, the so-called bosses never got paid for a good amount of time.\nWhy did we work for 3 years despite such a scenario?\nWell. The thought of getting the \u201cbig payment\u201d was too much of a temptation for young entrepreneurs like us to resist.\u00a0By the time \u201cthe big payment\u201d came, we had paid a fortune from our pocket.\nWe lost some good employees who left us because of a delay in salaries. Our office owner almost threw us out for reasons known to you by now.\nAnd we had vendors who refused to supply drinking water, and coffee to the office any further.\nOne fine day we decided to stop working with the government directly.\n8 out of 10 times they fail miserably.\nEase of Doing Business:\nEase-of-Doing-Business \u2013 why-startups-fail\nBefore you point to India\u2019s current rank \u2013 77 in the ease of doing business (source: livemint ), here is what you must know -a jump of 14 places means nothing for a country that aspires to be one of the best countries in the world.\nWe still struggle with simple things like bad infrastructure, red-tapism, abrupt tax decisions, etc.\nLet me elaborate to you on why India is not an easy place to do business (one by one):\nRed-Tapism in India:\nYou will not understand the word if you are not from our part of the world but red-tapism has significantly helped businesses close.\nRed-Tapism here refers to \u201cour slow bureaucracy process\u201d where files move slower than tortoise and corruption move faster than a hare.\nPlease do not relate the above example to slow and steady wins the race because, in India, the slow processes kill startups and Businesses.\nBad Infrastructure\nI know there will be swords out for my throat when I write this but how many of you can claim to get a pot-free road to your office or 24 x 7 electricity in your office (Delhi-ites, please do not pick up your hands. You are the envy of the nation. I am talking about the mango man of the country).\nCorruption\nOur system is corrupt from top to bottom and it\u2019s not that we do not indulge in it. I mean, as a startup or a small business owner why would I want my work to slow down?.\nSo, I happily pay bribes here and there to keep the wheel moving.\nWhy have all the trouble when a little profit from your company can help you cut corners? \ud83d\ude42\nMarket Not Ready for Innovation\nMarket \u2013 why-startup-fails\nMost startups are trying to change the way businesses are done.\nThey are innovative and disruptive.\u00a0The aim is to change things for good.\nBut is the market ready for the change?\nI worked as a consultant for a Job portal for small cities.\u00a0My job was to build a business plan and guide the marketing team.\nThe product \u201cA web-based Job portal\u201d worked on a unique business model.\nThey sold memberships of a job portal in tier 2 cities to job seekers.\nOur employees were too intimate job seekers before anyone knew about the job posted on the website.\nWe mixed online with offline to create a product that was high maintenance with low returns.\nSo our online mode failed, as the market was too dependent on the offline medium.\nOur offline medium failed, as we charged peanuts for providing a time-consuming service.\nThe whole \u201cInnovation\u201d backfired.\nThe venture failed despite high investment from the founders.\nThe above-listed reasons were India specific, however \u2013 there are other common reasons that lead to the failure of startups.\nI am writing to them to help you avoid the pitfalls while building your startup.\nOther common reasons for the failure of startups:\nLack of Ownership:\nWe started ArrangeMyParty with a lot of hope.\u00a0The plan was to connect party planners with party seekers on the\u00a0internet.\nThe concept of the internet marketplace was just catching up in the\u00a0country.\nIt was a virgin market waiting to be tapped.\u00a0At least, that is what we thought.\nWe were the pioneers \u2013 the early starters.\nWe hired a new team, renovated an existing office of one of the founders and spent a good amount of money on the website.\nWe launched the startup with a lot of enthusiasm and energy.\u00a0Only to see the startup shut shop within a few months of launch.\nWhy did AMP (Arrange My Party) fail?\nIt took me years to figure out the reason for the failure of the venture.\nIt wasn\u2019t money or bad idea which failed the venture.\u00a0The Lack of ownership led to the slow death of AMP (as we referred to Arrange My Party).\nAll the founders of the company had their own established businesses.\nAt the end of the\u00a0day, the new venture never had a full-time owner.\nIt was an orphaned kid, who went for adoption from time to time to different owners. Since no one knew who was the real owner, the staff had a gala time working on the project.\nThey partied in the office. They Played cricket and had the time of their life!\nThey also refused to make sales citing a lack of market demand as a reason for no sales.\nThe venture died a slow death within a few months of launch.\nI recently faced the same issue with another startup Pinksis started by someone close to me.\nThe original owners were to be the main stakeholders of this venture. I was to consult them.\nWithin 2 months of launch, the venture was a headless chicken.\nWe had to close the firm.\nThe Unplanned Approach:\nOur initial ventures were without any plan.\nWe relied a lot on our hard work and instincts to take the business to the next level.\nWe had no idea on how to set targets for the business and teams.\nWe forgot the basic fundamental of life \u201cFailing to Plan is Planning to Fail\u201d.\nOne fine day, I would walk into the office and declare \u201cWe plan to touch X amount of top line in the next 6 months\u201d.\nThe next day our HR started hiring the marketing team to help us meet X amount.\nWe did all the stupidity with no regard for the basic fundamental of a business called \u201cPlanning\u201d.\nNo wonder, we kept failing.\nI was busy with marketing. The partner did the techie stuff and business ran on auto-pilot destruction mode.\nIt took us a good year to figure out what was wrong.\nToday, I make it a point to keep up some spreadsheets with targets for everything in the company. For Project Management, we are streamlined using teamwork to run our operations\nI know you will find it foolish on how a business can run in such an unplanned way.\nWell! \u2013 I have worked with founders who have no idea on how to make plans.\nThey are just one step away from imploding.\nA decision I do not regret to date.\nBad Customer Service:\nWhen we forget we are there because of customers. They are not there because of us.\nWe start digging our own grave.\nArrogance leads to us getting blinded to customer\u2019s woes and bad service does not need any publicity.\nStaff Dissatisfaction:\nThe day your trusted lieutenants decide to march against you is the day your army loses.\nHave you heard of industries getting closed because of strikes?\nTrust me it is one of a known reason for the closure of businesses in the manufacturing sector.\nPartner Troubles:\nWhen the partner is at each other\u2019s throats for every disagreement, you know the new business/startup is just around the corner from the shutting shop.\nThis is why you should understand the advantages and disadvantages of a partnership business before deciding to partner with someone.\nComfort Zone Issues:\nNokia was the market leader living in its own comfort zone. They had their own OS which they did not evolve with the market.\nWhen the market shifted to Android, they stuck to their good old OS and bad old handsets.\nI don\u2019t have to write further on what happened to their success story.\nThe bottom line is Entrepreneurs and startups cannot afford to be in their comfort zone.\nThey always have to think ahead of their competition and market.\nPoor Marketing:\nThe best of products suck when marketed improperly.\nWhile the worst of products sell when they are packaged smartly and sold efficiently.\nSuch is the magic of good marketing.\nBusinesses fail when they forget marketing is an important part of the business.\nThere are so many articles out there talking about why do startups fail in India.
