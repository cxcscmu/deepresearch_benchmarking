# Report on the Percentage of Women Who Identify as Pro-Choice in the United States

## Introduction

The topic of abortion remains one of the most polarizing and politically significant issues in the United States. Public opinion on abortion, especially the self-identification as "pro-choice" or "pro-life," has been extensively studied through various polls and surveys. This report focuses specifically on the percentage of women who identify as pro-choice, examining recent and reliable data sources to provide a comprehensive and detailed understanding of this demographic's stance on abortion rights. The report also contextualizes these findings within broader trends and demographic variations.

## Overview of Pro-Choice Identification Among Women

Recent polling data consistently show that a majority of women in the United States identify as pro-choice, indicating support for a woman's right to choose whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy. This trend has been particularly pronounced since the leak and subsequent Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case, which overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.

### Key Findings on Women's Pro-Choice Identification

- **Gallup Poll (2024):** Gallup's May 2024 survey found that 54% of Americans identified as pro-choice overall, with a notable increase among women. Specifically, pro-choice identification among women rose by nine percentage points to 61% compared to previous years ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx)).

- **Demographic Breakdown:** The increase in pro-choice identification among women was part of a broader shift driven largely by Democrats, younger adults, and women. For instance, 88% of Democrats identified as pro-choice, up from 70% the previous year, and 61% of women identified as pro-choice, up from 52% in earlier polls ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx)).

- **Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) 2024 Women’s Health Survey:** This nationally representative survey of 3,901 women aged 18 to 49 found that three in four reproductive-age women (74%) believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Moreover, 70% support a nationwide right to abortion, and 64% oppose a nationwide abortion ban at 15 weeks ([KFF, 2024](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortion-experiences-knowledge-attitudes-among-u-s-women-2024-womens-health-survey/)).

- **YouGov and Other Polls:** Various YouGov polls conducted around 2022 and later have also reflected strong pro-choice sentiment among women, particularly younger women and Democrats, reinforcing the trend seen in Gallup and KFF data ([YouGov, 2022](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/42810-abortion-summary-polling)).

### Historical Context and Trends

- **Historical Fluctuations:** Gallup's long-term data show that pro-choice identification among Americans, including women, has fluctuated over the past three decades. In 1995, 56% identified as pro-choice, a figure similar to recent years. However, there were periods, such as 2009-2013 and 2019, when more respondents identified as pro-life than pro-choice ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx)).

- **Impact of Dobbs Decision:** The leak of the Dobbs decision draft in May 2022 and the eventual overturning of Roe v. Wade have been pivotal in shifting public opinion. The perceived threat to abortion rights galvanized many women, especially Democrats and younger cohorts, to identify more strongly as pro-choice ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx)).

- **Moral Acceptability:** For the first time since Gallup began tracking in 2001, a majority of Americans (52%) consider abortion morally acceptable, with women more likely than men to hold this view. This moral acceptance correlates with the increase in pro-choice identification ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx)).

## Detailed Analysis of Women's Pro-Choice Identification

### Political and Demographic Influences

- **Partisanship:** Political affiliation is a strong predictor of abortion views. Among women, Democrats overwhelmingly identify as pro-choice (88%), while Republican women show lower but still significant pro-choice identification. Independents fall in between these groups ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx)).

- **Age:** Younger women (ages 18-34) are more likely to identify as pro-choice (67%) compared to older women. This age group has shown the largest increase in pro-choice identification in recent years ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/393104/pro-choice-identification-rises-near-record-high.aspx)).

- **Race and Ethnicity:** The KFF survey highlighted that larger shares of Black (21%) and Hispanic (19%) women report having had an abortion compared to White women (11%), suggesting nuanced perspectives on abortion within different racial and ethnic groups ([KFF, 2024](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortion-experiences-knowledge-attitudes-among-u-s-women-2024-womens-health-survey/)).

### Satisfaction with Abortion Laws and Access

- Despite the majority identifying as pro-choice, only 25% of Americans overall are somewhat satisfied with abortion laws, with many women expressing dissatisfaction and a desire for less restrictive policies ([Forbes, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/08/20/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-dnc-gets-underway/)).

- In states with abortion bans, 67% of women want the procedure to be at least mostly legal, indicating strong support for abortion rights even in more restrictive environments ([Forbes, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/08/20/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-dnc-gets-underway/)).

- Awareness and knowledge about abortion laws vary, with about a third of women uncertain about the status of abortion legality in their state, which may impact their identification and opinions ([KFF, 2024](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortion-experiences-knowledge-attitudes-among-u-s-women-2024-womens-health-survey/)).

### Abortion as a Voting Issue

- Abortion remains a highly motivating issue for women voters. A record-high 32% of voters in May 2024 stated they would only vote for candidates who share their abortion position, with women, Democrats, and younger voters particularly motivated by abortion rights ([Forbes, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/08/20/how-americans-really-feel-about-abortion-the-sometimes-surprising-poll-results-as-dnc-gets-underway/)).

- This political mobilization underscores the significance of abortion as a core issue for many women, reinforcing the importance of pro-choice identification in electoral contexts.

## Opinion and Interpretation

Based on the comprehensive data reviewed, it is evident that a clear majority of women in the United States identify as pro-choice, with recent figures indicating approximately 61% of women self-identify as such. This majority is consistent across various reputable polls and surveys, including Gallup and KFF, and reflects a significant shift in public opinion catalyzed by the Dobbs decision and ongoing political debates.

The trend toward pro-choice identification among women is particularly strong among younger women and Democrats, though substantial support exists across other demographic groups as well. The data also reveal that while many women support abortion rights, there remains a notable level of dissatisfaction with current abortion laws, especially in states with restrictive policies.

This pro-choice majority among women is not only a reflection of personal beliefs about abortion but also a significant political force influencing voting behavior and policy debates. The alignment of pro-choice identification with moral acceptance of abortion further solidifies this stance as a mainstream position among women in the U.S.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the percentage of women who identify as pro-choice in the United States is approximately 61%, according to the most recent and reliable polling data from 2024. This majority has grown in the wake of the Dobbs decision and is driven by political, generational, and demographic factors. Women's pro-choice identification is a critical component of the national conversation on abortion rights and continues to shape political dynamics and policy discussions.
