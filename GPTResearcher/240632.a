# Report on the Shortage of School Bus Drivers in the United States

## Introduction

The shortage of school bus drivers in the United States has become a critical issue affecting the education system, student attendance, and family dynamics. Despite the essential role school bus drivers play in safely transporting millions of children to and from school, the profession faces persistent and severe shortages nationwide. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the causes behind the shortage, supported by recent data and expert insights, and offers an informed perspective on the underlying factors and potential remedies.

## Scope and Significance of the Shortage

As of September 2024, school bus driver employment remains approximately 12.2% lower than pre-pandemic levels in September 2019, with about 192,400 drivers on the road compared to higher numbers before the COVID-19 pandemic ([Economic Policy Institute, 2024](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-school-bus-driver-shortage-remains-severe-and-bus-driver-pay-is-getting-worse/)). This shortage is not localized but widespread, affecting every state and various school districts, from large urban centers like Chicago and New York City to rural areas ([USA Today, 2023](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/08/15/school-bus-driver-shortage-2023/70516560007/); [ABC News, 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-districts-nationwide-facing-bus-driver-shortages/story?id=79124876)).

Approximately half of U.S. schoolchildren rely on bus transportation, making the shortage a significant barrier to regular school attendance and participation in extracurricular activities. Disruptions in bus services have led to route consolidations, delayed pick-ups and drop-offs, and even temporary school closures in extreme cases ([Economic Policy Institute, 2023](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-school-bus-driver-shortage-remains-severe-without-job-quality-improvements-workers-children-and-parents-will-suffer/); [HopSkipDrive, 2024](https://www.hopskipdrive.com/blog/key-findings-2024-state-of-school-transportation-report/)).

## Primary Causes of the School Bus Driver Shortage

### 1. Low Compensation and Economic Disincentives

The most consistently cited and data-supported cause of the shortage is low pay. In 2023, the median weekly earnings of school bus drivers were 43% lower than the median weekly wage for all U.S. workers. While the typical school bus driver earned about $20.00 per hour in 2022, this was 16.8% less than the median wage for all workers ($24.04). More importantly, the average public school bus driver works only about 32 hours per week due to split-shift schedules, resulting in significantly lower weekly income compared to full-time workers ([Economic Policy Institute, 2024](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-school-bus-driver-shortage-remains-severe-and-bus-driver-pay-is-getting-worse/); [NEA, 2023](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-bus-driver-shortage-persists)).

Wage growth for school bus drivers has lagged behind that of other workers. Between 2019 and 2022, while hourly wages for all workers increased by 5.7%, school bus drivers saw only a 4.9% increase. Weekly wages for bus drivers actually declined by 1.8% during this period, indicating that drivers are earning less overall despite nominal hourly wage increases ([Economic Policy Institute, 2023](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-school-bus-driver-shortage-remains-severe-without-job-quality-improvements-workers-children-and-parents-will-suffer/)).

The low pay contributes to poverty among bus drivers, with 7.8% living below the poverty line in 2021, a rate higher than private-sector (5.6%) and public-sector (3.4%) workers ([NEA, 2023](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-bus-driver-shortage-persists)).

### 2. Work Schedule and Job Quality Challenges

School bus drivers typically work split shifts that coincide with the beginning and end of the school day, often amounting to only a few hours of work in the morning and afternoon with a long unpaid break in between. This schedule is increasingly unattractive to workers who prefer more continuous or full-time employment. The split-shift nature also limits earning potential and complicates work-life balance ([NPR, 2023](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/25/1195858259/why-are-so-many-school-districts-struggling-to-find-good-bus-drivers?)).

Additionally, school bus drivers face stressful working conditions, including managing large groups of children (sometimes up to 72 kids per bus), handling confrontations with students and parents, and dealing with unsafe driving behaviors from other motorists. These challenges contribute to job dissatisfaction and high turnover ([NEA, 2023](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-bus-driver-shortage-persists)).

### 3. Aging Workforce and Health Concerns

The school bus driver workforce is significantly older than the average worker population. In 2021, 72.6% of state and local government school bus drivers were aged 50 or older, compared to 37.5% of state and local government employees overall. This demographic skew made the workforce particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, leading to increased retirements and reluctance to return to work during and after the pandemic ([NEA, 2023](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-bus-driver-shortage-persists)).

The pandemic exacerbated the shortage by halting recruitment and hiring for several years, creating a backlog of unfilled positions. Even as health risks have lessened, the aging workforce and pandemic-related attrition continue to impact driver availability ([NPR, 2023](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/25/1195858259/why-are-so-many-school-districts-struggling-to-find-good-bus-drivers?)).

### 4. Licensing, Training, and Language Barriers

Obtaining a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) with school bus endorsements involves a lengthy and sometimes costly process. The National Association for Pupil Transportation (NAPT) survey found that the average hiring process takes 16 days, with some regions averaging over 20 days. Barriers such as the length of time to secure a CDL and the availability of training and benefits were cited as significant recruitment challenges ([NAPT, 2021](https://www.napt.org/blog_home.asp?display=53)).

Moreover, testing and training are often offered only in English, which limits the pool of potential drivers who are non-native English speakers but otherwise qualified. Districts that could provide testing in other languages, such as Spanish, might attract more diverse candidates ([NEA, 2023](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-bus-driver-shortage-persists)).

### 5. Impact of Privatization and Contracting Out Services

More than one-third of school districts contract out bus services to private companies. While privatization is often pursued as a cost-saving measure, it can lead to reduced service quality and driver retention problems. Private companies may offer lower wages and fewer benefits, exacerbating the shortage and turnover issues ([NEA, 2023](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/school-bus-driver-shortage-persists)).

### 6. Increased Demands and Responsibilities

School bus drivers today are expected to handle more complex responsibilities, including transporting students with special needs, managing individualized education plans, and navigating longer and more complex routes due to fewer drivers available. These additional demands increase the stress and skill requirements of the job, potentially deterring candidates ([School Bus Fleet, 2025](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10233601/2025-trend-to-watch)).

## Consequences of the Shortage

The shortage has led to significant disruptions in student transportation, including:

- Consolidation of routes and elimination of some bus routes, forcing students to walk longer distances or rely on parents for transportation ([The Epoch Times, 2025](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/a-shortage-of-bus-drivers-has-schools-scrambling-to-find-alternatives-5778632)).

- Increased absenteeism and missed instructional time due to unreliable or unavailable bus services ([HopSkipDrive, 2024](https://www.hopskipdrive.com/blog/key-findings-2024-state-of-school-transportation-report/)).

- Added stress and logistical burdens on families, with 41% of parents reporting that their children’s school district had reduced or eliminated bus services, forcing them to become de facto chauffeurs. Over half of parents admitted that this negatively affected their careers ([HopSkipDrive, 2024](https://www.hopskipdrive.com/blog/key-findings-2024-state-of-school-transportation-report/)).

- Some districts resorting to emergency measures such as using ride-sharing services, school staff as substitute drivers, or private cab companies to fill gaps ([The Epoch Times, 2025](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/a-shortage-of-bus-drivers-has-schools-scrambling-to-find-alternatives-5778632)).

## Potential Solutions and Outlook

Some school districts have successfully mitigated the shortage by implementing aggressive hiring, recruiting, and retention strategies, including offering competitive pay, improving work environments, and providing professional development opportunities ([School Bus Fleet, 2025](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10233601/2025-trend-to-watch)).

Legislative efforts, such as the bipartisan "Driving Forward Act," aim to reduce licensing barriers by eliminating mandatory under-the-hood testing for new school bus drivers, potentially easing entry into the profession ([Arizona Central, 2025](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2025/04/11/mark-kelly-wants-easier-school-bus-driver-licensing/83018181007/)).

However, without addressing the core issue of low pay and improving job quality, these measures may only provide limited relief. The Economic Policy Institute emphasizes that the shortage is a symptom of long-term underinvestment in public school transportation and calls for substantial wage increases and better working conditions to attract and retain drivers ([Economic Policy Institute, 2024](https://www.epi.org/blog/the-school-bus-driver-shortage-remains-severe-and-bus-driver-pay-is-getting-worse/)).

## Conclusion

The shortage of school bus drivers in the United States is a multifaceted problem rooted primarily in low compensation, challenging work schedules, an aging workforce, and regulatory barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues by disrupting recruitment and accelerating retirements. The shortage has significant negative impacts on student attendance, family logistics, and educational equity.

Addressing this crisis requires a comprehensive approach that prioritizes improving pay and job quality, streamlining licensing processes, offering multilingual training and testing, and investing in the public school transportation workforce. Without such measures, the shortage is likely to persist, continuing to disrupt the education system and burden families.
