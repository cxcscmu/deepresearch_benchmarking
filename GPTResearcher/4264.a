# Does Personality Change Over Time? A Comprehensive Review

Personality has long been considered a relatively stable set of psychological traits that define an individual's characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. However, contemporary research over the past few decades has challenged the traditional view of personality as fixed, revealing that personality traits can and do change throughout the lifespan. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based examination of whether personality changes over time, focusing on empirical findings, theoretical perspectives, and the implications of personality change across adulthood and older age.

## 1. Introduction to Personality Stability and Change

Historically, personality traits were believed to be largely stable after early adulthood, with minimal change unless disrupted by major neurological events such as dementia or brain injury (Roberts & Jackson, 2008). This perspective was dominant until longitudinal research began to demonstrate that personality traits exhibit both stability and systematic change over the lifespan. The Big Five personality traits—Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness—serve as the primary framework for understanding personality development.

Recent meta-analyses and longitudinal studies have provided nuanced insights into the patterns and mechanisms of personality change, emphasizing that while rank-order stability (the relative ordering of individuals on traits) is high, mean-level changes (average changes in traits across the population) do occur and are meaningful (Hudson et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2006).

## 2. Empirical Evidence of Personality Change Across the Lifespan

### 2.1 Rank-Order Stability

Rank-order stability refers to the consistency of an individual's relative position on a trait compared to others over time. Meta-analytic evidence indicates that rank-order stability increases from childhood through early adulthood and plateaus around age 25, remaining moderately high thereafter (Hudson et al., 2022). Test-retest correlations for the Big Five traits across adulthood typically range from 0.54 to 0.70 over short intervals and decline over longer intervals but remain significant even over decades (Damian et al., 2018; Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000).

### 2.2 Mean-Level Change

Mean-level change reflects average increases or decreases in trait scores across the population with age. Research consistently shows:

- **Neuroticism (N):** Tends to decrease gradually from young adulthood through old age, indicating reduced emotional instability and anxiety over time (Roberts et al., 2006; Terracciano et al., 2005).
- **Agreeableness (A) and Conscientiousness (C):** Generally increase with age, especially in young adulthood and middle age, reflecting maturation and social adaptation (Roberts et al., 2006; Soto et al., 2011).
- **Extraversion (E) and Openness (O):** Show more complex trajectories; Extraversion may decline slightly in old age, while Openness tends to increase in adolescence and young adulthood but decline in later years (Roberts et al., 2006; Soto et al., 2011).

These patterns have been replicated across multiple cultures, suggesting some universal aspects of personality development, though cultural differences in the magnitude and timing of changes exist (Terracciano et al., 2005; Specht et al., 2011).

## 3. Mechanisms and Predictors of Personality Change

### 3.1 Social Role Investment and Life Events

Personality change is often linked to the adoption of social roles and life transitions. The Social Investment Principle posits that investing in roles such as marriage, parenthood, and career leads to personality maturation, typically characterized by increases in Conscientiousness and Agreeableness and decreases in Neuroticism (Roberts et al., 2006; Specht et al., 2011). However, empirical support is mixed, with some studies finding strong effects of life events on personality change, while others report little or no change linked to these events (Specht et al., 2011).

### 3.2 Biological and Genetic Influences

Genetic factors contribute not only to baseline personality traits but also to their stability and change over time. Twin studies reveal that genes influence both the expression and temporal stability of personality traits, with environmental factors modulating these effects (Hopwood et al., 2013; Eaton et al., 2012).

### 3.3 Psychological and Environmental Factors

Psychological mechanisms such as self-reflection, deliberate practice, and therapy can facilitate intentional personality change (Psychology Today, 2025). Environmental contexts, including cultural norms and social expectations, also shape personality trajectories, as evidenced by cross-cultural differences in trait development and stability (Terracciano et al., 2005; Specht et al., 2011).

## 4. Personality Change as a Predictor and Outcome of Health

Personality change is not only a developmental phenomenon but also a predictor of health outcomes. Increases in Neuroticism have been associated with worse cognitive performance and mental health in older adults, while changes in Conscientiousness predict physical health and mortality risk (Roberts et al., 2015). Understanding personality change pathways is crucial for interventions aimed at promoting successful aging and well-being (Terracciano et al., 2019).

---

## 5. Intentional Personality Change

Contrary to the belief that personality is immutable, recent research suggests that individuals can intentionally change certain traits through consistent effort and interventions such as psychotherapy or behavioral exercises. For example, increasing social engagement can enhance Extraversion, and mindfulness or cognitive-behavioral therapy can reduce Neuroticism (Psychology Today, 2025). However, such changes typically require sustained commitment and are more feasible for some traits than others.

---

## 6. Cross-Cultural Perspectives

Cross-cultural studies indicate that while the general patterns of personality change are similar across cultures, the extent and timing of changes vary. For instance, Japanese adults exhibit greater fluctuations in trait levels over time compared to Americans, reflecting cultural differences in social roles and expectations (Specht et al., 2017). These findings highlight the importance of cultural context in personality development research.

## 7. Summary and Conclusion

The preponderance of evidence from large-scale longitudinal studies, meta-analyses, and cross-cultural research demonstrates that personality traits do change over time, albeit gradually and variably across individuals and traits. Rank-order stability is generally high, indicating that individuals tend to maintain their relative standing on traits, but mean-level changes reflect normative developmental trends such as increased maturity and emotional stability with age.

Personality change is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors. Life events and social role investments can accelerate or shape personality development, though individual differences in responsiveness exist. Moreover, personality change has important implications for health and well-being, making it a critical area for psychological and gerontological research.

Importantly, personality is not fixed; intentional change is possible, particularly through sustained effort and intervention. This opens avenues for promoting successful aging and psychological resilience.

In conclusion, personality is both stable and dynamic. It evolves across the lifespan in response to internal and external influences, reflecting the adaptive nature of human development.
