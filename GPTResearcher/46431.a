# Report: Why Some Groups Tend to Be Underrepresented in Congress

## Introduction

The underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in the United States Congress remains a significant issue that affects the inclusivity and responsiveness of the legislative body. Despite gradual improvements in diversity, many groups—particularly racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals—continue to be underrepresented relative to their proportions in the general population. This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind this underrepresentation, drawing on recent research and data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural, systemic, and sociopolitical factors that contribute to this persistent disparity.

## Overview of Underrepresentation in Congress

As of the 116th Congress, nonwhite racial and ethnic groups accounted for 22% of members, a significant increase from just 1% in the 79th Congress (1945-46), yet still falling short of the 39% share these groups represent in the national population ([Congress That Works, 2020](https://congressthatworks.com/diversity-in-congress-by-the-numbers-why-it-matters/)). Women, who make up 51% of the U.S. population, represented only 24% of Congress in 2018, illustrating a substantial gender gap ([Common Cause Illinois, n.d.](https://www.commoncause.org/illinois/articles/part-three-underrepresentation-in-congress-what-are-the-consequences/)). LGBTQ+ representation, while growing, remains limited, with research indicating that even a small number of openly gay legislators can significantly influence legislative priorities ([Common Cause Illinois, n.d.](https://www.commoncause.org/illinois/articles/part-three-underrepresentation-in-congress-what-are-the-consequences/)).

## Structural and Systemic Barriers

### Historical and Institutional Racism

A foundational cause of underrepresentation is the legacy of structural, systemic, and institutional racism that has historically disadvantaged minoritized groups. Laws and policies such as the Black Codes, discriminatory housing practices like redlining, and exclusionary labor laws have created long-lasting barriers to wealth accumulation, education, and political participation for Black, Indigenous, Latino, and other minoritized communities ([NCBI Bookshelf, 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK593028/)). These systemic inequities have limited access to the resources and networks necessary for political candidacy and success.

### Economic Disparities and Campaign Finance

Economic inequality, deeply intertwined with racial disparities, affects the ability of minority candidates to compete in elections. Research shows that Black and Latino individuals contribute less to campaign finance relative to their population shares, partly due to wealth gaps and economic barriers ([American Political Science Review, 2023](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/race-and-representation-in-campaign-finance/D954D2B6ACC3CCF36E15D241365365FF)). Although the presence of minority candidates can mobilize coethnic donors and increase minority contributions, overall fundraising disparities persist, limiting the competitiveness of minority candidates.

### Gender-Specific Obstacles

Women face unique challenges in political representation. Surveys indicate that a majority of Americans perceive that women must prove themselves more than men to succeed in politics (54%), and nearly half cite gender discrimination and lack of support from party leaders as major obstacles ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/09/27/views-of-obstacles-for-women-seeking-high-political-office/)). Additionally, family responsibilities and sexual harassment are significant deterrents for women considering political careers. These factors contribute to the slower growth of female representation in Congress compared to men.

### Party Polarization and Political Culture

Political party dynamics also influence representation. The increasing polarization of parties has discouraged moderate candidates, including women and minorities, from running, particularly within the Republican Party ([Protect Democracy, n.d.](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/women-and-minorities-in-american-political-parties/)). While Democratic women and minorities have seen gains, Republican women remain underrepresented, partly due to traditional gender norms and resistance to identity politics within the party.

## Social and Cultural Factors

### Discrimination and Intersectionality

Discrimination based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and other intersecting identities affects political participation and candidacy. Studies highlight that individuals from minoritized groups often face compounded discrimination, influencing their political engagement and opportunities ([PMC, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6741774/)). For example, Black women experience both racial and gender biases, which can deter political aspirations and voter support.

### Voter Behavior and Bias

Public perceptions and biases also play a role. A significant portion of Americans believe voters are less likely to support women, especially women of color, for high political office ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/09/27/views-of-obstacles-for-women-seeking-high-political-office/)). This voter bias creates an additional hurdle for minority candidates, affecting their electability and discouraging potential candidates from running.

## Consequences of Underrepresentation

The underrepresentation of minority groups in Congress has tangible consequences for policymaking. When Congress does not reflect the diversity of the population, issues critical to marginalized communities—such as discrimination, healthcare disparities, economic inequality, and LGBTQ+ rights—may receive insufficient attention or be overlooked entirely ([Common Cause Illinois, n.d.](https://www.commoncause.org/illinois/articles/part-three-underrepresentation-in-congress-what-are-the-consequences/)). Research shows that the presence of minority legislators can shift legislative priorities and foster more inclusive policies.

## Efforts and Recommendations to Address Underrepresentation

### Increasing Candidate Diversity

Supporting minority and female candidates through recruitment, funding, and mentorship programs is crucial. Political action committees like Emily’s List for Democratic women and similar efforts for Republican women have helped increase female representation, though partisan differences remain ([Protect Democracy, n.d.](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/women-and-minorities-in-american-political-parties/)).

### Structural Reforms

Reforming campaign finance to reduce economic barriers, combating voter suppression, and addressing systemic racism in political institutions are necessary steps. The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress has proposed measures to diversify congressional staff and improve retention, which can create a more inclusive political environment ([Congress That Works, 2020](https://congressthatworks.com/diversity-in-congress-by-the-numbers-why-it-matters/)).

### Addressing Societal Bias

Public education and cultural change to reduce gender and racial biases among voters can improve the electoral prospects of minority candidates. Encouraging intersectional approaches to understanding discrimination can also help tailor strategies to support underrepresented groups effectively ([PMC, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6741774/)).

## Conclusion

The underrepresentation of certain groups in the U.S. Congress is a complex issue rooted in historical, structural, economic, social, and cultural factors. Structural racism and economic disparities create significant barriers to political participation and candidacy for racial and ethnic minorities. Gender-specific challenges and party dynamics further complicate the landscape for women and LGBTQ+ individuals. Addressing these issues requires comprehensive reforms in political institutions, campaign finance, party recruitment, and societal attitudes. Increasing diversity in Congress is essential not only for fairness but also for ensuring that the legislative body effectively represents and addresses the needs of all Americans.
