# How Has Racism Changed? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Racism, a deeply entrenched social issue, has evolved significantly over centuries, adapting to changing social, political, and cultural contexts. From overt and legally sanctioned discrimination to more covert and systemic forms, the nature of racism has transformed, reflecting broader societal shifts. This report examines the historical trajectory of racism, its modern manifestations, and the ongoing challenges in addressing racial inequality, drawing on a diverse range of scholarly and empirical sources. The analysis prioritizes recent and reliable research to provide an in-depth, objective understanding of how racism has changed.

## Historical Context of Racism

Racism in the United States and many other parts of the world has roots extending back to colonial times. Initially, racial hierarchies were constructed to justify slavery and economic exploitation, particularly of Black people. The concept of race emerged as a tool to create a social order that placed white Europeans at the top and Black people at the bottom, legitimizing slavery through pseudoscience and religious doctrine (The Global Humanitarian, n.d.).

Following the abolition of slavery in the 19th century, racism did not disappear but morphed into new forms, such as segregation and discriminatory laws during the Jim Crow era. This period enforced racial segregation in schools, public spaces, and housing, perpetuating racial subordination despite constitutional amendments aimed at ensuring equality (Cognitive Research Journal, 2021). The collapse of Reconstruction in 1876 and the withdrawal of federal troops from the South allowed states to institutionalize systemic racism through Jim Crow laws, which maintained racial inequalities for decades.

## Evolution of Racism: From Overt to Covert

### Overt Racism

Historically, racism was explicit and overt, characterized by openly racist laws, policies, and social norms. Examples include legalized segregation, disenfranchisement, and racial violence. These forms of racism were visible and widely accepted in many societies, particularly in the United States before the Civil Rights Movement.

### Covert and Systemic Racism

Post-Civil Rights era, overt racism became socially unacceptable and legally prohibited. However, racism persisted in more subtle and systemic forms. Modern racism often manifests as implicit racial biases, microaggressions, and institutional discrimination embedded within societal structures such as housing, education, employment, and criminal justice systems (Pearn Kandola, 2019; Cognitive Research Journal, 2021).

Implicit racial bias, documented since the 1980s, refers to unconscious negative attitudes and stereotypes that individuals may hold without conscious awareness or intent to discriminate (Cognitive Research Journal, 2021). These biases influence behaviors and decisions, perpetuating racial disparities even among individuals who consciously reject racism.

Systemic racism operates at multiple levels: institutional policies, societal norms, individual cognition, and everyday interactions. It does not require explicit racist intent but is maintained through entrenched practices and social structures that produce unequal outcomes for racial minorities (Cognitive Research Journal, 2021).

## Modern Manifestations of Racism

### Systemic Inequalities

Systemic racism today shapes economic opportunities, political representation, and social interactions. Persistent disparities exist in employment, wealth, healthcare access, education, and criminal justice. For instance, practices like redlining have historically restricted housing opportunities for Black Americans, contributing to wealth gaps and segregated communities (The Global Humanitarian, n.d.; PMC, 2021).

Mass incarceration disproportionately affects Black and Latino populations, reflecting systemic biases in policing and sentencing. Employment discrimination continues to limit opportunities for racial minorities, reinforcing economic inequalities (The Global Humanitarian, n.d.).

### Racial Profiling and Police Brutality

Racial profiling remains a significant issue, with Black and Latino individuals disproportionately targeted by law enforcement based on stereotypes rather than behavior. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, emerging prominently after incidents like the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2013 and George Floyd in 2020, has brought renewed attention to police brutality and systemic racism in the criminal justice system (Open Access Government, 2020; PMC, 2021).

### Cultural and Social Discourse Shift

BLM protests have significantly shifted public discourse on racism, increasing awareness and discussion of terms like "systemic racism," "white privilege," and "mass incarceration." Research shows that these protests have led to sustained increases in the use of antiracist vocabulary across social media and news platforms, indicating a cultural impact beyond immediate protest events (PMC, 2021).

The movement's decentralized nature and use of social media have allowed it to mobilize followers and influence public conversations, focusing attention on individual victims of police violence and broader systemic issues (PMC, 2021).

## Challenges in Addressing Racism

### Persistence of Racial Inequality

Despite legal advances since the Civil Rights era, significant racial disparities remain. Economic, educational, and health inequalities persist, and contemporary policies often fall short of addressing the root causes of systemic racism (UC Santa Cruz News, 2025).

### Modern Racism and Its Subtlety

Modern racism is more difficult to detect and address because it often manifests in subtle, ambiguous ways. Individuals may deny racist attitudes while unconsciously perpetuating biases through actions or policy opposition framed as non-racist critiques (Pearn Kandola, 2019).

The concept of "color-blindness," or ignoring race to promote equality, can inadvertently perpetuate inequality by failing to acknowledge and address systemic disparities (Pearn Kandola, 2019).

### Psychological and Social Dynamics

Systemic racism is reinforced by cognitive and social processes that create "built-in" biases resistant to awareness and change. People often experience "blindness" to systemic racism, sometimes perceiving themselves as victims of discrimination more than marginalized groups (PMC, 2021).

Interpersonal interactions also propagate bias through nonverbal cues and social distancing, contributing to a racially biased social system even without explicit intent (PMC, 2021).

## Progress and Ongoing Debates

### Improvements and Setbacks

There have been notable improvements in racial equality since the 1960s, including political and legal gains. However, optimism about achieving full equality has declined among many Black Americans, reflecting ongoing challenges (Brookings Institution, 2020).

Educational integration and compensatory programs have had mixed results, with some gains in access but persistent gaps in outcomes (Brookings Institution, 2020).

### Debates on Equality and Reparations

Contemporary debates about racial equity often revolve around concepts of equality of opportunity versus restitution. Historical analysis shows that Black Americans and their allies have long sought economic justice through policies that challenge white privilege and create viable opportunities (UC Santa Cruz News, 2025).

The political discourse remains divided, with some advocating color-blind meritocracy and others emphasizing the need for targeted policies to address systemic inequities (UC Santa Cruz News, 2025).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Racism has fundamentally changed from overt, legally sanctioned discrimination to more covert, systemic, and psychological forms. While explicit racist acts have declined and become socially unacceptable, systemic racism persists through embedded institutional practices, implicit biases, and social interactions that maintain racial inequalities.

The evolution of racism demands a nuanced understanding that goes beyond individual attitudes to encompass structural and cognitive dimensions. Movements like Black Lives Matter have played a crucial role in shifting public discourse and raising awareness of systemic issues, but substantial work remains to translate awareness into effective policy and social change.

Addressing modern racism requires recognizing its subtlety and systemic nature, confronting implicit biases, and implementing comprehensive policies that promote genuine equality of opportunity and restitution. Without this, racial disparities will continue, undermining social cohesion and justice.
