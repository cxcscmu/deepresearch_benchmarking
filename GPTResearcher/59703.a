# The Effects of Extrinsic Motivation on Performance in Sport: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Motivation is a fundamental psychological construct influencing athletic performance. In sports, motivation is generally categorized into intrinsic motivation—engaging in an activity for inherent satisfaction—and extrinsic motivation—engaging in an activity due to external rewards or pressures. This report focuses on extrinsic motivation and its effects on sports performance, drawing from recent empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and systematic reviews. The aim is to provide an in-depth, objective analysis of how extrinsic motivation influences athletic outcomes, considering both its benefits and limitations.

## Understanding Extrinsic Motivation in Sport

Extrinsic motivation in sports arises from external factors such as financial incentives, trophies, recognition, social approval, or avoiding punishment. It contrasts with intrinsic motivation, which is driven by internal satisfaction and enjoyment of the sport itself. Extrinsic motivators are prevalent in professional sports, where athletes receive monetary rewards, media attention, and social status ([The Minded Athlete, 2025](https://themindedathlete.com/intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation/)).

Extrinsic motivation can be subdivided into controlled motivation, where behavior is pressured by external demands, and autonomous extrinsic motivation, where external incentives are internalized and aligned with personal values ([Vallerand, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1512270/full)).

## Positive Effects of Extrinsic Motivation on Sports Performance

### Immediate Performance Enhancement

Extrinsic motivation can effectively increase short-term effort and performance. External rewards such as scholarships, trophies, and financial bonuses provide tangible goals that encourage athletes to train harder and compete more intensely ([Sporting Prodigy, 2025](https://sportingprodigy.com/motivation-in-sports/extrinsic-motivation-in-sports/)). For example, rewarding attendance or performance in physical education settings has been shown to improve participation rates and reduce misbehavior ([Chen et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04524-1)).

### Fostering Healthy Competition and Goal Setting

Extrinsic motivators encourage athletes to engage in healthy competition, pushing themselves to surpass others and personal bests. This competitive drive, often stronger in extrinsically motivated athletes, can lead to higher levels of performance in competitive contexts ([The Minded Athlete, 2025](https://themindedathlete.com/intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation/); [Sporting Prodigy, 2025](https://sportingprodigy.com/motivation-in-sports/extrinsic-motivation-in-sports/)). Moreover, extrinsic motivation teaches goal-setting skills, which are transferable beyond sports into life domains ([Sporting Prodigy, 2025](https://sportingprodigy.com/motivation-in-sports/extrinsic-motivation-in-sports/)).

### Transformation into Intrinsic Motivation

Research within the framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) suggests that extrinsic motivation is not inherently detrimental. Instead, extrinsic motivation can be internalized and transformed into intrinsic motivation through processes of autonomy support and satisfaction of basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy, relatedness) ([Ryan & Deci, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04524-1); [Vallerand, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1512270/full)). This internalization process can sustain motivation and enhance long-term adherence to sport.

## Negative Effects and Limitations of Extrinsic Motivation

### Potential Undermining of Intrinsic Motivation

A longstanding debate in motivation research concerns the "undermining effect," where extrinsic rewards may reduce intrinsic motivation. Although meta-analyses have yielded mixed results, some evidence suggests that extrinsic rewards, especially when perceived as controlling, can diminish the inherent enjoyment of sport and reduce long-term engagement ([Reiss, 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2755352/); [Deci et al., 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2755352/)).

### Risk of Demotivation and Burnout

Athletes relying heavily on extrinsic motivators may experience demotivation if rewards are withdrawn or fail to meet expectations. This can lead to inconsistent performance and increased risk of burnout ([The Minded Athlete, 2025](https://themindedathlete.com/intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation/); [Exploratio Journal, 2024](https://exploratiojournal.com/psychology-in-sports-effects-of-motivation-on-athletic-performance/)).

### Ethical Concerns and Unhealthy Behaviors

Extrinsic motivation focused on external rewards can sometimes encourage unethical behavior, such as doping or cheating, as athletes strive to secure rewards or recognition at any cost ([Sporting Prodigy, 2025](https://sportingprodigy.com/motivation-in-sports/extrinsic-motivation-in-sports/)).

### Overjustification Effect

Extrinsic motivators may lose their effectiveness over time due to habituation, known as the overjustification effect. When rewards become expected rather than exceptional, motivation can decline, reducing performance sustainability ([Sporting Prodigy, 2025](https://sportingprodigy.com/motivation-in-sports/extrinsic-motivation-in-sports/)).

## Empirical Evidence on Extrinsic Motivation and Performance

### Correlation and Predictive Validity

A meta-analysis encompassing 183 studies with over 212,000 participants across school, work, and physical domains found that intrinsic motivation is a medium to strong predictor of performance (correlation coefficients ρ = .21 to .45). Importantly, intrinsic motivation's predictive validity remains even when extrinsic incentives are present, indicating that extrinsic rewards do not necessarily diminish intrinsic motivation's role in performance ([Cerasoli et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24491020/)).

### Interaction with Intrinsic Motivation

Studies on college students’ sports motivation reveal a significant positive correlation between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, suggesting that extrinsic motivation can facilitate intrinsic motivation through internalization ([Chen et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04524-1)). This supports SDT’s view that extrinsic motivation is not inherently antagonistic to intrinsic motivation but can be complementary.

### Impact on Sports Anomie Behavior

Extrinsic motivation alone may increase the risk of sports anomie behavior (e.g., rule-breaking, doping), but when effectively transformed into intrinsic motivation, it can inhibit such negative behaviors ([Chen et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-04524-1)). This highlights the importance of motivational quality over mere presence of extrinsic incentives.

### Goal Motivation and Achievement

Research integrating Achievement Goal Theory and SDT shows that autonomous goal motivation (including internalized extrinsic motives) is positively associated with sport satisfaction, positive affect, and perceived goal attainment. Conversely, controlled motivation (externally pressured extrinsic motivation) correlates with negative affective states and lower satisfaction ([Michou et al., 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5854141/)).

## Practical Implications for Coaches and Sport Psychologists

### Balancing Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation

Coaches should recognize the dual role of extrinsic motivation: it can enhance performance and competition drive but must be balanced with strategies that foster intrinsic motivation. Autonomy-supportive environments that satisfy athletes’ basic psychological needs facilitate the internalization of extrinsic motivators, leading to sustained motivation and adherence ([Vallerand, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1512270/full); [Applied Sport Psych, 2025](https://appliedsportpsych.org/resources/resources-for-coaches/extrinsic-rewards-and-motivation/)).

### Use of Extrinsic Rewards

Extrinsic rewards should be used strategically to avoid controlling perceptions. Praise, recognition, and rewards that acknowledge competence and effort rather than outcomes can enhance motivation without undermining intrinsic interest ([Applied Sport Psych, 2025](https://appliedsportpsych.org/resources/resources-for-coaches/extrinsic-rewards-and-motivation/)).

### Monitoring Motivation Quality

Regular assessment of athletes’ motivational profiles can help identify whether extrinsic motivation is being internalized or remains controlling. Interventions can then be tailored to support autonomous motivation and reduce risks associated with controlled motivation ([Vallerand, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1512270/full)).

## Conclusion

Extrinsic motivation plays a complex and multifaceted role in sports performance. It can enhance immediate performance, foster healthy competition, and serve as a gateway to intrinsic motivation through internalization processes. However, excessive reliance on extrinsic rewards risks undermining intrinsic motivation, leading to demotivation, burnout, and unethical behaviors. Empirical evidence supports the coexistence and interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, emphasizing the importance of motivational quality and context.

For optimal athletic performance and well-being, extrinsic motivation should be balanced with intrinsic motivation through autonomy-supportive coaching and environments that satisfy athletes’ psychological needs. Future research should continue to explore the mechanisms of internalization and the long-term effects of extrinsic motivators in diverse sporting contexts.
