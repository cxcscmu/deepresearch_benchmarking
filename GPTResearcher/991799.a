# When Did Racism First Start? A Comprehensive Historical Analysis

## Introduction

Racism, as a social and ideological phenomenon, has deeply influenced human history, shaping societies, cultures, and political systems. However, pinpointing the exact origin of racism is complex due to evolving definitions and the multifaceted nature of racial thought and discrimination. This report aims to provide a detailed, well-structured, and comprehensive analysis of when racism first started, based on a critical examination of scholarly research and historical evidence. The discussion will distinguish between early forms of prejudice and ethnocentrism and the modern concept of racism as a system of racial classification and hierarchy, emphasizing the significance of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and European colonialism in its emergence.

## Defining Racism and Its Historical Context

Racism is generally understood as discrimination or prejudice against individuals or groups based on perceived racial differences, often coupled with beliefs in racial superiority or inferiority. However, the concept of "race" itself is relatively modern. Prior to the early modern period, societies categorized people more often by geographic, cultural, or religious identifiers rather than by fixed racial categories based on physical traits such as skin color ([EBSCO Research Starters, n.d.](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/social-sciences-and-humanities/racism-history-concept)).

The Oxford English Dictionary defines racism as the belief in the superiority of a particular race, a definition that acquired its full supremacist connotations by the mid-20th century ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism)). This modern understanding emerged in the context of European imperialism, capitalism, and the Atlantic slave trade.

## Pre-Modern Prejudices: Ethnocentrism, Xenophobia, and Proto-Racism

Historical scholarship reveals that while ancient and medieval societies exhibited forms of prejudice and ethnocentrism, these were not racism in the modern sense. Ancient Greeks and Romans, for example, did not conceptualize race biologically; slaves were of various ethnicities and skin colors, and slavery was not racially based ([Workers Solidarity Movement, n.d.](https://libcom.org/article/very-brief-history-racism-workers-solidarity-movement)).

Medieval Europe exhibited "racialized" attitudes primarily through religious and cultural lenses, targeting Jews, Muslims, and other minorities. Some scholars argue that the Middle Ages were "thoroughly raced" in terms of discrimination and representation, especially through the moral symbolism attached to colors such as black and white ([Seth, 2022](https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-did-racism-begin)). However, this racialization was embedded in religious and cultural contexts rather than biological determinism.

The scholarship on medieval racism is contentious. Some historians reject the idea of medieval racism as anachronistic, distinguishing it from modern racism tied to nationalism, biological science, and centralized states ([Seth, 2022](https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-did-racism-begin)). Others emphasize the continuity of racial thinking from the medieval period into modernity, highlighting the political relevance of these earlier forms of discrimination.

## The Emergence of Modern Racism: The Early Modern Period and the Atlantic Slave Trade

The consensus among many historians and scholars is that modern racism emerged prominently during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, coinciding with European exploration, colonization, and the Transatlantic Slave Trade ([EBSCO Research Starters, n.d.](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/social-sciences-and-humanities/racism-history-concept); [Human Rights Careers, n.d.](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/who-started-racism/)).

This period marked a shift from geographic and religious categorizations to racial hierarchies based on physical characteristics, especially skin color. The demand for enslaved labor in the Americas led to the invention of racial justifications to legitimize the exploitation and dehumanization of African peoples. White Europeans and Americans constructed a racial hierarchy that placed white people at the top and Black people at the bottom, often using pseudoscientific theories to argue that some races were naturally inferior and destined for servitude ([Human Rights Careers, n.d.](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/who-started-racism/)).

The term "race" itself entered European languages between the 12th and 15th centuries but initially referred to lineage, breeding, or groups of animals rather than humans. It was only in the 17th century that "race" began to be used in relation to human classification and hierarchy ([EBSCO Research Starters, n.d.](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/social-sciences-and-humanities/racism-history-concept)).

## Scientific Racism and the Enlightenment

The Enlightenment period further entrenched racism through the development of scientific racism, which sought to classify humans into hierarchical races based on biological traits. This pseudoscientific approach provided a veneer of legitimacy to racial discrimination and slavery, influencing social, economic, and political ideologies in Europe and the Americas ([Academia.edu, 2017](https://www.academia.edu/33239927/Were_Early_Modern_Europeans_Racist)).

Philosophers and scientists of the 18th and 19th centuries developed theories that linked race to civilization stages and cultural capacities, often justifying colonialism and imperialism as a "civilizing mission" for supposedly inferior races ([International Journal of Science and Society, 2023](https://ijsoc.goacademica.com/index.php/ijsoc/article/view/785)).

## Racism and Empire: The 19th and 20th Centuries

Racism became a dominant ideology during the era of European imperialism, used to justify the conquest, exploitation, and subjugation of colonized peoples. Concepts like the "White Man's Burden" framed imperialism as a moral obligation of white Europeans to civilize non-white populations ([Workers Solidarity Movement, n.d.](https://libcom.org/article/very-brief-history-racism-workers-solidarity-movement)).

In the United States, racism underpinned slavery, segregation (Jim Crow laws), and systemic discrimination against African Americans and other minorities. Globally, racism played a role in genocides, including the Holocaust and colonial atrocities ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism)).

## Contemporary Perspectives and the Political Relevance of Historical Racism

Recent scholarship emphasizes the political importance of recognizing racism's historical roots, including premodern forms of racial thinking. This perspective argues that understanding the continuity and transformation of racial ideologies is essential for addressing contemporary racism ([Seth, 2022](https://www.chronicle.com/article/when-did-racism-begin)).

However, scholars caution against anachronistically projecting modern racial categories onto past societies, advocating for nuanced analyses that consider historical contexts and the evolving meanings of race and racism ([Journal of Social Sciences, 2023](https://journalofsocialsciences.org/vol6no1/blacks-in-the-middle-ages---what-about-race-and-racism-in-the-past-literary-and-art-historical-reflections)).

## Conclusion: When Did Racism First Start?

Based on the comprehensive review of historical and scholarly sources, racism as understood today—a system of classification and hierarchy based on perceived biological differences, particularly skin color—primarily emerged during the early modern period, specifically in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. This emergence was closely tied to European exploration, colonization, and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, which necessitated ideological justifications for the exploitation and enslavement of African peoples.

While earlier societies exhibited ethnocentrism, xenophobia, and religiously motivated discrimination, these do not constitute racism in the modern sense. The medieval period showed early forms of racialized thinking, especially in the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, but lacked the biological determinism and systemic racial hierarchies characteristic of modern racism.

Therefore, the origins of racism are best understood as a product of Western modernity, shaped by economic, political, and scientific developments from the early modern period onward. Recognizing this helps clarify the historical specificity of racism and informs contemporary efforts to combat its enduring legacies.
