# Report on Future Problems Resulting from Scarce Resources

## Introduction

Resource scarcity, defined as the limited availability of natural resources relative to demand, is a critical global challenge with profound implications for economic development, societal stability, and environmental sustainability. As the world population grows, urbanizes, and industrializes, the pressure on vital resources such as water, energy, arable land, and critical minerals intensifies. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the future problems that will arise from resource scarcity, drawing on recent authoritative sources and empirical data to offer an in-depth understanding of the multifaceted risks and consequences. The focus is on the systemic impacts of scarcity, particularly water scarcity, and its cascading effects on food security, geopolitical stability, economic growth, and social cohesion.

## Water Scarcity: A Central Challenge

Water scarcity stands out as a paramount issue among resource scarcities, with direct and indirect consequences on agriculture, human health, and economic productivity. According to Mishra (2023), water scarcity is already a prevalent problem even in regions with seemingly adequate water supplies, exacerbated by climate change-induced temperature rises and precipitation deficits ([Mishra, 2023](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)).

By 2030, global crop yields could decline by 20% due to water shortages, posing a significant threat to food security worldwide. By 2040, water scarcity may jeopardize up to 30% of global food production, with regions like the Mediterranean potentially losing up to 40% of crop revenue ([Zhang et al., 2021](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). In Southeast Asia, wheat and maize production could decrease by 10â€“20% by 2050 due to water constraints ([Gupta et al., 2021](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). These reductions threaten not only food availability but also economic livelihoods, especially in agrarian economies.

Water scarcity also disproportionately affects urban populations. The number of large cities experiencing water scarcity is projected to increase from 193 (37%) in 2016 to 292 (56%) by 2050, with the urban population under water stress doubling to between 1.693 and 2.373 billion people ([He et al., 2021](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). This urban water stress exacerbates public health risks, including waterborne diseases that currently cause over 1,000 child deaths daily ([UNICEF, 2017](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)).

## Food Security and Agricultural Productivity

The agricultural sector is the largest consumer of freshwater, accounting for nearly 70% of global water withdrawals, and up to 95% in some developing countries ([Ingrao et al., 2023](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). Water scarcity thus directly undermines agricultural productivity, leading to reduced crop yields, shifts in crop patterns, and increased food prices. For example, in Pakistan's Indus River Basin, farmers have shifted from water-intensive rice to less water-demanding wheat due to water shortages ([Shah et al., 2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)).

The cumulative effect of water scarcity and climate change could result in a 23% drop in global food output by 2100, with regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and Southern Europe being most vulnerable ([Schewe et al., 2014](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). This decline threatens global food security, potentially triggering food shortages, price volatility, and increased malnutrition.

## Societal and Health Implications

Resource scarcity, especially water scarcity, has severe societal consequences. The World Economic Forum identified water scarcity as the primary societal risk globally, surpassing infectious diseases, with an anticipated 43% increase in impact by 2025 ([World Economic Forum, 2015](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). By 2080, over 56.2% of the global population is expected to face high-impact water scarcity ([Veldkamp et al., 2016](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)).

Water scarcity exacerbates health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children. Poor access to clean water and sanitation contributes to the daily deaths of over 1,000 children under five from water-related illnesses ([UNICEF, 2017](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-water/article/water-scarcity-a-global-hindrance-to-sustainable-development-and-agricultural-production-a-critical-review-of-the-impacts-and-adaptation-strategies/2D555E039738FE6707382635C5BD0212)). Additionally, water scarcity can lead to increased competition and conflict over resources, heightening social tensions and potentially triggering violence.

## Geopolitical and Economic Risks

Resource scarcity fuels geopolitical tensions and economic instability. The Global Risks Report 2025 highlights state-based armed conflict as the top immediate global risk, with resource competition, including over water and critical minerals, being a significant driver ([World Economic Forum, 2025](https://securesustain.org/report/the-global-risks-report-2025/)). Conflicts in regions such as the Nile and Jordan River basins exemplify how shared water resources can become flashpoints for international disputes ([The Nation, 2025](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-resource-scarcity-and-climate-change-could-produce-global-explosion/)).

Economic consequences include disruptions to global supply chains, which are increasingly fragile due to geopolitical tensions, resource scarcity, and climate-related events. Supply chain disruptions impact the availability and cost of goods, affecting industries and consumers worldwide ([Arthur D. Little, 2025](https://www.adlittle.com/en/insights/viewpoints/developing-resilience-global-supply-chains-crisis)). For example, trade conflicts and tariffs linked to geopolitical disputes can force companies to diversify suppliers and relocate production, increasing costs and operational complexity ([Maersk, 2025](https://www.maersk.com/insights/resilience/2025/02/28/geopolitical-supply-chain-landscape)).

## Environmental Degradation and Resource Depletion

The exploitation of natural resources to meet economic development goals often leads to environmental degradation, including biodiversity loss, pollution, and ecosystem collapse ([Scientific Reports, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90187-w)). Rapid industrialization and urbanization contribute to the depletion of resources such as forests, minerals, and freshwater, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates scarcity and environmental stress.

The overuse of resources not only diminishes environmental quality but also undermines the long-term sustainability of economic activities. The concept of the U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve suggests that after a certain income level, environmental degradation may initially decrease but can rise again if resource consumption is not managed sustainably ([Scientific Reports, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90187-w)).

## Social and Economic Inequality

Resource scarcity tends to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating social inequalities. Limited access to water, food, and energy can deepen poverty and reduce opportunities for economic advancement. The Global Risks Report 2025 emphasizes societal polarization and inequality as critical risks that complicate collective action and governance responses to resource challenges ([World Economic Forum, 2025](https://securesustain.org/report/the-global-risks-report-2025/)).

Scarcity-driven price increases for essential goods can lead to social unrest, as witnessed in past food riots triggered by soaring commodity prices. The uneven distribution of resources and the inability of some regions or groups to adapt effectively may fuel migration and displacement, further straining social and political systems ([The Nation, 2025](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-resource-scarcity-and-climate-change-could-produce-global-explosion/)).

## Innovation and Adaptation Challenges

While scarcity can drive innovation and technological advancement, the pace and scale of adaptation required to mitigate future problems are daunting. Water-saving technologies, alternative crop varieties, renewable energy adoption, and circular economy practices offer pathways to reduce resource pressures ([Helpful Professor, 2025](https://helpfulprofessor.com/scarcity-examples/); [Scientific Reports, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90187-w)). However, these solutions require significant investment, political will, and international cooperation.

The complexity of global supply chains and geopolitical fragmentation complicate coordinated responses to resource scarcity. Companies and governments must integrate geopolitical risk assessments into strategic planning to build resilience and ensure continuity of critical supplies ([Arthur D. Little, 2025](https://www.adlittle.com/en/insights/viewpoints/developing-resilience-global-supply-chains-crisis)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The future problems resulting from scarce resources are multifaceted and interconnected, spanning environmental, economic, social, and geopolitical domains. Water scarcity, as a critical example, threatens food security, public health, and social stability on a global scale. The cascading effects of resource scarcity include increased conflict risk, economic disruptions, environmental degradation, and exacerbated inequalities.

Given the severity and complexity of these challenges, a proactive, integrated approach is essential. This includes investing in sustainable resource management, fostering international cooperation to prevent resource conflicts, and promoting technological innovation that enhances resource efficiency. Ignoring these imperatives risks a future marked by instability, diminished quality of life, and environmental collapse.

In my assessment, the most urgent priority is to address water scarcity through comprehensive policies that combine conservation, efficient use, and equitable distribution, alongside climate change mitigation. This focus will have multiplier effects in securing food production, reducing health risks, and stabilizing societies. Concurrently, strengthening global governance mechanisms to manage shared resources and supply chains is critical to mitigating geopolitical tensions and economic shocks.

The evidence underscores that resource scarcity is not merely an environmental issue but a central challenge to sustainable development and global security in the coming decades.
