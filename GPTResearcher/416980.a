# How Does Immigration Help the Economy?  
_A Comprehensive Analysis Based on Recent Research and Data_  

---

## Introduction

Immigration remains a pivotal and often contentious topic in U.S. economic and political discourse. Amid debates on border security, labor markets, and fiscal impacts, understanding immigration's multifaceted role in the economy is crucial. This report synthesizes recent empirical research and authoritative analyses to provide a detailed, evidence-based examination of how immigration benefits the U.S. economy. It highlights immigrants' contributions to labor supply, entrepreneurship, innovation, fiscal health, and overall economic growth, while addressing common concerns and policy implications.

## Labor Force Expansion and Economic Growth

One of the most direct economic benefits of immigration is the expansion of the labor force. In 2023, immigrants comprised nearly 19% of the U.S. civilian workforce, totaling approximately 31 million workers ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2024](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-does-immigration-affect-us-economy)). This substantial labor supply growth is critical in a context where the native-born workforce growth has slowed sharply.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that immigration contributes to economic output growth by increasing the number of workers who produce goods and services ([Kelly, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/03/20/how-immigrants-are-boosting-us-economic-and-job-growth/)). Immigrants do not merely add to labor supply; they also stimulate demand by consuming goods and services, creating a virtuous cycle that supports job creation and economic expansion ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/immigrants-and-the-economy/)).

Research by Boston University economist Tarek Hassan finds that immigration energizes local economies and raises wages for existing residents by fostering economic growth at the community level ([Boston University, 2024](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/do-immigrants-and-immigration-help-the-economy/)). This counters the misconception that immigrants displace native-born workers; instead, they complement the labor force and enhance productivity.

## Entrepreneurship and Job Creation

Immigrants are disproportionately entrepreneurial compared to native-born Americans. Studies using U.S. administrative data reveal that immigrants are about 80% more likely to start businesses than native-born citizens and are responsible for 42% more job creation through these firms ([Azoulay et al., 2022](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200588); [Kelly, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/03/20/how-immigrants-are-boosting-us-economic-and-job-growth/)).

Moreover, immigrant-founded firms tend to be high-growth and innovative, contributing significantly to labor demand. The dual role of immigrants as both workers and founders positions them as net "job creators" rather than "job takers" ([Azoulay et al., 2022](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200588)).

High-profile data show that immigrants have founded a majority of U.S. billion-dollar startups, underscoring their outsized role in driving economic dynamism and technological progress ([Kelly, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/03/20/how-immigrants-are-boosting-us-economic-and-job-growth/)).

## Innovation and Productivity

Immigrant entrepreneurs contribute disproportionately to innovation. A 2023 Census working paper analyzing nearly 200,000 firms found that immigrant-owned businesses are more likely than native-owned firms to develop new products, improve existing ones, adopt new processes, and engage in both basic and applied research and development (R&D) ([Lee et al., 2023](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2023/adrm/CES-WP-23-56.html)).

These innovation activities translate into higher patenting rates and productivity levels. Importantly, the innovation advantage holds across both high-tech and non-high-tech sectors and is amplified in firms with diverse immigrant-native teams, highlighting the role of diversity in fostering creativity and economic growth ([Lee et al., 2023](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2023/adrm/CES-WP-23-56.html)).

## Fiscal Contributions and Economic Sustainability

The fiscal impact of immigrants has been a subject of debate, but recent analyses provide nuanced insights. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that immigration will bolster federal tax revenues more than government spending in the short term, especially given the ongoing border situation ([Manhattan Institute, 2024](https://manhattan.institute/article/the-lifetime-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants)).

A detailed study by the Manhattan Institute highlights that younger and more educated immigrants pay more in taxes and receive fewer government benefits over their lifetimes compared to older and less educated immigrants. Selecting immigrants with these characteristics could reduce the national debt by trillions over the long term ([Manhattan Institute, 2024](https://manhattan.institute/article/the-lifetime-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants)).

While the fiscal impact varies by state due to differing tax and welfare policies, the overall effect of immigration on the federal budget is positive when accounting for immigrants' contributions to economic growth and tax revenues ([Manhattan Institute, 2024](https://manhattan.institute/article/the-lifetime-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants)).

## Complementarity with Native Workers and Wage Effects

Contrary to fears that immigrants depress wages or increase unemployment among native-born workers, evidence suggests otherwise. Immigration tends to complement the native workforce by filling labor shortages and expanding the economy, which supports job creation.

The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) reports that immigration has led to better wages and work opportunities for U.S.-born workers overall. The 2023 labor market exemplifies this: despite high immigrant arrivals, the unemployment rate for native-born workers hit record lows, and labor force participation among prime-age natives reached two-decade highs ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/immigrants-and-the-economy/)).

While some concerns remain about low-skill labor market impacts, the consensus among economists is that these effects are small and concentrated mainly among recent immigrants rather than native workers ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2024](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-does-immigration-affect-us-economy)).

## Consumer Spending and Demand Expansion

Immigrants contribute significantly as consumers, with a spending power that stimulates local economies and supports business activity. In 2014, immigrants earned $1.3 trillion and contributed $105 billion in state and local taxes and $224 billion in federal taxes, leaving nearly $927 billion in spending power ([New American Economy, 2015](https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/issues/taxes-spending-power/)).

This consumer demand expansion helps create jobs and supports economic growth by increasing the market for goods and services, thereby complementing their role as workers and entrepreneurs ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/immigrants-and-the-economy/)).

## Policy Implications and Recommendations

While immigration clearly benefits the U.S. economy, the full potential is often undermined by restrictive and inequitable policies. The Economic Policy Institute emphasizes that granting immigrants full and enforceable labor rights would enhance economic benefits for all workers by reducing exploitation and increasing productivity ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-benefits-from-immigration/)).

Furthermore, immigration policies that prioritize younger, educated immigrants, particularly those with STEM skills, could maximize fiscal and innovation benefits, reducing long-term deficits and boosting economic dynamism ([Manhattan Institute, 2024](https://manhattan.institute/article/the-lifetime-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants)).

Reforming immigration to allow greater labor market flexibility and equal rights would also enable immigrant workers to fully realize their innovative potential, currently limited by visa restrictions tied to specific employers ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/u-s-benefits-from-immigration/)).

## Conclusion

Immigration significantly strengthens the U.S. economy through multiple channels: expanding the labor force, fostering entrepreneurship and job creation, driving innovation, contributing positively to fiscal health, and increasing consumer demand. Empirical evidence from recent studies and government data consistently shows that immigrants are net contributors to economic growth and fiscal sustainability.

Concerns about negative impacts on native workers or fiscal burdens are largely overstated or mitigated by the complementary roles immigrants play. To fully harness immigration's economic benefits, policy reforms are necessary to ensure equal labor rights, facilitate immigrant innovation, and strategically select immigrants who maximize long-term fiscal and economic gains.

In sum, immigration is not only beneficial but essential for sustaining and enhancing the U.S. economy in the face of demographic shifts and global competition.
