# Should Beauty Standards Be More Inclusive?  
### A Comprehensive Analysis and Report  

---

## Introduction  

Beauty standards have historically been narrow, often centered around Eurocentric ideals that emphasize specific physical traits such as fair skin, slim bodies, and symmetrical facial features. However, as societies become more diverse and interconnected, there is a growing discourse on the need for inclusivity in beauty standards. This report examines whether beauty standards should be more inclusive, drawing on recent data, cultural analyses, and industry insights. It evaluates the benefits, challenges, and implications of inclusive beauty standards, relying on trusted and up-to-date sources from 2024 and 2025.

## The Case for Inclusive Beauty Standards  

### Representation and Validation  

One of the strongest arguments for more inclusive beauty standards is the validation and representation it offers to diverse populations. Historically marginalized groups, including people of color, individuals with disabilities, different body types, and gender non-conforming persons, have often been excluded from mainstream beauty narratives. This exclusion has been linked to negative self-esteem, body dysmorphia, and mental health challenges ([Black Girl Vitamins, 2025](https://blackgirlvitamins.co/blogs/blog/beauty-standards)).

Inclusive beauty standards allow individuals to see themselves reflected in media and products, which fosters a sense of belonging and self-acceptance. Brands like Dove and Fenty Beauty have demonstrated the positive impact of inclusive campaigns on consumer confidence and mental health by featuring diverse models and expanding product ranges to cater to varied skin tones and hair types ([CosmeticsDesign, 2025](https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2025/03/12/inclusivity-takes-center-stage-insights-from-the-2025-seeme-inclusivity-index/)).

### Economic and Market Benefits  

From a business perspective, inclusivity is not just ethical but economically advantageous. Inclusive brands have achieved significantly higher market penetration rates, particularly in emerging markets. For example, brands that prioritize diversity have a market penetration rate of 35%, compared to 20% for those with limited diversity in their offerings ([XJ Beauty, 2025](https://www.xj-beauty.com/blog/inclusive-beauty-a-must-have-not-a-nice-to-have-in-2025)). This demonstrates a clear consumer demand for products and marketing that reflect diverse identities.

The SeeMe Inclusivity Index highlights that Black-owned or founded brands are leading in inclusion across multiple identity dimensions, including age, skin conditions, and hair types. This leadership underscores the commercial viability and cultural resonance of inclusive beauty practices ([CosmeticsDesign, 2025](https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2025/03/12/inclusivity-takes-center-stage-insights-from-the-2025-seeme-inclusivity-index/)).

### Cultural Enrichment and Authenticity  

Inclusive beauty standards contribute to a richer cultural dialogue by recognizing and celebrating diverse cultural expressions of beauty. This counters the homogenization of beauty ideals driven by globalization, which risks diluting traditional beauty practices and cultural authenticity ([Women’s Journal, 2025](https://womensjournal.com/beauty-standards-and-cultural-influences/)).

By embracing diverse beauty ideals, societies promote a more positive and accepting narrative that respects cultural histories and identities. This approach fosters global understanding and appreciation, which is essential in an increasingly interconnected world.

## Challenges and Considerations  

### Persistence of Colorism and Narrow Representation  

Despite progress, significant challenges remain. The SeeMe Inclusivity Index points out the persistence of colorism—discrimination favoring lighter skin tones within ethnic groups—which continues to skew representation in advertising and marketing ([CosmeticsDesign, 2025](https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2025/03/12/inclusivity-takes-center-stage-insights-from-the-2025-seeme-inclusivity-index/)).

Moreover, brands often cast lighter-skinned individuals to represent entire ethnic groups, which fails to capture the full spectrum of diversity and can perpetuate exclusionary beauty norms.

### Tokenism and Superficial Inclusion  

Another challenge is the risk of tokenism, where brands include diverse models or messaging superficially without meaningful commitment to inclusivity. Jason R. Klein, COO and Co-Founder of SeeMe Index, emphasizes that featuring a “diverse” individual as a checkbox exercise is no longer sufficient. Genuine inclusion requires aligning brand objectives with authentic representation and accountability ([CosmeticsDesign, 2025](https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2025/03/12/inclusivity-takes-center-stage-insights-from-the-2025-seeme-inclusivity-index/)).

### Communication Barriers and Cultural Clashes  

Diversity and inclusivity efforts can also encounter challenges such as communication barriers and cultural misunderstandings, which require proactive management. Organizations must foster open communication, cross-cultural training, and empathy to create truly inclusive environments ([EducationalWave, 2025](https://hub.educationalwave.com/pros-and-cons-of-diversity/)).

## The Role of Media and Marketing  

### Shifting Media Narratives  

Media has historically reinforced narrow beauty standards, but it is now a critical arena for change. The rise of digital platforms like Instagram and TikTok has democratized beauty narratives, allowing more diverse voices to challenge traditional norms ([Women’s Journal, 2025](https://womensjournal.com/beauty-standards-and-cultural-influences/)).

Inclusive media representation has mental health benefits by promoting self-esteem and reducing feelings of isolation among underrepresented groups. Campaigns that feature diverse body types, skin tones, and gender identities help dismantle harmful stereotypes and expand societal definitions of beauty ([Common Beauty, 2024](https://www.commonbeauty.net/content/read/0000001207.html)).

### Corporate Responsibility and Accountability  

Consumers increasingly demand transparency and ethical practices from beauty brands, including commitments to diversity and social justice. This expectation drives brands to integrate inclusivity into product development, marketing, and corporate policies, reinforcing the cultural shift toward broader beauty standards ([New Black Voices, 2025](https://newblackvoices.nyc/diversity-and-representation-in-beauty-and-wellness-analysis-and-cultural-impact/)).

## Societal Impact  

### Mental Health and Self-Perception  

Rigid and exclusionary beauty standards contribute to widespread mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia. By promoting inclusive beauty standards, society can reduce these negative impacts and foster environments where individuals feel valued and confident in their unique appearance ([Black Girl Vitamins, 2025](https://blackgirlvitamins.co/blogs/blog/beauty-standards)).

### Redefining Beauty Norms  

Inclusive beauty standards challenge the traditional, often Eurocentric, ideals by embracing a multiplicity of identities, body types, ages, and abilities. This redefinition promotes equality and cultural awareness, contributing to a more just and harmonious society ([Renbacci, 2025](https://www.renbacci.com/post/the-impact-of-diversity-and-inclusion-on-the-beauty-industry-the-importance-of-representation-in-be)).

## Conclusion  

Based on the comprehensive analysis of recent industry reports, cultural studies, and market data, beauty standards should indeed be more inclusive. Inclusive beauty standards validate diverse identities, foster mental well-being, and offer significant economic benefits for brands. They enrich cultural narratives and promote social equity, aligning with the values of younger, more diverse generations.

However, inclusivity must be genuine and comprehensive, avoiding tokenism and addressing persistent issues like colorism and superficial representation. Brands and media must commit to transparency, accountability, and cultural intelligence to sustain meaningful change.

In sum, the shift toward inclusive beauty standards is not merely a trend but a necessary evolution that reflects the true diversity of society and supports healthier, more equitable perceptions of beauty.
