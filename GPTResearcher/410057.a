# Is Slavery Still Present Today? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Slavery, historically associated with the transatlantic slave trade and chattel slavery, is often perceived as a relic of the past. However, modern forms of slavery persist globally, affecting tens of millions of people today. This report examines the current state of slavery, often termed "modern slavery," by analyzing recent data, definitions, and the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon. Drawing on authoritative and up-to-date sources, the report provides a detailed, evidence-based assessment of whether slavery still exists in the 21st century, its forms, prevalence, and the challenges in combating it.

## Defining Modern Slavery

Modern slavery is an umbrella term encompassing various forms of exploitation where individuals are deprived of their freedom and coerced into work or relationships against their will. Unlike historical slavery, modern slavery is often hidden and illegal but thrives through coercion, deception, and abuse of power. It includes forced labor, forced marriage, human trafficking, debt bondage, domestic servitude, commercial sexual exploitation, and hereditary slavery ([Walk Free Foundation, 2023](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/); [Our Rescue, 2024](https://ourrescue.org/education/research-and-trends/modern-day-slavery)).

The United Nations defines human trafficking as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit” ([The Exodus Road, 2024](https://theexodusroad.com/does-slavery-exist-in-america-today/)).

## Prevalence and Scale of Modern Slavery

### Global Estimates

Recent estimates indicate that modern slavery affects approximately 49.6 to 50 million people worldwide as of 2025. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates 49.6 million people are trapped in modern slavery, including forced labor and forced marriage ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/); [Our Rescue, 2024](https://ourrescue.org/education/research-and-trends/modern-day-slavery)). Similarly, the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking reports over 50 million individuals are enslaved globally ([OCCRP, 2025](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/report-over-50-million-human-trafficking-victims-forced-into-modern-slavery-worldwide)).

These figures surpass the populations of many countries, such as Uganda, Spain, and Canada, underscoring the magnitude of the issue ([Our Rescue, 2024](https://ourrescue.org/education/research-and-trends/modern-day-slavery)).

### Breakdown by Type of Exploitation

- **Forced Labor:** Approximately 27.6 million people are subjected to forced labor, coerced or deceived into working under exploitative conditions in industries like agriculture, construction, domestic work, and manufacturing ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/)).
- **Forced Marriage:** Around 22 million people live in forced marriages, often unable to leave due to threats or legal constraints. Women and girls constitute about 68% of these victims ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/)).
- **Commercial Sexual Exploitation:** About 6.3 million people, predominantly women and girls (99%), are victims of sex trafficking ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/)).
- **State-Imposed Forced Labor:** Includes forced prison labor, compulsory public works, or military conscription, affecting roughly 3.9 million individuals ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/)).

### Demographics

Women and girls represent 71% of all modern slavery victims, while children comprise approximately 25% ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/)). Forced marriage disproportionately affects girls, with 88% of victims being female and 44% under the age of 15 ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2024](https://www.cfr.org/blog/human-trafficking-and-slavery-21st-century)).

### Regional Variations

In the Americas, sexual exploitation is the most prevalent form of trafficking, accounting for over 50% of detected cases, predominantly affecting women and girls ([OCCRP, 2025](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/report-over-50-million-human-trafficking-victims-forced-into-modern-slavery-worldwide)).

### United States Context

The United States has an estimated 1,091,000 people living in modern slavery, ranking 122nd out of 160 countries in prevalence but 10th in absolute numbers due to its large population ([Our Rescue, 2024](https://ourrescue.org/education/research-and-trends/modern-day-slavery); [The Exodus Road, 2024](https://theexodusroad.com/does-slavery-exist-in-america-today/)).

## Causes and Drivers of Modern Slavery

Modern slavery persists due to a combination of economic, social, and political factors:

- **Poverty:** A primary driver, forcing individuals to accept exploitative work or marriages to survive ([Right for Education, 2017](https://rightforeducation.org/2017/01/06/modern-slavery/)).
- **Conflict and Displacement:** Wars and natural disasters increase vulnerability, forcing people to migrate and exposing them to traffickers ([Walk Free Foundation, 2023](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/)).
- **Weak Legal Frameworks and Enforcement:** Some countries lack adequate laws or fail to enforce existing ones, allowing slavery to continue with impunity ([Regent University, 2021](https://globaljustice.regent.edu/2021/01/slavery-still-exists-today/)).
- **Corruption and Social Norms:** In certain regions, slavery is normalized or ignored due to cultural practices or corruption ([Regent University, 2021](https://globaljustice.regent.edu/2021/01/slavery-still-exists-today/)).
- **Economic Incentives:** Modern slavery is highly profitable, with low capital investment and rapid returns, especially in sex trafficking, which can yield up to 1,000% annual return on investment ([Harvard Kennedy School, 2017](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/research-insights/policy-topics/human-rights/siddharth-kara-persistence-modern-slavery)).

## Forms of Modern Slavery

Modern slavery manifests in various forms, often overlapping:

- **Forced Labor:** Coerced work without pay or under threat.
- **Debt Bondage:** Workers trapped by debts they cannot repay.
- **Forced Marriage:** Individuals, often girls, compelled into marriage.
- **Human Trafficking:** Recruitment and exploitation for labor or sex.
- **Domestic Servitude:** Forced labor in private households.
- **Child Slavery:** Children used as laborers, soldiers, or in sexual exploitation.
- **Hereditary Slavery:** People born into slavery due to ancestral status ([Eurasia Review, 2024](https://www.eurasiareview.com/03012024-behind-the-freedom-slavery-of-the-21st-century-analysis/); [Right for Education, 2017](https://rightforeducation.org/2017/01/06/modern-slavery/)).

## Challenges in Measuring Modern Slavery

Estimating the true scale of modern slavery is difficult due to its hidden nature, inconsistent definitions, and underreporting. Different organizations report varying figures based on their focus areas and methodologies. For example, the ILO’s estimate of 49.6 million includes forced labor and forced marriage, while other sources report 27.6 million forced labor victims alone ([AIM Free, 2025](https://aimfree.org/statistics/)).

The clandestine nature of slavery, combined with lack of data from primary sources, necessitates reliance on secondary data such as NGO reports, government data, and investigative journalism ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_21st_century)).

## Global and National Responses

### Legal Frameworks and Policy

Many countries have enacted laws criminalizing slavery and trafficking. The UK’s Modern Slavery Act (2015) is a notable example, though its effectiveness is debated. Recent shifts in government focus, such as in the UK in 2024-2025, aim to improve transparency in supply chains and increase prosecutions ([Modern Slavery PEC, 2025](https://www.modernslaverypec.org/latest/what-will-2025-bring-for-modern-slavery-policy)).

International bodies urge countries to adopt and strengthen anti-slavery legislation and enforcement ([OCCRP, 2025](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/report-over-50-million-human-trafficking-victims-forced-into-modern-slavery-worldwide)).

### Awareness and Advocacy

Organizations worldwide, including NGOs and human rights groups, work to raise awareness, support victims, and advocate for policy changes ([Be Slavery Free, 2025](https://www.beslaveryfree.com/articles-blogs/how-you-can-take-action-against-modern-slavery-in-2025)).

### Economic Measures

Efforts include banning imports produced with forced labor and promoting human rights due diligence in supply chains to reduce demand for products linked to slavery ([Modern Slavery PEC, 2025](https://www.modernslaverypec.org/resources/forced-labour-import-bans-2025)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence overwhelmingly confirms that slavery is very much present today, albeit in modernized and often hidden forms. Tens of millions of people worldwide remain trapped in conditions that deprive them of freedom and subject them to exploitation. Modern slavery is a complex, multifaceted issue driven by poverty, conflict, weak governance, and economic incentives.

Despite being illegal globally, modern slavery persists due to systemic failures, lack of enforcement, and the high profitability of exploitation. The scale and diversity of modern slavery demand coordinated international efforts, robust legal frameworks, and increased awareness.

Given the data and ongoing challenges, it is clear that slavery is not a historical artifact but a current, urgent human rights crisis. Continued research, policy innovation, and global cooperation are essential to dismantle the systems enabling modern slavery and to support survivors.
