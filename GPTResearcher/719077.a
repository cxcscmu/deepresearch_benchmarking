# Report on Why Healthcare Workers Are Quitting

## Introduction

The healthcare sector is experiencing an unprecedented wave of workforce attrition, with a significant number of healthcare workers quitting their jobs across various roles. This phenomenon has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic but is rooted in deeper systemic issues. Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind this exodus is crucial for healthcare organizations, policymakers, and stakeholders aiming to stabilize and sustain the healthcare workforce. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the primary factors driving healthcare workers to quit, supported by recent and reliable data sources.

## Elevated Burnout and Work Overload

### Burnout as a Primary Driver

Burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, is a pervasive issue among healthcare professionals. Studies indicate that nearly half of healthcare workers meet the criteria for burnout, with nurses reporting rates as high as 56% during the COVID-19 pandemic ([Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/)). Burnout is strongly linked to increased intent to leave the profession, with work overload identified as a significant independent predictor. Healthcare workers experiencing work overload have up to 2.9 times greater risk of burnout and up to 2.1 times greater risk of intending to leave their jobs ([Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/)).

### Work Overload Across Roles

While prior research focused mainly on physicians and nurses, recent studies expand this understanding to include other clinical staff (e.g., nursing assistants, respiratory therapists) and non-clinical staff (e.g., administrative personnel). These groups also experience high work demands and associated burnout, indicating that work overload is a systemic issue across the healthcare workforce ([Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/)).

### Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The pandemic intensified existing stressors by increasing clinical volumes and introducing unprecedented challenges. Healthcare workers faced acute stress, fear of infection, and trauma from patient suffering and death, which compounded burnout and emotional exhaustion ([Maleki et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10939201/); [Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/)). These factors contributed to a surge in the intention to leave among nurses and physicians during the pandemic ([Maleki et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10939201/)).

## Mental Health Challenges and Emotional Stress

Healthcare workers face significant mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and compassion fatigue. The stigma surrounding mental health in healthcare settings often discourages workers from seeking help, exacerbating these issues ([Rodriguez-Vega et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-024-10419-5); [Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/)).

Emotional stress is not only a leading cause of burnout but also a top reason cited by healthcare professionals for quitting their jobs ([Lotis Blue Consulting, 2025](https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20250227220592/lotis-blue-consulting-releases-the-science-of-staying-2025-health-care-workforce-retention-study-new-research-can-predict-turnover-with-90-accuracy)). The psychological toll of continuous exposure to suffering, moral distress, and high job demands leads to decreased job satisfaction and increased turnover intentions ([Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/); [Maleki et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10939201/)).

## Financial Stress and Compensation Issues

Financial stress and inadequate compensation are significant contributors to healthcare worker attrition. Despite the high demands and risks associated with healthcare roles, many workers feel underpaid and undervalued. The use of sign-on bonuses rather than sustainable salary increases reflects a short-term approach to workforce retention that fails to address underlying compensation dissatisfaction ([Smartlinx, 2022](https://www.smartlinx.com/resources/blog/top-5-reasons-healthcare-workers-are-quitting)).

Financial burdens impact not only job satisfaction but also the quality of care delivered, as stressed and financially insecure workers may be less focused and engaged ([Smartlinx, 2022](https://www.smartlinx.com/resources/blog/top-5-reasons-healthcare-workers-are-quitting)).

## Staffing Shortages and Increased Workload

Chronic understaffing exacerbates workload and burnout, creating a vicious cycle where increased demands lead to more attrition, further worsening staffing levels. The shortage of nurses, for example, is projected to exceed one million by the end of 2022 due to retirements and resignations ([Smartlinx, 2022](https://www.smartlinx.com/resources/blog/top-5-reasons-healthcare-workers-are-quitting)).

Healthcare executives report that turnover among clinical professionals remains a key strategic challenge, with nearly half planning to leave their organizations within the next year ([B.E. Smith, 2025](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/24/3047898/0/en/Survey-Projects-High-Turnover-Rates-Among-Healthcare-Executives-in-2025.html)). This turnover intensifies staffing shortages, leading to increased workloads and compromised patient care ([B.E. Smith, 2025](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/24/3047898/0/en/Survey-Projects-High-Turnover-Rates-Among-Healthcare-Executives-in-2025.html)).

## Work Environment and Organizational Factors

Healthcare workers cite lack of support from leadership, insufficient staffing, poor work-life balance, and inadequate mental health resources as critical reasons for leaving. The emotional toll of the job, combined with feelings of not being listened to or valued, contributes significantly to turnover ([ANA, 2023](https://www.nursingworld.org/content-hub/resources/nursing-leadership/why-nurses-quit/); [Maleki et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10939201/)).

Moreover, the stigma associated with mental health issues in healthcare settings leads to low peer support and reluctance to seek help, further impacting well-being and retention ([Rodriguez-Vega et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-024-10419-5)).

## Psychological Drivers and Employee Value Proposition (EVP)

Recent research highlights that the reasons healthcare workers stay or quit are distinct and influenced by different factors. Feeling that the work is meaningful is the top reason for staying, while emotional stress is the leading cause for quitting ([Lotis Blue Consulting, 2025](https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20250227220592/lotis-blue-consulting-releases-the-science-of-staying-2025-health-care-workforce-retention-study-new-research-can-predict-turnover-with-90-accuracy)).

Factors related to job stability, location, shift preferences, and physical and mental job demands significantly influence retention decisions. Importantly, liking one's immediate supervisor, often assumed to be crucial, was notably absent as a driver of quit decisions, underscoring the complexity of workforce dynamics ([Lotis Blue Consulting, 2025](https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20250227220592/lotis-blue-consulting-releases-the-science-of-staying-2025-health-care-workforce-retention-study-new-research-can-predict-turnover-with-90-accuracy)).

## Demographic and Career Considerations

Age, experience, and career stage also influence turnover. A significant portion of the healthcare workforce is approaching retirement age, with projections indicating that half of physicians practicing in 2021 and 20% of nurses will retire by 2030 ([Maleki et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10939201/)). This demographic shift exacerbates workforce shortages and turnover rates.

Additionally, newer employees exhibit higher turnover rates, with 45% of those employed for less than a year having quit, indicating challenges in early career retention ([Lotis Blue Consulting, 2025](https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20250227220592/lotis-blue-consulting-releases-the-science-of-staying-2025-health-care-workforce-retention-study-new-research-can-predict-turnover-with-90-accuracy)).

## Systemic and Policy-Level Challenges

The healthcare workforce crisis is not merely a collection of individual issues but reflects systemic challenges, including policy inadequacies, resource constraints, and structural inequities. Addressing these requires comprehensive reforms that value healthcare workers appropriately, ensure sustainable compensation, provide mental health support, and match work demands to capacity ([Shah et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10035977/); [Rodriguez-Vega et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-024-10419-5)).

## Conclusion

Healthcare workers are quitting due to a complex interplay of burnout, work overload, mental health challenges, financial stress, staffing shortages, and organizational factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these issues but did not create them. Sustainable solutions must address systemic workload management, mental health stigma, competitive compensation, supportive work environments, and demographic shifts. Without targeted interventions, the healthcare system risks further attrition, compromising care quality and accessibility.
