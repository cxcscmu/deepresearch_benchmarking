# Why Should Christians Share Their Faith?  
## A Comprehensive Report

### Introduction  
Sharing the Christian faith, commonly known as evangelism, is a foundational practice in Christianity. It involves communicating the message of Jesus Christ—the Good News—to others. Despite its centrality in Christian doctrine, the practice of sharing faith has seen shifts in perception and practice, especially in contemporary society. This report explores the reasons why Christians should share their faith, drawing on recent research, theological insights, and sociocultural trends. It aims to provide a detailed, well-rounded understanding of the imperative and benefits of evangelism in the modern world.

### Biblical Mandate and Theological Foundation  

The primary and most compelling reason for Christians to share their faith is obedience to the biblical command known as the Great Commission. Jesus explicitly instructed His followers to "go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19-20, NIV). This directive is not optional but a fundamental aspect of Christian identity and mission (Cherubim, 2025). The Great Commission underscores evangelism as an act of obedience and faithfulness to Christ's teachings.

Moreover, evangelism is rooted in God's love and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. Christians share their faith because God’s love compels them to do so (2 Corinthians 5:14-15). The message of salvation through Jesus’ death and resurrection is central to Christian belief and offers eternal hope and reconciliation with God (Boucher, 2013). Sharing this message is an expression of love for others, reflecting the command to love one’s neighbor as oneself (Living Waters, 2023).

### Evangelism as an Act of Love and Compassion  

Evangelism is fundamentally an act of love and compassion. Christians are called to share the gospel not out of obligation alone but because they genuinely desire others to experience the transformative power of Christ’s love. The analogy of a firefighter risking personal safety to save others illustrates the selflessness involved in evangelism (Living Waters, 2023). Remaining silent about salvation, when one has the means to offer hope, is considered a sin (Living Waters, 2023).

This perspective is echoed in contemporary Christian teaching that sharing faith is a way to bridge people from brokenness to abundant life. Christians believe that their testimony and the gospel can offer hope, healing, and purpose to those struggling with life’s challenges (Cherubim, 2025; Mt. Bethel Church, 2025).

### Societal and Cultural Impact  

Beyond individual transformation, sharing the Christian faith contributes positively to society. The values promoted by Christianity—love, justice, compassion, forgiveness, and selflessness—have historically shaped laws and fostered cultures of service and reconciliation (Cherubim, 2025). When Christians share their faith, they participate in building God’s kingdom on Earth, which is marked by these values.

The church, both universal and local, plays a critical role in societal engagement by addressing social issues, advocating for justice, and providing charity (The Witness, 2025). Evangelism is intertwined with discipleship, where new believers are nurtured to grow in faith and contribute positively to their communities (The Witness, 2025).

### Contemporary Challenges and Trends  

Despite the biblical and theological imperatives, recent research shows a decline in the perceived personal responsibility among Christians to share their faith. Studies by Barna Group and the Christian Research Network reveal that fewer Christians today view evangelism as their individual duty, often attributing it to the local church instead (Barna Group, 2017; Christian Research Network, 2018). This shift may be due to cultural barriers, fear of rejection, or misunderstandings about the church’s role.

Furthermore, social barriers have increased, with Christians more likely to avoid spiritual conversations for fear of rejection (Christian Research Network, 2018). However, these challenges also highlight the need for churches to empower believers with confidence and practical resources for evangelism (Barna Group, 2017).

### Personal and Spiritual Benefits of Evangelism  

Sharing faith is not only beneficial to the recipients but also enriches the spiritual life of the evangelizer. Engaging in evangelism deepens a Christian’s walk with God, increases reliance on Scripture, and fosters a more profound gratitude for Christ’s sacrifice (Living Waters, 2023). The process of sharing faith encourages believers to pray more earnestly and depend on the Holy Spirit for guidance and boldness.

Moreover, evangelism cultivates spiritual growth by compelling Christians to imitate the Apostle Paul, who exemplified obedience and love in his missionary efforts (Living Waters, 2023). This personal transformation is a vital aspect of the Christian journey.

### Global Growth and Missionary Trends  

On a global scale, Christianity continues to grow, particularly in Africa and Asia, where the number of Christians is increasing rapidly (Lifeway Research, 2025). Evangelicals, one of the fastest-growing Christian groups, are projected to reach nearly 621 million by 2050 (Lifeway Research, 2025). This growth is accompanied by an increase in national workers and missionaries actively engaged in evangelism worldwide.

The expansion of gospel access through translations of the New Testament into thousands of languages further facilitates evangelism efforts globally (Lifeway Research, 2025). Despite ongoing persecution in some regions, the overall trend shows a decline in martyrdom and an increase in the spread of the Christian message.

### The Role of the Church  

The church, both universal and local, is instrumental in supporting evangelism. The universal church represents the global body of believers, fostering unity and collective prayer, while local churches provide the immediate community for worship, teaching, and fellowship (The Witness, 2025). Local churches empower members to share their faith in practical ways and nurture new believers through discipleship.

Effective evangelism requires churches to invest in training, resources, and encouragement for their members, helping them overcome fears and cultural barriers (Barna Group, 2017). The mission of the church—to spread the gospel and develop strong societal relationships—remains central to its purpose (The Witness, 2025).

### Conclusion  

Christians should share their faith because it is a biblically mandated act of obedience, rooted in God’s love and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. Evangelism is an expression of compassion, a means of societal transformation, and a source of spiritual growth for believers. Despite contemporary challenges, the global Christian community continues to grow and engage in mission work, underscoring the ongoing relevance and necessity of sharing the gospel.

The church’s role in equipping and encouraging believers is crucial to overcoming barriers and fulfilling the Great Commission. Ultimately, sharing faith is both a privilege and responsibility that reflects the heart of Christianity: love for God and love for others.
