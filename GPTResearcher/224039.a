# The End of the Cambodian Genocide: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

The Cambodian genocide, perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot from April 1975 to January 1979, resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.2 to 3 million people—approximately 25% to 30% of Cambodia’s population at the time. This genocide was characterized by mass executions, forced labor, starvation, and the eradication of intellectuals and ethnic minorities. The brutal regime sought to create a radical agrarian communist society, abolishing money, private property, religion, and individuality, leading to widespread suffering and death.

This report aims to provide a detailed, well-structured, and comprehensive account of how the Cambodian genocide ended. It integrates information from multiple reliable sources, prioritizing recent and authoritative accounts to offer an objective analysis of the events that culminated in the fall of the Khmer Rouge and the cessation of the genocide.

## Background to the Genocide

The Khmer Rouge came to power following years of civil war and instability in Cambodia, exacerbated by the spillover effects of the Vietnam War and a devastating U.S. bombing campaign. The regime’s radical policies led to the forced evacuation of cities, mass executions, and the establishment of labor camps, with notorious sites such as Tuol Sleng prison and the Killing Fields symbolizing the scale of atrocities ([History.com](https://www.history.com/articles/the-khmer-rouge), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Cambodian-Genocide)).

## The Vietnamese Invasion: Catalyst for the End

### Escalating Border Conflicts and Khmer Rouge Aggression

Despite initial cooperation with North Vietnam during their rise, the Khmer Rouge grew increasingly hostile towards Vietnam, driven by ultra-nationalism and territorial claims over historically contested border areas, such as the Mekong Delta. The Khmer Rouge launched brutal cross-border raids into Vietnam, culminating in the massacre of over 3,000 Vietnamese civilians in Ba Chúc in April 1978 ([National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/40-years-ago-vietnam-steamrolled-genocidal-khmer-rouge-cambodia-lightning-war-41412), [Jacobin](https://jacobin.com/2025/04/cambodia-khmer-rouge-communist-history)).

Vietnam responded to these provocations with a punitive multi-division invasion beginning on December 25, 1978. The Vietnamese forces, numbering approximately 150,000 troops and supported by air power, rapidly overran the Khmer Rouge military, which was weakened by starvation, demoralization, and lack of effective resistance ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian–Vietnamese_War), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cambodia/Vietnamese-Intervention)).

### The Fall of Phnom Penh and Khmer Rouge Defeat

By January 7, 1979, Vietnamese tanks and commandos entered Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, effectively ending Khmer Rouge control of the government. Pol Pot and his remaining forces fled to remote jungle areas near the Thai border, where they continued a guerrilla insurgency for years to come ([National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/40-years-ago-vietnam-steamrolled-genocidal-khmer-rouge-cambodia-lightning-war-41412), [History Tools](https://www.historytools.org/stories/southeast-asias-most-murderous-regime-the-khmer-rouge-explained)).

The Vietnamese installed a new government, the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), led by former Khmer Rouge defectors such as Hun Sen, who had been a battalion commander under Pol Pot. This government was heavily dependent on Vietnamese military and economic support ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cambodia/Vietnamese-Intervention)).

## The Aftermath of the Invasion

### Ending the Genocide and Humanitarian Relief

Vietnam’s invasion effectively ended the Cambodian genocide by dismantling the Khmer Rouge regime and halting the mass killings, forced labor, and starvation policies. The Vietnamese uncovered and publicized evidence of the atrocities, converting sites like Tuol Sleng prison into museums and memorials to honor the victims ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/world/asia/cambodia-khmer-rouge-timeline/index.html), [National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/40-years-ago-vietnam-steamrolled-genocidal-khmer-rouge-cambodia-lightning-war-41412)).

Vietnam also facilitated international food aid to mitigate the massive famine that had afflicted Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge years ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian–Vietnamese_War)).

### Continued Conflict and International Isolation

Despite the Khmer Rouge’s military defeat, they continued guerrilla warfare from bases along the Thai border, supported by China and, indirectly, by the United States and other Western-aligned groups, who opposed Vietnam’s occupation due to Cold War dynamics. This prolonged conflict lasted through the 1980s and into the early 1990s ([History Tools](https://www.historytools.org/stories/southeast-asias-most-murderous-regime-the-khmer-rouge-explained), [National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/40-years-ago-vietnam-steamrolled-genocidal-khmer-rouge-cambodia-lightning-war-41412)).

Vietnam’s occupation of Cambodia led to international sanctions and isolation, with the United States and China opposing the Vietnamese-installed government. Vietnam became economically dependent on the Soviet Union during this period ([National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/40-years-ago-vietnam-steamrolled-genocidal-khmer-rouge-cambodia-lightning-war-41412)).

## Political Developments and the End of the War

### Vietnamese Withdrawal and Peace Agreements

Vietnamese troops withdrew from Cambodia in 1989 after more than a decade of occupation. This withdrawal was part of broader geopolitical changes, including the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/world/asia/cambodia-khmer-rouge-timeline/index.html), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian–Vietnamese_War)).

The 1991 Paris Peace Agreements officially ended the conflict, establishing a framework for peace, national reconciliation, and democratic elections under United Nations supervision. The Khmer Rouge, however, boycotted the elections and continued guerrilla warfare until their eventual collapse in the late 1990s ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian–Vietnamese_War), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cambodia)).

### Trials and Legacy

Efforts to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice began in earnest in the late 1990s and 2000s, culminating in the establishment of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), a UN-backed tribunal. To date, only a few senior leaders have been convicted of crimes against humanity and genocide, including Kaing Guek Eav (Duch), Nuon Chea, and Khieu Samphan. Pol Pot died under house arrest in 1998 without facing trial ([History Tools](https://www.historytools.org/stories/southeast-asias-most-murderous-regime-the-khmer-rouge-explained), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide)).

## Analysis and Conclusion

The Cambodian genocide ended primarily due to the decisive military intervention by Vietnam in late 1978 and early 1979. Vietnam’s invasion was a response to repeated Khmer Rouge cross-border attacks and massacres of Vietnamese civilians, as well as the genocidal policies of the Khmer Rouge that threatened regional stability. The Vietnamese military campaign swiftly dismantled the Khmer Rouge regime, ending the genocide and installing a new government.

However, the end of the genocide did not bring immediate peace or stability. The Khmer Rouge continued as a guerrilla insurgency with foreign support, and Cambodia remained embroiled in conflict and political turmoil throughout the 1980s. The international community’s Cold War politics complicated the situation, with many countries opposing Vietnam’s occupation despite the humanitarian imperative.

Vietnam’s role in ending the genocide is complex and viewed differently within Cambodia and internationally. While many Cambodians see Vietnam as a savior who stopped the mass killings, others perceive the invasion as an imperialist conquest, fueling nationalist and anti-Vietnamese sentiments that persist today.

Ultimately, the Cambodian genocide ended through a combination of military intervention, international political shifts, and subsequent peace processes. The legacy of this dark chapter continues to influence Cambodia’s political landscape and collective memory.
