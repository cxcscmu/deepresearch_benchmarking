# What Makes a Great Manager: An In-Depth Report

## Introduction

Great managers are pivotal to organizational success, influencing employee engagement, productivity, retention, and overall workplace culture. Despite the abundance of managerial roles, research consistently shows that truly great managers are rare, with less than 10% of the workforce possessing the personality and skills required to excel in these positions ([Robinson, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/06/03/research-paints-the-image-of-a-great-manager-to-be-in-short-supply/)). This report synthesizes current research, expert opinions, and empirical studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of what distinguishes great managers from merely good ones. The analysis prioritizes recent, reliable sources and integrates insights from leadership theory, interpersonal skills research, and data-driven management practices.

## Defining a Great Manager

A great manager is not simply a taskmaster or a figurehead but a multifaceted leader who inspires, supports, and develops their team while driving organizational goals. The distinction between leadership and management is increasingly viewed as artificial; effective managers embody leadership qualities and vice versa, blending vision with execution ([PMC, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5607712/)).

## Core Qualities of Great Managers

### 1. Emotional Intelligence and Empathy

Emotional intelligence (EI), particularly empathy, is repeatedly identified as the most critical skill for effective management. Empathy allows managers to understand and relate to their employees' perspectives, fostering trust, psychological safety, and loyalty. Research shows that when leaders demonstrate empathy, 86% of employees report better work-life balance and improved mental health, which correlates with higher engagement and productivity ([Brower, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2021/09/19/empathy-is-the-most-important-leadership-skill-according-to-research/)).

Empathetic managers also create environments conducive to cooperation and innovation by valuing diverse viewpoints and encouraging open dialogue. This emotional connection translates into tangible business outcomes, including reduced turnover and enhanced team performance ([Robinson, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/06/03/research-paints-the-image-of-a-great-manager-to-be-in-short-supply/)).

### 2. Communication Skills and Active Listening

Great managers excel in communication, ensuring clarity of objectives, providing balanced feedback, and actively listening to their team members. Over 90% of employees believe that being genuinely listened to, not just heard, is essential for effective management ([Robinson, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/06/03/research-paints-the-image-of-a-great-manager-to-be-in-short-supply/)).

Regular one-on-one check-ins, transparent updates, and clear expectations help align individual and team goals with organizational strategy. Effective communication also involves explaining the "why" behind decisions and data, which empowers employees to make informed choices and fosters a data-driven culture ([Claffey, 2025](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-core-traits-of-great-leaders-what-every-manager/485599); [Neev Systems, 2025](https://neevsystems.com/building-a-data-driven-culture-empowering-teams-with-analytics/)).

### 3. Visionary Thinking and Strategic Decision-Making

Great managers possess a clear vision that aligns with the company’s mission and values. They inspire their teams by articulating this vision and demonstrating how each member's contributions fit into the bigger picture. Visionary leadership motivates employees to invest their best efforts, fostering a sense of purpose and collective achievement ([Top Workplaces, 2025](https://topworkplaces.com/qualities-of-a-good-manager/); [Claffey, 2025](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-core-traits-of-great-leaders-what-every-manager/485599)).

Moreover, decisiveness is a hallmark of great management. Managers must make informed decisions swiftly, balancing data insights with interpersonal considerations to guide their teams effectively. This decisiveness builds trust and enables adaptability in fast-changing environments ([Top Workplaces, 2025](https://topworkplaces.com/qualities-of-a-good-manager/); [Forbes, 2016](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2016/01/26/seven-qualities-the-best-managers-share-and-why-they-matter/)).

### 4. Accountability and Role Modeling

Accountability is essential for building trust and credibility. Great managers own their decisions, celebrate successes, and take responsibility for failures. This transparency encourages a culture of fairness and continuous improvement. Employees are more likely to emulate managers who model integrity and hold themselves to high standards ([Claffey, 2025](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-core-traits-of-great-leaders-what-every-manager/485599); [Forbes, 2016](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2016/01/26/seven-qualities-the-best-managers-share-and-why-they-matter/)).

Being a role model extends beyond accountability to embodying the company culture and values. Managers who genuinely love and invest in their company’s culture inspire their teams to do the same, which drives engagement and organizational cohesion ([Forbes, 2016](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2016/01/26/seven-qualities-the-best-managers-share-and-why-they-matter/); [Top Workplaces, 2025](https://topworkplaces.com/qualities-of-a-good-manager/)).

### 5. Interpersonal Skills and Conflict Management

Managerial interpersonal skills (MIPS) — including conflict resolution, motivation, and support — are critical for effective team leadership. Studies validate that employees’ perceptions of their managers’ interpersonal skills significantly predict job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behaviors, and supervisor performance ratings ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8039519/)).

Great managers actively address conflicts, build trust, and mentor their teams, removing barriers to success. They foster psychological safety, enabling team members to express themselves without fear, which is essential for collaboration and innovation ([Forbes Coaches Council, 2023](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2023/12/12/20-skills-that-distinguish-great-managers-from-good-ones/)).

### 6. Developing Others and Creating a Learning Culture

Exceptional managers see leadership potential in every team member and invest in their development. They create a learning culture characterized by high psychological safety and clear expectations, which encourages continuous growth and resilience ([Forbes Coaches Council, 2023](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2023/12/12/20-skills-that-distinguish-great-managers-from-good-ones/); [Claffey, 2025](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-core-traits-of-great-leaders-what-every-manager/485599)).

By mentoring employees, encouraging autonomy, and providing opportunities for mastery, great managers multiply their impact and build stronger, more capable teams ([Forbes Coaches Council, 2023](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2023/12/12/20-skills-that-distinguish-great-managers-from-good-ones/)).

### 7. Data-Driven Decision Making and Empowerment

In the modern workplace, data literacy and analytics are increasingly vital managerial competencies. Great managers leverage data to make objective, evidence-based decisions, avoiding cognitive biases and optimizing outcomes through iterative improvements ([Gleeson, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2025/03/12/5-ways-to-transform-leadership-through-data-driven-decision-making/)).

They empower their teams by democratizing data access, providing targeted training to build analytics skills, and celebrating data-driven successes. This approach fosters a culture of continuous learning and innovation, enabling organizations to adapt and thrive ([Emerald Insight, 2023](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jmd-12-2022-0306/full/html); [Neev Systems, 2025](https://neevsystems.com/building-a-data-driven-culture-empowering-teams-with-analytics/)).

## Challenges and the Rarity of Great Managers

Despite the clear qualities that define great managers, they remain scarce. Gallup’s State of the American Manager Report estimates that only about 10% of managers possess the talent to be great leaders ([Robinson, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/06/03/research-paints-the-image-of-a-great-manager-to-be-in-short-supply/)). This shortage is partly due to organizations promoting individuals based on tenure or technical performance rather than interpersonal and leadership skills, leading to miscast managers who disengage employees and increase turnover ([Robinson, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/06/03/research-paints-the-image-of-a-great-manager-to-be-in-short-supply/)).

Additionally, managerial roles are inherently stressful, requiring high levels of emotional labor and interpersonal dexterity. Effective managers must navigate complex social dynamics while maintaining productivity under pressure ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8039519/)).

## Conclusion

Great managers are distinguished by a blend of emotional intelligence, visionary leadership, accountability, interpersonal skills, and data-driven decision-making. They foster trust, communicate effectively, develop their teams, and align individual efforts with organizational goals. While the scarcity of such managers presents a challenge, organizations that prioritize these qualities in hiring and development can build cultures of excellence and sustainable success.

The integration of empathy and data-driven practices, combined with a commitment to continuous learning and accountability, forms the foundation of exceptional management in today’s complex business environment. Recognizing and cultivating these traits will be essential for organizations aiming to thrive in the future.
