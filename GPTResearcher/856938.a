# Report: How Nursing Homes Deal with Elderly People's Mental Health After COVID-19

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted nursing homes worldwide, not only through the direct health risks posed by the virus but also by exacerbating mental health challenges among elderly residents. Nursing homes, traditionally focused on physical health care, have faced significant challenges in addressing the mental health needs of their residents during and after the pandemic. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how nursing homes have dealt with elderly people's mental health following COVID-19, drawing on recent and reliable research to offer an in-depth understanding of the strategies, challenges, and outcomes involved.

## Mental Health Challenges in Nursing Homes Post-COVID-19

### Prevalence and Nature of Mental Health Issues

Before the pandemic, mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, and cognitive decline were already prevalent among nursing home residents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), up to 50% of nursing home residents experience depression, yet fewer than half receive treatment ([Prerna's Civic Life Blogs, 2025](https://sites.psu.edu/prernascivicblogs/2025/04/19/mental-health-in-nursing-homes-the-silent-struggle/)). The pandemic intensified these issues due to increased social isolation, disruption of routines, and heightened anxiety about health risks.

### Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions

Lockdowns and visitor restrictions, while necessary to prevent viral spread, led to severe social isolation. Residents were cut off from family, friends, and communal activities, which are critical lifelines for emotional support ([Simard, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8208072/)). This isolation contributed to increased anxiety, depression, and feelings of hopelessness among residents ([Fallon et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7665707/)).

### Staff Mental Health and Its Influence

Caregivers and nursing staff also experienced intense psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and burnout, which affected their ability to provide optimal mental health care ([Kusumoto et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9393777/)). The mental health of staff is closely linked to resident well-being, as stressed or overwhelmed staff may be less able to recognize and respond to residents' mental health needs.

## Strategies Employed by Nursing Homes to Address Mental Health Post-COVID-19

### Enhanced Staff Training and Mental Health Screening

Recognizing the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of mental health conditions, many nursing homes have prioritized staff training on geriatric mental health. Training focuses on recognizing atypical presentations of depression and anxiety in older adults, such as fatigue or irritability rather than overt sadness ([Prerna's Civic Life Blogs, 2025](https://sites.psu.edu/prernascivicblogs/2025/04/19/mental-health-in-nursing-homes-the-silent-struggle/)). Regular mental health screenings have been implemented to identify residents needing intervention early.

### Access to Mental Health Professionals

Facilities have increased access to therapists, counselors, and psychiatric consultation-liaison services to provide specialized care. Psychiatric consultations have been shown to improve outcomes for nursing home residents with mental disorders ([Tariot et al., 1993](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2981653/)). Some nursing homes have integrated mental health professionals into their care teams to offer ongoing support.

### Social Connection and Meaningful Activities

To combat social isolation, nursing homes have developed innovative ways to maintain social connections. These include window or behind-glass visits, virtual communication via video calls, and socially distanced group activities ([Simard, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8208072/); [Prerna's Civic Life Blogs, 2025](https://sites.psu.edu/prernascivicblogs/2025/04/19/mental-health-in-nursing-homes-the-silent-struggle/)). Engaging residents in meaningful activities helps restore a sense of purpose and reduces feelings of loneliness.

### Psychosocial Programs and Community Collaboration

Psychosocial programs designed to prevent loneliness and boredom have been implemented, often through community partnerships. A 12-week psychosocial program in South Africa, for example, demonstrated the importance of collaborative partnerships and reflective practices in delivering mental health support during lockdowns ([Jarvis et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9348144/)).

### Use of Telehealth and Integrated Care Models

Telehealth has become a vital tool for providing timely and individualized mental health care, especially when in-person visits are limited ([Abrams et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7353831/)). Integrated health and social care models that focus on person-centered approaches have shown promise in improving mental health outcomes and quality of life ([Abrams et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7353831/)).

### Staff Support and Mental Health Interventions

Given the psychological burden on staff, nursing homes have introduced mentoring, stress management training, and access to mental health resources for caregivers ([Kusumoto et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9393777/); [Fallon et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7665707/)). Supporting staff mental health is essential to sustaining quality care for residents.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Underdiagnosis and Stigma

Mental health conditions in older adults often present atypically and are frequently dismissed as normal aging, leading to underdiagnosis ([Prerna's Civic Life Blogs, 2025](https://sites.psu.edu/prernascivicblogs/2025/04/19/mental-health-in-nursing-homes-the-silent-struggle/)). Stigma surrounding mental illness in long-term care settings further hinders residents from receiving appropriate care.

### Resource Constraints

Many nursing homes face staffing shortages, limited mental health expertise, and financial constraints that limit the scope and quality of mental health services ([Gray et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9976775/)). The pandemic exacerbated these issues, making it difficult to implement comprehensive mental health programs.

### Balancing Infection Control and Social Needs

Strict infection control measures necessary during the pandemic conflicted with residents' social and emotional needs. Finding a balance between safety and psychosocial well-being remains a challenge ([Simard, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8208072/)).

## Recommendations and Future Directions

### Prioritizing Mental Health as Integral to Care

Nursing homes must recognize mental health care as a core component of overall health care, not an adjunct. This includes routine mental health assessments and integrating mental health professionals into care teams.

### Expanding Training and Education

Ongoing education for staff on geriatric mental health, recognizing atypical symptoms, and reducing stigma is critical. Training should also address self-care and resilience for staff to mitigate burnout.

### Leveraging Technology

Telehealth and digital communication tools should be further developed and integrated to maintain social connections and provide mental health services, especially during periods of restricted visitation.

### Enhancing Community Partnerships

Collaborations with community organizations, mental health agencies, and families can support psychosocial programs and provide additional resources.

### Research and Policy Support

More research is needed to identify effective interventions tailored to nursing home residents' unique needs. Policymakers should allocate resources to support mental health services and workforce development in long-term care.

## Conclusion

Nursing homes have faced unprecedented challenges in addressing elderly residents' mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic exacerbated mental health issues through isolation and anxiety, it also catalyzed innovations in care delivery, including enhanced staff training, psychosocial programs, telehealth, and community collaboration. Despite ongoing challenges such as resource limitations and stigma, these efforts represent significant progress toward improving mental health care in nursing homes. Continued commitment to integrating mental health into comprehensive care, supporting staff well-being, and leveraging technology will be essential to sustaining and advancing these gains.
