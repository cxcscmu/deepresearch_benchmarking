# How Society Contributes to Anorexia: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex eating disorder characterized by severe weight loss, an intense fear of gaining weight, and distorted body image. While genetic and psychological factors play roles in its development, sociocultural influences are significant contributors to the onset and maintenance of anorexia. This report aims to provide an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of how societal factors contribute to anorexia, drawing from recent and reliable research. The focus is on sociocultural norms, media influence, family and peer dynamics, and broader cultural and environmental pressures that shape body image and eating behaviors.

## Sociocultural Factors and Anorexia

### Internalization of Sociocultural Beauty Ideals

One of the most critical sociocultural contributors to anorexia is the internalization of societal beauty ideals, particularly the thin ideal promoted by mass media. Studies have consistently shown that women who internalize these ideals are more likely to engage in behaviors aimed at achieving an unrealistic body shape, which can escalate into anorexia readiness syndrome (ARS) and eventually diagnosable anorexia nervosa (ARS) ([Oketah et al., 2021](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-021-00410-y)). Internalization involves adopting the thin ideal as a personal standard, leading to excessive body monitoring, dieting, and emotional distress related to body dissatisfaction.

The degree of internalization correlates strongly with anorectic behaviors. For instance, Polish women in a large-scale study (N=1533) showed that higher internalization and sociocultural pressure predicted greater ARS symptoms, which are precursors to anorexia ([Oketah et al., 2021](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-021-00410-y)). This suggests that societal messages about beauty do not merely influence attitudes but can actively promote pathological eating behaviors.

### Media Influence and Body Image

The media plays a pivotal role in shaping societal standards of beauty and body image. Since the 1950s, the ideal female body portrayed in media has become progressively thinner, creating an increasing discrepancy between the media ideal and the average woman’s body size ([Garner et al., 1980; Spitzer et al., 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2533817/)). This discrepancy fosters "normative discontent," a term describing the widespread dissatisfaction with body image among women in Western societies.

Experimental and longitudinal studies confirm that media exposure leads to body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and disordered eating behaviors ([Stice et al., 1994; Tiggemann, 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2533817/)). For example, adolescent girls who frequently read fashion magazines are twice as likely to diet and three times as likely to initiate exercise programs to lose weight compared to infrequent readers ([Utter et al., 2003](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2533817/)).

Moreover, individuals with anorexia often report heavy media use, describing fashion magazines as "how-to" manuals for achieving thinness, which reinforces their restrictive behaviors ([Thomsen et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2533817/)). This cyclical relationship between media consumption and eating disorder symptoms highlights the media’s role not only in the development but also in the maintenance of anorexia.

### Sociocultural Pressure and Peer Influence

Beyond media, sociocultural pressure from family, peers, and cultural norms significantly influences anorexia development. Family attitudes toward weight control, parental emphasis on slimness, and familial interaction patterns can predispose individuals to disordered eating ([Chadda, 1987](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3172455/)). Peer pressure, especially among youth, also contributes by reinforcing appearance-related comparisons and dieting behaviors ([Oketah et al., 2021](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-021-00410-y)).

The assimilation of these pressures often leads to body dissatisfaction and ARS. For example, peer groups that value thinness can intensify social comparison, increasing the risk of anorexia ([Ata et al., 2007](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-021-00410-y)). Such social environments create a feedback loop where individuals feel compelled to conform to restrictive eating and exercise regimens to gain acceptance.

### Cultural and Ethnic Influences

Cultural beliefs and attitudes shape body image ideals and eating behaviors, influencing anorexia prevalence and expression across different populations. Cross-cultural studies indicate that rapid Westernization and exposure to Western media increase vulnerability to eating disorders among ethnic minorities and immigrant populations ([Becker et al., 2002; Wildes et al., 2001](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6382562/)). The shift from valuing fuller body types to thinness in industrialized societies exemplifies how cultural change can precipitate eating disorders.

However, the universality of thinness as an ideal is debated. For instance, in women aged 30 and older, high internalization of sociocultural appearance standards may be linked to greater body satisfaction, suggesting age and cultural context modulate these effects ([Sociocultural Appearance Standards and Risk Factors, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5885084/)).

### Social Media and Emerging Trends

The rise of social media has intensified the impact of sociocultural factors on anorexia. Platforms that emphasize appearance, such as Instagram and TikTok, facilitate social comparison, thin/fit ideal internalization, and self-objectification, all of which mediate the relationship between social media use and eating disorders ([PLOS Global Public Health, 2023](https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001091)). Specific social media trends and pro-eating disorder content exacerbate risks, especially among females, individuals with high BMI, and those with pre-existing body image concerns.

Conversely, higher social media literacy and body appreciation can serve as protective factors, indicating that education and critical engagement with media content may mitigate some negative effects.

## Psychological and Personality Factors Interacting with Sociocultural Influences

Personality traits, particularly neuroticism, interact with sociocultural pressures to increase anorexia risk. Neuroticism, characterized by emotional instability and negative affectivity, is associated with body dissatisfaction and ARS ([Oketah et al., 2021](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-021-00410-y)). Individuals high in neuroticism may be more susceptible to internalizing sociocultural ideals and experiencing emotional distress related to body image, thereby engaging in disordered eating behaviors.

## Family Role and Societal Support

Families are a critical social group influencing anorexia development and recovery. Parental attitudes toward dieting and body image can either exacerbate or alleviate risk ([More-Love.org, 2021](https://more-love.org/2021/01/27/does-society-cause-eating-disorders/)). Supportive family environments that reject diet culture and promote body acceptance are protective.

However, parents often face challenges in recognizing anorexia symptoms and navigating treatment options, as highlighted in qualitative studies exploring parental perspectives on adolescent anorexia treatment ([Oketah et al., 2023](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-023-00910-z)). Societal systems must support families through education, accessible treatment, and stigma reduction to improve outcomes.

## Societal Norms and the Perpetuation of Eating Disorders

Society perpetuates eating disorders through entrenched norms and beliefs about gender, beauty, and health. Women are expected to be small and thin, while men are expected to be strong, creating gendered pressures that contribute to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating ([More-Love.org, 2021](https://more-love.org/2021/01/27/does-society-cause-eating-disorders/)). Diet culture, which glorifies weight loss and perfectionism, further normalizes harmful behaviors.

The media and cultural institutions often fail to challenge these norms, instead reinforcing them through advertising, entertainment, and social messaging. This systemic issue requires broad societal change to promote body positivity and diversity.

## Prevention and Intervention Implications

Given the strong sociocultural contribution to anorexia, prevention efforts must focus on reducing internalization of unrealistic beauty ideals and sociocultural pressure. Media literacy programs, advocacy for diverse body representations, and education on healthy body image are essential.

Early intervention should involve families and communities, providing support to counteract harmful societal messages. Mental health services must be accessible and culturally sensitive, addressing the complex interplay of sociocultural and psychological factors.

## Conclusion

Society contributes profoundly to the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa through multiple interconnected pathways. The internalization of thin ideals, pervasive media influence, sociocultural pressure from family and peers, and cultural shifts toward Westernized beauty standards create an environment conducive to disordered eating. Social media has amplified these effects, making anorexia a pressing global public health concern.

Personality traits such as neuroticism interact with these societal factors, increasing vulnerability. Families play a dual role as potential risk or protective factors, highlighting the importance of societal support systems.

Addressing anorexia requires comprehensive societal change, including media reform, education, family support, and accessible treatment. Only through acknowledging and mitigating these sociocultural contributors can we hope to reduce the prevalence and impact of anorexia nervosa.
