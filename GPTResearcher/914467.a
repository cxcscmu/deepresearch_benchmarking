# Why Is Same-Sex Marriage Illegal? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue in the United States and worldwide, involving legal, social, political, and religious dimensions. While the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015 through *Obergefell v. Hodges*, same-sex marriage remains illegal or unrecognized in some states due to constitutional amendments, statutes, or political resistance. This report explores the reasons why same-sex marriage has been and, in some places, remains illegal. It examines historical legal frameworks, sociopolitical motivations, institutional influences, and ongoing challenges, supported by recent data and scholarly analysis.

## Historical and Legal Background

### Early Legal Restrictions and State Bans

The initial resistance to same-sex marriage in the U.S. took the form of state laws and constitutional amendments explicitly banning same-sex unions. For example, Hawaii and Alaska were among the first states to pass constitutional amendments related to marriage restrictions in 1998, with Alaska defining marriage strictly as between one man and one woman ([Ballotpedia, 2025](https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_same-sex_marriage_ballot_measures)). By 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage following the *Goodridge v. Department of Public Health* decision, which triggered a wave of conservative backlash and the enactment of bans in many states ([U.S. Constitution.net, 2025](https://www.usconstitution.net/constitution-and-same-sex-marriage/)).

### Federal Legislation and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) of 1996 defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, allowing states to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages performed elsewhere and denying federal benefits to same-sex couples ([The Court Said, 2025](https://thecourtsaid.org/obergefell-v-hodges-the-legalization-of-same-sex-marriage-in-america/)). DOMA institutionalized the illegality of same-sex marriage at the federal level until the Supreme Court partially struck it down in *United States v. Windsor* (2013), which recognized federal benefits for legally married same-sex couples but did not invalidate state bans.

### Supreme Court Legalization and Ongoing State-Level Resistance

The landmark *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015) decision declared same-sex marriage a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment, invalidating all state bans and mandating nationwide recognition ([U.S. Constitution.net, 2025](https://www.usconstitution.net/constitution-and-same-sex-marriage/)). Despite this, many states still have constitutional or statutory bans on same-sex marriage on the books, which remain unenforceable but symbolize continued opposition. As of 2025, thirteen states have not legalized same-sex marriage through legislation, including Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/same-sex-marriage-states)).

## Reasons for Illegality of Same-Sex Marriage

### 1. Constitutional and Statutory Bans at the State Level

A primary reason for the illegality of same-sex marriage in many states is the presence of constitutional amendments or statutes explicitly banning such unions. Approximately 26 states have constitutional bans on same-sex marriage or other types of unions, and 30 states have statutory bans, though all are currently unenforceable due to *Obergefell* ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_constitutional_amendments_banning_same-sex_unions)).

These bans were often enacted in response to judicial rulings favoring marriage equality in other states or countries, motivated by fears that courts would impose same-sex marriage on unwilling states. For example, after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2003, many states passed bans to preempt similar court decisions ([Oxford Research Encyclopedia, 2025](https://oxfordre.com/politics/politics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1226)).

### 2. Sociopolitical and Cultural Opposition

Opposition to same-sex marriage is deeply rooted in sociopolitical and cultural beliefs. Many opponents argue that marriage is traditionally and legally defined as a union between one man and one woman, often citing religious, moral, or procreation-based reasons. For instance, some conservative lawmakers and religious groups view same-sex marriage as contrary to their beliefs and societal norms ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/procon/gay-marriage-debate)).

The persistence of these views has translated into political action, including ballot initiatives, legislative bans, and constitutional amendments. The Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA), which sought to define marriage federally as between a man and a woman, was introduced multiple times in Congress but failed to pass, reflecting the divide in public opinion ([U.S. Constitution.net, 2025](https://www.usconstitution.net/constitution-and-same-sex-marriage/)).

### 3. Institutional and Political Factors

State institutions and political dynamics significantly influence the legality of same-sex marriage. The policymaking process in states varies, with some legislatures more inclined toward progressive policies and others toward conservative restrictions. Political party control, public opinion, and institutional structures affect whether states adopt marriage equality or bans ([Oxford Research Encyclopedia, 2025](https://oxfordre.com/politics/politics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1226)).

Moreover, some states have introduced new types of marriage, such as "covenant marriage," which restricts marriage to opposite-sex couples and imposes additional requirements, effectively excluding same-sex couples from this category ([The Conversation, 2025](https://theconversation.com/same-sex-marriage-is-under-attack-by-state-lawmakers-emboldened-by-trumps-anti-lgbtq-measures-and-the-supreme-courts-willingness-to-overturn-precedent-252154)).

### 4. Legal Uncertainty and Fear of Reversal

The Supreme Court's conservative shift and recent decisions, such as *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022), which overturned *Roe v. Wade*, have emboldened some lawmakers to challenge *Obergefell*. Symbolic resolutions urging the Supreme Court to overturn *Obergefell* have been introduced in multiple states, reflecting fears that marriage equality could be rescinded ([The Conversation, 2025](https://theconversation.com/same-sex-marriage-is-under-attack-by-state-lawmakers-emboldened-by-trumps-anti-lgbtq-measures-and-the-supreme-courts-willingness-to-overturn-precedent-252154)).

If *Obergefell* were overturned, states with bans still in their constitutions—such as Michigan—could immediately reinstate prohibitions on same-sex marriage without new legislative action ([NBC News, 2025](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/lawmakers-9-states-propose-measures-undermine-sex-marriage-rights-rcna193743)).

### 5. Religious Freedom and Conscience Clauses

Some states have enacted laws permitting government officials and service providers to refuse services related to same-sex marriage based on religious beliefs. By 2017, twelve states allowed such denials, which complicates the practical realization of marriage equality and reflects ongoing institutional resistance ([PMC, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8101749/)).

This legal accommodation of religious objections contributes to the illegality or non-recognition of same-sex marriages in certain contexts and perpetuates social and legal inequalities.

## Social and Psychological Impacts of Illegality

The illegality or non-recognition of same-sex marriage has profound psychosocial effects on LGBTQ+ individuals. Research indicates that legal recognition provides a sense of security, stability, and social legitimacy, while bans or non-recognition contribute to stigma, discrimination, and psychological stress ([PMC, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8101749/)).

Conversely, the persistence of bans and the threat of legal reversal create uncertainty and fear among same-sex couples, affecting their well-being and social acceptance ([PMC, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8101749/)).

## Current Trends and Future Outlook

Despite *Obergefell*, efforts to undermine same-sex marriage continue in some states, particularly those with conservative legislatures. However, public support for same-sex marriage has increased to about 70% nationally ([The Conversation, 2025](https://theconversation.com/same-sex-marriage-is-under-attack-by-state-lawmakers-emboldened-by-trumps-anti-lgbtq-measures-and-the-supreme-courts-willingness-to-overturn-precedent-252154)).

Some states are proactively repealing outdated bans to safeguard marriage equality against potential Supreme Court reversals, as seen in Nevada's 2020 repeal of its constitutional ban ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_law_in_the_United_States_by_state)).

## Conclusion

Same-sex marriage remains illegal in some U.S. states primarily due to constitutional and statutory bans rooted in historical, cultural, religious, and political opposition. Institutional factors and fears of legal reversal further complicate the landscape. Although federally legalized, the persistence of bans and legislative efforts to undermine marriage equality reflect ongoing societal divisions. The issue remains dynamic, with public opinion increasingly favoring marriage equality, but legal and political challenges continuing to threaten its permanence.
