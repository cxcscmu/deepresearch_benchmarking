# Report: How COVID-19 Shutdowns, Virtual School, and Remote Work Changed Our Relationship to Technology

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in early 2020, precipitated unprecedented global disruptions across social, economic, and educational domains. Among the most profound shifts was the rapid and widespread adoption of digital technologies in education and work, fundamentally altering how individuals engage with technology. This report examines how COVID-19 shutdowns, virtual schooling, and remote work have transformed our relationship with technology, drawing on recent empirical studies and authoritative analyses. The report highlights the acceleration of digital adoption, the challenges and inequities exposed, and the evolving expectations surrounding technology use in education and the workforce.

## Accelerated Digital Transformation in Education

### Rapid Integration of Technology in K-12 Education

Before the pandemic, many schools were gradually integrating digital tools into classrooms. However, the abrupt closure of schools in March 2020 forced an immediate and comprehensive shift to remote learning. This transition necessitated the widespread adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Google Classroom and Schoology, video conferencing platforms like Zoom, and various educational software almost overnight ([Jacob & Stanojevich, 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rewiring-the-classroom-how-the-covid-19-pandemic-transformed-k-12-education/)).

Even after the return to in-person instruction by 2022, the reliance on digital tools persisted. Over 70% of teachers reported that students were assigned personal devices, with this figure rising to over 80% in secondary schools. LMS platforms have become mainstays, especially in middle and high schools, indicating a permanent shift in instructional modalities ([Jacob & Stanojevich, 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rewiring-the-classroom-how-the-covid-19-pandemic-transformed-k-12-education/)).

### Impact on Teaching and Learning Practices

The pandemic catalyzed innovative approaches to educational technology (edtech), fostering a new era of teaching and learning. Digital literacy became a critical educational goal, and data-driven decision-making gained prominence. AI technologies began to be integrated to personalize learning, assist with assignments, and reduce administrative burdens on educators ([eSchool News, 2025](https://www.eschoolnews.com/digital-learning/2025/03/17/post-pandemic-a-new-era-of-teaching-and-learning/)).

However, this transformation also raised concerns about the role of private sector edtech products in public education and potential losses in instructional quality when teachers rely heavily on software for teaching ([Jacob & Stanojevich, 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rewiring-the-classroom-how-the-covid-19-pandemic-transformed-k-12-education/)).

### Exacerbation of the Digital Divide and Educational Inequities

The shift to remote learning exposed and intensified pre-existing disparities in access to technology and internet connectivity, known as the digital divide. Marginalized and low-income students often lacked reliable access to devices and broadband, leading to uneven engagement with remote schooling and widening achievement gaps ([Anderson et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259090/)).

For example, only about two-thirds of youth in U.S. households earning less than $25,000 had adequate computer and internet access for remote learning. This lack of access resulted in some students missing out entirely on schooling during lockdowns or relying on less effective paper-based materials ([Anderson et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259090/)).

Students with disabilities faced additional challenges due to inaccessible technology and interruptions in specialized services, negatively impacting their educational outcomes ([Anderson et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259090/)). These inequities underscore the necessity for targeted policies to bridge the digital divide and support vulnerable learners.

## Transformation of Work Through Remote Technologies

### Widespread Adoption of Remote Work Platforms

Prior to COVID-19, remote work was relatively uncommon and often considered a privilege. The pandemic forced a rapid and large-scale adoption of remote work technologies, including cloud computing, video conferencing, and collaboration platforms, transforming work environments globally ([Venkatesh et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519525/)).

By May 2021, when pandemic restrictions eased, many employees had substantial experience with remote work platforms, enabling researchers to analyze behavioral intentions and expectations regarding their continued use. Studies found that factors such as behavioral intention, behavioral expectation, and facilitating conditions were key determinants of remote work adoption, moderated by demographics like gender and generational differences ([Venkatesh et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519525/)).

### Strategic Resilience and Organizational Adaptation

Remote work technologies became instrumental in achieving strategic resilience during the crisis. Organizations invested heavily in IT infrastructure to support remote operations and adapted workflows to align with virtual modalities ([Rusinko, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519525/)).

The IT sector, in particular, experienced a rapid shift to virtual collaboration, with long-term effects on productivity, employee well-being, and office space requirements. Challenges such as digital fatigue and the need for effective virtual collaboration tools emerged as critical areas for ongoing innovation ([Emerald Insight, 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/s1572-832320240000034021/full/html)).

### Psychological and Economic Impacts on Employees

The sudden shift to remote work also had significant psychological and economic effects on employees. While digital technologies enabled continuity, workers faced new stressors related to isolation, work-life balance, and adapting to digital tools. The economic impacts, including changes in commuting costs and workspace expenses, varied widely ([Wang et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9186428/)).

Understanding these impacts is essential for designing supportive policies and technologies that enhance employee well-being and productivity in hybrid or fully remote work models.

## Changing Expectations and the New Normal

### Permanent Integration of Technology in Education and Work

The pandemic has created a "new normal" where digital technologies are deeply embedded in education and work. In K-12 education, technology use is no longer supplementary but foundational, with ongoing integration of AI and personalized learning tools. Similarly, remote work platforms have become standard components of organizational infrastructure ([Boyte, 2025](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/04/13/covid-19-created-a-new-normal-in-education-five-years-later/81761326007/)).

### Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the benefits, challenges persist, including managing behavioral issues in students post-pandemic, addressing inequities in technology access, and ensuring that technology enhances rather than replaces human interaction in education ([Jacob & Stanojevich, 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rewiring-the-classroom-how-the-covid-19-pandemic-transformed-k-12-education/)).

In the workplace, organizations must balance the advantages of remote work with the need to maintain corporate culture, collaboration, and employee mental health ([Venkatesh et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519525/)).

### Future Directions

The experience of the pandemic underscores the importance of digital literacy, equitable access to technology, and adaptive strategies for integrating technology in education and work. Policymakers and practitioners must focus on closing the digital divide, supporting educators and workers in technology use, and fostering innovative approaches that leverage technology's potential while mitigating its drawbacks ([Anderson et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10259090/); [eSchool News, 2025](https://www.eschoolnews.com/digital-learning/2025/03/17/post-pandemic-a-new-era-of-teaching-and-learning/)).

## Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally reshaped our relationship with technology in education and work. It accelerated digital adoption, making technology indispensable in classrooms and workplaces. However, it also exposed and exacerbated inequities, particularly the digital divide in education, and introduced new challenges related to psychological well-being and effective technology integration.

Moving forward, the lessons learned during the pandemic provide a roadmap for building more resilient, equitable, and innovative educational and work environments. Embracing technology thoughtfully and inclusively will be critical to harnessing its full potential in the post-pandemic world.
