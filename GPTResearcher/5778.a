# Why Do People Commit Domestic Violence? A Comprehensive Analysis

Domestic violence (DV) is a pervasive social problem characterized by a pattern of physical, sexual, psychological, emotional, financial, and technological abuse within intimate or familial relationships. Understanding why people commit domestic violence is critical for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. This report synthesizes current research and empirical findings to provide a detailed, evidence-based exploration of the causes and contributing factors of domestic violence, emphasizing the complex interplay of individual, relational, socio-economic, and cultural determinants.

## 1. Introduction

Domestic violence is a deliberate behavior used by an abuser to gain and maintain power and control over another individual, typically an intimate partner or family member. It affects millions worldwide, transcending cultural, economic, and social boundaries. In the United States alone, approximately 10 million people experience domestic violence annually ([Kubala, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/causes-of-domestic-violence)). Despite its prevalence, the reasons behind such abusive behaviors are multifaceted and rooted in a combination of learned behaviors, psychological issues, socio-economic factors, and cultural norms.

## 2. Learned Behavior and Intergenerational Transmission

One of the most consistent findings in domestic violence research is that abusive behavior is often learned. Individuals who grow up in households where violence is present—either as direct victims or witnesses—are more likely to perpetrate or experience intimate partner violence (IPV) in adulthood. This phenomenon is known as the intergenerational cycle of abuse.

- **Childhood Exposure to Abuse:** Experiencing or witnessing abuse during childhood significantly increases the risk of both IPV perpetration and victimization later in life. For example, children who witness violence may adopt similar conflict-resolution strategies, normalizing violence as an acceptable means of control ([Costa et al., 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-022-00451-0); [Sen, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10513418/)).

- **Type-Specific Continuity:** There is evidence of homogeneity in the type of abuse experienced and perpetrated; psychological abuse in childhood predicts psychological IPV in adulthood ([Costa et al., 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-022-00451-0)).

However, it is important to note that not all individuals exposed to childhood abuse become abusers, indicating that additional mediating and moderating factors influence outcomes.

## 3. Psychological and Emotional Factors

Psychological health plays a pivotal role in domestic violence dynamics. Mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, stress, personality disorders, and substance abuse are frequently associated with abusive behavior.

- **Mental Health Issues:** Depression and other psychological problems are significant risk factors for domestic violence perpetration. Abusers may experience destructive thought processes, including a "critical inner voice" that justifies controlling or violent behavior toward partners ([Van de Velde et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10513418/); [Kubala, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/causes-of-domestic-violence)).

- **Coercive Control:** A subtype of psychological IPV, coercive control involves ongoing patterns of domination that severely impact victims' mental health, including increased risks of PTSD and depression ([Bubriski-McKenzie & Jasinski, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10666508/)).

- **Personality and Behavioral Traits:** Traits such as low self-esteem, insecurity, anger management difficulties, and substance use can contribute to an individual's propensity for violence, although these do not deterministically cause abuse ([Psych Central, 2023](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-causes-domestic-violence)).

## 4. Socio-Economic and Demographic Factors

Socio-economic disparities and demographic characteristics are strongly linked to domestic violence prevalence.

- **Economic Stress and Employment:** Economic hardship, unemployment, and financial stress increase domestic violence risk. Notably, increases in male unemployment rates correlate with higher physical violence incidence, while female unemployment may reduce violence, possibly due to shifts in household power dynamics ([PMC10513418](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10513418/)).

- **Education and Income Levels:** Low education and income levels are associated with increased IPV risk. Limited access to education can perpetuate beliefs supporting gender inequality and violence ([CDC, 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html); [Kubala, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/causes-of-domestic-violence)).

- **Substance Abuse:** Alcohol and drug abuse are prevalent among perpetrators and exacerbate violent behavior. For instance, alcohol abuse was found in over 50% of domestic violence cases in Montenegro ([PMC10362826](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10362826/)).

- **Marital Dissatisfaction and Jealousy:** Relationship dissatisfaction, obsessive jealousy, and separation or divorce proceedings are common contextual factors preceding domestic violence incidents ([PMC10362826](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10362826/)).

## 5. Cultural and Gender Norms

Cultural beliefs and gender ideologies significantly influence domestic violence dynamics.

- **Gender Inequality:** Societies with entrenched gender inequality and patriarchal norms often exhibit higher rates of domestic violence. Men may feel entitled to control women, and traditional gender roles can legitimize abusive behavior ([Kubala, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/causes-of-domestic-violence); [PMC10362826](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10362826/)).

- **Power and Control Dynamics:** Domestic violence is fundamentally about power and control. Abusers use violence and manipulation to dismantle equality in relationships, making victims feel less valuable and easier to dominate ([The National Domestic Violence Hotline, 2023](https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/why-do-people-abuse/)).

- **Social Acceptance and Justification:** In some cultures, victims may justify or tolerate partner violence due to societal acceptance or stigma against leaving abusive relationships ([PMC8252169](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8252169/)).

---

## 6. Situational and Contextual Factors

Certain situational stressors can escalate the risk or severity of domestic violence.

- **Pandemic and Crisis Contexts:** The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated household stressors such as economic hardship, social isolation, and mental health issues, intensifying domestic violence risks ([PMC10513418](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10513418/)).

- **Household Density and Chores:** Crowded living conditions and retention tendencies (e.g., household chores) have been studied as factors influencing domestic violence, possibly due to increased conflict opportunities ([PMC10513418](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10513418/)).

- **Substance Use and Criminal History:** History of violent crimes and substance use among perpetrators are common in domestic violence cases, indicating overlapping behavioral risk factors ([PMC10362826](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10362826/)).

## 7. Summary and Opinion

The causes of domestic violence are complex and multifactorial. It is clear from the reviewed literature that domestic violence is not caused by a single factor but rather emerges from an interplay of learned behaviors, psychological vulnerabilities, socio-economic stressors, cultural norms, and situational pressures.

**Key points:**

- Domestic violence is primarily a learned behavior rooted in childhood exposure to violence and reinforced by societal and cultural norms that tolerate or justify abuse.

- Psychological factors, including mental health disorders and personality traits, contribute to the propensity for abuse but do not excuse it.

- Socio-economic disadvantages and stressors, particularly those affecting men’s employment and economic status, are significant contributors.

- Patriarchal cultural frameworks and gender inequality are foundational in perpetuating domestic violence by legitimizing male dominance and control.

- Situational factors such as crises (e.g., pandemics) and household dynamics can exacerbate existing risks.

In my assessment, effective prevention and intervention must address these multiple layers simultaneously. Policies should focus on breaking the intergenerational cycle of abuse through early childhood interventions, improving mental health support, promoting gender equality, and alleviating socio-economic disparities. Moreover, cultural change is essential to dismantle norms that condone violence and control.
