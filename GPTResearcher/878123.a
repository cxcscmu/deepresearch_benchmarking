# National and Local Policies That Help Protect People from Abuse: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Safeguarding individuals from abuse is a critical concern in both national and local contexts. Abuse can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, financial, and neglect, and it affects vulnerable populations such as children, adults with disabilities, and the elderly. To address these challenges, governments and agencies have developed a range of legislative frameworks, policies, and local systems designed to prevent abuse, protect victims, and promote wellbeing. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the key national and local policies that help protect people from abuse, with a focus on the United Kingdom and the United States, based on the most recent and reliable sources available as of 2025.

## National Policies for Safeguarding and Protection from Abuse

### United Kingdom

In the UK, safeguarding policies are underpinned by comprehensive legislation and national frameworks that guide local authorities, health services, and partner agencies in protecting vulnerable individuals.

#### Legislative Framework

1. **The Care Act 2014**  
   This act is foundational in adult safeguarding, placing statutory duties on local authorities to investigate and respond to abuse or neglect. It establishes Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs) to coordinate multi-agency efforts and emphasizes partnership working to promote wellbeing ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

2. **Mental Capacity Act 2005 and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS)**  
   These laws protect individuals who lack the capacity to make decisions, ensuring any restrictions on liberty are lawful and in the person's best interests ([Active Social Care Ltd](https://activesocialcare.com/handbook/safeguarding-adults/legislation-local-national-policies-procedures-relate-safeguarding-adults/)).

3. **Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006**  
   This act regulates the vetting and barring of individuals working with vulnerable adults and children, ensuring that those with a history of abuse are prevented from working in care settings ([Sage-Advices, 2019](https://sage-advices.com/what-are-the-national-policies-that-relate-to-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

4. **Equality Act 2010**  
   Protects individuals from discriminatory abuse and promotes equality in care and safeguarding services ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

5. **Modern Slavery Act 2015 and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Act 2003**  
   These laws target specific forms of abuse such as human trafficking, forced labor, and FGM, providing legal mechanisms to prosecute offenders and protect victims ([DSDWEB](https://dsdweb.co.uk/level-2-diploma-in-care/safeguarding-and-protection-in-care-settings/identify-relevant-legislation-national-policies-and-local-systems-that-relate-to-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

#### National Policy Frameworks

- **Government Statement of Policy on Adult Safeguarding**  
  This guidance outlines six key principles: empowerment, protection, prevention, proportionality, partnership, and accountability. These principles shape local safeguarding policies and multi-agency collaboration ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

- **ADASS Safeguarding Adults National Framework**  
  Developed by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), this framework supports the implementation of safeguarding duties and promotes best practices across local authorities ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

- **No Secrets (2000)**  
  Although superseded by later legislation, this guidance laid the groundwork for multi-agency safeguarding policies and remains influential in shaping local procedures ([Active Social Care Ltd](https://activesocialcare.com/handbook/safeguarding-adults/legislation-local-national-policies-procedures-relate-safeguarding-adults/)).

- **Making Safeguarding Personal (Local Government Association)**  
  This initiative promotes an outcomes-based approach, ensuring safeguarding efforts are person-centered and respect individual preferences ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

### United States

In the U.S., federal laws and policies provide a framework for child protection and welfare, with significant funding and regulatory oversight supporting state and local agencies.

#### Key Federal Legislation

1. **Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA)**  
   CAPTA sets national standards for child protection, provides funding for child protective services (CPS), and supports research and prevention programs. It mandates states to have procedures for reporting and investigating child abuse ([Administration for Children and Families, 2024](https://acf.gov/cb/laws-policies)).

2. **Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)** and **Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act**  
   These laws provide protections and support services for victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and trafficking, enhancing legal frameworks for accountability ([NCACIA, 2024](https://www.ncacia.org/post/the-role-of-public-policy-in-preventing-child-abuse-and-supporting-survivors)).

3. **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)** and **Title IV-E of the Social Security Act**  
   These funding sources support child welfare services, foster care, and family support programs, with TANF offering more flexible funding options for prevention and intervention ([U.S. GAO, 2025](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107467)).

#### Federal Policy and Prevention Programs

- **Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program**  
  This program funds home visitation services to at-risk families to prevent abuse before it occurs ([NCACIA, 2024](https://www.ncacia.org/post/the-role-of-public-policy-in-preventing-child-abuse-and-supporting-survivors)).

- **Economic Supports**  
  Policies such as childcare subsidies, living wages, paid family leave, and tax credits aim to reduce financial stressors that contribute to child maltreatment ([Prevent Child Abuse America, 2024](https://preventchildabuse.org/what-we-do/public-policy/)).

## Local Systems and Policies

### United Kingdom

Local authorities have statutory responsibilities to lead safeguarding efforts within their communities. Their roles include:

- Leading multi-agency safeguarding adult systems to prevent abuse and respond promptly when it occurs ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

- Operating Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs) that include representatives from health, social care, police, and other agencies to coordinate safeguarding activities ([Care Learning, 2024](https://carelearning.org.uk/qualifications/level-2-diploma-care/safeguarding-protection-care/4-1-identify-relevant-legislation-national-policies-and-local-systems-that-relate-to-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

- Implementing local policies that reflect national principles and legislation, including safe recruitment practices (such as Disclosure and Barring Service checks), maintaining safe environments, and recording and reviewing concerns ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

- Collaborating with health services to promote wellbeing and protect adults at risk ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

Examples of local policies include the **West Yorkshire Joint Multi-agency Safeguarding Adults Policy**, which provides detailed procedures for safeguarding adults across multiple local authorities ([Active Social Care Ltd](https://activesocialcare.com/handbook/safeguarding-adults/legislation-local-national-policies-procedures-relate-safeguarding-adults/)).

### United States

At the state and local levels, child welfare agencies implement federal laws through:

- Child Protective Services (CPS) that investigate reports of abuse and neglect.

- Foster care systems that provide temporary care for children removed from unsafe environments.

- Local prevention programs funded by federal grants, such as Community Based Child Abuse Prevention (CBCAP) grants ([Administration for Children and Families, 2024](https://acf.gov/cb/laws-policies)).

- Coordination with health, education, and social services to provide comprehensive support to children and families.

For example, in North Carolina, children entering foster care must undergo medical evaluations within specified timeframes, but caregivers face barriers such as difficulty securing appointments and accessing health records. Policies aimed at improving caregiver support and streamlining access to services are critical to addressing these challenges ([Bass Connections, 2025](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project/policy-strategies-address-child-maltreatment-and-foster-care-2025-2026/)).

## The Role of Public Policy in Prevention and Support

Public policy plays a pivotal role not only in responding to abuse but also in preventing it. Effective policies address root causes such as poverty, parental stress, and lack of support services.

- **Early Intervention Programs** such as home visiting and parenting education reduce risk factors for abuse ([NCACIA, 2024](https://www.ncacia.org/post/the-role-of-public-policy-in-preventing-child-abuse-and-supporting-survivors)).

- **Economic Supports** like tax credits, living wages, and paid family leave help alleviate financial pressures that can lead to neglect and abuse ([Prevent Child Abuse America, 2024](https://preventchildabuse.org/what-we-do/public-policy/)).

- **Trauma-Informed Care and Legal Protections** ensure survivors receive long-term support and justice, as seen in policies like CAPTA and VAWA ([NCACIA, 2024](https://www.ncacia.org/post/the-role-of-public-policy-in-preventing-child-abuse-and-supporting-survivors)).

- **Multi-Agency Collaboration** ensures that safeguarding is a shared responsibility, improving communication and coordinated responses ([MassInitiative, 2020](https://massinitiative.org/what-is-the-national-and-local-context-of-safeguarding-and-protection-from-abuse/)).

## Critical Analysis and Opinion

The comprehensive legislative frameworks and policies in both the UK and the US demonstrate a robust commitment to safeguarding vulnerable populations. The UK’s Care Act 2014 and associated frameworks provide a clear statutory basis for adult safeguarding, emphasizing multi-agency collaboration and person-centered approaches. Similarly, the US federal laws such as CAPTA and VAWA offer strong protections for children and survivors of abuse.

However, challenges remain in the implementation and resourcing of these policies at the local level. For example, barriers faced by foster families in accessing timely health evaluations highlight gaps between policy intent and practical realities ([Bass Connections, 2025](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project/policy-strategies-address-child-maltreatment-and-foster-care-2025-2026/)). Moreover, while economic supports are recognized as critical preventive measures, disparities in access and funding persist, particularly among marginalized communities ([Prevent Child Abuse America, 2024](https://preventchildabuse.org/what-we-do/public-policy/)).

Therefore, while national and local policies provide a strong foundation, continuous evaluation, adequate funding, and community engagement are essential to ensure these policies translate into effective protection and prevention. Innovations such as Making Safeguarding Personal and outcome-based approaches should be expanded to enhance responsiveness and respect for individual autonomy.

## Conclusion

National and local policies play a vital role in protecting people from abuse by establishing legal frameworks, guiding multi-agency collaboration, and promoting preventive strategies. In the UK, legislation such as the Care Act 2014 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005, combined with national frameworks and local safeguarding boards, create a comprehensive system for adult safeguarding. In the US, federal laws including CAPTA and VAWA, alongside state and local child welfare systems, provide protections and support for children and families.

Despite these strengths, ongoing challenges in implementation, resource allocation, and addressing social determinants of abuse require sustained attention. Effective safeguarding demands not only robust policies but also their practical application, community involvement, and continuous policy evolution to meet emerging needs.
