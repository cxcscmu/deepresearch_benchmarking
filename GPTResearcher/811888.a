# Reliance on Third Parties’ Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a fundamental component of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) frameworks globally. It involves verifying the identity of customers, assessing risks, and continuously monitoring transactions to prevent illicit financial activities. Financial institutions and regulated entities often face operational challenges in conducting CDD entirely in-house, leading to the consideration of reliance on third parties’ CDD procedures. This report provides an in-depth, objective analysis of whether and under what conditions reliance on other parties’ CDD is permissible, the regulatory frameworks governing such reliance, associated risks, and best practices for compliance.

## Understanding Reliance on Third Parties in CDD

### Definition and Regulatory Context

Reliance on third parties in the context of CDD refers to a regulated entity using the CDD measures already conducted by another regulated party, rather than performing the checks independently. This concept is distinct from outsourcing, where a service provider performs CDD on behalf of the institution under its direct control and supervision.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendation 17 explicitly permits financial institutions to rely on third parties to perform CDD measures, provided certain criteria are met. The ultimate responsibility for the CDD remains with the relying institution, which must ensure the third party is regulated, supervised, or monitored and complies with relevant CDD and record-keeping requirements (CFATF, 2025).

Similarly, under the UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017, Regulation 39 provides a legal mechanism for reliance on CDD conducted by other ‘relevant persons’—regulated professionals subject to equivalent AML obligations (Bray, 2022).

### Distinction Between Reliance and Outsourcing

It is critical to distinguish reliance from outsourcing:

- **Reliance** entails placing trust in another regulated party’s independent CDD processes, which are separate from the relying institution’s procedures. The third party must consent to being relied upon and maintain responsibility for their own CDD (Bovill Newgate, 2023).

- **Outsourcing** involves delegating CDD tasks to a service provider who acts under the institution’s control, applying the institution’s procedures and subject to its supervision (CFATF, 2025).

This distinction impacts the degree of control, liability, and regulatory expectations placed on the relying institution.

## Conditions and Preconditions for Reliance

### Regulatory Criteria

FATF Recommendation 17 outlines specific conditions for reliance:

- The relying institution must immediately obtain all necessary information concerning the CDD elements performed by the third party (CFATF, 2025).

- The institution must be able to obtain copies of identification data and relevant documentation without delay upon request.

- The third party must be regulated, supervised, or monitored for compliance with CDD and record-keeping requirements aligned with FATF Recommendations 10 and 11.

- The country risk associated with the third party’s jurisdiction must be considered, with higher-risk countries requiring additional mitigation (CFATF, 2025).

In the UK, Regulation 39 mandates that reliance can only occur with a written agreement specifying the obligations of both parties, including timely provision of CDD documents upon request and compliance with record-keeping requirements (Bray, 2022; Today's Conveyancer, 2024).

### Consent and Agreement

Third parties must consent to being relied upon, formalized through written agreements. These agreements should:

- Confirm the scope and level of CDD performed.

- Ensure availability of CDD documentation within a specified timeframe (commonly within two days).

- Outline record retention responsibilities.

- Address confidentiality, data protection, and client consent for information sharing (Lexology, 2024; Bovill Newgate, 2023).

### Suitability and Due Diligence on the Third Party

Before relying on another party’s CDD, institutions must conduct adequate due diligence to verify:

- The third party’s regulatory status and AML compliance program.

- The robustness and currency of their CDD procedures.

- Their capacity to provide documentation and information promptly.

- Their risk assessment and mitigation approaches, ensuring alignment with the relying institution’s risk appetite (Financial Crime Academy, 2024; CFATF, 2025).

### Limitations on Reliance

Reliance is generally not suitable for all customer relationships or risk profiles. For example:

- High-risk customers or transactions often require enhanced due diligence (EDD) that may not be adequately covered by third-party CDD.

- Situations where circumstances may have changed since the original CDD was performed (e.g., changes in beneficial ownership, customer relocation).

- Cases involving politically exposed persons (PEPs), non-face-to-face onboarding, or customers from high-risk jurisdictions may necessitate direct CDD by the institution (AML-CFT.net, 2024).

## Risks and Challenges of Relying on Third-Party CDD

### Regulatory and Legal Liability

Despite reliance, the ultimate responsibility for compliance remains with the relying institution. If the third party’s CDD is deficient, the relying institution may face regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and potential criminal liability (Lexology, 2024; Today's Conveyancer, 2024).

### Risk of Outdated or Incomplete Information

Circumstances may change after the third party’s CDD, such as changes in ownership or risk profile, which the relying institution may not be immediately aware of. This increases the risk of undetected money laundering or terrorist financing activities (Bray, 2022).

### Data Protection and Confidentiality Concerns

Sharing customer information between parties raises data protection and client confidentiality issues. Explicit client consent and compliance with data privacy laws are essential to avoid breaches (Lexology, 2024).

### Operational and Compliance Complexity

Managing reliance agreements, ensuring timely access to documentation, and monitoring third-party compliance require robust policies, procedures, and oversight mechanisms. Failure to integrate these effectively can lead to compliance gaps (CFATF, 2025; ACA Group, 2025).

## Best Practices for Implementing Reliance on Third-Party CDD

### Establishing Formal Policies and Procedures

Institutions should develop comprehensive reliance policies as part of their AML framework, covering:

- Criteria for when reliance is appropriate or prohibited.

- Processes for obtaining authorization to enter reliance agreements (typically involving the MLRO or MLCO).

- Procedures for verifying the credentials and regulatory status of third parties.

- Documentation and record-keeping requirements.

- Training for staff on reliance protocols and associated risks (Jonathon Bray Ltd, 2022).

### Conducting Ongoing Monitoring and Risk Assessments

Reliance does not absolve the institution from ongoing monitoring obligations. Institutions must:

- Periodically reassess the third party’s compliance and risk profile.

- Monitor changes in customer risk factors.

- Update CDD information as necessary.

- Maintain a centralized inventory of third-party relationships for effective oversight (FINRA, 2025).

### Ensuring Prompt Access to Documentation

Reliance agreements should guarantee immediate access to CDD data and documents upon request, typically within two business days, to facilitate regulatory inspections and internal audits (Lexology, 2024).

### Leveraging Technology Solutions

Automated document verification, real-time sanctions screening, and centralized case management platforms can enhance the efficiency and reliability of reliance arrangements (First AML, 2025; Financial Crime Academy, 2024).

### Considering Group-Level Reliance

Where the third party is part of the same financial group and subject to group-wide AML/CFT programs and supervision, reliance may be more straightforward, with some regulatory authorities allowing mitigated country risk considerations (CFATF, 2025).

## Regulatory Updates and Industry Trends

Regulators such as FINRA have emphasized the increasing risks associated with third-party vendor relationships, including cybersecurity threats and operational disruptions. Updated supervisory expectations require firms to enhance third-party risk management, including due diligence, contract validation, and incident response planning (FINRA, 2025).

The FinCEN CDD Final Rule reinforces the importance of robust CDD policies and procedures, including when third-party services are involved, to prevent misuse of financial systems by criminals and terrorists (FinCEN, 2024).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of regulatory frameworks, guidance, and industry practices, **reliance on other people’s CDD procedures is permissible and can be an effective compliance strategy, but only under stringent conditions and with robust controls**. The relying institution must:

- Conduct thorough due diligence on the third party.

- Establish formal, written reliance agreements.

- Maintain ultimate responsibility and oversight for CDD compliance.

- Consider the risk profile of customers and jurisdictions involved.

- Ensure timely access to CDD documentation and records.

- Address confidentiality and data protection requirements.

While reliance can reduce duplication of effort and improve operational efficiency, it introduces risks that must be carefully managed. Institutions should not treat reliance as a default approach but rather as a strategic option within a comprehensive AML/CFT risk management framework.

Failure to adhere to these principles can expose institutions to significant regulatory, legal, and reputational risks. Therefore, reliance arrangements must be implemented with caution, supported by clear policies, ongoing monitoring, and appropriate technological tools.
