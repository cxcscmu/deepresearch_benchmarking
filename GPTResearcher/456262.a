# Are Gun Owners More Likely to Be Shot? An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The question of whether gun owners are more likely to be shot is critical in public health, policy, and social discourse. While firearms are often acquired for self-protection, research increasingly challenges the assumption that gun ownership reduces the risk of firearm-related injury or death. This report synthesizes recent and reliable evidence to assess the relationship between gun ownership and the risk of being shot, including homicide and suicide, with a focus on empirical data, risk factors, and contextual variables.

## Epidemiological Evidence on Gun Ownership and Risk of Being Shot

### Increased Risk of Homicide Among Gun Owners and Their Cohabitants

Multiple studies demonstrate that individuals living in homes with firearms, particularly handguns, face a significantly higher risk of firearm homicide compared to those in gun-free homes. A landmark study involving nearly 17.6 million registered voters in California found that people who lived with handgun owners were more than twice as likely to die by homicide than those living in homes without guns. Specifically, the homicide risk was 2.33 times higher for non-owners living with handgun owners, and the risk of firearm homicide was 2.83 times higher ([Studdert et al., 2022](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/04/handguns-homicide-risk.html)).

Moreover, homicides occurring at home were 4.44 times more likely to involve victims living with handgun owners compared to those in gun-free homes. This elevated risk is particularly pronounced in intimate partner violence (IPV) contexts, where victims living with gun owners were seven times more likely to be shot by a spouse or intimate partner, with 84% of these victims being women ([Studdert et al., 2022](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/04/handguns-homicide-risk.html); [TIME, 2022](https://time.com/6183881/gun-ownership-risks-at-home/)).

### Suicide Risk and Gun Ownership

Gun ownership is also strongly associated with increased suicide risk, primarily due to the lethality of firearms as a method. Men who own handguns are eight times more likely to die by firearm suicide than men who do not own handguns, and women handgun owners are 35 times more likely to die by firearm suicide compared to female non-owners ([Zhang et al., 2020](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/handgun-ownership-associated-with-much-higher-suicide-risk.html)).

The availability of firearms in the home increases the risk of suicide not only for owners but also for other household members, especially when mental health crises occur. This risk factor underscores the importance of safe storage and risk-based interventions such as temporary firearm removal during periods of elevated suicide risk ([Azrael et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8716056/)).

### Perceptions of Safety Versus Actual Risk

Despite the evidence, many gun owners perceive firearms as enhancing home safety. Surveys reveal that approximately 60% of Americans believe guns make homes safer, with gun owners more likely to hold this belief. However, research shows that these perceptions often depend on factors such as gun owner characteristics (training, temperament, mental health), firearm storage practices, and intended use ([Azrael et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8716056/)).

Notably, only a small percentage of respondents condition their safety perceptions on the presence of individuals at risk for injury, such as children or persons experiencing emotional crises, indicating a gap in risk awareness and messaging ([Azrael et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8716056/)).

## Mechanisms Underlying Increased Risk

### Firearm Accessibility and Lethality

Firearms in the home increase the risk of fatal outcomes in violent encounters, whether intentional or accidental. The presence of a gun escalates the lethality of conflicts, including domestic disputes and suicide attempts. The ease of access to a firearm during moments of crisis or conflict significantly raises the likelihood of fatal injury ([Kellermann et al., 1993](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10126989/)).

### Intimate Partner Violence and Firearms

Firearms are disproportionately involved in intimate partner homicides and injuries. Studies estimate that more than half of intimate partner homicides involve firearms, with gun access by perpetrators being a major risk factor for victimization ([Sabri et al., 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37226755/); [Anestis et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34714337/)).

The presence of firearms in abusive relationships increases the risk of homicide, with controlling behaviors, previous threats with weapons, and access to guns identified as key risk factors for intimate partner homicide ([Kim et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35260002/); [Petrosky et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28727682/)).

### Storage Practices and Training

Safe storage and owner proficiency are critical factors influencing risk. Gun owners who store firearms locked and unloaded reduce the risk of accidental or impulsive shootings. Training and responsible ownership practices can mitigate some risks, but evidence suggests that many owners do not consistently follow safe storage guidelines ([Azrael et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8716056/)).

## Ecological and State-Level Analyses

At the population level, studies examining gun ownership rates and firearm homicide rates across U.S. states show a positive association. States with higher gun ownership tend to have higher firearm homicide rates, although the strength of this association varies and is influenced by other factors such as crime rates and social capital ([Christopoulos et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10447772/); [Siegel et al., 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3828709/)).

Some recent analyses suggest that the direct effect of gun ownership on firearm homicide may be smaller than previously estimated, indicating the importance of considering confounding variables and effect modifiers in policy and prevention efforts ([Christopoulos et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10447772/)).

## Summary of Key Findings

| Aspect | Findings |
|--------|----------|
| Homicide Risk | Living with handgun owners doubles the risk of homicide; intimate partner homicides involving guns disproportionately affect women. |
| Suicide Risk | Handgun ownership increases firearm suicide risk by 8-fold in men and 35-fold in women. |
| Perceptions vs. Reality | Many owners believe guns increase safety, but evidence shows increased risk, especially when risk factors are present. |
| Risk Factors | Access during emotional crises, unsafe storage, lack of training, and IPV increase risk. |
| Population-Level Trends | Higher gun ownership correlates with higher firearm homicide rates, moderated by social and crime factors. |

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of recent and reliable studies, it is clear that gun owners—and importantly, those living in households with firearms—are more likely to be shot than individuals in gun-free homes. This increased risk manifests in higher rates of firearm homicide, particularly intimate partner homicide, and dramatically elevated suicide rates among gun owners.

The perception that firearms provide safety is not supported by empirical evidence; rather, firearms in the home introduce significant risks that outweigh potential protective benefits. The data strongly suggest that gun ownership is a substantial risk factor for firearm-related death, both for owners and their cohabitants.

Therefore, public health messaging and policy interventions should focus on increasing awareness of these risks, promoting safe storage and training, and implementing targeted risk reduction strategies such as extreme risk protection orders and temporary firearm removal during crises. Future research should continue to explore effect modifiers and social determinants to refine prevention efforts.
