# Why Are They Pushing Medicare Advantage Plans?  
## An In-Depth Analysis of the Drivers Behind the Medicare Advantage Promotion  

### Introduction  
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, also known as Medicare Part C, have seen a significant increase in enrollment over the past decade, with projections indicating continued growth. This managed care alternative to Original Medicare offers bundled benefits, including hospital (Part A), medical (Part B), and often prescription drug coverage (Part D), along with additional perks not available under traditional Medicare. The question arises: why is there a concerted push by various stakeholders, especially the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and private insurers, to promote Medicare Advantage plans? This report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the multifaceted reasons behind this push, examining economic incentives, policy priorities, marketing dynamics, and beneficiary appeal, supported by current data and expert insights.

### 1. Economic Incentives for Stakeholders  

#### 1.1 Financial Benefits for Health Plans  
Private insurers offering Medicare Advantage plans receive higher per-member per-month (PMPM) revenues and operating margins compared to Medicare Supplement plans. According to L.E.K. Consulting, Medicare Advantage plans yield PMPM revenues between $800 and $1,200, with operating margins of $30 to $60, whereas Medicare Supplement plans generate $180 to $220 PMPM revenue and $10 to $18 operating margin ([L.E.K. Consulting, 2019](https://www.lek.com/insights/ei/medicare-advantage-penetration-drivers)). This substantial profitability incentivizes insurers to aggressively market MA plans.

#### 1.2 Government Cost Management and Budget Considerations  
CMS supports Medicare Advantage as a tool for managing healthcare cost trends through mechanisms other than the traditional fee-for-service schedule. The managed care model allows for more effective deployment of cost containment strategies, such as care coordination and utilization management. However, the government’s financial incentives are complex; recent reports indicate that Medicare Advantage may cost the government significantly more than traditional Medicare. The Medicare Payment and Advisory Commission (MedPAC) estimated that in 2025, Medicare Advantage could cost the federal government $84 billion more than if those beneficiaries were enrolled in traditional Medicare, representing a 20% overpayment primarily due to coding intensity and favorable selection ([Catherman, 2025](https://www.healthcare-brew.com/stories/2025/03/18/medicare-advantage-cost-government-84-billion-2025)).

Despite these higher costs, CMS has finalized a 5.06% increase in payments to Medicare Advantage plans for 2026, nearly double the earlier estimate, to ensure plan sustainability amid rising healthcare utilization and economic pressures ([FingerLakes1, 2025](https://www.fingerlakes1.com/2025/04/22/medicare-advantage-2026-payment-increase/)). This payment increase reflects government commitment to maintaining a robust MA market.

### 2. Consumer Appeal and Benefits  

#### 2.1 Enhanced Benefits and Cost Predictability  
Medicare Advantage plans offer additional benefits beyond Original Medicare, including dental, vision, hearing, fitness programs, transportation services, and meal deliveries. Approximately 99% of MA plans provide at least one supplemental benefit, with a median of 23 benefits offered in 2022 ([CMS, 2024](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/contract-year-2025-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-final-rule-cms-4205-f)). These extras, funded by public Medicare dollars, are not available to Original Medicare beneficiaries, making MA plans attractive to seniors seeking comprehensive coverage.

Moreover, MA plans provide annual out-of-pocket spending limits, offering financial protection that traditional Medicare lacks. This feature is highly valued by beneficiaries concerned about unpredictable healthcare costs ([KFF, 2023](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/10-reasons-why-medicare-advantage-enrollment-is-growing-and-why-it-matters/)).

#### 2.2 Marketing and Accessibility  
Aggressive marketing campaigns by insurers and brokers, including TV ads, mailings, and digital outreach, have significantly increased consumer awareness and enrollment. For example, during the 2023 open enrollment period, there were more than 9,500 TV airings per day promoting Medicare Advantage plans ([KFF, 2023](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/10-reasons-why-medicare-advantage-enrollment-is-growing-and-why-it-matters/)). Brokers receive higher commissions for MA plans compared to Medigap or Part D plans, incentivizing them to promote these options ([Senior Allies, 2020](https://www.senior-allies.com/senior-insurance-blog/why-is-there-a-big-push-to-buy-medicare-advantage)).

CMS itself has been criticized for biased communications favoring Medicare Advantage, such as the Medicare Plan Finder tool and email campaigns that highlight MA plans without equally presenting the benefits and drawbacks of Original Medicare ([Medicare Rights Center, 2025](https://www.medicarerights.org/medicare-watch/2025/03/20/medicare-advantage-costs-and-growth-largely-unexamined)).

### 3. Policy and Regulatory Drivers  

#### 3.1 Bipartisan Government Support  
Medicare Advantage enjoys bipartisan political support due to its alignment with the “triple aim” of healthcare: improving care experience, enhancing population health, and reducing per capita costs ([L.E.K. Consulting, 2019](https://www.lek.com/insights/ei/medicare-advantage-penetration-drivers)). CMS leadership has emphasized MA as a key component of long-term cost containment strategies, with Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar stating a focus on ensuring MA remains a strong, robust option for seniors ([L.E.K. Consulting, 2018](https://www.lek.com/insights/ei/medicare-advantage-penetration-drivers)).

#### 3.2 Regulatory Flexibility and Enhancements  
Recent CMS rulemaking has increased flexibility for MA plans to design benefits tailored to seniors’ unique needs, including expanded supplemental benefits and improved behavioral health access ([CMS, 2024](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-advantage-and-medicare-prescription-drug-programs-remain-stable-cms-implements-improvements)). The 2026 final rule includes a new risk adjustment model (CMS-HCC) that adjusts payments based on enrollees’ health conditions, potentially influencing plan design and availability ([NeedyMeds, 2025](https://blog.needymeds.org/2025/04/09/medicare-2026-what-you-need-to-know-about-plan-changes-next-year/)).

However, recent policy changes have also led to fewer plan choices and higher out-of-pocket maximums for beneficiaries in 2025, reflecting the complex balance between cost containment and beneficiary protections ([Better Medicare Alliance, 2024](https://bettermedicarealliance.org/news/new-analysis-shows-impact-of-recent-policymaking-on-medicare-advantage-plans-fewer-choices-higher-costs-and-reduced-benefits-for-seniors-in-2025/)).

### 4. Structural and Market Dynamics  

#### 4.1 Shift from Traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage  
Medicare Advantage penetration has steadily increased, projected to reach 47% by 2025 and potentially 70% between 2030 and 2040 ([L.E.K. Consulting, 2019](https://www.lek.com/insights/ei/medicare-advantage-penetration-drivers)). This growth is largely at the expense of Original Medicare, which could drop from 40% penetration to 10%-20% in some regions.

Seniors increasingly find Original Medicare’s 20% coinsurance responsibility burdensome as healthcare costs rise, with Medicare costs forecasted to grow at 7.5% annually through 2027 ([L.E.K. Consulting, 2019](https://www.lek.com/insights/ei/medicare-advantage-penetration-drivers)).

#### 4.2 Managed Care Model and Care Coordination  
MA plans operate under managed care principles, enabling care coordination and utilization management that can improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary spending. This model aligns with CMS’s goals of cost containment and quality improvement, making MA plans preferable from a policy perspective ([Senior Allies, 2020](https://www.senior-allies.com/senior-insurance-blog/why-is-there-a-big-push-to-buy-medicare-advantage)).

However, this also means that MA plans often impose network restrictions, require prior authorizations, and may deny certain treatments in favor of less expensive alternatives, which can be challenging for beneficiaries seeking specialized or frequent care ([HelpAdvisor, 2023](https://www.helpadvisor.com/medicare/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-medicare-advantage)).

### 5. Criticisms and Concerns  

#### 5.1 Overpayments and Government Spending  
Despite the promotion of MA plans as cost-saving, independent analyses suggest that Medicare Advantage is more expensive for the government than traditional Medicare, largely due to coding practices and favorable selection of healthier enrollees ([Center for Medicare Advocacy, 2025](https://medicareadvocacy.org/overpayments-and-other-structural-imbalances-favor-private-medicare-advantage-plans/)).

#### 5.2 Beneficiary Disruptions and Reduced Benefits  
Recent policymaking has led to fewer plan choices, higher out-of-pocket maximums, and reductions in supplemental benefits such as fitness programs and in-home support services for 2025, potentially impacting seniors’ access and satisfaction ([Better Medicare Alliance, 2024](https://bettermedicarealliance.org/news/new-analysis-shows-impact-of-recent-policymaking-on-medicare-advantage-plans-fewer-choices-higher-costs-and-reduced-benefits-for-seniors-in-2025/)).

#### 5.3 Marketing Bias and Incomplete Information  
CMS and insurers have been criticized for promoting Medicare Advantage plans disproportionately, sometimes providing incomplete or biased information that may not fully inform beneficiaries of the trade-offs compared to Original Medicare ([Medicare Rights Center, 2025](https://www.medicarerights.org/medicare-watch/2025/03/20/medicare-advantage-costs-and-growth-largely-unexamined)).

### Conclusion  

The push to promote Medicare Advantage plans is driven by a confluence of economic, policy, and consumer factors. Private insurers benefit from higher revenues and margins, incentivizing aggressive marketing. The government supports MA as a managed care model that promises cost containment and improved care coordination, despite evidence of higher overall spending compared to traditional Medicare. Consumers are attracted by the bundled coverage, additional benefits, and out-of-pocket spending limits. CMS’s regulatory flexibility and policy priorities further facilitate MA growth.

However, this promotion is not without controversy. Concerns about overpayments, beneficiary disruptions, reduced plan choices, and marketing biases highlight the need for balanced, transparent communication to Medicare beneficiaries. Policymakers must carefully weigh the benefits of Medicare Advantage’s managed care approach against its costs and ensure that beneficiaries receive clear, comprehensive information to make informed choices.
