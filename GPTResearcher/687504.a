## A Comprehensive Analysis and Report  

---

## Executive Summary  

Texas, despite its robust economic growth and record employment levels, faces significant challenges related to unemployment, underemployment, and financial hardship among its population. This report analyzes whether the state government should provide resources to unemployed, under-employed, and financially struggling Texans, drawing on recent data, economic forecasts, and policy analyses. The evidence strongly supports the provision of targeted state resources and interventions. These measures are essential not only to improve individual well-being but also to sustain economic growth, enhance workforce resilience, and stabilize public finances.

## Introduction  

Texas has experienced historic job growth, with employment reaching a record high of 14.7 million in June 2024. However, this strong labor market masks persistent disparities in job recovery, wage adequacy, and economic security for many Texans. Unemployment rates, while improved from pandemic peaks, remain above pre-pandemic levels, disproportionately affecting younger workers, women, and those with lower educational attainment. Additionally, financial hardships such as housing affordability crises and child care shortages exacerbate the struggles of many families.  

Given these realities, this report evaluates the necessity and implications of state government support for unemployed, under-employed, and financially struggling Texans.

## Current Economic and Labor Market Context in Texas  

### Employment and Unemployment Trends  

- Texas employment grew by 1.7% in 2024, adding over 244,000 jobs, with broad sector gains including oil and gas, financial services, and construction ([Dallas Fed, 2025](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/forecast/2025/emp250207)).  
- Despite this growth, the unemployment rate in Texas stood at 4.0% in June 2024, slightly below the national rate of 4.1%, but above the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5% ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- Unemployment disproportionately affects younger Texans (ages 16-24), with rates rising to 8.7% in 2023 from 7.5% in 2022, and those with less than a high school diploma face the highest unemployment at 6.3% ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- Women’s unemployment increased from 3.7% to 4.1% between 2022 and 2023, reflecting ongoing gender disparities exacerbated by child care shortages ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  

### Financial Hardship and Social Challenges  

- Approximately 14% of Texas households earn below the Federal Poverty Level, struggling with basic expenses such as housing, food, and healthcare ([TurboDebt, 2025](https://www.turbodebt.com/financial-hardship/texas)).  
- Texas faces a housing affordability crisis, with severe shortages of affordable units for households earning 30% or less of Area Median Income (AMI), and rising housing costs impede hiring and retention ([Texas Housers, 2025](https://texashousers.org/2025/04/24/texas-housers-2025-qap-report/); [Texas Comptroller, 2025](https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/government/2025/housing-ftd/)).  
- Child care deserts exist in over half of Texas counties, contributing to lost productivity estimated at $11 billion due to 300,000 children lacking care in 2023 ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).

## The Case for State Government Support  

### Economic and Social Rationale  

1. **Mitigating the Costs of Unemployment and Underemployment**  
   Unemployment reduces tax revenues from income, payroll, sales, and property taxes, straining government budgets and limiting public services ([Accounting Insights, 2025](https://accountinginsights.org/the-costs-of-unemployment-and-their-impact-on-the-economy/)). Increased unemployment also raises demand for public assistance programs such as unemployment insurance (UI), SNAP, and Medicaid, further pressuring state finances.  

2. **Promoting Equitable Economic Recovery**  
   The recovery from the COVID-19 recession has been uneven, with historically marginalized groups facing barriers to upward mobility due to systemic issues in criminal justice and immigration systems ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)). Targeted investments in workforce development, apprenticeships, and living wages can reduce these disparities.  

3. **Supporting Workforce Participation and Productivity**  
   Labor force participation in Texas has declined from 69.6% in 1995 to 64.9% in 2023, partly due to aging demographics but also due to economic discouragement ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)). State support programs can incentivize re-entry into the workforce and improve productivity.  

4. **Addressing Child Care and Caregiver Workforce Shortages**  
   Investments in child care subsidies and caregiver wages are critical to enable parents, especially women, to participate fully in the workforce and to support vulnerable populations ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  

5. **Stimulating Consumer Spending and Economic Growth**  
   Expanded UI benefits during the pandemic increased consumer spending by 2.0% to 2.6%, with only a minimal negative impact on employment (0.2% to 0.4%), demonstrating the effectiveness of such programs in stabilizing the economy ([Richmond Fed, 2022](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2022/eb_22-13)).  

### Specific Policy Recommendations  

- **Raise the State Minimum Wage** to reduce poverty wages and improve living standards ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- **Invest in Apprenticeship Programs** targeting youth, rural, low-income, and Black Texans to improve employment rates and skill development ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- **Implement a State-Administered Paid Parental Leave Program** offering at least 12 weeks of paid leave, which can yield returns up to 20 times the cost ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- **Expand Child Care Subsidies and Early Childhood Educator Pay** to reduce waitlists and improve care quality ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- **Provide Targeted Raises for Caregiver Workers** in public and private sectors to support disabled and aging populations ([Every Texan, 2024](https://everytexan.org/2024/08/12/the-texas-workforce-is-resilient-and-undervalued/)).  
- **Enhance Housing Assistance Programs** to address affordability and homelessness, including grants for home repairs and weatherization ([Home Property Grants, 2025](https://homepropertygrants.com/2025/02/window-replacement-grants-texas.html); [Texas Housers, 2025](https://texashousers.org/2025/04/24/texas-housers-2025-qap-report/)).

## Counterarguments and Considerations  

Some critics argue that government intervention distorts market dynamics, creates fiscal liabilities, and that economic development is best left to the private sector ([Texas Policy Research, 2025](https://www.texaspolicyresearch.com/texas-economic-development-strategy-a-roadmap-or-government-overreach/)). While these concerns merit consideration, the evidence indicates that strategic, well-targeted government support can complement market forces by addressing structural barriers and promoting inclusive growth.  

Moreover, failure to provide adequate support risks exacerbating economic disparities, reducing labor force participation, and increasing long-term social costs. The housing affordability crisis, for example, threatens Texas’ economic competitiveness by impeding workforce mobility and increasing business costs ([Texas Comptroller, 2025](https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/government/2025/housing-ftd/)).

## Conclusion  

The state government of Texas should provide resources to unemployed, under-employed, and financially struggling Texans. The data and analyses reviewed demonstrate that such support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Targeted investments in wages, workforce development, child care, caregiver support, and housing assistance will promote equitable economic recovery, enhance labor market participation, and stabilize public finances through increased tax revenues and reduced social costs.  

Texas’ continued economic vitality depends on inclusive policies that empower all Texans to contribute to and benefit from the state’s growth. Strategic government intervention, aligned with private sector dynamics, offers the most effective path forward.
