# How Do Immigrants Become U.S. Citizens? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Becoming a U.S. citizen is a significant milestone for many immigrants, symbolizing full participation in American civic life and access to various rights and responsibilities. The process of naturalization—the legal means by which lawful permanent residents (LPRs) become citizens—is administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This report provides an in-depth, step-by-step overview of how immigrants become U.S. citizens, incorporating eligibility criteria, procedural steps, challenges, and statistical context based on the most current and reliable sources as of April 2025.

## Overview of U.S. Citizenship

There are two primary types of U.S. citizenship: birthright citizenship and naturalized citizenship. Birthright citizenship is granted automatically to individuals born on U.S. soil or, under certain conditions, to children born abroad to U.S. citizen parents. Naturalization, by contrast, is the process through which foreign-born individuals acquire citizenship after fulfilling legal requirements, including residency and knowledge tests ([Passage Law, 2024](https://www.passage.law/blog/different-us-citizenship-pathways/)).

## Eligibility Requirements for Naturalization

Before applying for citizenship, immigrants must meet specific eligibility criteria established by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and enforced by USCIS. The main requirements include:

1. **Age**: Applicants must be at least 18 years old at the time of application ([USAGov, 2024](https://www.usa.gov/naturalization)).

2. **Permanent Residency**: Applicants must be lawful permanent residents (Green Card holders) for at least five years. If married to a U.S. citizen and living in marital union, the residency requirement is reduced to three years ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization); [USCIS Guide, 2024](https://www.uscisguide.com/citizenship/u-s-citizenship-and-permanent-residency/)).

3. **Continuous Residence and Physical Presence**: Applicants must demonstrate continuous residence in the U.S. for the required period and physical presence for at least 30 months out of the five years (or 18 months out of three years if married to a citizen). Extended absences can disrupt eligibility unless properly justified ([Arvian Law Firm, 2025](https://arvian-immigration.com/step-by-step-guide-to-u-s-naturalization/)).

4. **Good Moral Character**: Applicants must show good moral character, which generally means no serious criminal record or immigration violations ([USAGov, 2024](https://www.usa.gov/naturalization)).

5. **English and Civics Knowledge**: Applicants must demonstrate an ability to read, write, and speak basic English and pass a civics test covering U.S. history and government ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/apply-for-citizenship)).

6. **Oath of Allegiance**: Taking the Oath of Allegiance to the United States is the final legal step to becoming a citizen ([IRC, 2018](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

## Step-by-Step Naturalization Process

The naturalization process involves ten well-defined steps as outlined by USCIS, which applicants must complete sequentially:

### Step 1: Determine Eligibility

Applicants first assess their eligibility using tools such as the USCIS Naturalization Eligibility Worksheet or online eligibility tools. This step ensures that applicants meet all legal criteria before proceeding ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/naturalization-eligibility)).

### Step 2: Prepare Form N-400

The Application for Naturalization (Form N-400) is the official form submitted to USCIS. Applicants must create a free online account on the USCIS website to file the form electronically or submit a paper application. Alongside the form, applicants gather supporting documents proving eligibility, including proof of residency, identity, and marital status ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

### Step 3: Submit Form N-400 and Pay Fees

Applicants submit Form N-400 and pay the associated filing fees, which as of 2024 are $725 (including biometrics fees). Fee waivers or reductions may be available for eligible applicants ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/apply-for-citizenship)).

### Step 4: Biometrics Appointment

USCIS schedules a biometrics appointment where applicants provide fingerprints, photographs, and signatures. This step is crucial for background checks conducted by the FBI and other agencies ([IRC, 2018](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

### Step 5: Interview with USCIS Officer

Applicants attend an in-person interview where a USCIS officer reviews the application, asks questions about the applicant’s background, and administers the English and civics tests. The civics test consists of up to 10 questions from a list of 100, and applicants must answer at least six correctly to pass ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization); [IRC, 2018](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

### Step 6: Receive USCIS Decision

Following the interview, USCIS issues a decision:

- **Granted**: Application approved; applicant proceeds to the oath ceremony.
- **Continued**: Additional evidence or a retake of the civics/English test is required.
- **Denied**: Application rejected due to ineligibility or failure to meet requirements ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

### Step 7: Receive Notice for Oath Ceremony

If approved, applicants receive a notice scheduling their naturalization ceremony. Some USCIS offices offer same-day ceremonies immediately following the interview ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

### Step 8: Take the Oath of Allegiance

At the ceremony, applicants take the Oath of Allegiance, formally becoming U.S. citizens. They surrender their Green Cards and receive a Certificate of Naturalization, which serves as proof of citizenship ([IRC, 2018](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

### Step 9: Understand Rights and Responsibilities

New citizens gain rights such as voting, obtaining a U.S. passport, and eligibility for federal jobs. They also assume responsibilities like jury duty and allegiance to U.S. laws ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

### Step 10: Maintain Citizenship

Citizenship is permanent unless voluntarily renounced or revoked under exceptional circumstances. New citizens are encouraged to stay informed about their rights and responsibilities ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

## Alternative Pathways to Citizenship

While the standard naturalization process applies to most immigrants, several alternative pathways exist:

- **Military Service**: Immigrants serving honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces may qualify for expedited naturalization, sometimes waiving residency requirements ([Passage Law, 2024](https://www.passage.law/blog/different-us-citizenship-pathways/)).

- **Marriage to a U.S. Citizen**: Spouses of U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship after three years of permanent residency, provided they remain married and living together ([De Round Table, 2024](https://deroundtable.com/12-pathways-to-become-a-u-s-citizen-in-2025-difficulty-levels-easy-moderate-hard/)).

- **Refugee or Asylum Status**: Refugees and asylees can apply for citizenship after one year of permanent residency, which follows their initial status grant ([IRC, 2018](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

- **Employment-Based Immigration**: Some employment visas lead to permanent residency and eventually citizenship after the standard residency period ([Passage Law, 2024](https://www.passage.law/blog/different-us-citizenship-pathways/)).

- **Diversity Visa Lottery**: Winners of the Diversity Visa Lottery obtain Green Cards and can apply for citizenship after five years ([De Round Table, 2024](https://deroundtable.com/12-pathways-to-become-a-u-s-citizen-in-2025-difficulty-levels-easy-moderate-hard/)).

## Processing Times and Statistical Context

The naturalization process typically takes between 6 to 18 months, depending on individual circumstances and USCIS workload. As of 2024, USCIS naturalized approximately 878,500 new citizens across about 19,500 ceremonies nationwide, averaging 45 new citizens per event ([Arvian Law Firm, 2025](https://arvian-immigration.com/step-by-step-guide-to-u-s-naturalization/)).

The top countries of origin for new citizens in 2024 were Mexico (13%), India (7%), and the Philippines (6%) ([Arvian Law Firm, 2025](https://arvian-immigration.com/step-by-step-guide-to-u-s-naturalization/)).

## Challenges and Considerations

The path to citizenship can be complex and challenging. Applicants must navigate extensive documentation, meet strict eligibility criteria, and pass language and civics tests. Processing delays and fee costs—currently $725, with a pending proposal to increase fees to $1,170—can pose additional barriers ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/apply-for-citizenship); [Arvian Law Firm, 2025](https://arvian-immigration.com/step-by-step-guide-to-u-s-naturalization/)).

Legal assistance, including free or low-cost services, is often recommended to help applicants prepare and avoid common pitfalls ([USCIS, 2024](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/apply-for-citizenship)).

## Conclusion

The process for immigrants to become U.S. citizens through naturalization is structured, rigorous, and designed to ensure applicants are fully prepared to assume the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. While the journey requires meeting strict eligibility criteria, completing multiple procedural steps, and overcoming challenges, it culminates in the rewarding achievement of full American citizenship. With nearly 900,000 naturalizations annually, this process remains a cornerstone of the U.S. immigration system and a vital pathway to inclusion and civic participation.
