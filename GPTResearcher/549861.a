# Why Do So Many Young People Like Communism?  
## A Detailed Analysis of the Rising Favorability of Communism Among Younger Generations in the United States  

---

### Introduction  

In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the favorable views of communism, Marxism, and socialism among younger generations in the United States, particularly Generation Z (ages 16-23) and Millennials (ages 24-39). This trend has sparked widespread discussion and concern among scholars, policymakers, and the public. This report aims to provide a comprehensive and objective analysis of the reasons behind this phenomenon, drawing on multiple reputable sources, including polling data, scholarly research, and expert commentary.

### Rising Favorability of Communism and Socialism Among Youth  

Recent polls reveal a significant shift in the political and economic attitudes of young Americans. According to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation's 2020 Annual Report, 30% of Generation Z respondents have a favorable view of Marxism, up from 6% in 2019, while 49% view socialism favorably, a nine-point increase from the previous year ([Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, 2020](https://victimsofcommunism.org/annual-poll/2020-annual-poll/)). Similarly, a YouGov survey found that 36% of Millennials approve of communism, marking an 8% rise from 2018 ([The Independent, 2019](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/communism-millennials-capitalism-socialism-bernie-sanders-cold-war-yougov-a9188116.html)).

Despite this growing support, there is a paradox: younger generations simultaneously express deep distrust of government institutions, with only 6% of Gen Z and 5% of Millennials trusting the government to look after their interests ([Religion & Liberty Online, 2021](https://rlo.acton.org/archives/117396-half-of-gen-z-supports-marxism-socialism-heres-why.html)). This contradiction suggests that the appeal of communism and socialism among youth is complex and multifaceted.

### Factors Contributing to the Appeal of Communism Among Young People  

#### 1. Economic Discontent and Perceived Failures of Capitalism  

A primary driver of youth support for communism and socialism is widespread dissatisfaction with the current capitalist system. Millennials and Gen Z face economic challenges that previous generations did not, including soaring student debt, unaffordable housing, and precarious job markets. The Independent reports that millennials are the first generation in the U.S. likely to have worse life prospects than their parents, fueling a desire for systemic change ([The Independent, 2019](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/communism-millennials-capitalism-socialism-bernie-sanders-cold-war-yougov-a9188116.html)).

This economic instability has led to a perception that capitalism is failing to deliver prosperity or fairness. As Professor Lawrence Quill notes, capitalism is viewed as directly responsible for crises such as climate change and social inequality, which are especially salient issues for younger generations ([The Independent, 2019](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/communism-millennials-capitalism-socialism-bernie-sanders-cold-war-yougov-a9188116.html)). Consequently, communism and socialism are seen as alternatives promising greater economic justice and environmental responsibility.

#### 2. Historical Amnesia and Lack of Education on Communism’s Legacy  

A significant factor in the rising favorability of communism is the lack of historical knowledge among young Americans regarding the atrocities committed under communist regimes. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation found that 64% of Americans are unaware that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for more deaths than Nazi Germany, and 72% of Americans incorrectly believe that communism has killed fewer than 100 million people in the past century ([Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, 2019](https://victimsofcommunism.org/annual-survey-shows-growing-favorability-communism-socialism-among-millennials/)).

This "historical amnesia" is compounded by inadequate education about communism's violent past and present, leading to a sanitized or romanticized view of communist ideology among youth. Marion Smith, Executive Director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, emphasizes that this knowledge gap reflects a failure of the education system and media to convey the moral and historical failings of communism ([Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, 2020](https://victimsofcommunism.org/annual-poll/2020-annual-poll/)).

#### 3. Influence of Critical Theory and Jaundiced Views of the United States  

The rise of critical theory and related intellectual movements has contributed to a negative perception of American history and institutions among young people. Gen Z is almost twice as likely to believe that "America is a racist nation with a long history of discrimination" (51%) compared to those who view America as a defender of freedom (27%) ([Religion & Liberty Online, 2021](https://rlo.acton.org/archives/117396-half-of-gen-z-supports-marxism-socialism-heres-why.html)). This critical stance fosters skepticism toward capitalism and the American political system, making alternative ideologies like communism more attractive.

Moreover, young Americans are more likely to support the removal of statues of historical American figures than those of Marxist figures, indicating a willingness to challenge traditional narratives and symbols ([Religion & Liberty Online, 2021](https://rlo.acton.org/archives/117396-half-of-gen-z-supports-marxism-socialism-heres-why.html)).

#### 4. Misconceptions and Labeling Effects  

The term "communism" has been diluted and misused in contemporary political discourse, often employed as a catch-all pejorative by the political right. This overuse has paradoxically normalized the term and reduced its stigma among younger generations. Jodi Dean, a political science professor, argues that because "communist" is used indiscriminately to label various political opponents, its acceptability has increased among youth who oppose right-wing politics ([The Independent, 2019](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/communism-millennials-capitalism-socialism-bernie-sanders-cold-war-yougov-a9188116.html)).

Additionally, many young people conflate socialism and communism or lack clarity about these ideologies, leading to broader support for collectivist ideas without fully understanding their implications ([Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, 2019](https://victimsofcommunism.org/annual-survey-shows-growing-favorability-communism-socialism-among-millennials/)).

#### 5. Political Socialization and Activism  

Research into youth political participation suggests that young people's engagement is often motivated by personal experiences of inequality and a desire to enact social change. Studies indicate that youth activism is shaped by exposure to political contestation, peer groups, and media, which can foster radicalization in contexts of economic distress and perceived injustice ([Cambridge Core, 2021](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/comparative-analysis-of-the-motivations-of-youth-political-participation-across-different-types-of-activism/0BC7F631ADABACC121C860963AC3EC94)).

In the U.S., the normalization of socialist ideas by prominent politicians such as Bernie Sanders and members of "The Squad" has also contributed to the mainstreaming of these ideologies among youth ([Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, 2020](https://victimsofcommunism.org/annual-poll/2020-annual-poll/)).

### Critical Evaluation and Opinion  

The growing favorability of communism among young Americans is primarily a symptom of broader socio-economic and cultural dynamics rather than a genuine, informed endorsement of communist ideology in its historical or practical form. Economic insecurity, disillusionment with capitalism, and a lack of comprehensive education about communism's historical realities have created fertile ground for the appeal of alternative ideologies promising fairness and justice.

However, this trend also reflects a significant gap in historical awareness and critical thinking about the consequences of communism as practiced in the 20th century. The failure of educational institutions and media to adequately convey the moral and human costs of communist regimes has led to a sanitized perception that overlooks the ideology's violent and oppressive history.

Moreover, the contradictory nature of young people's distrust in government alongside their support for socialism and communism suggests a superficial or confused understanding of these ideologies. Socialism and communism inherently require strong state control, which conflicts with the expressed distrust of government institutions.

In conclusion, while the appeal of communism among youth is understandable given contemporary challenges, it is crucial to address the underlying causes—economic inequality, education deficits, and political polarization—rather than dismissing youth attitudes as mere ignorance or malice. A balanced approach that includes robust education on history, critical engagement with economic systems, and responsive policy solutions to economic insecurity is essential to fostering informed political attitudes among young Americans.
