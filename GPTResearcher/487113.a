# Report: Safety of Casinos Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted public spaces worldwide, including casinos, which are traditionally high-traffic indoor venues with numerous shared surfaces and close interpersonal interactions. This report evaluates the safety of casinos in the context of the COVID-19 virus, analyzing mitigation strategies, health protocols, transmission risks, and economic implications based on recent and reliable sources. The objective is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based assessment of how safe casinos are during the ongoing pandemic as of April 2025.

## Transmission Risks in Casinos

Casinos inherently present several risk factors for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. These include:

- **High-touch surfaces**: Slot machines, gaming tables, chips, and kiosks are frequently touched by many patrons.
- **Close proximity**: Players often gather around tables and machines, sometimes in crowded indoor environments.
- **Indoor ventilation**: Casinos are enclosed spaces where airborne transmission risk is elevated, especially if ventilation is suboptimal.
- **Shared facilities**: Restaurants, bars, and restrooms within casinos add to the potential exposure points.

Research on viral transmission in indoor settings, including high-rise buildings and public venues, highlights the role of airborne transmission and environmental factors such as ventilation and surface contamination ([CDC, 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6949e2.htm); [Zhou et al., 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10199749/)). Casinos, therefore, require rigorous mitigation strategies to reduce these risks.

## Mitigation Strategies and Compliance

### Regulatory Guidelines and Casino Protocols

The Nevada Gaming Commission and other regulatory bodies have established comprehensive safety guidelines for casino reopenings, emphasizing:

- Limiting occupancy and the number of people around table games.
- Increasing cleaning frequency of high-touch surfaces such as light switches, gaming equipment, and handrails.
- Keeping nightclubs and other high-density venues closed or restricted.
- Implementing social distancing measures, including rearranging slot machines and restaurant tables to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between patrons.
- Installing touch-free hand sanitizing stations at entrances and throughout properties.
- Requiring masks for employees and providing masks to guests, with temporary removal only for identification purposes.
- Using thermal scanners to screen guests and employees for fever.
- Testing employees for COVID-19 before returning to work and at regular intervals thereafter.
- Training staff on enhanced health and cleanliness standards that meet or exceed federal, state, and local guidelines ([Rindels, 2020](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gaming-commission-approves-safety-guidelines-for-casino-reopenings); [Schulz, 2025](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/station-casinos-releases-health-and-safety-plan-for-reopening-2030700/)).

These measures are designed to reduce transmission risk by addressing both direct person-to-person contact and environmental contamination.

### Compliance and Effectiveness

Epidemiological modeling indicates that the effectiveness of mitigation policies is heavily dependent on public compliance. Studies show that states with similar mitigation policies but varying compliance levels experienced different infection trends, underscoring that policies alone are insufficient without adherence ([Cano et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8351990/)).

In casino settings, compliance by both employees and patrons with mask-wearing, physical distancing, and hygiene protocols is critical. The Culinary Union, representing casino workers, has advocated for even stricter measures such as suspending buffets, replacing vacuuming with steam cleaning, and providing company masks and COVID-19 testing to employees ([Rindels, 2020](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gaming-commission-approves-safety-guidelines-for-casino-reopenings)).

## Health and Safety Assessments

### Expert Opinions and Public Perception

Infectious disease experts have assessed casinos as low to medium risk environments for COVID-19 exposure when appropriate mitigation strategies are in place. The presence of multiple hand sanitizing stations, routine cleaning, and mask mandates contribute to reducing risk ([CBS Sacramento, 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/infectious-disease-casinos-low-risk-coronavirus/)).

However, patrons' concerns persist, especially among those with vulnerable health conditions. Surveys and anecdotal evidence reveal that some casino-goers remain hesitant to visit due to fears of infection, while others appreciate the enhanced safety protocols and feel comfortable returning ([AP News, 2020](https://apnews.com/article/1a9fc19213b69b97b70a6a9dd1210b53)).

### Environmental Considerations

Studies on airborne and environmental transmission stress the importance of ventilation and air filtration in indoor settings. Casinos have responded by enhancing ventilation systems and employing hospital-grade disinfectants and electrostatic sprayers to sanitize surfaces ([CDC, 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6949e2.htm); [Schulz, 2025](https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/station-casinos-releases-health-and-safety-plan-for-reopening-2030700/)).

Research on high-rise buildings during the Omicron wave highlights the potential for aerosol transmission in confined spaces such as elevators and shared ventilation ducts, which may be analogous to some casino environments. This underscores the need for continuous environmental controls and monitoring ([Zhou et al., 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10199749/)).

## Economic and Operational Impact

The pandemic-induced shutdowns and capacity restrictions have had significant economic impacts on casinos. Simulation studies using Monte Carlo methods have demonstrated how social distancing and cleaning protocols affect player movement, contamination risk, and economic performance on slot floors ([Baran et al., 2023](https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/gaming_institute/2023/May25/17/)).

Casinos have had to balance safety with operational viability, often reducing capacity, rearranging gaming floors, and investing in new cleaning technologies. While these measures increase operational costs, they are essential to restore customer confidence and ensure sustainable reopening.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of current guidelines, scientific evidence, and industry practices, casinos can be considered **moderately safe** environments for COVID-19 exposure **provided that strict mitigation measures are implemented and followed consistently**. The key factors influencing safety include:

- **Robust health protocols**: Mandatory mask-wearing, physical distancing, employee testing, and enhanced cleaning are effective in reducing transmission risk.
- **Environmental controls**: Improved ventilation and air filtration systems are critical to mitigating airborne spread.
- **Compliance**: The success of safety measures depends heavily on adherence by both staff and patrons.
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Casinos must remain adaptable to evolving public health guidance and emerging variants.

While no indoor public venue can be entirely risk-free during a pandemic, casinos that rigorously apply and enforce these measures provide a safer gambling environment than was possible in early 2020. Patrons with underlying health conditions or heightened vulnerability should still exercise caution.

The economic necessity of reopening casinos is balanced by the imperative to protect public health. Continued investment in safety protocols and transparent communication with customers will be vital in maintaining trust and minimizing COVID-19 transmission risks.
