# Why Are Armenia and Azerbaijan at War? A Detailed Report

## Introduction

The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, primarily centered on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, is one of the most protracted and complex disputes in the post-Soviet space. Rooted in ethnic, historical, territorial, and geopolitical factors, the conflict has escalated into multiple wars and ongoing border crises since the late 1980s. This report provides an in-depth analysis of why Armenia and Azerbaijan are at war, drawing on a wide range of reliable and recent sources. It examines the historical background, territorial disputes, ethnic tensions, military escalations, and the roles of regional and international actors, culminating in the recent developments up to 2025.

## Historical Background

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous region internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians. The roots of the conflict trace back to the early 20th century and were significantly shaped during the Soviet era. In 1923, the Soviet Union established Nagorno-Karabakh as an autonomous oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, despite its Armenian majority population ([BBC, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66852070)).

As the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late 1980s, the Nagorno-Karabakh regional parliament voted in 1988 to unify with Armenia, sparking violent ethnic clashes and political turmoil. Azerbaijan sought to suppress the separatist movement, while Armenia supported it, leading to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994). This war resulted in approximately 30,000 casualties and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, with Armenia gaining control over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azerbaijani territories ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2025](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict)).

Despite a ceasefire brokered by Russia in 1994 (the Bishkek Protocol), the conflict remained unresolved, with Nagorno-Karabakh functioning as a de facto independent entity heavily reliant on Armenia but unrecognized internationally ([Polis180, 2025](https://polis180.org/polisblog/2025/03/27/the-high-cost-of-ignoring-nagorno-karabakh-how-unresolved-grievances-and-geopolitical-interests-fuel-future-conflict/)).

## Ethnic and Territorial Disputes

At the core of the conflict lies the question of sovereignty and self-determination versus territorial integrity. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian population has long sought independence or unification with Armenia, while Azerbaijan insists on its territorial integrity, including Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding occupied districts.

The Armenian position is complicated by the fact that Armenia itself has never officially recognized Nagorno-Karabakh's independence, fearing international backlash. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has invested heavily in military modernization, fueled by oil and gas revenues, to reclaim lost territories ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict)).

## Military Conflicts and Escalations

### The 2016 Clashes and the 2020 War

Between 1994 and 2020, sporadic clashes occurred along the line of contact. The most serious before 2020 was in April 2016, known as the "Four-Day War," which resulted in nearly 120 military casualties and civilian deaths on both sides ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict)).

In 2020, a full-scale war erupted, lasting 44 days. Azerbaijan, backed militarily and logistically by Turkey, decisively defeated Armenian forces, reclaiming significant territories including Nagorno-Karabakh's surrounding districts and parts of the enclave itself. The war ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire on November 10, 2020 ([Al Jazeera, 2020](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/5/iran-nk)).

### Post-2020 Developments and 2023 Offensive

Despite the ceasefire, tensions remained high, with frequent border skirmishes and violations. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a swift military offensive, regaining full control over Nagorno-Karabakh within 24 hours. This offensive prompted the exodus of nearly 100,000 ethnic Armenians from the region to Armenia, marking a significant humanitarian crisis ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2025](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict)).

The offensive was followed by negotiations over disarmament and reintegration of Nagorno-Karabakh into Azerbaijan, mediated by Russia. However, Azerbaijan's continued military incursions into Armenian territory and demands for constitutional changes in Armenia have escalated tensions further ([Armenian Weekly, 2025](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/03/26/armenian-officials-downplay-reports-of-azerbaijani-gunfire-along-the-border/)).

## Geopolitical and Regional Dynamics

The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict is deeply influenced by regional and international geopolitical interests.

### Role of Turkey and Russia

Turkey has been a staunch supporter of Azerbaijan, providing military aid and political backing, which significantly contributed to Azerbaijan's military superiority in 2020 and beyond ([Academia.edu, 2020](https://www.academia.edu/49272449/Nagorno_Karabakh_Conflict_A_Geopolitical_Analysis)).

Russia, traditionally a mediator and security guarantor in the post-Soviet space, has maintained complex relations with both countries. While allied with Armenia through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Russia has also developed closer ties with Azerbaijan. Its role as a peacekeeper and mediator has been crucial but questioned, especially after the 2023 offensive and ongoing border clashes ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2025](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict)).

### Other Regional Actors

Iran, Israel, and other regional players have also influenced the conflict through arms supplies, diplomatic support, and economic interests. Iran has expressed concerns about spillover effects, while Israel has increasingly supplied advanced weaponry to Azerbaijan ([Academia.edu, 2020](https://www.academia.edu/49272449/Nagorno_Karabakh_Conflict_A_Geopolitical_Analysis)).

### International Community and Diplomatic Efforts

The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, the United States, and France, was the primary international mechanism for conflict resolution but has been effectively abandoned by Armenia and Azerbaijan as of January 2025. The international community's limited engagement, especially compared to conflicts like Ukraine, has been criticized for enabling Azerbaijan's assertive military actions ([New Eastern Europe, 2025](https://neweasterneurope.eu/2025/04/09/the-complexity-of-the-peace-deal-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan/)).

## Recent Peace Negotiations and Challenges

In March 2025, Armenia and Azerbaijan finalized the text of a peace agreement aimed at ending nearly four decades of conflict. However, the signing remains uncertain due to Azerbaijan's preconditions, including constitutional amendments in Armenia and the removal of third-party monitors along the border ([Al Jazeera, 2025](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/armenia-and-azerbaijan-finalise-draft-peace-deal-to-resolve-conflict)).

Azerbaijan's demands also include the establishment of the Zangezur Corridor, a transport link through Armenian territory to connect Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhchivan, which Armenia views as a threat to its sovereignty ([Council on Foreign Relations, 2025](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict)).

The peace process is further complicated by internal divisions within Armenia, public backlash against territorial concessions, and ongoing Azerbaijani information campaigns accusing Armenia of ceasefire violations and military build-up ([SpecialEurasia, 2025](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2025/03/20/information-armenia-azerbaijan/); [Armenian Weekly, 2025](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/03/26/armenian-officials-downplay-reports-of-azerbaijani-gunfire-along-the-border/)).

## Humanitarian and Societal Impact

The conflict has caused immense human suffering. Over 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh after the 2023 offensive, fearing persecution and loss of cultural heritage. Azerbaijan has conducted trials against former Nagorno-Karabakh officials on charges including terrorism and war crimes, which Armenia and international observers have criticized as politically motivated ([Polis180, 2025](https://polis180.org/polisblog/2025/03/27/the-high-cost-of-ignoring-nagorno-karabakh-how-unresolved-grievances-and-geopolitical-interests-fuel-future-conflict/)).

The destruction of Armenian cultural sites and the resettlement of Azerbaijani populations in Nagorno-Karabakh exacerbate long-term grievances and the potential for renewed conflict ([Carleton University, 2025](https://carleton.ca/eetn/2025/the-price-of-peace-armenias-impossible-choice-between-identity-sovereignty-and-justice/)).

## Analysis and Opinion

The Armenia-Azerbaijan war is fundamentally driven by a clash between Azerbaijan’s assertion of territorial integrity and Armenia’s (and Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians’) pursuit of self-determination and security. The unresolved status of Nagorno-Karabakh, combined with deep-seated ethnic animosities and historical grievances, creates a volatile environment.

Azerbaijan’s military modernization and strategic backing by Turkey have shifted the balance of power decisively in its favor, enabling Azerbaijan to reclaim territories and pressure Armenia into concessions. Russia’s ambiguous role as both mediator and power broker reflects its competing interests and waning influence.

The failure of international actors to enforce ceasefires and mediate effectively has allowed military solutions to dominate over diplomatic ones. The peace agreement finalized in 2025, while a hopeful step, is fraught with challenges that risk undermining Armenia’s sovereignty and the rights of displaced Armenians.

In my assessment, lasting peace requires a balanced approach that respects Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity while ensuring security, cultural rights, and political representation for Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. External actors, especially Russia, Turkey, the EU, and the US, must play a more active and impartial role in guaranteeing and enforcing peace terms. Without addressing the underlying ethnic and political grievances, the risk of renewed conflict remains high.

## Conclusion

The Armenia-Azerbaijan war is a multifaceted conflict rooted in historical territorial disputes, ethnic tensions, and geopolitical rivalries. Military confrontations, shifting alliances, and failed diplomacy have perpetuated cycles of violence and displacement. Recent developments, including Azerbaijan’s 2023 offensive and the 2025 peace agreement draft, mark critical junctures but also highlight the fragility of peace.

Achieving a durable resolution will require addressing the complex interplay of sovereignty, identity, security, and regional interests with sustained international engagement and genuine compromise from both parties.
