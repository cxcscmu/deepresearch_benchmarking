# Why Do More Men Commit Crimes Than Women?  
## An In-Depth Analytical Report

---

## Introduction

The phenomenon that men commit more crimes than women is a well-documented and persistent finding across societies and historical periods. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the reasons behind this gender disparity in criminal behavior. Drawing on recent and reliable sources from sociology, criminology, psychology, and forensic science, the report examines biological, social, psychological, and structural factors influencing male criminality. The objective is to present a nuanced understanding that integrates multiple perspectives rather than relying on simplistic or deterministic explanations.

## Overview of Gender Differences in Crime Rates

Statistical data consistently show that men commit a significantly higher proportion of crimes than women. For example, men commit about 98% of sexual offenses, 82% of violence against the person offenses, and 92% of drug offenses, according to UK crime statistics (Thompson, 2024). In the United States, approximately 85-93% of serious crimes and federal prison populations are male (Ordway, 2017; Thompson, 2024). Men are also more likely to be arrested, prosecuted, and incarcerated for indictable offenses, which are more serious crimes (Thompson, 2024).

This gender gap is not only quantitative but also qualitative. Men tend to commit more violent and serious crimes, such as homicide and assault, whereas women are more often involved in less serious offenses and crimes related to societal control over female sexuality, such as prostitution (Zimmer, 2021). Furthermore, men are more often victims of violent crimes, although women are more vulnerable to sexual and domestic violence (Consumershield, 2025).

## Biological and Evolutionary Perspectives

### Hormonal and Neurological Factors

Biological explanations focus on innate differences between males and females, particularly the role of hormones such as testosterone, which is linked to aggression and competitive behavior. The Evolutionary Neuroandrogetic Theory posits that male sex hormones increase tendencies toward resource acquisition, hierarchical dominance, and sexual competition, which can manifest as aggressive and criminal behavior (Furtuna, 2014). Brain imaging and neuroscience research also explore physiological differences in brain function that may predispose men to higher levels of aggression and risk-taking (Zimmer, 2021).

### Evolutionary Psychology and Male Competition

Evolutionary psychology provides a framework for understanding male violence as a product of intrasexual competition. Men historically competed for reproductive access, leading to higher fitness variance among males than females. This competition fosters aggressive behaviors, including violent crime, as a strategy to gain status and mates (Kanazawa, 2008). Daly and Wilson’s extensive homicide studies show men commit homicide at rates up to 26 times higher than women, with most male homicides arising from trivial altercations linked to status disputes (Furtuna, 2014; Kanazawa, 2008).

## Sociological and Socialization Factors

### Gender Roles and Social Expectations

Socialization processes and culturally constructed gender roles significantly influence criminal behavior. Boys are often socialized to be aggressive and competitive, with societal norms endorsing male fighting and dominance. Leonard Berkowitz’s social roles theory highlights how boys receive more encouragement for aggressive behavior through toys, media, and parental attitudes, reinforcing male aggression as normative (Furtuna, 2014).

### Patriarchy and Gender Inequality

Patriarchal social structures historically position men as the standard for normal behavior, associating masculinity with rationality and aggression, while women are viewed as emotional and less aggressive (Renzetti et al., 2013). The gender equality hypothesis suggests that crime rates for men and women are influenced by social circumstances rather than biology alone. When social conditions change, such as increasing female equality, female crime rates tend to rise proportionally with male rates, indicating shared social influences like unemployment and drug availability (Zimmer, 2021; Cusack, 2015).

### Crime Opportunity and Social Freedom

Men’s greater freedom and mobility in society provide more opportunities to engage in criminal activities, particularly violent crimes. Women’s restricted roles and social control mechanisms reduce their exposure to crime opportunities (Hayes et al., 2015). Additionally, law enforcement and judicial biases often treat men and women differently, with men receiving harsher sentences, reinforcing perceptions of male criminality (Walklate, 2012).

## Psychological and Physiological Correlates

### Heart Rate and Crime Propensity

A notable empirical finding is the association between low resting heart rate and increased likelihood of criminal behavior, particularly among men. A longitudinal study from the University of Pennsylvania found that lower heart rates partially explain why men commit more crimes than women, possibly due to lower physiological arousal requiring more stimulation, which can manifest as risk-taking and antisocial behavior (Ordway, 2017).

### Stress and Prison Experience

Female prisoners are more likely to self-harm than males, indicating different psychological responses to incarceration and possibly different pathways into criminality (Thompson, 2024). This suggests that women’s criminal behavior may be more closely linked to trauma and emotional distress, contrasting with men’s aggression-driven offenses.

## Crime Types and Victimization Patterns by Gender

### Male-Dominated Violent Crime

Men overwhelmingly commit violent crimes such as homicide, assault, and gang-related offenses. For example, in Germany and globally, over 90% of murder suspects are male, and men are also the majority of homicide victims, often killed in public spaces linked to social conflicts (Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology, 2024). Male violence is often linked to status disputes and public altercations.

### Female Victimization and Intimate Partner Homicide

Women are more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence and homicide, typically occurring in private settings. Approximately two-thirds of women killed by other women had an intimate relationship with their killers, and a significant proportion of female homicide victims are killed by male intimate partners (Consumershield, 2025; Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology, 2024). This highlights gender-specific patterns of victimization and the need for targeted prevention.

## Integrative Analysis and Opinion

The evidence indicates that the higher rate of male criminality is a complex interplay of biological predispositions, socialization processes, gender roles, and structural opportunities. Biological factors such as testosterone and evolutionary pressures contribute to male aggression and competitiveness, predisposing men to violent and risk-taking behaviors. However, these innate tendencies are shaped and amplified by social environments that encourage male dominance, aggression, and provide greater opportunities for crime.

The gender equality hypothesis and social role theories demonstrate that social context is critical. As women gain more social freedom and equality, their crime rates tend to increase, suggesting that crime is not solely biologically determined but heavily influenced by social circumstances. Moreover, law enforcement practices and judicial biases reinforce male criminality, creating a feedback loop that sustains the gender disparity.

Therefore, the explanation for why more men commit crimes than women cannot be reduced to biology or socialization alone. It is the dynamic interaction of evolutionary biology, social structures, cultural norms, and individual psychological factors that produces this persistent pattern. Addressing male criminality requires multifaceted interventions that consider these diverse influences, including challenging harmful gender norms, improving social conditions, and reforming criminal justice practices.

## Conclusion

Men commit more crimes than women due to a combination of biological, psychological, and sociological factors. Evolutionary pressures and hormonal influences predispose men to aggression and competitiveness, while socialization and patriarchal structures reinforce these traits and provide greater opportunities for crime. Psychological factors such as low resting heart rate also contribute to risk-taking behavior among men. The gender equality hypothesis further explains how social changes affect crime rates across genders.

Understanding these complexities is essential for developing effective crime prevention strategies and promoting gender equity in criminal justice. Future research should continue to integrate biological and social perspectives to deepen our understanding of gender and crime.
