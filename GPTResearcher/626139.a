# Why Might Managers Do Things That Conflict with Their Own Ethical Values?  
*An In-depth Analytical Report*  

---

## Introduction  

Managers are often perceived as the ethical compass of organizations, entrusted with upholding corporate values and guiding employees toward responsible conduct. However, paradoxically, managers sometimes engage in actions that conflict with their own ethical values. Understanding why this occurs is critical for organizations aiming to foster ethical cultures and reduce misconduct. This report explores the multifaceted reasons managers might act contrary to their ethics, drawing on contemporary research and theories from organizational behavior, psychology, and business ethics.

## The Ethical Paradox in Organizations  

Research reveals a paradox where even managers in ethical organizations may engage in unethical behavior. One study highlights that as organizations become more ethical, certain forces—termed upward, downward, backward, and forward forces—intensify, increasing the likelihood of unethical actions by employees and managers alike ([Kaptein, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9136832/)). For example, the pressure to maintain an ethical reputation (forward force) can paradoxically encourage concealment of defects or unethical shortcuts to preserve that image. This paradox suggests that ethical intentions alone do not immunize managers against ethical lapses.

## Organizational Pressures and Unrealistic Expectations  

A significant driver of ethical conflicts for managers is the pressure to meet unrealistic organizational expectations. Lynn S. Paine (2024) notes that managers often face intense demands such as tight deadlines, high production targets, or aggressive financial goals. These pressures can compel even well-intentioned managers to cut ethical corners to achieve objectives, particularly when organizational culture prioritizes results over processes ([Paine, 2024](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/when-managers-set-unrealistic-expectations-employees-cut-ethical-corners)).  

This pressure creates a moral hazard where managers may tacitly or explicitly encourage subordinates to overlook ethical considerations, leading to a culture where the ends justify the means. The fear of penalties or loss of approval for failing to meet targets further exacerbates this behavior.

## Cognitive and Psychological Factors  

Psychological biases and cognitive limitations also contribute to ethical conflicts among managers. Overconfidence, confirmation bias, and selective information processing can cloud ethical judgment. For instance, a manager overly confident in their decisions may underestimate the ethical risks or rationalize questionable actions as necessary or harmless ([Accounting Insights, 2025](https://accountinginsights.org/factors-influencing-ethical-and-unethical-business-decisions/)).  

Moreover, managers may fail to recognize the ethical dimensions of complex business problems, perceiving them solely as operational or financial issues. This ethical blindness reduces their ability to analyze situations from a moral standpoint, increasing the likelihood of unethical choices ([Boatright, 2013](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/10/21/confronting-ethical-dilemmas-at-work-why-do-good-people-do-bad-things/)).

## Conflicting Stakeholder Interests  

Managers often navigate competing demands from diverse stakeholders—shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, and communities—each with distinct and sometimes conflicting priorities. For example, shareholders may demand profit maximization, while employees seek job security and fair treatment. These conflicts can place managers in ethical dilemmas where satisfying one group may harm another ([Penpoin, 2024](https://penpoin.com/stakeholder-conflict/)).  

Resource allocation conflicts are particularly challenging. Limited financial or human resources mean that managers must prioritize certain stakeholder interests over others, potentially compromising ethical standards to meet the most pressing demands. Such trade-offs can force managers to act against their personal ethical convictions to serve perceived organizational or stakeholder imperatives.

## Organizational Culture and Ethical Climate  

The ethical culture of an organization significantly influences managerial behavior. When ethics is not deeply embedded in the corporate culture or is treated as a secondary concern behind profits and efficiency, managers may feel justified or compelled to sideline ethical considerations ([Journal of Business Ethics, 1985](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00382676)).  

Conversely, even in organizations with strong ethical cultures, the complexity of ethical norms and the sheer volume of ethical standards can overwhelm managers. Overregulation or excessive ethical demands may lead to "ethics fatigue," where managers become desensitized or cynical, inadvertently increasing unethical behavior ([Kaptein, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9136832/)).

## Incentive Systems and Organizational Controls  

Incentive structures that reward short-term performance without integrating ethical metrics can unintentionally promote unethical behavior. Managers motivated primarily by bonuses, promotions, or recognition tied to financial or operational targets may prioritize these outcomes over ethical conduct ([Boatright, 2013](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/10/21/confronting-ethical-dilemmas-at-work-why-do-good-people-do-bad-things/)).  

Furthermore, inadequate monitoring and weak internal controls can embolden managers to engage in unethical acts with low perceived risk of detection or sanction. The erosion of organizational culture during growth or mergers can further weaken ethical norms, leaving managers without clear guidance or accountability ([Boatright, 2013](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/10/21/confronting-ethical-dilemmas-at-work-why-do-good-people-do-bad-things/)).

## Social and Normative Pressures  

Managers operate within a social context where normative pressures shape behavior. The desire to conform to peer norms, comply with superiors, or maintain group cohesion can lead managers to act unethically despite personal misgivings. Social learning theory explains how managers may imitate unethical behaviors observed in others, especially if such behaviors appear rewarded or unpunished ([Business Ethics Quarterly, 2018](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-ethics-quarterly/article/ethical-culture-in-organizations-a-review-and-agenda-for-future-research/5ECE055C6B5A931FCD12D6D28E297EDC)).  

Additionally, managers may experience role conflict, where their responsibilities to different constituencies impose incompatible demands, leading to ethical compromises. For example, a manager may feel torn between loyalty to the company and obligations to customers or employees.

## Ethical Blind Spots and Lack of Ethical Training  

Many managers lack sufficient training or tools to identify and resolve ethical dilemmas effectively. Ethical decision-making requires sensitivity to moral issues and the ability to apply ethical frameworks, skills often underdeveloped in managerial education ([Boatright, 2013](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/10/21/confronting-ethical-dilemmas-at-work-why-do-good-people-do-bad-things/)).  

New graduates or less experienced managers are particularly vulnerable, as they may not perceive the ethical dimensions of business challenges or may succumb to organizational pressures without adequate support. Without proactive ethics training and reinforcement, managers may inadvertently engage in unethical conduct.

## The Role of Ethical Paradoxes and Overcommitment to Ethics  

Interestingly, overcommitment to ethics can also backfire. When organizations impose too many detailed ethical standards or demand excessive transparency, managers may experience stress or confusion, leading to unintended unethical behavior ([Kaptein, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9136832/)). This phenomenon, known as the "gold digger effect," illustrates how excessive ethical demands can paradoxically increase unethical actions.  

---

## Summary and Opinion  

In summary, managers may act against their own ethical values due to a complex interplay of organizational pressures, psychological biases, conflicting stakeholder demands, cultural factors, incentive misalignments, social influences, and insufficient ethical training. These factors create environments where ethical lapses become more likely, even among well-intentioned individuals.  

My analysis suggests that the root causes are often systemic rather than individual moral failings. Organizations must therefore focus on creating realistic expectations, embedding ethics deeply into culture, aligning incentives with ethical outcomes, providing robust ethics education, and managing stakeholder conflicts effectively. Addressing these systemic issues will reduce the ethical paradox where good managers do bad things and foster sustainable ethical behavior.
