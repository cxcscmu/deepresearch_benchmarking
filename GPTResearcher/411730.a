# Does War Make States? Rentierism and the Formation of States in the Middle East

## Introduction

The classic theory of state formation, famously encapsulated by Charles Tilly’s dictum that “war makes states,” posits that the process of war-making compels rulers to extract resources from society, build centralized bureaucracies, and ultimately forge stronger, more legitimate states. This model has been widely applied to explain the emergence of modern states in Western Europe and parts of Asia. However, its applicability to the Middle East, particularly the rentier states of the Arab world, has been increasingly questioned. This report examines the interaction between war and rentierism in shaping state formation in the Middle East, assessing whether war indeed makes states in this region or if rentierism fundamentally alters this dynamic.

## The Tillyian Model of State Formation

Charles Tilly’s model emphasizes the role of war as a catalyst for state formation. According to Tilly, war-making necessitates resource extraction (primarily taxation), which in turn fosters the development of centralized bureaucracies and political institutions. This process leads to the consolidation of state power and the emergence of legitimate political authority. The model assumes a symbiotic relationship between war-makers and civilian state-makers, where the need for resources compels rulers to negotiate political rights with society, thereby fostering state legitimacy ([Tilly, 1985](https://docslib.org/doc/5098957/state-formation-processes-in-rentier-states-the-middle-eastern-case)).

## Rentierism in the Middle East: A Disruptive Factor

Rentierism refers to a state's reliance on substantial external rents, primarily from natural resources such as oil, rather than taxation of its own population. In the Middle East, many states derive significant revenues from oil exports, which profoundly shape their political economies and state formation processes. This external income reduces the state's dependence on domestic resource extraction, weakening the incentive to build strong, accountable institutions that represent citizens’ interests.

The rentier state model explains how oil wealth allows governments to provide extensive welfare benefits and patronage without taxing their populations, thereby undermining the traditional fiscal contract between state and society. This dynamic inhibits the development of institutionalized state structures and political legitimacy, as rulers do not need to negotiate political rights in exchange for taxation ([Mahdavy, 1970](https://docslib.org/doc/5098957/state-formation-processes-in-rentier-states-the-middle-eastern-case); [Luciani, 1988](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/abs/does-war-make-states-rentierism-and-the-formation-of-states-in-the-middle-east/FDD1AB00D427FD180F396794D2BB665E)).

## War and State Formation in the Middle East: Empirical Observations

The Middle East has been a region marked by frequent wars and conflicts, including interstate wars (e.g., Arab-Israeli wars, Iran-Iraq war, Gulf wars) and internal conflicts. According to the Tillyian framework, such conflict should have fostered stronger state institutions through increased resource extraction and bureaucratization. However, empirical evidence suggests a more complex picture.

Studies comparing rentier and non-rentier states in the region reveal that rentierism significantly alters the war-state formation nexus. For example, Iraq and Jordan, both exposed to warfare, differ markedly in their rentier status and state formation outcomes. Iraq, a rentier state with substantial oil revenues, has experienced state weakness and institutional fragmentation despite repeated wars. Jordan, with fewer rents, has developed relatively stronger state institutions through war-induced resource extraction ([Heydemann, 2000](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/abs/does-war-make-states-rentierism-and-the-formation-of-states-in-the-middle-east/FDD1AB00D427FD180F396794D2BB665E)).

Similarly, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Tunisia, both less affected by war, show divergent state formation trajectories influenced by their rentier status. The UAE, a high-rentier state, exhibits centralized authority with extensive welfare provision but limited political participation, while Tunisia, a non-rentier state, has developed more institutionalized political structures despite economic constraints ([Schwarz, 2004](https://docslib.org/doc/5098957/state-formation-processes-in-rentier-states-the-middle-eastern-case)).

## Rentierism as an Obstacle to War-Induced State Formation

The key argument emerging from recent scholarship is that rentierism abrogates the Tillyian process linking war-making to state-making. The availability of large external rents reduces the state's need to extract resources domestically, thereby weakening the fiscal contract that underpins political representation and institutional development. Consequently, war-making does not translate into stronger, more legitimate states in rentier contexts.

This dynamic is illustrated in Figure 2 of the European Political Science Review article, which depicts how rentierism disrupts the traditional war-state formation linkage in the Arab Middle East since 1945 ([Heydemann, 2000](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/abs/does-war-make-states-rentierism-and-the-formation-of-states-in-the-middle-east/FDD1AB00D427FD180F396794D2BB665E)).

Moreover, the diminished need for taxation impedes the emergence of legitimate political rule, as rulers are less compelled to negotiate political rights with society. The process through which war-makers are “civilianized” and integrated into state institutions does not materialize in rentier states, leading to institutional weakness and potential state fragility ([Luciani, 1988](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/abs/does-war-make-states-rentierism-and-the-formation-of-states-in-the-middle-east/FDD1AB00D427FD180F396794D2BB665E)).

## The Twin Phenomenon: State Weakness and Life Support

Rentierism produces a paradoxical “twin phenomenon” in the Middle East: on one hand, states remain institutionally weak and lack legitimacy; on the other, they receive life support through external rents that sustain welfare provision and patronage networks. This dynamic allows potentially failed states to persist, as external rents compensate for institutional deficiencies and social fragmentation ([Heydemann, 2000](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-political-science-review/article/abs/does-war-make-states-rentierism-and-the-formation-of-states-in-the-middle-east/FDD1AB00D427FD180F396794D2BB665E)).

The Gulf monarchies exemplify this pattern, where vast oil wealth funds extensive welfare programs and security apparatuses, maintaining regime stability despite limited political participation and institutionalization ([Clarke, 2025](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/middle-east-briefs/meb164.html)).

## New Rentierism and Regional Dynamics

Since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, a “new rentierism” has emerged, wherein oil-rich states use their wealth not only to maintain domestic authoritarianism but also to intervene in regional conflicts to suppress democratic movements. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as “hyper-rentiers,” have deployed their oil wealth to fund military interventions and counterrevolutions, thereby shaping the regional political order and limiting the prospects for democratic state formation ([Clarke, 2025](https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/middle-east-briefs/meb164.html)).

This new rentierism underscores the geopolitical dimension of rentier wealth, extending its impact beyond domestic state formation to regional authoritarian resilience.

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence indicates that the classic Tillyian model of war-induced state formation does not straightforwardly apply to the Middle East due to the pervasive influence of rentierism. While war remains a significant social and political factor, its capacity to foster strong, legitimate state institutions is undermined by the availability of external rents that reduce the need for domestic resource extraction and political negotiation.

Rentierism thus serves as a structural obstacle to the traditional war-state formation process, producing states that are institutionally weak yet sustained by resource wealth. This dynamic results in a paradoxical stability that masks underlying fragility and limits political development.

In my assessment, understanding Middle Eastern state formation requires integrating rentierism into the analysis of war and political development. Rentierism is not merely a minor factor but a central determinant that reshapes the pathways and outcomes of state formation in the region. Future research and policy approaches should account for this complex interplay to better address the challenges of governance, legitimacy, and stability in rentier states.
