# Improving Medicaid While Delivering Cost-Effectiveness: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Medicaid is a cornerstone of the U.S. healthcare system, providing coverage to over 90 million low-income individuals, including children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. As Medicaid enrollment expands—projected to cover more than one-quarter of Americans by 2014 and continuing to grow—states face unprecedented budget pressures. This growth, coupled with rising healthcare costs, necessitates reforms that improve care quality while ensuring financial sustainability. This report examines strategies to improve Medicaid delivery and payment systems to achieve cost-effectiveness, drawing on recent research, policy analyses, and expert insights.

## Challenges Facing Medicaid

The Medicaid program faces multiple challenges that threaten its sustainability:

- **Rising Enrollment and Costs**: Medicaid enrollment has surged, especially post-COVID-19, increasing state and federal expenditures significantly ([Rockefeller Institute of Government, 2024](https://rockinst.org/issue-area/state-medicaid-cost-containment-strategies-before-and-after-covid-19/)).

- **Medicaid Cuts and Financial Strain**: Proposed federal reforms, including per-capita caps, reductions in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), and work reporting requirements, risk coverage losses and increased uncompensated care costs, particularly impacting counties and rural providers ([National Association of Counties, 2025](https://www.naco.org/resource/federal-reforms-medicaid-financing-what-counties-should-know)).

- **Provider Participation and Access**: Low Medicaid reimbursement rates and inadequate risk adjustment deter physician participation, limiting patient access to care ([PubMed, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40190027/)).

- **Fragmented Care Delivery**: Traditional Medicaid models often lack integration across physical, behavioral, and social services, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes.

## Strategies for Improving Medicaid Delivery and Payment Systems

### 1. Payment Reform Toward Value-Based Models

Transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based payment models is critical for aligning incentives with quality and cost-effectiveness.

- **Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)**: Medicaid ACOs have demonstrated potential in improving care coordination, reducing emergency department visits, and slowing expenditure growth. Studies in Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Vermont show that Medicaid ACOs can generate shared savings and improve quality metrics, especially when providers assume two-sided financial risk ([PMC, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6554509/)).

- **Incorporating Social and Behavioral Risk Factors**: Adjusting payments to reflect patients’ clinical, social, and behavioral complexities enhances provider willingness to serve Medicaid populations and supports equity ([PubMed, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40190027/)).

- **Alternative Payment Models (APMs)**: States are experimenting with patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), ACA Health Homes, episodes of care payments, and all-payer models to foster integrated, patient-centered care ([KFF, 2022](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-delivery-system-and-payment-strategies-aimed-at-improving-outcomes-and-lowering-costs-in-medicaid/)).

### 2. Enhancing Medicaid Managed Care Effectiveness

Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) cover over 74% of Medicaid enrollees and are pivotal in cost containment and access improvement.

- **Comprehensive-Risk Managed Care**: These plans provide most Medicaid-covered services and incentivize preventive and coordinated care, which can reduce unnecessary utilization ([Rockefeller Institute of Government, 2024](https://rockinst.org/issue-area/state-medicaid-cost-containment-strategies-before-and-after-covid-19/)).

- **Challenges**: Despite incentives, managed care faces issues such as limited provider networks, low payment rates, and provider attrition, which may negatively affect care quality and access ([Rockefeller Institute of Government, 2024](https://rockinst.org/issue-area/state-medicaid-cost-containment-strategies-before-and-after-covid-19/)).

- **Performance Measurement and Incentives**: States are increasingly incorporating plan performance metrics and financial incentives to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness ([KFF, 2022](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-delivery-system-and-payment-strategies-aimed-at-improving-outcomes-and-lowering-costs-in-medicaid/)).

### 3. Leveraging Technology and Process Automation

Hospitals and Medicaid programs can adopt process automation to optimize revenue cycles and reduce financial losses due to Medicaid cuts.

- **Revenue Cycle Optimization**: Automation streamlines billing and claims processing, improving bad debt recovery and reducing administrative burdens ([Qualify Health, 2025](https://qualify.health/blog/3-strategies-offset-medicaid-cuts-2025/)).

- **Patient Assistance and Pharmacy Operations**: Efficient financial aid processing ensures timely care and medication adherence, which can improve health outcomes and reduce costly complications ([Qualify Health, 2025](https://qualify.health/blog/3-strategies-offset-medicaid-cuts-2025/)).

### 4. Addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and Health Equity

Medicaid programs increasingly recognize the importance of integrating social services with healthcare.

- **Medicaid Section 1115 Demonstrations**: States are encouraged to focus demonstrations on improving health outcomes for vulnerable populations, including addressing SDOH ([CMS, 2025](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-refocuses-its-core-mission-and-preserving-state-federal-medicaid-partnership)).

- **Incorporating Equity in Risk Adjustment**: Adjusting payments for social and behavioral risks can incentivize providers to serve high-need populations and reduce disparities ([PubMed, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40190027/)).

- **Community Care Hubs and Integrated Services**: Models that coordinate healthcare with social support services have shown promise in improving outcomes and reducing costs ([CHCS, 2010](https://www.chcs.org/resource/payment-reform-creating-a-sustainable-future-for-medicaid/)).

### 5. Policy Considerations and Federal-State Partnership

Sustaining Medicaid requires robust federal-state collaboration and thoughtful policy design.

- **Protecting the Federal Match**: Reductions in FMAP or imposing per-capita caps risk shifting costs to states and counties, potentially causing coverage losses and increased uncompensated care ([National Association of Counties, 2025](https://www.naco.org/resource/federal-reforms-medicaid-financing-what-counties-should-know)).

- **Avoiding Non-Core Spending**: CMS is refocusing Medicaid spending on core healthcare services, discouraging expenditures on unrelated programs to preserve financial health ([CMS, 2025](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-refocuses-its-core-mission-and-preserving-state-federal-medicaid-partnership)).

- **Work Reporting and Administrative Burdens**: Work requirements may reduce coverage and increase administrative complexity without clear evidence of cost savings ([National Association of Counties, 2025](https://www.naco.org/resource/federal-reforms-medicaid-financing-what-counties-should-know)).

## Evidence of Impact and Outcomes

- **Cost Savings and Quality Improvements**: Medicaid ACOs in multiple states have demonstrated reductions in emergency department visits and slower growth in expenditures, with Vermont showing statistically significant cost containment ([PMC, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6554509/)).

- **Managed Care Growth vs. Cost Containment**: Despite managed care’s growth, spending for managed care enrollees rose 17.1% between 2019 and 2021, exceeding total Medicaid spending growth, indicating a need for further refinement of managed care strategies ([Rockefeller Institute of Government, 2024](https://rockinst.org/issue-area/state-medicaid-cost-containment-strategies-before-and-after-covid-19/)).

- **Physician Perspectives**: Most physicians believe accountable care incentives and improved risk adjustment will enhance Medicaid patient care, underscoring the importance of provider engagement in reforms ([PubMed, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40190027/)).

## Recommendations

Based on the evidence and current policy environment, the following recommendations can guide Medicaid improvement efforts:

1. **Expand and Refine Value-Based Payment Models**: States should continue developing Medicaid ACOs and other APMs with robust risk adjustment that includes social and behavioral factors to promote equity and provider participation.

2. **Strengthen Medicaid Managed Care**: Enhance provider networks, increase payment rates where necessary, and implement rigorous performance measurement to ensure managed care delivers on cost and quality goals.

3. **Invest in Technology and Automation**: Hospitals and Medicaid programs should adopt process automation to optimize revenue cycles and improve patient financial assistance processes.

4. **Integrate Social Services with Healthcare**: Medicaid programs should leverage Section 1115 waivers and other mechanisms to address social determinants of health, improving outcomes and reducing costly hospitalizations.

5. **Preserve Federal-State Partnership and Funding**: Policymakers must avoid cuts to FMAP and per-capita caps that shift costs to states and jeopardize coverage, while focusing Medicaid spending on core healthcare services.

6. **Engage Providers and Patients**: Incorporate provider feedback into payment reforms and ensure patient-centered approaches that address barriers to care.

## Conclusion

Improving Medicaid while delivering cost-effectiveness is a complex but achievable goal. The transition to value-based payment models, particularly Medicaid ACOs, shows promise in improving care quality and containing costs. Strengthening Medicaid managed care, leveraging technology, addressing social determinants, and preserving the federal-state partnership are critical components of a sustainable Medicaid future. Policymakers and stakeholders must act decisively to implement these strategies, ensuring Medicaid continues to serve vulnerable populations effectively and efficiently.
