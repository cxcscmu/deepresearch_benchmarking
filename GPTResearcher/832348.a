# How the Coronavirus Could Trigger a Backslide on Freedom Around the World

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, has led to unprecedented government interventions worldwide. While these interventions aimed to curb the spread of the virus and save lives, they have also raised significant concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and democratic freedoms. This report examines how the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a backslide on freedom globally, analyzing the mechanisms, extent, and implications of this phenomenon based on recent empirical studies and expert analyses.

## Government Responses and Democratic Erosion

### Emergency Measures and Democratic Standards

Nearly every country adopted emergency measures to manage the pandemic, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and surveillance enhancements. While such measures are necessary during public health crises, their implementation has often violated democratic standards. According to Edgell et al. (2021), most countries engaged in some form of violation of democratic norms during the pandemic, with authoritarian practices such as indefinite states of emergency, legislative limitations, government disinformation, and restricted access to information being more prevalent than illiberal practices like discrimination or abusive enforcement ([Edgell et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8417367/)).

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) allows for derogations from certain rights during public emergencies but mandates that such measures be proportionate, necessary, and non-discriminatory. However, many governments exceeded these bounds, using the pandemic as a pretext to consolidate power and suppress dissent (United Nations, 2020).

### Examples of Democratic Backsliding

Countries with pre-existing democratic vulnerabilities, such as Hungary and Poland, exemplify how the pandemic accelerated democratic erosion. Hungary enacted regulations granting the government the right to issue special decrees under emergency rule, while Poland restricted public health experts from expressing views on the pandemic response ([Levine, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812335/)). Globally, 61% of countries imposed problematic restrictions on individual rights or democratic processes, with 17 countries making substantial negative changes to civil liberties ([Levine, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812335/)).

In some cases, these restrictions extended to the suppression of independent media and civil society. For instance, journalists in Bangladesh faced life sentences for criticizing government responses, and legislatures in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Zambia were dissolved citing pandemic-related justifications ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/spotlight-freedom-impact-coronavirus-basic-freedoms)).

## Mechanisms Driving the Backslide

### Use of Public Health as a Pretext for Political Gain

Authoritarian regimes and some democracies alike have exploited the pandemic to justify excessive authority and crackdowns on freedoms. This trend reflects a broader global democratic decline that predated COVID-19 but was exacerbated during the crisis ([Edgell et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8417367/); [Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/spotlight-freedom-impact-coronavirus-basic-freedoms)).

In many countries, governments imposed lockdowns and restrictions with heavy-handed enforcement, leading to mass arrests and detentions. For example, the Philippines arrested over 100,000 people for alleged violations of COVID-19 rules, while El Salvador detained 17,000 individuals arbitrarily, including human rights activists ([DW, 2021](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-leads-to-erosion-of-fundamental-rights-and-freedom/a-57433400)).

### Surveillance and Restriction of Civil Liberties

The pandemic accelerated the adoption of surveillance technologies and information control, often without adequate safeguards for privacy or accountability. These measures, while aimed at tracking and containing the virus, have raised concerns about long-term impacts on freedom and democratic governance ([BMC Public Health, 2023](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-16172-y)).

### Disinformation and Media Suppression

Government disinformation campaigns and restrictions on media freedom have been common, undermining transparency and public trust. This has hindered effective public health communication and democratic debate, essential components of crisis management ([Edgell et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8417367/)).

## Impact on Civil Society and Democratic Processes

### Curtailment of Civic Freedoms

Restrictions on assembly, speech, and participation have limited civil society's ability to hold governments accountable during the pandemic. In some countries, civil society organizations have filled governance gaps creatively, but overall, the pandemic has weakened democratic engagement ([DW, 2021](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-leads-to-erosion-of-fundamental-rights-and-freedom/a-57433400)).

### Elections and Legislative Functions

Several countries postponed or altered electoral processes citing public health concerns, sometimes undermining democratic legitimacy. Legislative bodies were suspended or operated under restricted conditions, limiting checks on executive power ([Edgell et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8417367/)).

## Balancing Public Health and Freedom

### The Trade-Off Dilemma

Governments faced the complex challenge of balancing public health imperatives with civil liberties. Measures such as business closures and restrictions on movement have health benefits but also economic and rights-related costs. Democratic participation activities like protests and elections posed risks of virus spread but are vital for governance ([Levine, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812335/)).

### The Role of Legitimate and Benign Governance

The pandemic highlighted the importance of legitimate and benign governments that weigh competing goods impartially. In contrast, autocratic regimes often exploited the crisis to consolidate power without balancing public health and democratic freedoms ([Levine, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7812335/)).

## Empirical Evidence on Policy Responses and Freedom

### Global Analyses of Policy Effectiveness

Studies analyzing government responses to COVID-19 show that stringent early interventions can effectively reduce virus transmission but may carry socio-economic and psychological costs. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other research highlight the need to consider socio-economic factors to ensure compliance and minimize adverse effects ([Scientific Reports, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31709-2)).

### Long-Term Dynamics of Government Responses

Research indicates that government responses have a significant impact on controlling COVID-19 in the long run but also exhibit cyclical patterns influenced by policy fatigue, virus mutations, and compliance levels. Transparency and accountability are critical to sustaining effective and rights-respecting responses ([PLOS One, 2022](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267232)).

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The COVID-19 pandemic has undeniably triggered a backslide on freedom worldwide, with governments imposing emergency measures that often exceeded necessary limits and undermined democratic standards. This erosion is particularly pronounced in countries with pre-existing democratic weaknesses but is also evident in established democracies.

While protecting public health during a pandemic is imperative, it is equally crucial to safeguard civil liberties and democratic processes to prevent the normalization of authoritarian practices. Transparency, accountability, and community engagement emerge as essential pillars for balancing health imperatives with freedom.

Going forward, international human rights frameworks should guide emergency responses, ensuring that restrictions are proportionate, necessary, and temporary. Civil society and independent media must be supported to maintain democratic oversight. Governments should also invest in building resilient health systems and governance structures that can manage crises without compromising fundamental freedoms.
