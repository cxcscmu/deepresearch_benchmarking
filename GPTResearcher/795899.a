# Report on the Recent Rise in Petrol Prices: Causes and Analysis

## Introduction

In early 2025, petrol prices in the United States and globally have experienced a noticeable increase, impacting consumers and economic indicators such as inflation. Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind this rise requires an examination of supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical factors, refinery operations, trade policies, and market sentiment. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the causes of the recent petrol price increases, supported by data and expert insights from authoritative sources, with a focus on the U.S. market but also considering global influences.

## Overview of Petrol Price Trends in Early 2025

As of April 2025, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline in the U.S. has risen to approximately $3.26, marking a significant increase over recent weeks and months ([AAA Newsroom, 2025](https://www.aaa.com/news/jump-at-the-pump-another-week-of-rising-gas-prices)). This rise follows a pattern similar to previous years but has been influenced by unique factors in 2025, including geopolitical tensions and trade policy changes. Prices remain below the peak levels seen in mid-2022 but are causing concern due to their impact on consumer budgets and inflation.

## Key Factors Driving Petrol Price Increases

### 1. Crude Oil Price Movements and Supply Dynamics

Crude oil prices are the primary driver of petrol prices since oil constitutes roughly 60% of the cost at the pump. In early 2025, crude oil prices have hovered around $70 to $80 per barrel, with Brent crude futures recently trading near three-year lows around $65-$70 per barrel but showing volatility due to market uncertainties ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

Several supply-side factors have influenced crude prices:

- **Global Oil Supply Surplus and OPEC+ Policies**: The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a global oil supply surplus of approximately 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2025, with potential for an additional 400,000 bpd if OPEC+ fully unwinds voluntary production cuts. Non-OPEC+ producers, especially in the Americas (U.S., Brazil, Canada), are expanding output, contributing to oversupply concerns ([IEA, 2025](https://www.energyconnects.com/opinion/features/2025/march/iea-oil-market-2025-rising-supply-slowing-demand-and-price-volatility)).

- **Seasonal and Unplanned Production Disruptions**: Temporary declines in supply due to seasonal weather disruptions in North America and unplanned outages in countries like Nigeria and Libya have caused short-term supply tightening, exerting upward pressure on prices ([IEA, 2025](https://www.energyconnects.com/opinion/features/2025/march/iea-oil-market-2025-rising-supply-slowing-demand-and-price-volatility)).

- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Conflicts in the Middle East, particularly Israel's war against Hamas and related Iranian involvement, have heightened market volatility and risk premiums on oil prices. Missile attacks and fears of escalation have kept investors cautious, contributing to price spikes ([CBS News, 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-up-inflation/)).

### 2. Refinery Operations and Seasonal Factors

Refinery activity directly affects the supply of gasoline and other refined products. Several operational factors have contributed to rising petrol prices:

- **Refinery Maintenance and Seasonal Gasoline Blends**: Spring is a typical period for refinery maintenance, during which output is reduced to perform essential upkeep. Additionally, refineries switch to producing more expensive summer-grade gasoline blends that meet stricter environmental standards, increasing production costs. These factors reduce gasoline supply temporarily, pushing prices higher ([AAA Newsroom, 2025](https://www.aaa.com/news/jump-at-the-pump-another-week-of-rising-gas-prices)).

- **Impact of Extreme Weather**: The unusually high temperatures recorded in parts of the U.S. in early 2025 forced some refineries to reduce output, as many facilities operate optimally within certain temperature ranges. This reduction in refinery throughput contributed to tightening gasoline supply and price increases ([CBS News, 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-national-average-august-oil/)).

- **Refining Margins and Profitability**: Despite robust refinery utilization rates (~90.3% in Q4 2024), analysts have lowered earnings expectations for refiners due to weakening fuel demand growth and geopolitical uncertainties. Refiners face margin pressure, especially when forced to switch feedstocks or reduce processing rates ([OilPrice.com, 2025](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Refiners-Face-Headwinds-in-2025.html)).

### 3. Trade Policies and Tariffs

Trade tensions and tariff policies have introduced additional complexity to the petrol price landscape:

- **Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican Oil Imports**: In March 2025, the U.S. imposed tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, except for energy products from Canada, which face a 10% tariff. Since approximately 55% of U.S. crude imports (about 4.5 million bpd) come from Canada, these tariffs increase costs for refiners relying on Canadian heavy crude, which is often cheaper and suited to certain refinery configurations. The increased import costs are expected to be passed on to consumers, raising gasoline prices ([BNN Bloomberg, 2025](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/markets/oil/2025/03/04/why-trumps-tariffs-could-drive-us-gasoline-prices-higher/)).

- **Refinery Adaptation Costs**: Some U.S. refineries designed to process heavier Canadian crude may need to switch to lighter and more expensive domestic crude grades, reducing profit margins and potentially leading to higher retail fuel prices ([BNN Bloomberg, 2025](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/markets/oil/2025/03/04/why-trumps-tariffs-could-drive-us-gasoline-prices-higher/)).

- **Broader Economic Impacts**: Tariffs contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing costs across supply chains, which can indirectly affect fuel prices. Additionally, trade tensions have dampened economic growth prospects, reducing demand growth and increasing market volatility ([J.P. Morgan Research, 2025](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs)).

### 4. Demand-Side Considerations

While supply factors have been prominent, demand dynamics also influence petrol prices:

- **Slowing Demand Growth**: The IEA forecasts weaker-than-expected global oil demand growth in 2025, with an increase of only about 730,000 bpd, revised downward due to trade tensions and economic uncertainties. Asia, led by China’s petrochemical sector, accounts for most demand growth, but demand for refined fuels in advanced economies is plateauing ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

- **Electric Vehicle Adoption and Emissions Regulations**: The transportation sector is gradually shifting due to rising electric vehicle (EV) adoption and stricter emissions standards, reducing traditional gasoline demand growth, especially in developed markets ([Energy Connects, 2025](https://www.energyconnects.com/opinion/features/2025/march/iea-oil-market-2025-rising-supply-slowing-demand-and-price-volatility)).

- **Seasonal Driving Patterns**: The approach of the peak driving season in spring and summer typically increases gasoline demand, contributing to price rises. Additionally, specific events, such as the solar eclipse in early 2025, temporarily boosted driving activity and fuel consumption ([CBS News, 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-up-inflation/)).

## Interplay of Factors and Market Outlook

The recent rise in petrol prices is the result of a complex interplay between supply constraints, refinery operations, trade policies, geopolitical risks, and demand patterns. Notably:

- Despite a global oil supply surplus, localized refinery maintenance and operational constraints have tightened gasoline supply in the U.S., pushing prices upward.

- Tariffs on Canadian crude imports have increased costs for U.S. refiners, especially in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where refineries are optimized for heavy crude. This has led to higher wholesale gasoline prices and reduced refinery margins.

- Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have introduced risk premiums into crude prices, adding upward pressure on petrol prices.

- Economic uncertainties and trade tensions have dampened demand growth, but seasonal factors and specific events have temporarily increased consumption.

- Market volatility remains high, with oil prices fluctuating between $60 and $80 per barrel in early 2025, influencing retail gasoline prices accordingly.

## Conclusion

The rise in petrol prices in early 2025 is attributable to a combination of supply-side disruptions, refinery maintenance and operational challenges, trade policy-induced cost increases, geopolitical tensions, and seasonal demand fluctuations. While global oil supply remains ample, localized factors and policy decisions, particularly U.S. tariffs on Canadian crude imports, have increased costs for refiners and consumers. Geopolitical risks and market uncertainty further exacerbate price volatility. Although demand growth is slowing due to structural changes like EV adoption, seasonal driving and specific events continue to support gasoline consumption.

Consumers can expect continued price fluctuations in the near term, influenced by refinery operations, trade negotiations, geopolitical developments, and economic conditions. Policymakers and industry stakeholders should consider these interconnected factors when assessing strategies to stabilize fuel prices and support energy security.
