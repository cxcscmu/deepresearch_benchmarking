# Report: Why Have Used Car Prices Increased in 2025?

## Introduction

The used car market in 2025 has experienced a notable shift, with prices rising after a prolonged period of decline or stability. This trend marks a significant departure from the past two years, during which used car prices generally decreased or remained flat. Understanding the factors behind this increase is crucial for consumers, dealers, and policymakers alike. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the rise in used car prices in 2025, drawing on recent data and expert analyses. Key drivers include trade tariffs, supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, shifts in consumer demand, and broader economic conditions.

## Overview of the Price Increase

According to automotive research site iSeeCars, used car prices for one- to five-year-old vehicles increased by approximately 1% year-over-year as of March 2025, translating to an average price bump of about $317 ([Singh, 2025](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/11/used-car-prices-are-rising-2025/83050309007/)). Kelley Blue Book data corroborates this trend, noting that the average used car price rose roughly $170 from February to March 2025, reaching $25,180 ([Kelley Blue Book, 2025](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/average-used-car-price-starts-to-rise/)). This modest increase is widely viewed as the leading edge of a larger upward trend in used car prices throughout the year.

## Key Factors Driving Used Car Price Increases

### 1. Impact of Tariffs and Trade Wars

The most significant and immediate cause of rising used car prices in 2025 is the imposition of tariffs on new vehicles and auto parts, primarily under policies initiated by the Trump administration. Beginning in early 2025, a 25% tariff was applied to all new cars entering the United States, with additional tariffs on automotive parts scheduled to follow ([Kelley Blue Book, 2025](https://www.kbb.com/car-news/average-used-car-price-starts-to-rise/); [Neeley, 2025](https://carketa.com/auto-tariffs-used-car-pricing-inventory/)).

These tariffs have led to several cascading effects:

- **Increased New Car Prices**: The tariffs raise production costs for new vehicles, which automakers pass on to consumers. Cox Automotive estimates that imported vehicles could see price increases of up to $6,000 due to tariffs, with domestically assembled vehicles also facing increases of around $3,600 due to parts tariffs ([CNBC, 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/12/auto-tariffs-sales-costs.html)).

- **Reduced New Car Supply and Affordability**: Automakers have responded by pausing shipments, adjusting production strategies, or freezing exports to the U.S., leading to a contraction in the supply of affordable new vehicles ([Carscoops, 2025](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/04/used-cars-just-saw-their-first-price-bump-in-over-two-years/)). This scarcity drives consumers toward the used car market as a more affordable alternative.

- **Increased Demand for Used Cars**: As new car prices rise and supply tightens, more buyers turn to used vehicles, pushing up demand and prices in that segment ([Tampa Bay AutoNetwork, 2025](https://www.tampabayautonetwork.com/news/how-tariffs-will-affect-new-used-car-prices-in-2025/)).

- **Inventory Challenges for Dealerships**: Tariffs on Chinese imports and ongoing supply chain disruptions complicate inventory management for used car dealerships, limiting their ability to replenish stock and further constraining supply ([Neeley, 2025](https://carketa.com/auto-tariffs-used-car-pricing-inventory/)).

The interplay of these factors creates a "perfect storm" where tariffs not only increase new car prices but also indirectly inflate used car prices due to heightened demand and constrained supply.

### 2. Lasting Supply Chain Disruptions from COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions in the automotive supply chain, effects of which persist into 2025:

- **Production Shortfalls**: The pandemic led to factory shutdowns, raw material shortages (notably microchips), and shipping delays, cutting millions of vehicles from production in 2020 and 2021 ([Motor, 2023](https://www.motor.com/2023/07/long-covid-continues-to-impact-supply-chain-issues-and-new-vehicle-inventory/); [Michigan Journal of Economics, 2022](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2022/01/05/covid-19-supply-chain-shortages-and-the-automobile-industry/)).

- **Lease and Rental Market Void**: Traditionally, lease returns and ex-rental vehicles provide a steady stream of relatively new, well-maintained used cars. The pandemic caused a sharp decline in new lease agreements and rental fleet purchases, leading to a "missing generation" of used vehicles entering the market ([Digital Dealer, 2025](https://digitaldealer.com/sales-variable-ops/how-covid-19-created-a-lasting-supply-chain-void-in-the-automotive-industry/)).

- **Reduced Used Car Inventory**: The shortage of lease returns and ex-rental vehicles has created a persistent supply gap in the used car market, leading to increased competition for available stock and higher prices ([Digital Dealer, 2025](https://digitaldealer.com/sales-variable-ops/how-covid-19-created-a-lasting-supply-chain-void-in-the-automotive-industry/)).

- **Extended Vehicle Lifecycles**: Both rental companies and private owners are holding onto vehicles longer due to limited replacement options, further reducing the influx of used cars ([Digital Dealer, 2025](https://digitaldealer.com/sales-variable-ops/how-covid-19-created-a-lasting-supply-chain-void-in-the-automotive-industry/)).

These supply chain voids have compounded the effects of tariffs by limiting the availability of used cars, thereby driving prices upward.

### 3. Economic and Financing Conditions

Economic factors also influence used car prices:

- **High Interest Rates**: Auto loan rates remain near decades-high levels, with rates exceeding 9.64% for new vehicles and nearly 15% for used cars ([CNBC, 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/12/auto-tariffs-sales-costs.html)). This increases the total cost of ownership, potentially dampening demand but also pushing buyers toward more affordable used vehicles.

- **Inflation and Consumer Budgeting**: Inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty make consumers more budget-conscious, increasing reliance on used cars as affordable alternatives to new vehicles ([Tampa Bay AutoNetwork, 2025](https://www.tampabayautonetwork.com/news/how-tariffs-will-affect-new-used-car-prices-in-2025/)).

- **Declining Trade-In Values**: Trade-in values have fallen to four-year lows, reducing the affordability of new purchases and contributing to tighter used car supply ([Dealership Guy, 2025](https://news.dealershipguy.com/p/2025-auto-market-affordable-new-car-inventory-rises-used-car-supply-shrinks-2025-01-17)).

These economic conditions reinforce the demand for used cars while simultaneously limiting supply, contributing to price increases.

### 4. Shifts in Consumer Preferences and Market Dynamics

- **Increased Demand for Used Vehicles**: With new car prices rising, more consumers are turning to used cars, increasing demand and pushing prices higher ([iSeeCars, 2025](https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/cars/2025/04/10/used-car-prices-increase-consumers/83026082007/)).

- **Segment-Specific Trends**: SUVs and trucks have seen the largest price increases in the used market, with SUVs up 3.5% and trucks up 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting consumer preference for these vehicle types ([Carscoops, 2025](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/04/used-cars-just-saw-their-first-price-bump-in-over-two-years/)). Conversely, used electric vehicles (EVs) have experienced price declines, indicating differing market dynamics by vehicle type.

- **Technological Advancements**: Modern used cars equipped with advanced safety and infotainment technology command higher resale values, contributing to overall price increases ([Car Concierge Pro, 2025](https://carconciergepro.com/trends-in-2025-used-car-prices-visual-insights/)).

- **Regional Variations**: Demand and pricing trends vary by region, with North America favoring trucks and SUVs, Europe emphasizing compact EVs and hybrids, and Asia focusing on affordable sedans and hatchbacks ([Car Concierge Pro, 2025](https://carconciergepro.com/trends-in-2025-used-car-prices-visual-insights/)).

### 5. Dealer Inventory and Pricing Strategies

- **Inventory Constraints**: Dealers face challenges acquiring used car inventory due to tariffs, supply chain issues, and fewer trade-ins, leading to limited stock and higher prices ([Neeley, 2025](https://carketa.com/auto-tariffs-used-car-pricing-inventory/)).

- **Pricing Adjustments**: Dealers are adjusting pricing strategies to reflect market conditions, balancing demand with competitive pricing to maintain sales ([Neeley, 2025](https://carketa.com/auto-tariffs-used-car-pricing-inventory/)).

- **Enhanced Customer Service**: To retain customers amid price fluctuations, dealers are offering flexible financing and personalized experiences, which may indirectly support higher price points ([Neeley, 2025](https://carketa.com/auto-tariffs-used-car-pricing-inventory/)).

## Conclusion and Outlook

The rise in used car prices in 2025 results from a complex interplay of trade policy, lingering pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, economic conditions, and shifting consumer behavior. Tariffs on new vehicles and parts have increased new car prices, pushing more buyers into the used car market. Simultaneously, supply chain voids—especially the shortage of lease returns and ex-rental vehicles—have constrained used car inventory. Economic factors such as high interest rates and inflation further shape consumer demand and affordability dynamics.

While the current price increase is modest, data and expert analysis suggest that upward pressure on used car prices is likely to continue unless there is a significant policy reversal or resolution of supply chain issues. Dealers and consumers alike must navigate these challenges with informed strategies, including diversifying sourcing channels and exploring financing options.

Understanding these drivers is essential for making prudent decisions in the evolving automotive market landscape of 2025.
