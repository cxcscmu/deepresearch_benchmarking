# Report on the Prevalence and Nature of Spousal Abuse in the United States

## Introduction

Spousal abuse, a subset of domestic violence, remains a pervasive and critical public health and social issue in the United States. It encompasses a range of abusive behaviors perpetrated by one partner against another within an intimate relationship, including physical, sexual, psychological, and economic abuse. Understanding the prevalence, demographic patterns, and types of spousal abuse is essential for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. This report synthesizes recent and authoritative data sources to provide a comprehensive overview of how common spousal abuse is, with a focus on intimate partner violence (IPV) statistics, demographic variations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on abuse rates.

## Definition of Spousal Abuse

The U.S. Department of Justice defines domestic violence, including spousal abuse, as “a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship used by one partner to gain or keep control over the other intimate partner” ([FindLaw, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)). This encompasses physical violence, sexual violence, psychological aggression, coercive control, and economic abuse.

## Prevalence of Spousal Abuse

### Lifetime and Annual Prevalence

- According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) 2016/2017 data, approximately **47.3% of women** and **44.2% of men** in the U.S. have experienced some form of domestic violence in their lifetime, which includes physical, sexual, or psychological abuse ([CDC, 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/nisvs/documentation/NISVSReportonIPV_2022.pdf)). This suggests that nearly half of the adult population has been affected by spousal or intimate partner abuse at some point.

- The annual incidence is also significant, with more than **16 million people** in the U.S. suffering from intimate partner abuse each year ([Break the Cycle, 2024](https://www.breakthecycle.org/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

- Daily, over **20,000 phone calls** are made to domestic violence hotlines in the U.S., and almost **20 people are physically abused by their domestic partner every minute** ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

### Severity and Fatality

- Spousal abuse is a leading cause of injury to women, with **around 1 in 5 homicide victims** killed by their intimate partner ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

- Approximately **75% of fatal victims** of domestic violence are women, and by 2019, nearly **4 women were murdered daily by intimate partners**, reflecting a concerning increase after decades of decline ([Break the Cycle, 2024](https://www.breakthecycle.org/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

### Types of Abuse Experienced

- Psychological aggression is highly prevalent, with **48.8% of men and 48.4% of women** reporting at least one instance of psychologically aggressive behavior from a domestic partner ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

- Sexual violence affects **19.6% of women** and **7.6% of men**, with **14% to 25% of women** being sexually assaulted by their domestic partners during a relationship ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/); [PMC, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3830163/)).

- Financial abuse is also significant, with **21% to 60% of domestic violence victims losing their jobs** due to abuse, reflecting the economic control aspect of spousal abuse ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

## Demographic Variations in Spousal Abuse

### Gender

- Women are disproportionately affected by severe physical and sexual abuse. Although men also experience domestic violence, women are more likely to be targets of serious physical abuse and sexual assault ([Healthline, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-common-is-domestic-violence)).

- Pregnant women face particularly high risks, with **93.1% experiencing intimate partner violence**, predominantly psychological abuse ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

### Age

- Young women aged **18 to 24** are at the highest risk of domestic violence, indicating that IPV often begins early in adult life ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

### Race and Ethnicity

- Multiracial women and men report the highest rates of IPV, with **63.8% of multiracial women** and **51.5% of multiracial men** reporting IPV in 2016/2017 ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

- Victimization rates vary by race, with White and Black women more frequently victims of beatings than Asian or Hispanic women ([Break the Cycle, 2024](https://www.breakthecycle.org/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

### Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

- LGBTQ+ individuals experience IPV at equal or higher rates compared to heterosexuals. Transgender people are **1.7 times more likely** to experience intimate partner violence than cisgender people ([Healthline, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-common-is-domestic-violence)).

### Geographic Variation

- Kentucky has the highest rate of domestic violence in the U.S. at **45.3%**, while South Dakota has the lowest at **27.8%** ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

## Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

- The pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders led to a significant increase in domestic violence cases, with an **8.1% rise** reported after lockdowns began ([EarthWeb, 2024](https://earthweb.com/blog/domestic-violence-statistics/)).

- Factors contributing to this increase include elevated stress levels, economic hardship, and the challenges of homeschooling children, which intensified household tensions.

## Underreporting and Barriers to Disclosure

- Domestic violence is widely underreported due to fear of retaliation, financial dependence, lack of awareness about resources, shame, and distrust in the criminal justice system ([Healthline, 2023](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-common-is-domestic-violence)).

- Marginalized groups such as undocumented immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and men from cultures that stigmatize victimhood face additional barriers to reporting abuse.

## Conclusion

Spousal abuse remains a highly prevalent and multifaceted problem in the United States, affecting nearly half of all women and men at some point in their lives. The data indicates that psychological aggression is nearly as common as physical violence, and sexual and economic abuses are significant components of the abuse spectrum. Young women, multiracial individuals, pregnant women, and LGBTQ+ populations are particularly vulnerable. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the problem, highlighting the need for enhanced support systems and prevention efforts.

Despite the extensive prevalence, underreporting remains a major challenge, suggesting that actual rates may be even higher. Continued efforts to raise awareness, improve reporting mechanisms, and provide comprehensive support to victims are essential to address this critical public health issue.
