# The Relationship Between External Validity and the College Sophomore Problem: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The use of college student samples, particularly undergraduates, in experimental research has long been a subject of debate within the social sciences. This debate centers on the **external validity** of findings derived from these samples, commonly referred to as the **college sophomore problem**. External validity pertains to the extent to which results obtained from a study sample can be generalized to a broader target population. The college sophomore problem highlights concerns about the representativeness and generalizability of findings based on samples predominantly composed of college sophomores or similar undergraduate populations.

This report provides a comprehensive examination of the relationship between external validity and the college sophomore problem. Drawing on recent empirical research and theoretical frameworks, it explores how the characteristics of college student samples affect the generalizability of experimental results, the mechanisms underlying these effects, and the implications for research design and interpretation.

## Defining External Validity and the College Sophomore Problem

**External validity** is defined as "the extent to which an internally valid effect measured in a study sample is an (asymptotically) unbiased estimator of the treatment effect in the population of interest" (general population or a specific target group) ([Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5466356/)). It can be subdivided into:

- **Generalizability**: Making inferences from a biased sample of the target population to the full target population.
- **Transportability**: Making inferences when the study sample and target population are partially or completely non-overlapping.

The **college sophomore problem** refers to the concern that results derived from undergraduate student samples, often from a single institution or a narrow demographic, may not be representative of broader populations. This problem questions whether findings from such homogenous samples can be generalized beyond the specific student population studied (Sears, 1986; Kam, Wilking, & Zechmeister, 2007).

## The College Sophomore Problem as a Threat to External Validity

### Homogeneity and Selection Bias

One core issue is the **homogeneity** of college student samples. Students at a single institution tend to share similar demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural characteristics, which may not reflect the diversity of the general population or even other student populations. This homogeneity can lead to **selection bias**, where the sample is not representative of the broader target population, thus threatening external validity ([Mintz, Redd, & Vedlitz, 2006](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/external-validity-of-college-student-subject-pools-in-experimental-research-a-crosssample-comparison-of-treatment-effect-heterogeneity/9ABE76C91A0E1530AFBEFCB1B50AA339)).

Moreover, selection effects occur not only in which students attend certain institutions (based on prestige, selectivity, and geography) but also in which students choose to participate in experiments. These **self-selection effects** can further skew the sample, as participants who opt into studies may differ systematically from those who do not, influencing the internal and external validity of the findings.

### Institutional Differences and Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

Recent research has explicitly tested whether college student samples from different institutions are comparable. A study administering the same experimental protocol across three distinct universities—a selective liberal arts college, a private research university, and a public research university—found that student samples differ significantly in demographics, worldviews, and responses to experimental treatments ([Mintz, 2025](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/external-validity-of-college-student-subject-pools-in-experimental-research-a-crosssample-comparison-of-treatment-effect-heterogeneity/9ABE76C91A0E1530AFBEFCB1B50AA339)).

These findings indicate **treatment effect heterogeneity**—the variation in how different groups respond to the same experimental manipulation. This heterogeneity challenges the assumption that results from one student sample can be generalized to others or to the broader population, underscoring the external validity concerns embodied in the college sophomore problem.

### Recruitment Mechanisms and Dropout Rates

Another critical factor influencing external validity is the **recruitment mechanism** used to engage student participants. Institutions with dedicated research pools for political science experiments tend to have lower dropout rates and more stable samples, enhancing both internal and external validity. Conversely, samples recruited without such pools may experience higher dropout rates, introducing nonrandom attrition bias that threatens the validity of conclusions ([Mintz, 2025](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/external-validity-of-college-student-subject-pools-in-experimental-research-a-crosssample-comparison-of-treatment-effect-heterogeneity/9ABE76C91A0E1530AFBEFCB1B50AA339)).

High dropout rates may mean that those who complete the experiment differ systematically from those who start but do not finish, further limiting the representativeness of the sample and the generalizability of the results.

## Balancing Internal and External Validity

The college sophomore problem highlights a fundamental tension in experimental research between **internal validity** (the accuracy of causal inference within the study sample) and external validity (the generalizability of findings). Minor compromises in internal validity may be acceptable if they result in greater external validity, but this balance is difficult to achieve in practice.

The potential outcomes framework suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which sample differences arise can help researchers adjust for these differences and improve generalizability ([Bareinboim & Pearl, 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5466356/)). However, when selection bias or collider stratification bias is present, it may threaten causal inference for any population, not just the target population.

## Implications for Research Design and Practice

### Careful Sample Selection and Recruitment

Researchers should carefully consider the composition of their student samples and recruitment methods. Institutions with diverse student bodies and dedicated research pools provide more reliable samples for generalizing results. Conversely, researchers at institutions without such resources should be cautious and transparent about the limitations of their samples.

### Use of Broader and More Diverse Samples

There has been a push toward recruiting participants with actual policy experience or using broader online subject pools such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). However, the generalizability of MTurk samples is also debated, indicating that no sample is without limitations ([Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/external-validity-of-college-student-subject-pools-in-experimental-research-a-crosssample-comparison-of-treatment-effect-heterogeneity/9ABE76C91A0E1530AFBEFCB1B50AA339)).

### Transparent Reporting and Sensitivity Analysis

Researchers should report demographic and recruitment details transparently and conduct sensitivity analyses to assess how sample characteristics influence treatment effects. This practice can help identify the extent of treatment effect heterogeneity and guide the interpretation of findings.

## Conclusion

The college sophomore problem is a significant and nuanced threat to the external validity of experimental research. It arises from the homogeneity, selection biases, and institutional differences inherent in college student samples. Empirical evidence demonstrates that student samples from different institutions vary in meaningful ways, and treatment effects are not uniform across these samples.

While the use of college students as research subjects remains valuable and often necessary due to convenience and accessibility, researchers must be vigilant about the limitations this imposes on generalizability. Understanding and addressing the mechanisms driving sample differences—such as recruitment methods and dropout rates—can mitigate some threats to external validity.

Ultimately, the relationship between external validity and the college sophomore problem underscores the need for careful research design, transparent reporting, and critical interpretation of findings when relying on undergraduate samples. Researchers should neither uncritically accept nor outright reject the use of college students but instead adopt a nuanced approach that acknowledges the problem's complexity and strives to enhance the generalizability of experimental results.
