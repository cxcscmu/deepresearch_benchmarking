# Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Ethical behavior in organizations is often assumed to be a direct reflection of individual character and values. However, numerous high-profile corporate scandals and research findings reveal a more complex reality: ethical individuals sometimes make unethical decisions. Understanding why this occurs is critical for organizations striving to foster ethical workplaces and prevent misconduct. This report synthesizes insights from recent research and expert analyses to explore the multifaceted reasons ethical people engage in unethical behavior, emphasizing organizational, psychological, and contextual factors. The findings challenge simplistic notions of ethics as a fixed personal trait and highlight the systemic influences that shape ethical decision-making.

## Organizational Pressures and Unrealistic Expectations

One of the most significant drivers of unethical behavior among otherwise ethical individuals is the pressure to meet unrealistic performance targets. According to Lynn S. Paine, corporate misconduct often arises not from inherently "bad actors" but from managers setting unattainable deadlines, production goals, or sales quotas. When employees perceive that achieving these goals is impossible through legitimate means, they may resort to unethical shortcuts to avoid negative consequences such as job loss or demotion ([Paine, 2024](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/when-managers-set-unrealistic-expectations-employees-cut-ethical-corners)).

Research supports that excessive pressure to reach ambitious or "stretch" goals can encourage compromising choices, including falsifying reports or cutting corners in processes. For example, Wells Fargo's sales incentive system led to widespread unethical sales practices as employees sought to meet unrealistic quotas ([Paine, 2024](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/when-managers-set-unrealistic-expectations-employees-cut-ethical-corners)). This phenomenon illustrates how organizational goal-setting and reward structures can inadvertently promote unethical behavior, even among well-intentioned employees.

## Psychological Safety and the Fear of Speaking Up

Another critical factor is the psychological safety within the organization. When employees feel it is unsafe to raise ethical concerns due to fear of retaliation, dismissal, or social ostracism, they may choose silence over whistleblowing. Ron Carucci highlights that managers' reactions to employee concerns set the tone for whether individuals will speak up in the future. Even subtle signs of annoyance or dismissal from leadership can discourage reporting of unethical conduct, allowing misconduct to persist or escalate ([Carucci, 2016](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices)).

This fear creates an environment where unethical behavior can become normalized, as employees "go along to get along." The lack of open dialogue about ethics means that unethical decisions are less likely to be challenged or corrected, increasing the risk of systemic ethical breakdowns.

## Ethical Fading and Self-Deception

Ethical fading is a psychological process where the ethical aspects of a decision become obscured, allowing individuals to engage in unethical behavior without feeling they are doing wrong. Although direct access to the foundational article on ethical fading was unavailable, the concept is well-documented in the literature. Ethical fading occurs when individuals focus on other aspects of a decision, such as financial gain or meeting targets, while moral considerations recede from conscious awareness.

This self-deception enables ethical people to rationalize unethical actions as necessary or justified under the circumstances, thereby reducing cognitive dissonance and guilt. Such mechanisms explain how individuals with strong personal values can nonetheless make decisions that violate ethical norms.

## Organizational Culture and Leadership Influence

Organizational culture profoundly shapes individual ethical behavior. Studies of corporate scandals at Enron, Lehman Brothers, Barclays, and Siemens demonstrate that unethical cultures often originate from leadership attitudes and behaviors. Leaders who prioritize results over ethics or who tacitly accept rule-bending create a culture where unethical behavior is tolerated or even encouraged ([Link & Winstanley, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41463-020-00080-z)).

Leadership sets the ethical climate by modeling behavior, establishing norms, and designing control systems. When leaders fail to "walk the talk," ethical standards become disconnected from actual practices, leading to widespread misconduct. For instance, the Barclays CEO described the bank's culture as "how people behave when you think no one is watching," underscoring the importance of leadership in shaping ethical norms ([Link & Winstanley, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41463-020-00080-z)).

Moreover, organizational culture evolves from the cumulative decisions and actions of individuals over time, reinforcing patterns of behavior that can either promote or undermine ethics. A strong ethical culture encourages open communication, accountability, and shared values, which help prevent ethical lapses.

## Conflicting Goals and Perceived Unfairness

Conflicting organizational goals can provoke a sense of unfairness among employees, which research links to increased likelihood of unethical behavior. When employees perceive that they are treated unjustly or that organizational policies are inconsistent, they may consciously or unconsciously sabotage the organization or cut ethical corners as a form of retribution or self-protection ([Carucci, 2016](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices)).

This sense of injustice undermines trust and commitment, creating a fertile ground for ethical compromises. Organizations must therefore pay attention not only to formal policies but also to employees’ perceptions of fairness and equity.

## Lack of Routine Ethical Conversations and Training

Ethical behavior is not sustained by one-time training or compliance programs alone. Many organizations limit ethics education to onboarding or occasional refreshers, failing to integrate ethics into everyday conversations and decision-making processes. This neglect leads to a culture where ethics is seen as an afterthought or a response to scandals rather than a core value ([Smith & Kouchaki, 2021](https://hbr.org/2021/11/building-an-ethical-company)).

Embedding ethics into routine dialogue helps employees recognize ethical dilemmas, reflect on their decisions, and align their actions with organizational values. Without this ongoing engagement, even ethical individuals may lack the support and frameworks needed to navigate complex situations.

## Psychological and Cognitive Biases

Psychological factors such as cognitive biases also influence ethical decision-making. Overconfidence, confirmation bias, and motivated reasoning can lead individuals to overestimate their ethical judgment or selectively interpret information to justify questionable actions ([Accounting Insights, 2025](https://accountinginsights.org/factors-influencing-ethical-and-unethical-business-decisions/)).

These biases can distort perceptions of right and wrong, especially under pressure or ambiguity, making ethical lapses more likely even among those with strong moral compasses.

## The Role of Incentives and Accountability

Incentive systems and accountability mechanisms significantly impact ethical behavior. When rewards are tied solely to performance outcomes without regard to ethical means, employees may prioritize results over integrity. Conversely, clear accountability and balanced incentives that reward ethical conduct reduce the temptation to engage in misconduct ([AP PGECET, 2025](https://www.appgecet.co.in/factors-that-affect-ethical-and-unethical-behavior-understanding-the-choices-we-make/)).

Organizations must design compensation and evaluation systems that align ethical behavior with success metrics to foster a culture of integrity.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Ethical people make unethical choices not because of inherent moral failings but due to a complex interplay of organizational pressures, psychological dynamics, cultural influences, and systemic factors. Unrealistic expectations, fear of speaking up, ethical fading, leadership failures, conflicting goals, lack of ongoing ethical engagement, cognitive biases, and misaligned incentives all contribute to ethical lapses.

To mitigate these risks, organizations should:

- Set realistic, achievable goals and provide adequate resources.
- Foster psychological safety to encourage open dialogue about ethics.
- Integrate ethics into daily conversations and leadership practices.
- Model ethical behavior consistently at all levels.
- Design incentive systems that reward ethical conduct.
- Provide ongoing ethics training that develops moral reasoning skills.
- Monitor and address perceptions of fairness within the workforce.

Recognizing that ethics is a dynamic, organizational phenomenon rather than a fixed individual trait is essential. By addressing systemic factors and cultivating an ethical culture, organizations can support ethical decision-making and reduce the incidence of unethical choices by even their most principled employees.
