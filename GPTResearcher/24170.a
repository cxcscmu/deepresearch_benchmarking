# Comprehensive Report on Preventing School Shootings in the United States

## Introduction

School shootings in the United States represent a critical public health and safety challenge. Despite their rarity, the profound physical and psychological harm they cause to students, educators, families, and communities demands urgent and effective prevention strategies. This report synthesizes current research and expert recommendations to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of what can be done to prevent school shootings. It prioritizes interventions that are proactive, data-driven, and sensitive to the developmental and emotional needs of students, while avoiding approaches that may inadvertently increase anxiety or disproportionately affect marginalized populations.

## Understanding the Problem

School shootings are complex phenomena typically involving a combination of factors including access to firearms, mental health struggles, social isolation, bullying, and behavioral warning signs. Research indicates that nearly all perpetrators exhibit identifiable behaviors of concern prior to an attack, and most are insiders with some connection to the school community ([National Threat Assessment Center, 2019](https://bit.ly/2U7vnwa); [NEA, 2025](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/gun-violence-prevention-response-guide/gun-violence-prevention)).

A significant proportion of firearms used in school shootings are obtained from family members’ unsecured guns at home, highlighting the critical role of secure firearm storage in prevention ([Brookings Institution, 2022](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/school-shootings-what-we-know-about-them-and-what-we-can-do-to-prevent-them/); [NPR, 2024](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/05/nx-s1-5101684/preventing-school-shootings)).

## Key Prevention Strategies

### 1. Fostering Safe and Supportive School Climates

Creating a positive, trusting, and inclusive school environment is foundational to preventing violence. Students who feel connected, respected, and supported by peers and adults are more likely to report concerns and seek help before crises escalate. Programs such as Sandy Hook Promise’s *Start With Hello* and *Know the Signs* emphasize building relationships and recognizing behavioral warning signs ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/); [NEA, 2025](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/gun-violence-prevention-response-guide/gun-violence-prevention)).

Schools should implement trauma-informed practices, peer mentoring, and anti-bullying policies which have demonstrated benefits in reducing risk factors associated with school violence ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8345605/)).

### 2. Early Identification and Intervention of Behavioral Concerns

The U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center found that 100% of school shooters exhibited concerning behaviors prior to attacks, and 77% of the time, someone else was aware of their plans ([National Threat Assessment Center, 2019](https://bit.ly/2U7vnwa)). This underscores the importance of effective behavioral threat assessment and management teams within schools.

Schools should adopt evidence-based crisis intervention models such as the R-Model (Ready-Respond-Refer-Revisit) to identify and deescalate potential threats while respecting students’ civil rights and avoiding racial profiling ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://off-ramp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/R-Model-Protocol-Final-2.pdf)).

Anonymous reporting systems have proven effective in enabling students and community members to share concerns safely, increasing the likelihood of early intervention ([NEA, 2025](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/gun-violence-prevention-response-guide/gun-violence-prevention); [NIJ, 2024](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/five-facts-about-mass-shootings-k-12-schools)).

### 3. Enhancing Mental Health Supports

Adequate mental health staffing and services are critical components of prevention. The average student-to-psychologist ratio in U.S. schools is approximately 1,233:1, far exceeding the recommended 500:1 ratio ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/)). Increasing funding for school-based mental health professionals, including counselors and psychologists, can provide timely support for students experiencing distress.

Mental health interventions should be trauma-informed and culturally sensitive to avoid exacerbating stigma or alienating vulnerable students ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10111880/); [NEA, 2025](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/gun-violence-prevention-response-guide/gun-violence-prevention)).

### 4. Promoting Secure Firearm Storage and Child-Access Prevention Laws

Since many school shootings involve firearms obtained from homes, promoting secure gun storage is essential. Public awareness campaigns like Everytown’s *Be SMART* program educate families on the importance of locking firearms and keeping ammunition inaccessible to children ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/); [NPR, 2024](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/05/nx-s1-5101684/preventing-school-shootings)).

Child-Access Prevention (CAP) laws, which hold gun owners accountable for unsafe storage, have been shown to reduce accidental shootings and unauthorized access to guns by minors ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/)).

### 5. Implementing Thoughtful Physical Security Measures

Physical security measures such as controlled access points, fencing, and interior door locks can help delay or prevent an active shooter from moving freely within a school. However, these measures should be balanced with the need to maintain a welcoming and non-threatening school environment ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/)).

Research indicates that some security measures, like metal detectors and armed teachers, may increase anxiety and fear among students and staff without significantly reducing violence. In fact, arming teachers has been found to increase risks due to decreased shooting accuracy under stress ([Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/); [RAND, 2008](https://bit.ly/2U9bk0t)).

### 6. Community Collaboration and Engagement

Preventing school shootings requires coordinated efforts across schools, families, law enforcement, mental health providers, and community organizations. Violence prevention programs that integrate mental health and emotional supports beyond school grounds can address systemic factors contributing to gun violence ([NEA, 2025](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/gun-violence-prevention-response-guide/gun-violence-prevention); [ValorTec, 2025](https://valortec.com/preventing-school-shooting-incidents-key-strategies/)).

Building strong parent-school relationships improves communication and trust, facilitating early identification of at-risk students ([ValorTec, 2025](https://valortec.com/preventing-school-shooting-incidents-key-strategies/)).

### 7. Avoiding Harmful Practices

While lockdown drills and active shooter drills are common, research suggests they may increase student anxiety and habituation, potentially diminishing their effectiveness. Schools should minimize trauma by implementing trauma-sensitive drill protocols and providing support resources ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10111880/); [Everytown Research, 2023](https://everytownresearch.org/report/how-can-we-prevent-gun-violence-in-schools/)).

Racial profiling and disproportionate disciplinary actions against marginalized students must be strictly avoided, as they undermine trust and can exacerbate behavioral issues ([NEA, 2025](https://www.nea.org/resource-library/gun-violence-prevention-response-guide/gun-violence-prevention)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Preventing school shootings requires a multifaceted, evidence-based approach centered on fostering safe and supportive school climates, early behavioral threat identification, robust mental health services, secure firearm storage, and thoughtful physical security measures. Community collaboration and culturally sensitive practices are essential to ensure interventions are effective and equitable.

Policies that emphasize "softening" schools—supporting students’ social and emotional needs—are more promising than those focused solely on "hardening" schools through increased security personnel or weapons. Arming teachers and over-reliance on metal detectors may do more harm than good by increasing anxiety and risks.

To achieve meaningful reductions in school gun violence, policymakers and school leaders must invest in mental health staffing, implement trauma-informed crisis intervention programs, promote secure gun storage laws, and foster trusting relationships among students, staff, and families. These efforts must be data-driven, respectful of civil rights, and continuously evaluated for effectiveness and unintended consequences.

Ultimately, creating safe schools where students feel connected, supported, and protected is the most effective strategy to prevent the tragic consequences of school shootings.
