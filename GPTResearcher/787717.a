# Why Is Abortion Legal? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Abortion remains one of the most contentious issues globally, involving complex ethical, legal, social, and medical dimensions. The legality of abortion is grounded in a combination of factors including women's autonomy, public health concerns, socioeconomic considerations, and evolving legal precedents. This report aims to provide an in-depth and objective analysis of why abortion is legal in many jurisdictions, supported by recent data, historical context, and scholarly perspectives. The report also offers a reasoned opinion based on the synthesis of reliable and up-to-date sources.

## Historical and Legal Context

Historically, abortion was a relatively unregulated practice until the 19th century when medical professionalization and sociopolitical factors led to widespread criminalization. In the United States, for example, abortion was legal until the "quickening" stage (around the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy) in the early 1800s. However, the American Medical Association (AMA), established in 1847, spearheaded campaigns to criminalize abortion, largely to consolidate medical authority and marginalize midwives and other reproductive health providers ([Planned Parenthood Action Fund, 2025](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/abortion-central-history-reproductive-health-care-america/historical-abortion-law-timeline-1850-today); [Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health Magazine, 2022](https://magazine.publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/brief-history-abortion-us)).

The landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision *Roe v. Wade* (1973) enshrined abortion as a constitutional right based on privacy and bodily autonomy, although this was overturned in 2022 by *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*, leading to a patchwork of state laws varying from total bans to protections of abortion access ([ACOG, 2025](https://www.acog.org/clinical-information/policy-and-position-statements/position-statements/2025/abortion-training-and-education-in-a-post-dobbs-landscape)).

## Core Reasons for the Legality of Abortion

### 1. Women's Autonomy and Reproductive Rights

At the heart of the argument for legal abortion is the principle of bodily autonomy—the right of individuals, particularly women, to make decisions about their own bodies without external interference. This includes control over reproductive choices, such as whether and when to bear children. Advocates argue that denying abortion access undermines women's autonomy and self-ownership, treating them as mere vessels rather than persons with agency ([Social Work Institute, 2024](https://socialwork.institute/family-education-elective/abortion-debate-pros-and-cons/); [Profolus, 2024](https://www.profolus.com/topics/arguments-in-favor-of-abortion-and-abortion-rights/)).

This autonomy is linked to broader reproductive rights, encompassing the ability to pursue education, career, and personal development without being constrained by unwanted pregnancies. Legal abortion affirms women's capacity to make informed decisions about their futures, health, and well-being ([Desklib, 2022](https://desklib.com/study-documents/abortion-should-legal/)).

### 2. Health and Safety Considerations

One of the most compelling public health reasons for legal abortion is the safety it provides. When abortion is illegal or heavily restricted, women often resort to unsafe, clandestine procedures that carry significant risks of infection, hemorrhage, infertility, and death. The World Health Organization identifies unsafe abortion as a major cause of maternal mortality worldwide ([CTEEC, 2024](https://cteec.org/reasons-why-abortion-should-be-legal-essay/)).

Data from the United States illustrate this starkly. Before legalization, unsafe abortions accounted for nearly 18% of maternal deaths in 1930, with thousands of women dying annually from complications of illegal abortions ([Planned Parenthood Action Fund, 2025](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/abortion-central-history-reproductive-health-care-america/historical-abortion-law-timeline-1850-today)). In contrast, legal abortions performed by qualified professionals have a mortality rate of approximately 0.7 deaths per 100,000 procedures, which is significantly lower than mortality rates for childbirth (9 deaths per 100,000) or even plastic surgery (2 deaths per 100,000) ([Profolus, 2024](https://www.profolus.com/topics/arguments-in-favor-of-abortion-and-abortion-rights/)).

Moreover, abortion bans have been linked to increased maternal mortality. Analysis by the Gender Equity Policy Institute (GEPI) shows that mothers in states with abortion bans are nearly twice as likely to die during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum compared to those in states where abortion is legal and accessible. For example, maternal mortality rose 56% in Texas after its abortion ban, with Black mothers in banned states facing mortality rates over three times higher than their White counterparts ([GEPI, 2025](https://thegepi.org/maternal-mortality-abortion-bans/)).

### 3. Socioeconomic Implications

Unwanted pregnancies can impose severe financial, emotional, and social burdens on individuals and families. Legal abortion allows women to avoid having children they cannot adequately care for, thereby reducing the incidence of children born into poverty, neglect, or unstable environments ([Social Work Institute, 2024](https://socialwork.institute/family-education-elective/abortion-debate-pros-and-cons/)).

Access to abortion also enables women to pursue education and career opportunities, contributing to economic stability and reducing reliance on public assistance. This empowerment fosters gender equality by allowing women to participate fully in society and the workforce ([CTEEC, 2024](https://cteec.org/reasons-why-abortion-should-be-legal-essay/)).

### 4. Legal and Ethical Frameworks

The legal recognition of abortion rights is often framed within human rights and gender equality paradigms. International human rights bodies, such as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), emphasize that abortion laws must not perpetuate gender stereotypes that confine women to reproductive roles and deny them autonomy ([Erdman, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7888000/)).

Ethically, proponents argue that the state should not interfere with personal decisions about pregnancy, as such decisions fall within the realm of personal liberty and privacy. The government’s role is to protect individual rights rather than impose moral or religious views on reproductive choices ([Social Work Institute, 2024](https://socialwork.institute/family-education-elective/abortion-debate-pros-and-cons/)).

## Counterarguments and Their Legal Responses

Opponents of abortion legality primarily argue from the standpoint of fetal rights, asserting that life begins at conception and that the fetus has a right to life that must be protected. They also raise ethical and moral objections based on religious beliefs and societal values about the sanctity of life ([Social Work Institute, 2024](https://socialwork.institute/family-education-elective/abortion-debate-pros-and-cons/)).

However, legal frameworks often balance these competing rights by recognizing the pregnant person's autonomy while imposing limits on abortion at certain gestational stages. Moreover, the recognition of abortion as a healthcare right acknowledges the complex medical and social realities that pregnant individuals face, including cases of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and severe health risks ([Profolus, 2024](https://www.profolus.com/topics/arguments-in-favor-of-abortion-and-abortion-rights/); [ACOG, 2025](https://www.acog.org/clinical-information/policy-and-position-statements/position-statements/2025/abortion-training-and-education-in-a-post-dobbs-landscape)).

## The Impact of Abortion Legality on Maternal Health

Recent studies underscore the critical link between abortion access and maternal health outcomes. The Gender Equity Policy Institute’s analysis of CDC data from 2019 to 2023 reveals that states with abortion bans experience significantly higher maternal mortality rates, with racial disparities exacerbated in these states. Conversely, states where abortion remains legal have seen declines in maternal mortality, indicating the protective effect of access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare ([GEPI, 2025](https://thegepi.org/maternal-mortality-abortion-bans/)).

Furthermore, abortion restrictions complicate healthcare delivery by creating legal uncertainties that delay or deny care for pregnancy complications, thereby increasing risks for pregnant individuals ([ACOG, 2025](https://www.acog.org/clinical-information/policy-and-position-statements/position-statements/2025/abortion-training-and-education-in-a-post-dobbs-landscape)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The legality of abortion is fundamentally rooted in the recognition of women's autonomy, the imperative to protect health and safety, and the socioeconomic benefits of reproductive choice. Historical evidence and contemporary data demonstrate that legal abortion reduces maternal mortality, supports gender equality, and enables individuals to make informed decisions about their lives.

While respecting the moral and ethical concerns of opponents, the legal frameworks that uphold abortion rights prioritize the lived realities and rights of pregnant individuals. Given the significant health risks associated with illegal abortion, the socioeconomic consequences of unwanted pregnancies, and the foundational principle of bodily autonomy, abortion should remain legal and accessible as a critical component of reproductive healthcare and human rights.
