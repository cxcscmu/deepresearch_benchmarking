## Understanding Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering refers to the manipulation of individuals to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, it targets human vulnerabilities such as trust, fear, curiosity, and urgency. Common social engineering techniques include phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating, and impersonation, often initiated through emails, phone calls, social media, or physical interactions ([StrongBox IT, 2024](https://www.strongboxit.com/social-engineering-attacks-best-practices-for-business-security-in-2025/); [Exabeam, 2022](https://www.exabeam.com/blog/infosec-trends/top-8-social-engineering-techniques-and-how-to-prevent-them/)).

The sophistication of these attacks has escalated in 2025, with AI-powered phishing campaigns, deepfake impersonations, and hybrid attacks combining digital and physical tactics becoming prevalent. Attackers exploit detailed victim profiles harvested from social media, breached databases, and public records to craft convincing narratives ([TechLogify, 2025](https://techlogify.com/social-engineering-in-2025-recognize-and-defend-tactics/)).
