# Causes of Long-Term Climate Change: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Long-term climate change refers to significant and sustained alterations in Earth's climate patterns over extended periods, ranging from thousands to millions of years. Understanding the causes of such changes is crucial for contextualizing current climate trends and distinguishing natural variability from human-induced effects. This report provides a comprehensive examination of the primary drivers of long-term climate change, integrating insights from recent scientific research and authoritative sources. The analysis covers natural factors such as orbital variations, solar radiation changes, volcanic activity, plate tectonics, and biological processes, alongside the role of anthropogenic influences. The report concludes with an assessment of the relative significance of these causes based on current scientific consensus.

## Natural Causes of Long-Term Climate Change

### 1. Milankovitch Cycles (Orbital Variations)

One of the most significant natural drivers of long-term climate change is the variation in Earth's orbit and axial tilt, collectively known as Milankovitch cycles. These cycles operate over tens to hundreds of thousands of years and influence the distribution and intensity of solar radiation (insolation) received by Earth, particularly at different latitudes and seasons.

Milankovitch cycles consist of three primary components:

- **Eccentricity:** Changes in the shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun, occurring roughly every 100,000 years, affect the distance between Earth and the Sun and thus the amount of solar energy received.
- **Obliquity:** Variations in the tilt of Earth's axis, cycling approximately every 41,000 years, influence the contrast between seasons.
- **Precession:** The wobble in Earth's rotational axis, with a cycle of about 23,000 years, alters the timing of seasons relative to Earth's position in its orbit.

These orbital changes have been strongly correlated with the timing of glacial and interglacial periods over the last 2.6 million years, shaping ice ages and warmer intervals (Greenly, 2025; NASA Science, n.d.). For example, weaker summer insolation at high northern latitudes favors ice sheet growth, leading to glaciation, while stronger insolation promotes ice retreat.

However, Milankovitch cycles operate on very long timescales and cannot explain rapid climate changes observed over the last century. Current global warming is occurring at a pace approximately 100 times faster than any natural warming cycle in the past (Greenly, 2025). Moreover, ice core data show that in past warming events, CO2 rises lagged temperature increases, acting as an amplifier, whereas today CO2 levels have increased first due to human activities (Greenly, 2025).

### 2. Solar Radiation Variations

Solar output fluctuates naturally over various timescales, including the well-known 11-year sunspot cycle. These variations can subtly influence Earth's climate by altering the total solar irradiance received. Historically, changes in solar radiation have contributed to climate variability, including periods of warming and cooling.

However, the effect of solar cycles on recent climate change is minimal. Observations show that while solar intensity follows natural cycles, the average global temperature has increased markedly over the past century, a trend not explained by solar variations alone (US EPA, 2020). The current energy imbalance driving warming is primarily due to increased greenhouse gases rather than solar changes (IPCC, 2021).

### 3. Volcanic Activity

Volcanic eruptions inject aerosols, ash, and gases such as sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which can reflect sunlight and cause short-term cooling lasting several years. Large volcanic events can temporarily alter climate patterns and contribute to natural variability.

While volcanic CO2 emissions contribute to the carbon cycle, their magnitude is small compared to human emissions. Volcanic activity's cooling effects are episodic and short-lived, and thus do not drive long-term climate trends (AAEnvironment, n.d.; CTIF, n.d.).

### 4. Plate Tectonics and Continental Drift

Over millions of years, movements of Earth's tectonic plates have reshaped continents and ocean basins, influencing climate by altering ocean currents, atmospheric circulation, and the distribution of landmasses.

For instance, the formation of supercontinents like Pangaea can create continental climates with extreme temperature variations, while the breakup of continents allows for more even heat distribution. Plate tectonics can also trigger volcanic activity and mountain building, affecting atmospheric CO2 levels and albedo (reflectivity) through changes in ice cover (Lumen Learning, n.d.; LibreTexts, n.d.).

These geological processes operate on very long timescales and have been instrumental in initiating ice ages and other major climate shifts.

### 5. Biological Processes and Carbon Cycles

Natural biological processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, regulate the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Oceanic phytoplankton play a critical role in absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen, acting as a natural moderator of global carbon levels.

Changes in sea temperature and acidity can impact these biological systems, contributing to subtle but significant shifts in climate dynamics over long periods (AAEnvironment, n.d.).

## Anthropogenic (Human-Induced) Influences

While natural factors have historically driven climate variability, the rapid warming observed since the Industrial Revolution is overwhelmingly attributed to human activities.

### 1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have dramatically increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap infrared radiation, leading to enhanced greenhouse effects and global warming.

- CO2 emissions from human sources account for over 75% of global CO2 emissions annually, vastly exceeding volcanic emissions, which contribute less than 1% (CTIF, n.d.).
- Methane emissions are approximately 60% anthropogenic, primarily from agriculture, fossil fuel extraction, and waste management (CTIF, n.d.).
- Nitrous oxide emissions are mostly anthropogenic, mainly from agricultural fertilizer use (CTIF, n.d.).

The unprecedented rise in GHG concentrations over the past 150 years correlates strongly with industrialization and economic development (IPCC, 2021). Current rates of increase in GHG levels are unprecedented over at least the last 800,000 years (IPCC, 2021).

### 2. Land Use and Land Cover Change

Historical land cover changes, including deforestation and urbanization, alter Earth's surface albedo and carbon storage capacity. While these changes have a smaller radiative forcing effect compared to GHG emissions, they still contribute to climate change.

Model simulations indicate that land cover change has caused a slight global cooling effect (–0.06 to –0.22 °C), but this is overshadowed by the warming influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (Climate Dynamics, 2016).

### 3. Aerosols from Human Activities

Human-generated aerosols from burning fossil fuels and industrial processes can reflect sunlight and have a cooling effect on climate. However, this effect is insufficient to counterbalance the warming induced by greenhouse gases.

## Discerning Between Natural and Human Causes

Climate scientists use sophisticated climate models, paleoclimate data (e.g., ice cores, tree rings), and observational records to differentiate natural climate variability from human-induced changes. These analyses show:

- Natural factors alone cannot explain the rapid warming observed since the mid-20th century.
- Climate models reproduce observed temperature trends only when human influences are included.
- The pattern of warming (surface warming, stratospheric cooling, ocean heat uptake) aligns with GHG-driven climate change, not natural forcings (AAEnvironment, n.d.; IPCC, 2021).

## Conclusion

Long-term climate change is driven by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Natural causes such as Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation variations, volcanic activity, plate tectonics, and biological processes have shaped Earth's climate over geological timescales. These processes explain past climate shifts, including ice ages and interglacial periods.

However, the rapid and unprecedented warming observed over the last century cannot be accounted for by natural factors alone. Human activities, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions and land use changes since the Industrial Revolution, have become the dominant force driving contemporary climate change.

Understanding these causes is essential for effective climate policy and mitigation strategies. While natural processes will continue to influence Earth's climate over millennia, addressing anthropogenic emissions remains critical to managing future climate risks.
