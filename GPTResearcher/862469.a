# Report on the Prevalence and Context of Late-Term Abortions in the United States

## Introduction

Late-term abortions, generally defined as abortions performed at or after 21 weeks of gestation, represent a small but significant portion of abortion care in the United States. This report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of how common late-term abortions are in the U.S., the clinical and social contexts in which they occur, and the legal landscape governing them. Drawing on the most recent and reliable data sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Guttmacher Institute, and policy analyses from reputable organizations, this report aims to clarify misconceptions and provide an objective understanding of late-term abortion prevalence and characteristics.

## Defining Late-Term Abortion

The term "late-term abortion" lacks a precise medical definition and varies across sources. Common thresholds range from 20 to 28 weeks gestation, often coinciding with fetal viability—the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb with medical support (usually around 24 weeks). The CDC and many medical professionals prefer the term "abortions later in pregnancy" for procedures occurring at or after 21 weeks gestation, as "late-term" can be misleading and lacks clinical specificity ([KFF, 2024](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortions-later-in-pregnancy-in-a-post-dobbs-era/)).

## How Common Are Late-Term Abortions?

### Statistical Prevalence

According to the CDC's Abortion Surveillance Data for 2021, prior to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, approximately 1% of all abortions in the United States occurred at or after 21 weeks gestation. The vast majority (96%) of abortions took place at or before 15 weeks, while 3% occurred between 16 and 20 weeks ([KFF, 2024](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortions-later-in-pregnancy-in-a-post-dobbs-era/)).

This 1% figure translates to roughly 11,500 abortions annually occurring after 20 weeks, based on estimates from Johnston Archive data and CDC reports ([HRF, 2024](https://healthresearchfunding.org/21-compelling-third-trimester-abortion-statistics/)). The Guttmacher Institute's data aligns with these findings, noting that abortions later in pregnancy are rare and performed by a small subset of providers ([Guttmacher Institute, 2025](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states)).

### Trends Over Time

Data from the CDC and Guttmacher Institute indicate that most abortions occur early in pregnancy, with a trend toward earlier gestational ages over the past decade. For example, in 2021, about 79.1% of abortions occurred at or before 9 weeks gestation, an increase from 74.8% in 2012 ([CDC, 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7209a1.htm)). This shift toward earlier abortions suggests that late-term abortions have not increased proportionally and remain a small fraction of total abortions.

## Reasons for Late-Term Abortions

Contrary to some public perceptions, late-term abortions are not predominantly elective or performed without serious reasons. Research identifies two primary pathways leading to abortions after 24 weeks:

1. **Medical Necessity:** Many late-term abortions occur due to severe fetal anomalies incompatible with life or significant risks to the pregnant person's health or life. These diagnoses often cannot be confirmed until later in pregnancy.

2. **Delayed Access:** Some individuals seek abortions later due to delayed pregnancy recognition, logistical barriers, financial constraints, or restrictive state laws that delay access to care ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321603/); [Lozier Institute, 2024](https://lozierinstitute.org/fact-sheet-third-trimester-abortion-and-abortion-up-to-birth/)).

Qualitative studies interviewing women who obtained abortions after 24 weeks reveal that delays in decision-making, difficulties in accessing services, and disagreements with partners also contribute to later abortions ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321603/)).

## Legal and Policy Landscape

### State Restrictions and Access

The legal environment for late-term abortions varies significantly by state. As of 2025:

- **Total Bans:** Fourteen states had total abortion bans in effect for most of 2024, with some states repealing or blocking bans late in the year ([Guttmacher Institute, 2025](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/stability-number-abortions-2023-2024-us-states-without-total-bans-masks-major-shifts-access)).

- **Gestational Limits:** Most states (43) prohibit abortions after a certain gestational age, typically ranging from 20 to 28 weeks, often tied to fetal viability or specific weeks post-fertilization ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/late-term-abortion-laws-by-state)).

- **Exceptions:** All states with late-term abortion restrictions allow exceptions when the pregnant person's life or physical health is at risk. Some states also permit exceptions for rape, incest, or fetal anomalies ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/late-term-abortion-laws-by-state)).

- **No Limits:** A minority of states, including Alaska, Colorado, New Jersey, and Oregon, place no gestational limits on abortion ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/late-term-abortion-laws-by-state)).

### Provider Availability

Late-term abortions are provided by a very limited number of clinics. Only four facilities in the U.S. publicly advertise abortion care after 24 weeks gestation ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321603/)). Operation Rescue's 2023 survey found that 41% of abortion clinics perform abortions after 14 weeks, with 20% offering abortions after 20 weeks ([Operation Rescue, 2024](https://www.operationrescue.org/late-term-abortion/)).

The scarcity of providers, combined with legal restrictions, contributes to delays and the necessity for some patients to travel out of state for care ([Guttmacher Institute, 2023](https://www.guttmacher.org/2023/12/high-toll-us-abortion-bans-nearly-on)).

## Public Opinion and Misconceptions

Public support for abortion is generally strong for early pregnancy but declines sharply for late-term abortions. A 2018 Gallup poll found only 13% of respondents believed abortion should generally be legal in the third trimester, though support was higher in cases involving life endangerment, rape, incest, or serious fetal health issues ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9321603/)).

Misinformation about late-term abortions is common, including false claims about abortions occurring "moments before birth" or "after birth," which do not occur and are illegal in the U.S. ([KFF, 2024](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortions-later-in-pregnancy-in-a-post-dobbs-era/)).

## Clinical Aspects and Safety

Abortions later in pregnancy are more complex, often requiring multiple days of treatment and specialized care. They carry higher medical risks than first-trimester abortions but remain safe when performed by trained providers in appropriate settings ([CDC, 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7209a1.htm)).

Medication abortion predominates in early pregnancy but is uncommon after 14 weeks. Most late-term abortions are surgical procedures ([CDC, 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7209a1.htm)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Late-term abortions in the United States are rare, constituting approximately 1% of all abortions annually. They are primarily performed for serious medical reasons or due to barriers that delay access to care. The limited number of providers and restrictive state laws further constrain access, often necessitating travel and imposing financial and logistical burdens on patients.

Public discourse often exaggerates the prevalence and nature of late-term abortions, leading to misconceptions and stigma. It is essential for policy and public understanding to be grounded in accurate data and clinical realities.

Given the data, it is clear that late-term abortions are an uncommon but necessary component of comprehensive reproductive healthcare. Policies should reflect the nuanced reasons for these procedures and ensure access for those who need them while maintaining safety and ethical standards.
