# How Do Labor Unions Hurt the Economy? — A Detailed Analysis

## Introduction

Labor unions have historically played a significant role in shaping labor markets by advocating for higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions for their members. However, the economic impact of unions extends beyond their members to the broader economy, affecting employment, investment, productivity, and growth. This report provides a comprehensive and objective analysis of how labor unions can hurt the economy, drawing on a wide range of empirical research and economic theory. The focus is on the mechanisms through which unions may negatively affect economic performance, supported by quantitative evidence where available.

## Unions as Labor Cartels and Their Impact on Employment

One of the primary economic criticisms of labor unions is that they function as labor cartels. Like other cartels, unions restrict the supply of labor to increase wages for their members. This restriction often leads to fewer jobs available in unionized firms or industries. By limiting the number of workers, unions drive up labor costs, which can reduce the overall demand for labor and increase unemployment rates ([Sherk, 2009](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy)).

Economic studies consistently find that unions decrease the number of jobs available in the economy. The manufacturing sector in the United States provides a stark example: over the past three decades, the vast majority of manufacturing jobs lost were among union members, while non-union manufacturing employment increased ([Sherk, 2009](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy)). This suggests that unionization can contribute to structural job losses in certain sectors.

Moreover, unions’ role in restricting labor supply can exacerbate unemployment during economic downturns. Research shows that states with higher union density experienced longer recoveries from recessions, such as those in 1982 and 1991, indicating that unions may delay economic recoveries ([Sherk, 2009](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy)).

## Reduced Business Investment and Profitability

Higher wages secured by unions come at a cost to firms, primarily in the form of increased labor expenses. This rise in labor costs reduces firm profitability and, consequently, the resources available for investment in capital and research and development (R&D). Empirical evidence shows that unions have the same effect on business investment as a 33 percentage point increase in corporate income tax, significantly discouraging capital formation ([Sherk, 2009](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy)).

Lower investment due to unionization makes unionized firms less competitive over time. As a result, unionized firms tend to grow more slowly and destroy jobs gradually. Job growth at unionized businesses is approximately 4% slower than at non-unionized firms ([Sherk, 2009](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy)). This slower growth and reduced investment can stifle innovation and productivity improvements, further harming the economy.

Studies also indicate that unions reduce firm profits by significant margins. For example, one study found that unions reduce firm profits by 19% relative to the sample mean, with even more pronounced effects (up to 40%) in firms with low market shares ([Booth, 1995](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_204-1)). The negative impact on profitability is linked to unions’ rent-seeking behavior, where they capture part of the firm's economic rents, reducing returns to shareholders and limiting resources for growth ([Laroche & Wechtler, 2011](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_204-1)).

## Impact on Productivity and Innovation

The effect of unions on productivity is complex and contested. While some research suggests unions may raise productivity in certain sectors (e.g., education and construction), the overall evidence indicates that unions do not increase productivity on average and may even reduce it in some contexts ([Tcherneva & Wicks-Lim, 2023](https://tcf.org/content/report/how-unions-work-for-the-economy/)).

Union rent-seeking can act as a tax on returns to investment, discouraging firms from investing in both tangible and intangible assets, including R&D. This reduction in investment can have detrimental effects on the dynamic path of productivity growth ([Connolly et al., 1986](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_204-1)).

Moreover, unions may impose restrictive work practices and increase labor costs above competitive levels, which can cause inefficiencies in production and resource allocation ([Hirsch & Addison, 1986](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_204-1)). These inefficiencies can reduce output and slow economic growth.

## Macroeconomic Effects: Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation

At the macroeconomic level, unions have been found to adversely affect several critical economic indicators. Using data from 48 U.S. states from 1978 to 1994, research shows that unions negatively impact unemployment rates and the growth rates of gross state product (GSP), productivity, and population, while increasing wage inflation ([Brown & Ashenfelter, 2001](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12122-001-1012-0)).

Although the impact on employment growth was negative, it was not statistically significant in this study. However, the increase in wage inflation can contribute to cost-push inflationary pressures in the economy, potentially reducing competitiveness and economic stability.

Furthermore, unions have been associated with delayed economic recoveries. Policies encouraging union membership have historically deepened and prolonged recessions, such as the Great Depression, by cartelizing both labor and business, reducing output, and raising prices ([Sherk, 2009](https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence reviewed indicates that labor unions, while beneficial to their members in terms of higher wages and benefits, impose significant economic costs on the broader economy. By functioning as labor cartels, unions restrict employment opportunities and reduce job growth. The higher wages they secure come at the expense of reduced firm profitability and lower investment in capital and innovation, which are critical drivers of long-term economic growth.

Furthermore, unions can contribute to macroeconomic inefficiencies, including higher unemployment rates, increased wage inflation, and slower recoveries from recessions. These effects suggest that unions, particularly in their traditional form as monopolistic labor organizations, can hurt the economy by distorting labor markets and reducing economic dynamism.

While unions play an important role in advocating for workers’ rights and improving workplace conditions, policymakers should carefully consider these economic trade-offs. Reforms that balance workers’ interests with the need to maintain competitive and flexible labor markets may help mitigate the negative economic impacts of unions.
