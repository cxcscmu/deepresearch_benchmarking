# Challenges Faced by the United Nations in Maintaining Global Security: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The United Nations (UN), since its inception in 1945, has been the principal international organization tasked with maintaining global peace and security. Despite its foundational role and numerous successes, the UN faces unprecedented challenges in fulfilling its mandate in the contemporary geopolitical landscape. These challenges are multifaceted, encompassing political, structural, operational, and financial dimensions. This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of the key challenges confronting the UN in maintaining global security, drawing on the latest authoritative sources from 2024 and 2025. The report also offers a critical perspective on these challenges, emphasizing the urgent need for reform and enhanced cooperation among member states.

## 1. Political Divisions Among Member States

### 1.1 Fragmentation and Geopolitical Rivalries

One of the most significant challenges to the UN's effectiveness in global security is the growing disunity and geopolitical rivalry among its member states, particularly within the Security Council. The UN relies heavily on the political support and consensus of its 193 member states to authorize and sustain peacekeeping missions and political interventions. However, as Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, emphasized, divisions between member states undermine the unity required for effective peacekeeping operations ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160536)).

The Security Council, the UN's primary body for maintaining international peace and security, is often paralyzed by the veto power wielded by its five permanent members (P5). This veto power has been increasingly used to block resolutions addressing critical conflicts, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions. Secretary-General António Guterres highlighted that "deepening geopolitical divisions and mistrust are adding fuel to the fire," complicating efforts to resolve conflicts such as those in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan ([UN Press, 2025](https://press.un.org/en/2025/ga12673.doc.htm)).

### 1.2 Impact on Peacekeeping and Conflict Resolution

The lack of unified political will hampers the UN’s ability to deploy and sustain peacekeeping missions effectively. Lacroix noted that existing peacekeeping missions often cannot count on strong and united support from member states, including host governments, which weakens their operational effectiveness ([Global Issues, 2025](https://www.globalissues.org/news/2025/02/26/39187)). This fragmentation also affects the UN’s capacity to broker political settlements, which are essential for lasting peace.

## 2. Evolving Nature of Conflicts

### 2.1 Complexity and Protraction of Wars

Modern conflicts have become more complex, protracted, and deadly. Wars now often involve multiple actors, including non-state entities such as terrorist groups, private security companies, and organized crime networks. These conflicts are increasingly transnational, transcending national borders and complicating traditional peacekeeping approaches ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161441)).

Guterres noted that conflicts "last longer and are more enmeshed in global and regional dynamics," making negotiated settlements harder to achieve. The interplay of terrorism, organized crime, and the weaponization of new technologies further exacerbates the security environment ([UN Press, 2025](https://press.un.org/en/2025/ga12673.doc.htm)).

### 2.2 Climate Change as a Security Threat

Climate change has emerged as a critical driver of conflict, affecting resource availability, displacing populations, and exacerbating existing tensions. The UN recognizes the multifaceted impacts of climate change as complicating efforts to secure peace, requiring integrated approaches that address environmental and security challenges simultaneously ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161441)).

## 3. Structural and Institutional Challenges

### 3.1 Security Council Composition and Reform

The UN Security Council’s structure, designed in the aftermath of World War II, is increasingly seen as anachronistic and unrepresentative of today's geopolitical realities. Calls for reform focus on expanding membership to include emerging powers and modifying the veto mechanism to prevent paralysis in crisis situations ([Academia.edu, 2023](https://www.academia.edu/110797349/United_Nations_Security_Council_Reform_Revisited_A_Proposal); Carnegie Endowment, 2023).

However, reform efforts face significant political hurdles, as permanent members are reluctant to dilute their privileges. This impasse limits the Council’s legitimacy and effectiveness in addressing contemporary security challenges ([Brill, 2020](https://brill.com/view/journals/cjgg/6/1/article-p71_5.xml)).

### 3.2 Mandate-Resource Mismatch

There is a persistent and growing gap between the ambitious mandates assigned to UN peacekeeping missions and the resources allocated to them. Guterres highlighted this mismatch as a major hurdle, noting that missions often operate with insufficient personnel, funding, and equipment to meet their complex objectives ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161441)).

This resource shortfall undermines mission effectiveness and puts peacekeepers at risk, especially as they face new threats such as terrorism and advanced weaponry.

## 4. Operational Challenges in Peacekeeping

### 4.1 Complex and Hostile Environments

Peacekeeping missions are increasingly deployed in volatile and unpredictable environments. The conflict between Israeli forces and Hezbollah, compounded by the 2023 Hamas attacks, exemplifies the operational difficulties faced by UN missions like UNIFIL. Differing interpretations of ceasefire obligations by parties further complicate peacekeepers’ roles ([United Nations, 2025](https://www.un.org/en/delegate/peacekeeping-challenged-more-complex-situations-field)).

### 4.2 Misinformation and Disinformation

The rise of misinformation and disinformation campaigns undermines the credibility of UN peacekeepers and fuels local distrust. UNIFIL has had to adapt its strategies to counteract these challenges, emphasizing impartiality and transparency to maintain trust ([United Nations, 2025](https://www.un.org/en/delegate/peacekeeping-challenged-more-complex-situations-field)).

### 4.3 Technological Threats and Adaptation

New technologies, including artificial intelligence, cyber attacks, and drones, pose both threats and opportunities. The UN has launched a digital transformation strategy aimed at enhancing situational awareness, improving peacekeeper safety, and countering weaponized misinformation ([Global Issues, 2025](https://www.globalissues.org/news/2025/02/26/39187)).

## 5. Financial Constraints

The UN’s peacekeeping and humanitarian operations require substantial and predictable funding. However, there is a chronic underfunding problem, with contributions often failing to keep pace with rising needs. For example, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) received pledges totaling US$351 million for 2025, which is insufficient given the scale of humanitarian crises worldwide ([OCHA, 2024](https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/world/huge-scale-humanitarian-crises-worldwide-requires-surge-support-un-emergency-fund-top-officials-say)).

Underfunding forces the UN to scale back operations, make difficult prioritization decisions, and limits its ability to respond swiftly to emerging crises ([OCHA, 2025](https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/world/global-humanitarian-overview-2025-enarfres)).

## 6. Sovereignty and Nationalism Challenges

The principle of state sovereignty limits the UN’s ability to intervene in internal conflicts or human rights abuses. Rising nationalism and populism further complicate multilateral cooperation, as states prioritize narrow national interests over collective action ([WSSPS HQ, 2025](https://wssps-un.org/united-nations-challenges/)).

This trend undermines the UN’s mission and calls for renewed diplomatic efforts to foster dialogue and trust among member states.

## 7. Efforts and Opportunities for Improvement

Despite these challenges, the UN and its member states have made progress through initiatives such as the Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) and enhanced partnerships with regional organizations like the African Union. These efforts aim to strengthen political support, improve mandate clarity, and increase resource allocation ([United Nations Peacekeeping, 2025](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/un-and-member-states-efforts-to-strengthen-peacekeeping-are-having-impact-despite-global-divisions)).

The upcoming Peacekeeping Ministerial in Berlin represents an opportunity to renew commitments and address persistent gaps.

## Conclusion

The United Nations faces a complex array of challenges in maintaining global security in 2025. Political divisions among member states, evolving and protracted conflicts, structural limitations of the Security Council, resource constraints, operational difficulties, and rising nationalism collectively hinder the UN’s effectiveness. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive Security Council reform, enhanced political unity, adequate funding, technological adaptation, and strengthened partnerships with regional actors.

While the obstacles are formidable, the UN retains unique tools and legitimacy to foster peace. Success depends on the collective political will of member states to overcome divisions and commit to reforms that reflect contemporary global realities.
