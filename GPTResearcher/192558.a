# Report: Why People Voted to Leave the European Union in the 2016 Brexit Referendum

## Introduction

The 2016 United Kingdom (UK) referendum on European Union (EU) membership resulted in a narrow majority—51.9%—voting to leave the EU (KBC, 2019). This decision, commonly known as Brexit, surprised many observers and has had profound political, economic, and social consequences. Understanding why a majority of Britons voted to leave requires a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted factors that influenced voter behavior. This report synthesizes findings from multiple trusted sources, including academic research, government surveys, and reputable news outlets, to provide an in-depth and objective examination of the motivations behind the Leave vote.

## Key Motivations Behind the Leave Vote

### 1. Immigration and National Sovereignty

One of the most consistently cited reasons for voting Leave was concern over immigration and its perceived impact on jobs, public services, and national identity. Surveys conducted by the Centre for Social Investigation (2018) and the National Centre for Social Research revealed that over 70% of Leave voters identified regaining control over EU migration as a primary motivation for their choice ([KBC, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/economics/publications/voting-leave:-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html); [The Independent, 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html)).

The freedom of movement principle within the EU allowed millions of EU nationals to live and work in the UK, which many Leave voters perceived as a strain on jobs, wages, healthcare, and social security systems. Notably, 73% of those worried about immigration voted Leave, compared to 36% of those who were not concerned about immigration ([The Independent, 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html)).

Moreover, the desire to restore UK sovereignty—meaning the ability to make decisions independently without EU oversight—was a powerful factor. Many Leave voters felt that EU membership eroded democratic control by transferring decision-making powers to Brussels, particularly to regulatory bodies like the European Commission. This loss of sovereignty was framed as decisions being taken by 508 million EU residents rather than the 66 million UK citizens ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_vote_in_favour_of_Brexit)).

### 2. Economic Concerns and Misperceptions

Economic factors played a complex role in the Leave vote. While some voters were motivated by economic grievances, others were skeptical of the economic warnings issued by experts. The UK Treasury, Bank of England, and international organizations like the IMF and OECD warned that Brexit could lead to economic downturns, higher unemployment, and reduced investment. However, many voters were unconvinced or willing to accept these risks for the perceived benefits of leaving the EU ([BBC News, 2016](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36574526)).

Research indicates that economic insecurity, especially in regions with high social deprivation and low educational attainment, correlated strongly with Leave support. This "left-behind" hypothesis suggests that voters who felt marginalized by globalization and neoliberal economic policies saw Brexit as a way to protest against these forces ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_vote_in_favour_of_Brexit)).

Interestingly, official migration data showed that job growth for EU nationals remained positive even during periods of economic downturn, while UK nationals experienced job losses during the Great Recession. Despite this, perceptions about immigration and economic competition were more influential than actual economic data ([KBC, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/economics/publications/voting-leave:-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html)).

### 3. Political Distrust and Anti-Establishment Sentiment

Although some narratives suggested that Brexit was a protest against political elites and establishment politics, survey data showed that trust in government was a less decisive factor. For example, 45% of those who trusted the government voted Leave, compared to 65% of those who distrusted it, indicating a difference but not a dominant cause ([The Independent, 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html)).

Nonetheless, anti-establishment populism played a role, as many Leave voters viewed Brexit as a way to challenge "big merchant banks" and political elites perceived to have ignored the will of the people ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_vote_in_favour_of_Brexit)). The Leave campaign capitalized on this sentiment by framing the referendum as a democratic reclaiming of control.

### 4. National Identity and Cultural Concerns

National identity and cultural outlook were significant in shaping voter preferences. Older voters, in particular, were more likely to vote Leave, possibly due to nostalgia for a pre-EU Britain and concerns about immigration's impact on British culture ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_vote_in_favour_of_Brexit)). Surveys showed that 70–75% of under-25s voted Remain, highlighting a generational divide ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_vote_in_favour_of_Brexit)).

The Leave vote reflected the concerns of socially conservative and "authoritarian" voters about the social consequences of EU membership, especially immigration, which they perceived as threatening national cohesion ([The Independent, 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html)).

### 5. Misinformation and Misperceptions About the EU

Misperceptions about the EU's impact on the UK were widespread and influenced voting behavior. For instance, many Britons overestimated the proportion of EU-born residents in the UK, with survey respondents estimating 15% compared to the actual 5%. Similarly, the UK population overestimated its financial contributions to the EU budget ([KBC, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/economics/publications/voting-leave:-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html)).

These misperceptions, especially prevalent among Leave supporters, fueled fears about immigration and economic costs, reinforcing support for Brexit despite contrary official data.

### 6. Regional and Demographic Variations

Voting patterns varied significantly across regions, age groups, and socio-economic backgrounds. The Leave vote was stronger in the Midlands and North-West England, areas characterized by economic deprivation and lower educational attainment ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_vote_in_favour_of_Brexit)). Urban centers like London tended to vote Remain, reflecting economic prosperity and cultural diversity.

Turnout was 72.2%, and surveys suggest that if non-voters had participated, the Remain side might have won with a 50.3% majority, indicating that voter mobilization influenced the outcome ([UK in a Changing Europe, 2025](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/why-did-britain-vote-to-leave-the-european-union/)).

## Discussion and Opinion

The decision to leave the EU was not driven by a single factor but by a complex interplay of immigration concerns, sovereignty aspirations, economic insecurity, cultural identity, political distrust, and misinformation. Immigration emerged as the most salient issue, amplified by misperceptions and fears about its social and economic consequences. Sovereignty concerns reflected a broader desire for democratic control and national self-determination.

Economic arguments were nuanced; while many voters were motivated by economic grievances, others rejected expert warnings, prioritizing perceived sovereignty and cultural issues over economic risks. The Leave vote also embodied a protest against perceived political elites and globalization's negative effects on certain communities.

In my assessment, the Leave vote was fundamentally a reaction to rapid social and economic changes that left significant portions of the population feeling marginalized and unheard. The referendum became a vehicle for expressing these frustrations, with immigration and sovereignty serving as focal points. The role of misinformation and misperceptions cannot be understated, as they shaped public understanding and emotional responses.

Understanding these motivations is crucial for policymakers to address the underlying issues that fueled Brexit, including regional inequalities, political engagement, and public trust, to prevent similar divisive outcomes in the future.

## Conclusion

The 2016 Brexit referendum reflected a confluence of factors that motivated Britons to vote Leave. Immigration concerns, sovereignty, economic insecurity, cultural identity, political distrust, and misinformation all played significant roles. The vote was as much about reclaiming national control and identity as it was about economic calculations. Recognizing the complexity of these motivations is essential for comprehending the referendum's outcome and its implications for the UK's future relationship with the EU and domestic cohesion.
