# How Companies Are Using LinkedIn Learning: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving business landscape of 2025, continuous learning and upskilling have become essential for organizational success. Companies increasingly rely on digital platforms to equip their workforce with relevant skills that drive productivity, innovation, and retention. LinkedIn Learning, an online education platform developed by LinkedIn, has emerged as a pivotal tool for businesses to address these needs. This report provides an in-depth analysis of how companies are using LinkedIn Learning, supported by data and insights from multiple authoritative sources. It also offers a critical evaluation of the platform’s impact on workforce development and organizational growth.

## Overview of LinkedIn Learning for Business

LinkedIn Learning offers a vast library of over 16,000 expert-led courses spanning technology, business, and creative skills. It integrates with LinkedIn’s professional network, enabling employees to showcase their learning achievements on their profiles, which adds motivation and recognition. The platform is designed to support both employee-driven and management-driven learning, fostering a culture of continuous improvement within organizations ([LinkedIn Learning for Business](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-learning-business-unlock-top-skills-today-ompe-pope-alzmc)).

More than 78% of Fortune 100 companies use LinkedIn Learning, underscoring its widespread adoption and trust among leading enterprises ([American Society of Administrative Professionals, 2022](https://www.asaporg.com/technology/why-linkedin-learning-is-an-asset-for-businesses)).

## Key Ways Companies Use LinkedIn Learning

### 1. Upskilling and Reskilling Employees

Companies leverage LinkedIn Learning primarily to upskill and reskill their workforce, addressing skill gaps and preparing employees for evolving roles. Upskilling helps employees advance in their current careers, while reskilling enables them to transition to new roles within the organization. This approach reduces reliance on external hiring, which can be costly and time-consuming.

Economic data shows that US companies spent $101.8 billion on employee training in the past year, highlighting the scale of investment in workforce development ([Talent OnPoint!, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/economic-impact-upskilling-reskilling-2025-beyond-pierpoint-2w4we)). Furthermore, upskilling existing employees can save employers 70-92% compared to hiring new talent ([Talent OnPoint!, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/economic-impact-upskilling-reskilling-2025-beyond-pierpoint-2w4we)).

### 2. Enhancing Employee Engagement and Retention

LinkedIn Learning supports employee engagement by providing career development opportunities that employees highly value. Studies indicate that 74% of Millennials and Gen Z workers would quit a job without upskilling options, and 94% of employees would stay longer at companies that invest in their career growth ([Talent OnPoint!, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/economic-impact-upskilling-reskilling-2025-beyond-pierpoint-2w4we)).

Moreover, companies with strong learning cultures experience 57% better retention rates than those that do not invest in learning and development (L&D) ([Together Mentoring Software](https://www.togetherplatform.com/blog/employee-retention-and-learning-and-development)). LinkedIn Learning’s self-paced format allows employees to learn flexibly, fitting training into busy schedules, which further enhances satisfaction and loyalty ([LinkedIn Learning Benefits](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/career-development/online-employee-training-benefits)).

### 3. Driving Productivity and Innovation

Training through LinkedIn Learning has been shown to increase employee productivity by up to 52%, while also boosting engagement by 15-80% ([American Society of Administrative Professionals, 2022](https://www.asaporg.com/technology/why-linkedin-learning-is-an-asset-for-businesses)). Organizations with a learning culture are 92% more likely to develop new products and solutions, demonstrating a direct link between continuous learning and innovation ([American Society of Administrative Professionals, 2022](https://www.asaporg.com/technology/why-linkedin-learning-is-an-asset-for-businesses)).

### 4. Supporting Leadership Development and Internal Mobility

LinkedIn Learning offers hundreds of courses on leadership and management, enabling employees at all levels to develop critical skills for career advancement. Companies use the platform to foster internal mobility, which research shows increases employee retention by nearly 20% at the two-year mark for those who advance internally ([LinkedIn Learning Career Pathing](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/career-development/career-pathing-employee-retention)).

The platform’s analytics tools help organizations track leadership skill development and internal promotions, forming part of a broader Career Development Index that correlates with positive business outcomes ([LinkedIn Learning 2025 Workplace Learning Report](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report)).

### 5. Facilitating Remote and Hybrid Workforce Training

With the rise of remote and hybrid work models, LinkedIn Learning provides flexible, accessible training solutions that meet diverse employee needs regardless of location. Companies use the platform to overcome challenges related to distributed teams by offering personalized learning paths and hybrid learning options, including virtual classrooms and milestone check-ins ([LinkedIn Learning Upskilling Remote Employees](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/upskilling-and-reskilling)).

### 6. Cost-Effective and Scalable Training Solutions

LinkedIn Learning eliminates many costs associated with traditional in-person training, such as travel and venue expenses. Its subscription-based pricing offers predictable costs for organizations, which can scale access to entire teams or companies. This scalability makes it suitable for both small startups and large enterprises ([LinkedIn Learning for Business](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-learning-business-unlock-top-skills-today-ompe-pope-alzmc)).

### 7. Data-Driven Learning and Skill Gap Analysis

A significant advantage of LinkedIn Learning is its integration with LinkedIn’s Economic Graph and analytics capabilities. Organizations can identify in-demand skills, monitor employee progress, and customize learning paths based on real-time data. This data-driven approach helps companies focus training efforts on critical skills that align with business goals and market trends ([LinkedIn Learning for Companies](https://learning.linkedin.com/for-entire-companies)).

## Case Studies and Success Stories

Numerous organizations have reported positive outcomes from using LinkedIn Learning:

- **Siemens** implemented the 'SkillUp! Learning Challenge' to fuel future-ready skills in ASEAN countries ([LinkedIn Learning Case Studies](https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-case-studies)).
- **LG Electronics** scaled global skill development through a comprehensive LinkedIn Learning rollout ([LinkedIn Learning Case Studies](https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-case-studies)).
- **MGM Resorts** used LinkedIn Learning to upskill frontline employees for leadership roles, enhancing internal mobility and retention ([LinkedIn Learning Case Studies](https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-case-studies)).
- **Kantar** experienced high employee engagement with LinkedIn Learning, attributing success to personalized learning experiences ([LinkedIn Learning Case Studies](https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-case-studies)).

These examples illustrate the platform’s versatility across industries and organizational sizes.

## Critical Evaluation and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive data and case studies, it is evident that LinkedIn Learning is a strategic asset for companies aiming to build a future-ready workforce. Its extensive course library, expert-led content, and integration with LinkedIn’s professional network provide a unique value proposition that few other platforms match.

However, the success of LinkedIn Learning depends heavily on how organizations implement and integrate it into their broader talent development strategies. Merely providing access to courses is insufficient; companies must foster a learning culture, promote engagement, and leverage analytics to tailor learning experiences effectively.

Moreover, while LinkedIn Learning offers cost savings compared to traditional training, the initial investment in content curation, employee motivation, and management oversight should not be underestimated. Organizations must commit resources to maximize the platform’s ROI.

In conclusion, LinkedIn Learning is not just a tool for employee training but a comprehensive solution that supports talent retention, productivity, innovation, and leadership development. Companies that strategically adopt and embed LinkedIn Learning into their operations are likely to gain a significant competitive advantage in the evolving labor market.

## Conclusion

Companies use LinkedIn Learning in multifaceted ways to address critical workforce challenges. From upskilling and reskilling to enhancing engagement, driving innovation, and supporting leadership development, the platform plays a central role in modern L&D strategies. Its data-driven insights, scalability, and integration with LinkedIn’s network make it a powerful solution for businesses of all sizes.

As the demand for continuous learning grows, LinkedIn Learning’s role in shaping the future of work will only expand. Organizations that embrace this platform with a strategic mindset will be better positioned to attract, retain, and develop top talent, ensuring long-term success.
