# Report on the Consequences if Children Don't Like to Share

## Introduction

Sharing is a fundamental social skill that plays a crucial role in children's social-emotional development and their ability to form and maintain relationships. The reluctance or refusal to share toys, resources, or attention with peers can have significant consequences on a child's social integration, emotional regulation, and overall development. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the consequences when children do not like to share, drawing on recent and reliable research findings. It also explores the developmental context of sharing, the challenges children face, and the long-term implications of poor sharing behaviors.

## Understanding Sharing in Child Development

Sharing is not merely a behavioral expectation but a complex developmental milestone that involves cognitive, emotional, and social competencies. Young children, especially toddlers, often struggle with sharing because they are still developing an understanding of ownership, self-regulation, and empathy ([Raising Children Network, n.d.](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/friends-siblings/sharing)). For instance, toddlers may not comprehend why they must give up a toy they are actively engaged with, and their emotional regulation skills are still immature, leading to behaviors such as tantrums when sharing is demanded prematurely.

By around age three, many children begin to grasp the concepts of turn-taking and fairness, although they may still find it challenging to share, especially when it involves giving up something they value ([Raising Children Network, n.d.](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/friends-siblings/sharing)). The process of learning to share is gradual and requires guidance, practice, and positive reinforcement from caregivers and peers.

## Consequences of Children Not Liking to Share

### 1. Social Isolation and Peer Rejection

Children who do not share are at risk of social isolation and peer rejection. Sharing is a key aspect of cooperative play, which is essential for forming friendships and social bonds. When a child refuses to share, peers may perceive them as selfish or uncooperative, leading to exclusion from group activities and playdates ([Rubin et al., 2006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6085085/)). This exclusion can reinforce shy or withdrawn behaviors, creating a cycle of social withdrawal and further rejection ([Oh et al., 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6085085/)).

Moreover, children who are rejected due to aggressive or disruptive behaviors—often linked with poor sharing skills—may become "bully-victims," experiencing a trajectory of negative social outcomes ([Pouwels et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6085085/)). Thus, reluctance or inability to share can contribute to both internalizing problems (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalizing problems (e.g., aggression), compounding social difficulties.

### 2. Impaired Emotional and Social Development

Sharing requires emotional regulation, empathy, and understanding others' perspectives. Children who do not like to share may struggle with these competencies, which are critical for healthy social interactions. The inability to share can be indicative of broader challenges in emotional comprehension and self-regulation ([Gross, 2002](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10043184/)).

Research shows that children with better emotional comprehension tend to employ more positive conflict resolution strategies and build stronger peer relationships ([Kouvava et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10043184/)). Conversely, children who resist sharing may have difficulties managing emotions such as frustration and disappointment, leading to frequent conflicts and poor social outcomes.

### 3. Development of Poor Self-Control and Resilience

Play deprivation and lack of sharing opportunities are linked to reduced self-control and poor resilience in children ([Storychanges, 2024](https://storychanges.com/what-effects-does-a-child-s-lack-of-play-have-on-their-development.html)). Sharing involves delaying gratification and negotiating with others, which are essential skills for self-regulation. Children who do not engage in sharing miss critical opportunities to develop these skills, potentially leading to difficulties in adapting to change and managing stress later in life.

### 4. Challenges in Forming and Maintaining Relationships

Sharing is foundational for building trust and reciprocal relationships. Children who do not share may face challenges in forming and sustaining friendships. Attachment difficulties, often exacerbated by poor sharing behaviors, can manifest as controlling, coercive, or avoidant patterns in relationships ([NCBI Bookshelf, 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK588783/)).

Children with attachment problems may sabotage relationships out of fear of rejection, which can be linked to their reluctance to share or engage cooperatively. These relational difficulties extend beyond peer interactions to include challenges with authority figures and caregivers, impacting overall social functioning.

### 5. Impact on Cognitive and Socio-Cognitive Development

Interactive sharing, including sharing during play and book reading, supports cognitive and socio-cognitive development. Children learn joint attention, language skills, and executive functions through shared activities ([Forssman et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9509634/)). Children who do not share or engage in interactive play may miss out on these developmental benefits, potentially affecting their school readiness and academic achievement.

### 6. Behavioral Consequences and Emotional Dysregulation

Psychiatrist Stuart Brown highlights that sustained play deprivation, which includes lack of sharing, is linked to emotional dysregulation, depression, diminished impulse control, and fragile interpersonal relationships ([Storychanges, 2024](https://storychanges.com/what-effects-does-a-child-s-lack-of-play-have-on-their-development.html)). Children who do not share may exhibit aggressive behaviors or tantrums, which can alienate peers and adults alike, further isolating the child and reinforcing negative behavior patterns.

## Why Children May Resist Sharing

Understanding why children resist sharing is crucial for addressing the consequences effectively. Young children are developing a sense of ownership and autonomy, and toys often serve as extensions of their exploration and comfort ([Ariseed Psych, 2023](https://www.ariseedpsych.co.uk/blogs/why-its-okay-if-children-dont-always-share)). Forcing sharing prematurely can interrupt their developmental processes and create frustration.

Moreover, children need to learn boundaries and the right to say "no," which is part of healthy emotional development ([Ariseed Psych, 2023](https://www.ariseedpsych.co.uk/blogs/why-its-okay-if-children-dont-always-share)). Recognizing this helps caregivers balance encouraging sharing with respecting the child's developmental readiness.

## Strategies to Support Healthy Sharing Habits

To mitigate the negative consequences of children not liking to share, caregivers and educators can adopt supportive strategies:

- **Model Sharing Behavior:** Children learn by observing adults. Demonstrating thoughtful, non-forced sharing helps children understand its value ([Raising Children Network, n.d.](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/friends-siblings/sharing)).

- **Use Turn-Taking Language:** Encouraging turn-taking rather than immediate sharing can be more developmentally appropriate for young children ([Ariseed Psych, 2023](https://www.ariseedpsych.co.uk/blogs/why-its-okay-if-children-dont-always-share)).

- **Set Realistic Expectations:** Recognize that toddlers and preschoolers are still learning to share and may need guidance and encouragement rather than punishment ([Raising Children Network, n.d.](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/friends-siblings/sharing)).

- **Create Consequences Related to Sharing:** For older children, consequences for not sharing should be related to the shared item to help them understand the impact of their behavior ([Raising Children Network, n.d.](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/friends-siblings/sharing)).

- **Praise and Encourage Sharing Attempts:** Positive reinforcement helps children develop sharing skills and understand its social benefits ([Raising Children Network, n.d.](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/friends-siblings/sharing)).

## Conclusion

Children who do not like to share face a range of social, emotional, and developmental challenges. These include social isolation, peer rejection, impaired emotional regulation, poor self-control, and difficulties forming relationships. Understanding the developmental context of sharing and the reasons behind children's reluctance is essential for caregivers to provide appropriate support. Encouraging sharing through modeling, positive reinforcement, and realistic expectations can help children develop this critical social skill, promoting healthier social integration and emotional well-being.
