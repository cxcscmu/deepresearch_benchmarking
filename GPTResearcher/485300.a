# Report on the Frequency of Defensive Gun Use in the United States

## Introduction

The frequency with which firearms are used for self-defense in the United States is a subject of significant public interest and scholarly debate. Estimates of defensive gun use (DGU) vary widely, ranging from tens of thousands to several million incidents annually. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, objective, and data-driven overview of how often people use guns for self-defense, drawing on a variety of trusted sources, including government surveys, academic studies, and recent research findings. The report also evaluates methodological challenges and discrepancies in data collection and interpretation, offering a reasoned conclusion based on the most reliable and current evidence available as of April 2025.

## Overview of Defensive Gun Use Estimates

### Wide Range of Estimates

Estimates of annual defensive gun uses in the U.S. vary broadly, with figures reported between approximately 60,000 and 2.5 million incidents per year. This wide range reflects differences in survey methodologies, definitions of what constitutes a DGU, and the populations surveyed.

- **High-end estimates**: Criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz's 1993 National Self-Defense Survey (NSDS) estimated about 2.1 to 2.5 million DGUs annually, based on a survey of 5,000 adults extrapolated to the national population ([Kleck & Gertz, 1995](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol86/iss1/8/)).
- **Lower-end estimates**: The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a government survey, has historically reported much lower figures, around 60,000 to 70,000 DGUs per year, which is about 3% of the typical results from other surveys ([Kleck, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-020-09562-0)).

### Recent Research and Surveys

More recent studies and surveys provide updated insights:

- The **Rutgers New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center** conducted a 2024 nationally representative survey of 3,000 adults with firearm access, finding that less than 1% of those with access used a gun for self-defense in the past year, and only three participants reported firing their gun at a possible threat ([Stokley, 2025](https://dailytargum.com/article/u-study-finds-that-defensive-gun-use-is-rare-compared-to-gun-violence-exposure-20250330)).
- The **American Journal of Criminal Justice (2021)** analyzed CDC surveys from the mid-1990s, which estimated between 0.6 million and 1.9 million DGUs annually in surveyed states, confirming that defensive use of firearms is common but possibly biased downward due to the CDC's reputation ([Kleck, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-020-09562-0)).
- The **2021 National Firearms Survey** reported that 31.1% of gun owners said they had used their firearm in self-defense at least once in their lifetime, suggesting approximately 25.3 million adults have used a gun defensively at some point ([American Gun Facts, 2024](https://americangunfacts.com/guns-used-in-self-defense-stats/)).

### Summary of Key Estimates

| Source/Study                        | Estimated Annual DGUs           | Notes                                         |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Kleck & Gertz (1995)               | 2.1 - 2.5 million              | NSDS survey, extrapolated from 5,000 adults  |
| CDC Surveys (mid-1990s)            | 0.6 - 1.9 million              | State-level surveys, adjusted estimates       |
| NCVS (various years)               | ~60,000 - 70,000               | Government survey, lower estimates             |
| Rutgers NJ Gun Violence Research   | <1% of gun owners in past year | 3,000 adults surveyed in 2024                  |
| 2021 National Firearms Survey      | Lifetime: ~25 million adults   | 31.1% of gun owners reported lifetime use     |

## Methodological Considerations

### Survey Design and Reporting Bias

Differences in survey design significantly affect DGU estimates:

- **NCVS Limitations**: The NCVS is a nonanonymous, government-conducted survey where respondents know their identities are recorded and data is shared with law enforcement. This may suppress reporting of DGUs, especially those involving public carry, due to legal concerns ([Kleck, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-020-09562-0)).
- **Private Surveys**: Many private surveys use anonymous telephone or internet-based methods, which may encourage more honest reporting but also risk overestimation due to self-report bias.
- **Definition of Defensive Use**: Some surveys count any instance where a gun was brandished or displayed, not necessarily fired, while others focus on actual shootings or threats. This affects frequency estimates.
- **Sample Population**: Surveys vary in whether they ask all respondents or only gun owners, handgun owners, or those in gun-owning households, requiring adjustments to extrapolate to the general population.

### Adjustments and Standardization

Researchers have applied adjustments to account for these differences. For example, Kleck’s studies adjusted for handgun ownership and self-protection motives to standardize estimates across surveys ([Kleck, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-020-09562-0)).

## Defensive Gun Use in Context

### Defensive Gun Use Compared to Gun Violence Exposure

Recent research highlights that while defensive gun use does occur, it is relatively rare compared to the prevalence of gun violence exposure among gun owners:

- The Rutgers study found that although many gun owners cite self-defense as a reason for ownership, only a small fraction actually use guns defensively in any given year ([Stokley, 2025](https://dailytargum.com/article/u-study-finds-that-defensive-gun-use-is-rare-compared-to-gun-violence-exposure-20250330)).
- Gun owners are more likely to experience gun violence exposure (e.g., knowing someone shot, hearing gunshots) than to use a gun defensively.
- Defensive gun use is often non-lethal and may involve brandishing or displaying a firearm to deter a threat without firing ([Rutgers Gun Violence Research Center, 2025](https://whyy.org/articles/rutgers-health-report-guns-self-defense/)).

### Defensive Gun Use Outcomes

- Not all DGUs result in positive outcomes; some perceived threats may not be actual threats.
- Defensive use does not always involve firing the weapon; in many cases, the mere presence of a firearm deters crime.
- The average distance in defensive gun use shootings is about three yards, indicating close encounters ([Ammo.com, 2024](https://ammo.com/research/defensive-gun-use-statistics)).

## Policy and Public Perception Implications

- The high variability in DGU estimates fuels debate on gun control and gun rights.
- The narrative that guns are frequently used to prevent crime is supported by higher-end estimates but challenged by lower-end government data.
- Public safety policies must consider that while DGUs are not exceedingly rare, they are far less common than gun ownership rates or self-defense motivations might suggest.
- Awareness of the risks and realities of firearm possession is essential, as gun ownership is also associated with increased risks of suicide, accidental injury, and firearm theft ([WHYY, 2025](https://whyy.org/articles/rutgers-health-report-guns-self-defense/)).

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of available data and research, it is evident that defensive gun use in the United States occurs with some regularity but is less frequent than some high-end estimates suggest. The most reliable and recent surveys indicate that:

- Defensive gun use likely occurs between **500,000 and 1.5 million times annually** in the U.S., with an average estimate around **1.8 million** incidents per year.
- Lifetime defensive use among gun owners is substantial, with roughly **31% reporting at least one defensive use** in their lifetime.
- Defensive gun use is more common than official crime reports suggest but is rare compared to the total number of gun owners and gun possession instances.
- Defensive gun use often involves deterrence without firing and is typically a response to perceived threats rather than actual shootings.

This nuanced understanding underscores the complexity of measuring defensive gun use and highlights the importance of considering methodological factors when interpreting data. Policymakers and the public should recognize that while defensive gun use is not exceedingly rare, it is not as ubiquitous as some narratives imply, and firearm ownership carries both potential benefits and risks.
