# Report on Fair Lending Concerns with Mortgage Loan Originator (MLO) Compensation

## Introduction

Mortgage Loan Originator (MLO) compensation is a critical area of focus in fair lending compliance. The structure and incentives embedded in compensation programs can significantly influence lending practices, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes or steering, which violate fair lending laws and regulations. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of fair lending concerns associated with MLO compensation, drawing on regulatory frameworks, supervisory expectations, industry best practices, and relevant case discussions. The objective is to present an informed, detailed, and balanced view on whether and how MLO compensation programs pose fair lending risks, supported by authoritative sources and recent supervisory insights.

## Regulatory Framework and Key Prohibitions

The primary regulatory framework governing MLO compensation is the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), implemented by Regulation Z, particularly as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulation Z explicitly prohibits compensation to loan originators that is based on the terms or conditions of a mortgage transaction, except for the amount of credit extended. It also prohibits steering consumers to loans that yield greater compensation for the originator unless the loan is in the consumer’s interest ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2021](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/loan-originator-compensation-requirements-under-truth-lending-act-regulation-z/)).

Specifically, Regulation Z states:

- No loan originator shall receive compensation based on a term of a transaction.
- No person shall pay compensation to a loan originator that varies based on transaction terms.
- Loan originators must not steer consumers to consummate loans that provide greater compensation to the originator compared to other available options ([Federal Reserve Board, n.d.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/regzcg.htm)).

These provisions aim to prevent unfair lending practices and discriminatory steering that could disproportionately harm protected classes under fair lending laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA).

## Fair Lending Risks Associated with MLO Compensation

### Steering and Discrimination Risks

The most significant fair lending concern with MLO compensation is the risk of steering. Steering occurs when loan originators direct consumers toward loan products that yield higher compensation for themselves rather than those in the best interest of the consumer. This practice can lead to discriminatory outcomes if certain groups (e.g., racial minorities, low-income borrowers) are disproportionately steered into higher-cost or less favorable loan products.

Regulators and examiners actively scrutinize compensation plans to detect incentives that might encourage steering. The Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures emphasize reviewing compensation structures as a key element of fair lending risk assessments ([Ncontracts Compliance Team, 2021](https://www.ncontracts.com/nsight-blog/fair-lending-risk-loan-originator-compensation-reg-z)).

### Compensation Based on Product Type or Loan Terms

Compensation that varies based on loan product type or transaction terms is particularly problematic. While some industry participants have sought to justify differential compensation based on loan types (e.g., FHA/VA loans versus conventional loans, purchase loans versus refinances), regulatory guidance generally views such practices as risky and potentially violative of Regulation Z.

The Small Entity Compliance Guide explicitly warns that varying compensation based on “product type” often violates the rule because many products bundle specific transaction terms, which are prohibited bases for compensation variation ([Federal Reserve Board, n.d.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/regzcg.htm)).

Discussions in industry forums reflect uncertainty and concern about this issue. For example, compensation differences by loan type or product have been flagged as potential fair lending and steering risks by compliance professionals ([BankersOnline, 2013](https://www.bankersonline.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/1818427/mlo-compensation-varied-by-product-type)). Even when lenders argue that more complex loans (e.g., government loans) justify higher compensation, regulators have generally maintained a cautious stance to avoid incentives that could lead to steering.

### Discretion and Exceptions in Compensation

Another area of concern is discretionary compensation practices, such as bonuses, contests, or undefined incentives that are not clearly documented or controlled. Loan officers or management discretion in compensation can increase fair lending risk if exceptions or incentives are applied unevenly or without proper oversight.

Effective compliance programs require documented compensation plans by role and individual, with clear policies to monitor and control discretionary elements. This helps prevent unfair practices and supports regulatory compliance ([Ncontracts Compliance Team, 2021](https://www.ncontracts.com/nsight-blog/fair-lending-risk-loan-originator-compensation-reg-z)).

## Supervisory Expectations and Fair Lending Risk Management

### Fair Lending Risk Assessments

Supervisory agencies expect institutions, especially those with heightened fair lending risk, to conduct comprehensive fair lending risk assessments. These assessments should evaluate inherent risks, controls, and residual risks related to compensation practices and other lending activities.

Key risk factors include supervisory history, loan portfolio composition, organizational structure, and market demographics. Institutions are expected to tailor risk assessments to their specific profiles and update them regularly, typically annually or after significant events like mergers ([Federal Reserve System, 2024](https://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/2024/fourth-issue/fair-lending/)).

### Compliance Management Systems and Controls

Effective compliance management systems must include:

- Written policies and procedures governing compensation aligned with Regulation Z.
- Documentation of compensation plans by role and individual.
- Monitoring mechanisms to detect and prevent steering or discriminatory compensation practices.
- Controls to limit loan officer discretion and require documentation of exceptions.
- Training programs to educate staff and management on fair lending laws and risks.
- Reporting and escalation procedures to keep senior management and boards informed ([Ncontracts Compliance Team, 2021](https://www.ncontracts.com/nsight-blog/fair-lending-risk-loan-originator-compensation-reg-z); [Federal Reserve System, 2024](https://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/2024/fourth-issue/fair-lending/)).

### Training and Awareness

Recurring, role-appropriate fair lending training is critical. Training helps lending staff understand prohibited practices, management recognize risks, and boards set the right tone and oversight expectations. Supervisory feedback highlights that failure to conduct adequate training is a common deficiency leading to fair lending risks ([Federal Reserve System, 2024](https://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/2024/fourth-issue/fair-lending/)).

## Industry Practices and Challenges

Industry discussions reveal practical challenges in designing MLO compensation programs that comply with fair lending laws while addressing business needs.

- Some lenders seek to compensate MLOs differently based on loan complexity or product type, arguing that certain loans require more effort or carry different risk profiles.
- Regulators generally discourage compensation variation tied to loan terms or product bundles to avoid steering risks.
- Compensation based solely on loan amount (credit extended) is permissible, and varying compensation by individual loan officers is allowed as long as it is not based on prohibited factors ([BankersOnline, 2013](https://www.bankersonline.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/1818427/mlo-compensation-varied-by-product-type)).
- The CFPB has reportedly clarified that compensation cannot differ between purchase and refinance loans, reflecting a strict interpretation of the steering prohibition ([BankersOnline, 2013](https://www.bankersonline.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/1818427/mlo-compensation-varied-by-product-type)).

These insights underscore the importance of cautious, well-documented compensation structures that avoid incentives linked to transaction terms or product types.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion

There are significant fair lending concerns associated with MLO compensation programs, primarily related to the risks of steering and discrimination. Regulatory frameworks, supervisory expectations, and industry guidance consistently emphasize that compensation must not be based on loan terms or product types that could incentivize unfair lending practices. Discretionary compensation elements and lack of clear policies further exacerbate fair lending risks.

While some variation in compensation by individual or loan amount is permissible, compensation tied to transaction terms, loan product types, or loan purpose (purchase vs. refinance) is generally prohibited or viewed as high risk. Institutions failing to implement robust compliance management systems, conduct fair lending risk assessments, and provide effective training increase their exposure to regulatory actions and fair lending violations.

### Recommendations

Financial institutions should adopt the following best practices to mitigate fair lending risks related to MLO compensation:

1. **Establish and maintain comprehensive written policies and procedures** governing MLO compensation that explicitly comply with Regulation Z and fair lending laws.

2. **Document compensation plans by role and individual**, including salary, variable compensation, bonuses, and contests, ensuring all components are clearly defined and justified.

3. **Avoid compensation structures that vary based on loan terms, product types, or loan purpose** to eliminate steering risks.

4. **Implement strong monitoring and compliance controls** to detect and prevent discriminatory practices, including limiting loan officer discretion and requiring documentation of exceptions.

5. **Conduct regular fair lending risk assessments** tailored to the institution’s risk profile, updating them annually or after significant changes.

6. **Provide recurring, role-specific fair lending training** to all lending staff, management, and board members to promote awareness and compliance culture.

7. **Maintain records of compensation and compliance monitoring** for at least two years, as required by Regulation Z.

By rigorously applying these practices, institutions can effectively manage fair lending risks associated with MLO compensation, ensuring compliance and protecting consumers from discriminatory lending practices.
