# Why Was Anwar Sadat Assassinated? A Detailed Report

## Introduction

Anwar Sadat, the third President of Egypt, was assassinated on October 6, 1981, during a military parade in Cairo commemorating the eighth anniversary of Egypt's crossing of the Suez Canal in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. His assassination marked a pivotal moment in Middle Eastern history, with deep ramifications for Egypt, the Arab world, and international relations. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, in-depth, and well-structured analysis of the reasons behind Sadat's assassination, drawing from a wide range of reliable sources and historical accounts.

## Background: Sadat’s Presidency and Policies

Anwar Sadat rose to power after the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1970. Initially a close confidant of Nasser and a member of the Free Officers who overthrew the Egyptian monarchy in 1952, Sadat’s presidency marked a significant shift in Egypt’s domestic and foreign policies. He distanced Egypt from the Soviet Union, expelled Soviet advisors in 1972, and aligned Egypt more closely with the United States. Domestically, Sadat launched the *Infitah* (economic "opening") policy, encouraging private investment and moving away from Nasser’s socialism. Internationally, Sadat is best known for his historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977 and the subsequent Camp David Accords in 1978, which led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty ([Lumen Learning, 2025](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-worldhistory/chapter/33-5-5-sadat-and-cold-war-influences/); [Washington Institute, 1998](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/sadat-and-his-legacy-egypt-and-world-1977-1997)).

## The Camp David Accords and Its Controversy

The Camp David Accords, brokered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter between Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, were hailed internationally as a major breakthrough toward peace in the Middle East. Sadat and Begin were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 for this achievement. However, this peace initiative was highly controversial within Egypt and the broader Arab world. The treaty made Egypt the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel, which many Arab nations and Palestinian groups vehemently opposed. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League from 1979 to 1989, and Sadat was branded a traitor by many in the Arab world ([Association for Diplomatic Studies & Training, 2013](https://adst.org/2013/09/the-assassination-of-anwar-sadat-part-i/); [Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

## Domestic Opposition and Islamist Radicalization

Sadat’s peace treaty with Israel was not the sole cause of his assassination but was a critical catalyst that intensified domestic opposition, especially from Islamist groups. Various jihadist organizations, most notably the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, viewed Sadat’s peace initiative as a betrayal of Arab and Islamic causes, particularly the Palestinian struggle. These groups used the Camp David Accords to rally support for their cause and publicly called for the overthrow of Sadat’s government and the establishment of an Islamic theocracy in Egypt ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat); [Mapping Militant Organizations, 2025](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/401)).

Sadat’s last years were marked by increasing internal unrest, including riots in June 1981 and mass arrests in September 1981. Sadat responded with a major crackdown on opposition figures, including Islamists, leftists, and other dissidents. Despite maintaining some popularity, Sadat was seen as increasingly authoritarian and oppressive, alienating many Egyptians ([EBSCO Research Starters, 2025](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/anwar-el-sadat); [Washington Institute, 1998](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/sadat-and-his-legacy-egypt-and-world-1977-1997)).

## The Assassination Plot

The assassination was carried out by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, led by Lieutenant Khalid al-Islambuli, a military officer who exploited his position to orchestrate the attack. Al-Islambuli and his accomplices disguised themselves as members of the Egyptian military and opened fire during the October 6, 1981, military parade in Cairo. Sadat was shot multiple times and killed, along with 11 others, including foreign dignitaries and Egyptian officials. The attack was preceded by a fatwā (religious decree) approving the assassination, issued by prominent Islamist cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Khalid-al-Islambuli); [Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

The assassination was not only a symbolic act against Sadat personally but aimed at destabilizing the Egyptian state and halting the peace process with Israel. The conspirators hoped that killing Sadat would cripple the government enough to allow Islamist groups to seize power ([Stanford Mapping Militants, 2025](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/401)).

## Political and Social Context Leading to the Assassination

### 1. Alienation of the Arab World and Palestinians

Sadat’s unilateral peace with Israel alienated Egypt from the Arab world. The Arab League suspended Egypt’s membership, and many Arab nations severed diplomatic ties. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Palestinian factions condemned the treaty, viewing it as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause. This regional isolation intensified domestic opposition and emboldened Islamist militants who opposed Sadat’s policies ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

### 2. Domestic Political Repression and Unrest

Sadat’s crackdown on political opposition, including Islamists, leftists, and intellectuals, created a climate of fear and resentment. Thousands were arrested, and political dissent was suppressed. Sadat’s assumption of extraordinary presidential powers in 1980 and his increasingly authoritarian rule alienated many Egyptians who had initially supported him. The economic hardships and social inequalities exacerbated by the *Infitah* policy also fueled discontent ([EBSCO Research Starters, 2025](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/anwar-el-sadat); [Washington Institute, 1998](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/sadat-and-his-legacy-egypt-and-world-1977-1997)).

### 3. Rise of Islamist Militancy

The failure of Sadat’s policies to address Islamist demands and the perceived betrayal of Islamic and Arab nationalism led to the rise of militant Islamist groups. These groups, including Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, rejected Sadat’s secular and pro-Western orientation and sought to replace the government with an Islamic theocracy. The assassination was the culmination of years of radicalization and militant plotting ([Stanford Mapping Militants, 2025](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/401); [Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

## Immediate Aftermath and Consequences

Following Sadat’s assassination, Vice President Hosni Mubarak assumed power. Mubarak’s hand was injured during the attack, symbolizing his close involvement. The government declared a state of emergency and launched a massive crackdown on Islamist militants and political dissidents. Over 700 people were arrested, with 25 facing trial; five were executed, including al-Islambuli ([UPI, 2022](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2022/03/06/On-This-Day-5-sentenced-to-death-for-assassination-of-Egypts-Anwar-Sadat/6611646535783/); [Factual America, 2025](https://www.factualamerica.com/history-revisited/cairo-assassination-9-documentaries-on-sadats-final-day)).

Internationally, the assassination shocked the world. Sadat’s funeral was attended by numerous dignitaries, including three former U.S. presidents and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who insisted on attending despite the Sabbath. The event underscored the fragility of pro-Western governments in the Middle East and raised concerns about the future of peace efforts in the region ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Sadat)).

## Analysis and Conclusion

The assassination of Anwar Sadat was the result of a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. Sadat’s bold peace initiative with Israel, while internationally lauded, alienated much of the Arab world and ignited fierce opposition at home, particularly from Islamist groups who viewed the treaty as a betrayal of Islamic and Arab nationalist ideals. Sadat’s increasingly authoritarian domestic policies, economic challenges, and suppression of dissent further fueled opposition.

The assassination was orchestrated by radical Islamist militants within the military, led by Khalid al-Islambuli, who sought to reverse Sadat’s policies and destabilize the Egyptian state. The attack was both a symbolic rejection of Sadat’s peace efforts and a strategic attempt to seize power by Islamist factions.

In my assessment, Sadat’s assassination was fundamentally rooted in his unprecedented peace treaty with Israel and the resulting political isolation and domestic unrest. While his leadership brought significant diplomatic achievements and shifted Egypt’s international alignment, it also exposed deep societal divisions and provoked violent backlash from Islamist extremists. The event highlights the profound challenges of pursuing peace and reform in a context marked by entrenched ideological, religious, and geopolitical conflicts.
