# Ending Sexual Violence in the Military: A Comprehensive and Evidence-Based Approach

## Introduction

Sexual violence in the military remains a persistent and corrosive problem that undermines the safety, dignity, and effectiveness of the armed forces. Despite decades of efforts, including legislative reforms, training programs, and cultural initiatives, sexual assault and harassment continue to affect thousands of service members annually. This report synthesizes recent developments, research findings, and policy actions to provide a detailed, evidence-based roadmap for ending sexual violence in the military. It emphasizes the necessity of systemic reforms, cultural change, prevention strategies, and survivor-centered responses, grounded in reliable data and expert analysis.

## Current State of Sexual Violence in the Military

Sexual violence in the military encompasses a range of offenses, including sexual assault, harassment, domestic violence, and related crimes. According to the Department of Defense (DoD), there were over 8,942 reports of sexual assaults involving service members in the 2022 fiscal year, a slight increase from the previous year ([The White House, 2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/)). RAND research highlights that more than 20,000 service members reported sexual assault in a single year, with women disproportionately affected (6.2% of military women versus 0.7% of men) ([RAND, 2021](https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2021/preventing-sexual-violence-in-the-military.html)). These figures likely underestimate the true prevalence due to underreporting driven by fear of retaliation and mistrust in the system.

## Legislative and Executive Reforms

### Independent Prosecution Authority

A landmark reform signed into effect by President Biden in 2023 transferred prosecutorial decision-making authority for serious offenses—including sexual assault, domestic violence, and murder—from commanders to independent military prosecutors known as the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTC). This change aims to eliminate perceived conflicts of interest and increase trust in the military justice system by ensuring prosecutorial independence and professionalism ([The White House, 2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/); [AP News, 2023](https://apnews.com/article/sex-assault-military-biden-prosecutor-justice-df9fef0cfa91c5badbd141c2a13466d0)).

### Uniform Evidence Standards and Sentencing Reform

The reforms also include standardizing evidence rules for non-judicial punishment and court-martial sentencing to promote fairness and reduce disparities, particularly in sexual assault cases ([The White House, 2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/)).

### Sexual Harassment as a Military Offense

The Manual for Courts-Martial was amended to criminalize sexual harassment explicitly, strengthening the military justice system’s ability to prosecute such offenses ([The White House, 2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/)).

## Challenges and Controversies

Despite these reforms, challenges persist. In early 2025, several military branches paused Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) training amid reviews to comply with executive orders restricting references to "gender," "gender identity," and "gender ideology." This pause raised concerns among lawmakers about deprioritizing sexual assault prevention efforts and potentially undermining victim support and reporting mechanisms ([Military.com, 2025](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/11/not-only-irresponsible-also-dangerous-democrats-demand-answers-paused-military-sexual-assault.html)).

## Prevention Strategies: Evidence and Best Practices

### Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE)

Research indicates that sexual violence perpetration is influenced by multiple risk factors, including gender norms, attitudes towards violence, and social-emotional intelligence. Comprehensive sexuality education that is gender-transformative and addresses these risk factors has shown promise in reducing sexual violence perpetration, particularly among adolescents and young adults ([Butler et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6283686/)).

### Bystander Intervention and Social Norms Marketing

Programs that empower peers to intervene and challenge harmful behaviors have demonstrated effectiveness in changing attitudes and reducing risk factors associated with sexual violence ([RAND, 2020](https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TLA746-2/handbook/resources/sexual-assault-prevention-activities.html)).

### Targeting Alcohol Misuse

Given the correlation between alcohol misuse and sexual assault risk, interventions focusing on reducing alcohol abuse among service members are a promising prevention strategy ([RAND, 2014](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR538.html)).

## Cultural Change and Leadership Commitment

### Separate Military Justice Reform from Culture Change

Experts caution against conflating military justice reform with cultural change. While reforms such as shifting prosecutorial authority address perceptions of bias, they do not directly transform military culture. Effective cultural change requires sustained leadership commitment, clear standards of conduct, and accountability at all levels ([Cox, 2021](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2021/09/08/brian-cox-on-congress-must-learn-that-military-justice-reform-and-changing-military-culture-are-two-separate-issues/)).

### Professionalizing Sexual Assault Response Workforce

The DoD has moved to professionalize Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs) and Victim Advocates (VAs) by removing them from the command reporting structure and eliminating collateral duties, thereby enhancing victim support and trust ([The White House, 2023](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-implementing-bipartisan-military-justice-reforms/)).

### Leadership Tone and Accountability

Research underscores the importance of leadership setting a clear tone against sexual violence and intervening early in patterns of harassment to prevent escalation ([RAND, 2021](https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2021/preventing-sexual-violence-in-the-military.html)).

## Survivor-Centered Approaches

Ensuring dignity, respect, and comprehensive care for survivors is critical. This includes accessible reporting options, protection from retaliation, and robust victim advocacy services. The reforms and SAPR program emphasize these components, but ongoing evaluation and improvement are necessary ([GovFacts, 2023](https://govfacts.org/federal/defense/understanding-the-militarys-sexual-assault-prevention-and-response-sapr-program/)).

## Data, Research, and Continuous Improvement

Reliable data collection and analysis are essential for understanding the scope of sexual violence and assessing the effectiveness of interventions. RAND and other research institutions provide valuable insights that should inform policy and program adjustments ([RAND, 2021](https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2021/preventing-sexual-violence-in-the-military.html)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Ending sexual violence in the military requires a multifaceted, evidence-based approach that integrates:

1. **Independent and Professional Military Justice**: Fully implement and support independent prosecution authorities to ensure fairness and build trust in the justice system.

2. **Comprehensive Prevention Programs**: Invest in and expand evidence-based prevention strategies, including comprehensive sexuality education, bystander intervention, and alcohol misuse reduction.

3. **Cultural Transformation**: Promote sustained leadership commitment to a culture of respect and accountability, separate from justice reforms.

4. **Survivor Support**: Enhance victim advocacy, reporting mechanisms, and protections to ensure survivors receive comprehensive care and justice.

5. **Training and Education**: Maintain and improve SAPR training with inclusive, evidence-based content that addresses all service members.

6. **Data-Driven Policy**: Continuously collect and analyze data to guide policy decisions and program improvements.

While legislative and executive reforms mark significant progress, they must be complemented by cultural change and prevention efforts grounded in research to achieve the ultimate goal: a military free from sexual violence.
