# Report: Factors Contributing to the Increase in Domestic Violence

## Introduction

Domestic violence (DV), also referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), has been a pervasive social issue globally, affecting millions of individuals, predominantly women. Recent years have witnessed a notable increase in domestic violence incidents, particularly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, by the intensifying climate crisis. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the underlying causes driving the rise in domestic violence, drawing on recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and authoritative reports from global organizations. The report prioritizes reliable and recent sources to elucidate the multifaceted factors contributing to this troubling trend.

## Increase in Domestic Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic

### Impact of Lockdowns and Stay-at-Home Orders

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led to unprecedented public health measures worldwide, including stay-at-home and lockdown orders intended to curb virus transmission. While effective from a public health perspective, these measures inadvertently increased domestic violence incidents. A systematic review and meta-analysis found strong evidence of increased officially reported domestic violence following lockdowns, with an overall mean effect size of 0.66, indicating a significant rise in incidents across multiple countries, with stronger effects noted in the United States ([Piquero et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582712/)).

Victims were confined with abusers, limiting opportunities to seek help or escape. The isolation intensified stress and anxiety, which are known risk factors for domestic violence. Additionally, the pandemic's economic fallout—marked by record unemployment, financial instability, and increased childcare burdens due to school closures—exacerbated tensions within households ([Piquero et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582712/); [Global Citizen, 2021](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/domestic-violence-covid-19-increase-us-ncccj-study/)).

### Economic Stress and Unemployment

Economic distress emerged as a central driver of increased domestic violence during the pandemic. Male unemployment and financial insecurity heightened tensions and conflict within households. Women's economic dependence on male partners further increased vulnerability to abuse, as financial control is a common tactic used by abusers to exert coercive control ([Piquero et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582712/); [Global Citizen, 2021](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/domestic-violence-covid-19-increase-us-ncccj-study/)).

### Mental Health and Substance Abuse

The pandemic's psychological toll, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression, contributed to maladaptive coping strategies such as increased alcohol and substance use, which are associated with higher risks of domestic violence ([Piquero et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582712/); [Global Citizen, 2021](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/domestic-violence-covid-19-increase-us-ncccj-study/)).

### Reporting Dynamics

It is important to note that increases in reported domestic violence may reflect not only a rise in victimization but also changes in help-seeking behavior. Some victims who previously did not report abuse may have sought help during the pandemic due to increased awareness or severity of incidents. Conversely, some victims may have been unable or fearful to report due to constant proximity to abusers ([Piquero et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582712/)).

## Technology-Facilitated Abuse: A New Dimension

The rise of technology-facilitated abuse (TFA) has added complexity to the domestic violence landscape. TFA includes digital coercive control, harassment via social media, surveillance, and identity crimes perpetrated through technological means. Research with domestic violence specialists highlights that TFA acts as an extension of traditional abuse methods, enabling perpetrators to exert control and instill fear continuously, even when physically apart from victims ([Woodlock et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8246499/)).

Social media platforms can be weaponized to humiliate survivors, engage others in abuse, and exacerbate isolation. This digital dimension amplifies the psychological impact of abuse and complicates intervention efforts ([Woodlock et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8246499/)).

## Climate Crisis and Domestic Violence

Emerging evidence indicates that the climate crisis is driving a surge in gender-based violence, including domestic violence. The United Nations Spotlight Initiative reports that climate change intensifies social and economic stresses—such as displacement, food insecurity, and economic instability—that increase the prevalence and severity of violence against women and girls ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162461)).

### Temperature Rise and Intimate Partner Violence

Quantitative analyses reveal a direct correlation between rising global temperatures and intimate partner violence. Every 1°C increase in global temperature is associated with a 4.7% rise in IPV. Under a 2°C warming scenario, an estimated 40 million more women and girls could experience IPV annually by 2090, with numbers more than doubling under a 3.5°C scenario ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162461)).

### Climate Disasters and Violence

Extreme weather events and climate-related disasters exacerbate vulnerabilities. For instance, femicide rates increased by 28% during heatwaves in one study. Displacement caused by floods, droughts, and desertification leads to higher rates of child marriage, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation, particularly affecting marginalized communities ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162461)).

### Intersectionality and Marginalized Groups

Women and girls living in poverty, indigenous populations, disabled individuals, elderly women, and LGBTQ+ communities face compounded risks due to overlapping social and economic inequalities. These groups often have limited access to protective services, shelters, and legal recourse, deepening their vulnerability ([UN News, 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162461); [UN News, 2022](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129242)).

## Societal Norms and Underlying Factors

Domestic violence is rooted in complex societal norms and individual factors. Research identifies several contributors:

- **Desire for control and power:** DV is often motivated by a perpetrator's need to dominate.
- **Mental health issues:** Psychological disorders can increase the risk of abusive behavior.
- **Substance abuse:** Alcohol and drugs impair judgment and exacerbate aggression.
- **Financial problems:** Economic stress is a well-established risk factor.
- **Cultural values and gender role perceptions:** Societal acceptance of male dominance and gender inequality perpetuates abuse ([Knowledge and Information Systems, 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-025-02420-7)).

## Socio-Demographic Factors and Trends

Population-based studies, such as those conducted in Norway, show increases in severe violence including physical partner violence, forcible rape, and physical violence, especially among women and younger individuals. Lower education, income, and marital status (divorced or separated) correlate with higher risks. Increased societal awareness and movements like #MeToo may have influenced reporting rates, but the underlying prevalence remains concerning ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22763-8)).

## Discussion and Conclusion

The increase in domestic violence is a multifactorial phenomenon influenced by acute crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis, as well as entrenched societal and individual factors. The pandemic's lockdowns and economic fallout created conditions conducive to increased abuse by confining victims with abusers, heightening stress, and limiting access to support. Technology-facilitated abuse has expanded perpetrators' reach, intensifying control and fear. The climate crisis adds another layer of risk by exacerbating economic and social vulnerabilities, particularly in marginalized communities.

Addressing the rise in domestic violence requires integrated approaches that consider these intersecting factors. Policy responses must enhance support services, incorporate technology-based abuse interventions, and embed gender-sensitive strategies within climate resilience planning. Recognizing domestic violence as both a public health and social justice issue is critical to reversing this upward trend.
