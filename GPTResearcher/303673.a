# Report on the Causes of the Chicken Wing Shortage in the United States

## Introduction

Chicken wings have long been a popular food item in the United States, especially favored in restaurants, sports bars, and fast-food chains. However, in recent years, consumers and businesses alike have faced a notable shortage of chicken wings, leading to increased prices, menu changes, and supply chain challenges. This report aims to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the chicken wing shortage, drawing on recent and reliable sources to present a clear understanding of the issue as of 2025.

## Overview of the Chicken Wing Shortage

The chicken wing shortage in the U.S. is a multifaceted problem influenced by a combination of supply constraints, increased demand, environmental factors, and disruptions in the poultry supply chain. Unlike a general chicken shortage, the wing shortage is particularly acute because wings constitute only a small portion of the chicken, and demand for wings has surged disproportionately compared to other parts of the bird.

## Key Factors Driving the Chicken Wing Shortage

### 1. Supply Chain Disruptions and Production Constraints

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the poultry industry, causing labor shortages and temporary closures of processing plants. These disruptions reduced the industry's capacity to process chickens efficiently, leading to backlogs and culling of birds in some regions ([The Cooking Facts, 2025](https://thecookingfacts.com/is-there-a-chicken-shortage/)). Additionally, severe weather events such as the Texas power crisis in 2021 and record-breaking winter storms in the southcentral U.S. caused significant losses in poultry populations, further constraining supply ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

Moreover, processing plants operate below capacity due to ongoing labor shortages and safety protocols, which limits the throughput of chicken products, including wings ([Ritter Foods, 2025](https://ritterfoods.com/navigating-the-current-chicken-shortage-in-the-u-s/)).

### 2. Increased Demand for Chicken Wings

Demand for chicken wings has surged significantly, especially during and after the pandemic. Wings became a highly sought-after comfort food during lockdowns, and their popularity has remained strong as restaurants reopened. The National Chicken Council estimated that Americans consumed approximately 1.42 billion chicken wings during the 2022 Super Bowl alone, highlighting the cultural and seasonal demand spikes ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

Fast-food chains have also contributed to increased demand. For example, KFC reported a 14% spike in comparable store sales linked to their new chicken sandwich, and Chick-fil-A saw a 23% increase in sales, intensifying pressure on chicken supplies ([ABC7 Los Angeles, 2021](https://abc7.com/us-facing-chicken-shortage-is-there-a-why-fried/10566867/)).

### 3. Disproportionate Consumption of Wings Relative to Whole Chickens

Each chicken has only two wings, which limits the total available supply of wings relative to other parts of the bird. When demand for wings outpaces demand for other parts, it creates an imbalance in supply. This imbalance results in an oversupply of other chicken parts, such as thighs and breasts, while wings remain scarce ([JD Food, 2021](https://www.jdfood.com/chicken-wing-shortage/)).

### 4. Export and Trade Dynamics

The U.S. poultry industry has also experienced changes in export patterns. While exports of chicken wings to countries like Mexico have decreased to meet domestic demand, the overall export volume of chicken products remains high. In 2021, 17.1% of total chicken production was exported, the highest since 2014, which can further tighten domestic supplies of specific cuts like wings ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

### 5. Rising Production Costs and Economic Pressures

Feed costs, primarily corn and soybeans, have increased significantly due to global market fluctuations and climate events. These rising feed prices elevate the cost of raising chickens, prompting some producers to reduce flock sizes or exit the industry altogether ([The Cooking Facts, 2025](https://thecookingfacts.com/is-there-a-chicken-shortage/)). Additionally, inflation has increased labor and transportation costs, further pressuring producers and processors.

### 6. Environmental and Regulatory Factors

Environmental challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and land degradation affect feed production and poultry farming operations. Regulatory factors, including food safety laws and trade tariffs, also impact production costs and supply chain efficiency ([FlavoryCooking, 2025](https://flavorycooking.com/why-are-chicken-wings-getting-cheaper/)).

### 7. Shifts in Consumer Preferences

More recently, changes in consumer dietary habits have influenced demand patterns. A growing interest in healthier eating and alternative protein sources has led to fluctuating demand for traditional chicken wings. While this has contributed to some price volatility, the overall demand for wings remains strong in many regions ([FlavoryCooking, 2025](https://flavorycooking.com/why-are-chicken-wings-getting-cheaper/)).

## Impact of the Shortage

### Price Increases

The shortage has caused chicken wing prices to surge dramatically. Suppliers and restaurants face higher procurement costs, which are often passed on to consumers. For example, wing prices reached record highs in 2021, creating a price crunch across the industry ([Yahoo Finance, 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-wing-national-chicken-wing-150009910.html)).

### Menu Changes and Business Adjustments

Restaurants and foodservice providers have had to adapt by removing wings from menus, increasing prices, or promoting alternative products such as chicken thighs. Wingstop, a major wing restaurant chain, launched a virtual brand called Thighstop to offer chicken thighs as an alternative during the wing shortage ([BlackDoctor.org, 2021](https://blackdoctor.org/chicken-wing-shortage-2021/)).

### Regional and Localized Shortages

While the shortage is not uniform nationwide, certain regions and grocery stores have experienced empty shelves and limited availability of wings. These localized shortages often coincide with supply chain interruptions and seasonal demand spikes ([The Cooking Facts, 2025](https://thecookingfacts.com/is-there-a-chicken-shortage/)).

## Outlook and Conclusion

The chicken wing shortage is the result of a complex interplay of supply chain disruptions, increased demand, environmental challenges, and economic pressures. The COVID-19 pandemic and severe weather events exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in the poultry supply chain. Despite these challenges, the shortage is expected to ease as production capacity recovers and supply chain issues are addressed. Industry experts predict that by late 2025 or early 2026, the supply-demand balance for chicken wings will improve, though price volatility may persist in the short term ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

In my assessment, the shortage is primarily a supply-side issue intensified by extraordinary external shocks rather than a fundamental long-term scarcity of chicken wings. The disproportionate demand for wings relative to other parts of the chicken, combined with labor and processing constraints, has created a bottleneck that will require time and strategic industry adjustments to resolve fully. Continued monitoring of environmental factors, feed costs, and consumer trends will be essential for stakeholders to navigate this evolving landscape.
