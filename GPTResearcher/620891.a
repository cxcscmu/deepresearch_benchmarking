# Appropriate Contributions of Wealthy Countries to Global Health: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Global health remains a critical domain where disparities in funding and resource allocation significantly impact health outcomes worldwide. Wealthy countries, by virtue of their economic capacity and global influence, play a pivotal role in financing global health initiatives. The question of how much wealthy countries should contribute to global health is complex, involving considerations of equity, economic capacity, moral responsibility, and global stability. This report provides an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of appropriate contributions from wealthy countries to global health, drawing on recent data, funding trends, and scholarly insights as of 2025.

## Current State of Global Health Funding

The World Health Organization (WHO) budget for 2024–2025 stands at approximately US$6.83 billion, covering a wide range of activities from emergency response to health system strengthening ([Nature Medicine, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03649-z)). However, this budget is insufficient to meet the growing global health challenges, including rising noncommunicable diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and vaccination gaps.

The WHO’s funding is sourced from two main streams: assessed contributions (membership dues) and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions cover less than 20% of the total WHO budget, while voluntary contributions, which include core voluntary contributions, thematic funds, and specified contributions, make up the remaining 80% ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/who-funding-by-country)).

The United States remains the largest single donor, expected to contribute approximately $220 million in the current budget cycle, followed by China ($115 million), Japan ($82 million), Germany ($58 million), and the United Kingdom ($44 million) ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/who-funding-by-country)). Despite these contributions, the WHO faces a significant funding gap, with an estimated $11.1 billion needed over the next three years to effectively respond to health emergencies and strengthen health systems ([Nature Medicine, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03649-z)).

## The Funding Gap and the Need for Increased Contributions

The WHO Investment Round launched in 2024 aims to raise an additional $7.1 billion on top of $4 billion in assessed contributions to meet the 14th workplan for 2025–2028 ([Nature Medicine, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03649-z)). This initiative reflects the urgent need to diversify and stabilize funding sources, especially in light of the US exit and reductions in contributions from other G7 countries.

Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), require substantial financial investments. The United Nations has long advocated for developed countries to allocate 0.7% of their Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA), a target that remains unmet by most countries ([UNCTAD, 2016](https://unctad.org/news/achieving-sdgs-requires-rich-countries-meet-their-07-aid-target-unctad); [Our World in Data, 2025](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/foreign-aid-given-as-a-share-of-national-income)).

In 2023, aid provided by OECD-DAC members reached only 0.37% of GNI, falling significantly short of the 0.7% target ([UNCTAD, 2025](https://unctad.org/publication/aid-crossroads-trends-official-development-assistance)). This shortfall has tangible consequences, including increased mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

## Proposals for Appropriate Contributions

### DALY-Based Contribution Model

A prominent approach to determining appropriate contributions is based on Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which quantify the burden of disease. Carrasco et al. (2013) proposed a DALY tradable credit market system, suggesting that high-income countries should contribute approximately 74% of the additional US$36–45 billion needed annually to meet health MDGs (Millennium Development Goals), with middle-income countries contributing the remaining 26% ([Carrasco et al., 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001392)).

Under this model, the United States alone would be expected to increase its contributions by US$6.8–10 billion annually, Japan by US$2 billion, Germany by US$1.5–2 billion, and China by US$2.1–2.7 billion. This represents a significant scale-up from current levels but is justified by the substantial health and economic benefits derived from these investments.

### Percentage of Military Budgets as a Benchmark

The DALY-based increases correspond to relatively small percentages of military expenditures: 1% for the US, 3% for Japan and Germany, and 2% for China and France ([Carrasco et al., 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001392)). This comparison underscores the feasibility of reallocating a modest fraction of defense budgets to global health, which offers high returns in terms of lives saved and economic productivity.

### Meeting the 0.7% ODA/GNI Target

The longstanding UN target of allocating 0.7% of GNI to ODA remains a critical benchmark. Achieving this target would generate an estimated additional US$231 billion in aid globally, vastly exceeding current aid flows ([One.org, 2025](https://data.one.org/analysis/official-development-assistance)). This level of funding is essential not only for health but for broader sustainable development goals.

Despite repeated commitments, few wealthy countries consistently meet this target. For example, in 2023, OECD-DAC countries collectively provided only 0.37% of GNI in aid ([UNCTAD, 2025](https://unctad.org/publication/aid-crossroads-trends-official-development-assistance)). Increasing contributions to meet or exceed this target is both a moral imperative and a practical necessity.

## Rationale for Increased Contributions

### Moral and Human Rights Obligations

Many governments fall short of their human rights obligations to ensure adequate public healthcare funding. WHO data indicates that numerous countries could increase health spending by improving tax revenues and debt management ([Human Rights Watch, 2025](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/04/10/new-data-exposes-global-healthcare-funding-inequalities)). Wealthier countries have a special responsibility to support these efforts through increased aid and debt relief.

### Economic and Security Benefits

Investing in global health yields substantial economic returns. Analyses estimate that every $1 pledged to WHO generates $35 in economic activity through reduced disease burden and increased productivity ([Nature Medicine, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03649-z)). Moreover, global health security contributes to geopolitical stability, reducing the risk of pandemics and cross-border health threats.

### Addressing Funding Volatility and Diversification

The WHO’s reliance on a small number of donors creates vulnerability to budget fluctuations, as evidenced by the US withdrawal and reduced voluntary contributions from G7 countries ([Nature Medicine, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03649-z)). Diversifying funding sources and increasing predictable, flexible funding from wealthy countries is essential for WHO’s financial stability.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Political Will and Economic Constraints

Despite clear benefits, political and economic challenges hinder increased contributions. Some wealthy countries face domestic pressures to reduce foreign aid budgets, as seen in recent cuts by the UK and Switzerland ([Nature, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01191-z)). Economic downturns and geopolitical tensions further complicate commitments.

### Efficient Use of Funds

Ensuring that increased contributions translate into effective health outcomes requires transparency, accountability, and strategic allocation. Core voluntary contributions, which are fully discretionary, represent only a small fraction of WHO’s voluntary funding, with most funds earmarked for specific causes ([World Population Review, 2025](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/who-funding-by-country)).

### Equity Among Donor Countries

Contributions should reflect both ability to pay and global health needs. Emerging economies like China, Brazil, and India are increasingly expected to contribute, reflecting their growing economic capacities ([Carrasco et al., 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001392)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive analysis of current funding, proposed models, and global health needs, it is appropriate for wealthy countries to:

1. **Increase contributions significantly beyond current levels**, aiming to meet or exceed the 0.7% ODA/GNI target, which remains a globally recognized benchmark.
2. **Adopt DALY-based contribution frameworks** to align funding with disease burden and economic capacity, with the US increasing contributions by approximately US$7–10 billion annually and other wealthy countries scaling accordingly.
3. **Reallocate a modest percentage of military budgets (1–3%)** towards global health, recognizing the high return on investment and security benefits.
4. **Enhance predictable and flexible funding mechanisms** to reduce WHO’s reliance on a few donors and improve financial stability.
5. **Support tax reforms, debt relief, and domestic resource mobilization** in lower-income countries to complement external aid and promote sustainable health financing.
6. **Promote transparency and efficiency** in the use of funds to maximize health outcomes and donor confidence.

In sum, wealthy countries have both the capacity and the responsibility to substantially increase their contributions to global health. Doing so is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in global stability, economic growth, and human well-being.
