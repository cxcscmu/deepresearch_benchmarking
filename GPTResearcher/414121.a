# Report on Public Perceptions and Feelings About Climate Change in 2024-2025

## Introduction

Climate change remains one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century, with wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, economies, and societies. Understanding how people around the world feel about climate change is crucial for shaping effective policies and mobilizing collective action. This report synthesizes findings from multiple recent and authoritative surveys and studies conducted globally and in the United States, focusing on public attitudes, emotional responses, perceived risks, and support for climate policies as of 2024-2025. The analysis prioritizes data from the Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024, Pew Research Center studies, Ipsos reports, and expert commentary from organizations such as the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and E3G.

## Global Public Opinion on Climate Change

### Increasing Concern and Awareness

The Peoples’ Climate Vote 2024, the world’s largest standalone public opinion survey on climate change, reveals a significant and growing global concern about climate change. The survey, which represents 87% of the world’s population through over 73,000 respondents across 77 countries, shows that 56% of people think about climate change daily or weekly, and 53% are more worried about it now than a year ago ([UNDP Climate Promise, 2024](https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/worlds-largest-survey-climate-change-out-heres-what-results-show)).

Moreover, 43% of respondents perceive that extreme weather events have worsened recently, and 78% want increased protection for vulnerable populations facing such events. There is also strong support (79%) for richer countries to assist poorer nations in adapting to climate impacts, reflecting a global sense of solidarity and justice ([Peoples’ Climate Vote, 2024](https://peoplesclimate.vote/)).

### Consensus for Ambitious Climate Action

The UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner described the survey's results as a “truly astonishing” consensus for stronger climate action, with 80% of respondents supporting more ambitious measures to combat climate change. This widespread agreement transcends geopolitical and cultural boundaries, underscoring a global demand for leaders to act boldly and urgently ([UN News, 2024](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/06/1151271)).

People globally express a desire to rapidly transition away from fossil fuels toward clean energy, restore and protect nature, and close gaps in climate education. These priorities align with scientific recommendations for mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts ([UNDP Climate Promise, 2024](https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/worlds-largest-survey-climate-change-out-heres-what-results-show)).

### Regional Variations and Demographic Factors

While global concern is high, regional differences exist. For example, people in Eastern and Middle Eastern countries tend to express greater concern about climate change than those in some Western nations. Scandinavian countries, despite facing significant warming, show comparatively less concern, possibly due to perceptions of local benefits from a warming climate ([Conca, 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2019/09/17/how-does-everyone-feel-about-climate-change/)).

Demographically, younger adults are generally more worried about climate change and its future impacts. For instance, in the United States, 78% of young adults (18-29) expect worsening climate harms in their lifetime, reflecting heightened awareness and concern among younger generations ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/10/25/how-americans-view-future-harms-from-climate-change-in-their-community-and-around-the-u-s/)).

## Public Perceptions and Emotional Responses in the United States

### Recognition of Current and Future Harms

In the U.S., a majority recognize that climate change is already causing harm. About 43% say it is causing a great deal or quite a bit of harm today, with an additional 28% acknowledging some harm. Looking ahead, 63% expect climate impacts to worsen during their lifetime ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/10/25/how-americans-view-future-harms-from-climate-change-in-their-community-and-around-the-u-s/)).

Many Americans anticipate making sacrifices due to climate change, with 23% expecting major sacrifices in their daily lives and 48% expecting minor ones. This expectation indicates a personal recognition of climate change’s tangible effects ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/10/25/how-americans-view-future-harms-from-climate-change-in-their-community-and-around-the-u-s/)).

### Emotional Reactions to Climate News

Emotions play a significant role in shaping public engagement. Seven in ten Americans report feeling sad about the state of the Earth when exposed to climate news, and 56% feel anxious about the future. However, only about 38-45% feel optimistic that climate change can be addressed effectively, indicating a gap between concern and hope ([Pew Research Center, 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/12/09/how-americans-view-climate-change-and-policies-to-address-the-issue/)).

Frustration is widespread, with 79% feeling frustrated by political disagreement on climate change, and 53% expressing suspicion toward groups advocating for climate action. This skepticism often stems from perceptions of politicization and distrust of motives, particularly among certain demographic groups and political affiliations ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/10/25/how-americans-view-future-harms-from-climate-change-in-their-community-and-around-the-u-s/)).

### Partisan and Ideological Divides

Political affiliation strongly influences climate change perceptions in the U.S. Democrats and Democratic-leaning individuals are more likely to believe in human-caused climate change, feel sadness and anxiety about it, and support climate policies. Conversely, Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals exhibit greater skepticism, with 56% believing climate policies hurt the economy and expressing suspicion toward climate advocates ([Pew Research Center, 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/12/09/how-americans-view-climate-change-and-policies-to-address-the-issue/)).

Despite these divides, frustration over political disagreement is shared across party lines, indicating a common desire for more unified and effective climate action ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/10/25/how-americans-view-future-harms-from-climate-change-in-their-community-and-around-the-u-s/)).

## Barriers to Urgency and Action

### Skepticism and Distrust

A notable segment of the population remains skeptical about the urgency of climate change. Interviews reveal that some individuals view climate change as a natural cycle rather than a human-driven crisis. Alarmist messaging emphasizing catastrophic outcomes can backfire, fostering distrust and disengagement among these groups ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/08/09/why-some-americans-do-not-see-urgency-on-climate-change/)).

This skepticism is often linked to perceptions of politicization and financial motives behind climate advocacy, leading some to dismiss calls for drastic policies as exaggerated or self-serving ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/08/09/why-some-americans-do-not-see-urgency-on-climate-change/)).

### Information and Trust in Science

While respect for climate scientists exists, many Americans express the need to scrutinize their motivations. Trust in news media is generally low, with many perceiving it as biased. This dynamic complicates efforts to communicate climate science effectively and build consensus on necessary actions ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/08/09/why-some-americans-do-not-see-urgency-on-climate-change/)).

## Global and Geopolitical Context

### Intersection with Geopolitics and Economic Concerns

The year 2025 is poised as a critical juncture for climate diplomacy and action. However, geopolitical tensions, nationalist policies, and economic uncertainties pose challenges to unified global efforts. Conflicts and crises divert attention and resources, potentially crowding out climate initiatives ([E3G, 2025](https://www.e3g.org/news/trends-in-climate-and-geopolitics-for-2025/)).

Despite these challenges, technological advancements in carbon capture, green hydrogen, and battery storage offer opportunities for progress. Public opinion favoring rapid fossil fuel transition and nature protection aligns with these technological pathways ([Global Center on Adaptation, 2025](https://gca.org/what-to-expect-in-climate-change-in-2025-opportunities-amid-challenges/)).

### Demographic Trends and Climate Adaptation

Demographic changes, including population growth and aging, influence both emissions and societies’ adaptive capacities. Policies targeting energy efficiency and green transitions must consider these demographic factors to be effective and equitable ([European Commission, 2023](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/demography-and-climate-change-new-study-explores-links-between-two-mega-trends-our-century-2023-06-05_en)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence from multiple robust and recent surveys indicates that a substantial majority of people worldwide are increasingly concerned about climate change, recognize its current and future harms, and support ambitious climate action. This consensus is particularly strong among younger generations and in regions experiencing acute climate impacts.

However, in countries like the United States, significant partisan divides and skepticism persist, fueled by distrust of media and political polarization. Emotional responses range from sadness and anxiety to frustration and suspicion, highlighting the complex psychological landscape surrounding climate communication.

Globally, geopolitical and economic challenges threaten to impede progress, but public demand for rapid transition from fossil fuels and enhanced nature protection provides a strong mandate for policymakers.

Given this comprehensive data, it is clear that climate change is a central concern for the global populace, and there is a robust foundation of public support for bold climate policies. Addressing skepticism through transparent communication, building trust in science, and framing climate action in terms of economic and social benefits will be crucial for converting concern into effective action.
