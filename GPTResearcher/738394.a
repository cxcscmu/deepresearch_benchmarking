# Report: Why Did Racial Discrimination Start?

## Introduction

Racial discrimination, defined as differential treatment based on perceived racial or ethnic group membership, remains a pervasive social issue worldwide. Understanding why racial discrimination started requires an exploration of historical, social, economic, and scientific developments that shaped the modern concept of race and institutionalized racial hierarchies. This report provides a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the origins of racial discrimination, drawing on recent and reliable scholarly sources, historical records, and contemporary analyses. It aims to elucidate the complex factors that led to the emergence of racial discrimination, its evolution, and its enduring legacy.

## The Origins of Racial Discrimination

### Pre-Modern Context: Prejudice Without Race

For much of human history, societies recognized physical and cultural differences among peoples but did not classify humans rigidly into racial categories as understood today. Prejudice, ethnocentrism, and social exclusion existed, often based on religion, tribe, or nationality rather than race. For example, in medieval societies, conflicts and discrimination were frequently rooted in religious differences, such as Christians enslaving non-Christians or Muslims owning slaves from enemy tribes (University of Notre Dame, 2024). However, these distinctions did not crystallize into the modern racial hierarchies that define racial discrimination today.

### The Transatlantic Slave Trade and the Construction of Race

The modern concept of race and racial discrimination is closely tied to the Transatlantic Slave Trade beginning in the 16th century. This period marked a pivotal shift where white Europeans and Americans constructed the idea of “race” as a social and biological category to justify the enslavement of Africans. Slavery had existed before, but moral concerns about enslaving humans led to the need for a new ideological justification as the demand for enslaved labor increased in the 17th century. White Europeans developed a racial hierarchy that placed white people at the top and Black people at the bottom, arguing that certain groups were “naturally” meant to be enslaved (The Global Humanitarian, 2024; Human Rights Careers, 2024).

This racial ideology was reinforced through pseudoscientific theories and religious doctrines. Scientists and philosophers of the time sought physical, non-religious explanations for human differences, leading to the creation of racial categories that were falsely presented as immutable and biologically based (Human Rights Careers, 2024). These ideas served to legitimize slavery and colonial exploitation by portraying Black people and other non-European groups as inferior and destined for subjugation.

### Scientific Racism and Eugenics

The 18th and 19th centuries saw the formalization of scientific racism, where scholars used emerging scientific methods to classify humans into hierarchical racial groups. This period witnessed the rise of craniometry, anthropometry, and other measurement techniques aimed at proving the superiority of Europeans. Figures such as Samuel Morton and Josiah Nott promoted polygenism—the idea that different races had distinct origins—which further entrenched racial hierarchies (Britannica, 2025).

Scientific racism was not merely an academic exercise but a political and ideological project that supported European colonial dominance and the transatlantic slave trade. It revived older hierarchical paradigms like the Great Chain of Being to argue that racial inequalities were natural and divinely ordained (Britannica, 2025). Eugenics, a movement emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extended these ideas by promoting “racial purity” and Aryan superiority, which justified discriminatory policies and atrocities, including those perpetrated by the Nazis (University of Notre Dame, 2024).

### Colonialism and the Institutionalization of Racial Discrimination

Colonialism further entrenched racial discrimination by establishing rigid racial hierarchies and Eurocentric dominance across colonized regions. The doctrine of the “civilizing mission” rationalized European domination over “inferior” races, embedding racial discrimination into political, economic, and social institutions (University of Sheffield, 2024). Colonial powers in Africa, Asia, and the Americas created systems that privileged Europeans and marginalized indigenous and African populations, laying the groundwork for systemic racial inequalities that persist today.

Colorism, a form of prejudice based on skin tone within racial groups, also emerged during colonial times, complicating racial dynamics in places like Latin America and Africa (University of Sheffield, 2024). The legacy of colonialism continues to shape contemporary racial discrimination through institutional racism, cultural hegemony, and economic disparities.

## The Evolution and Persistence of Racial Discrimination

### Post-Slavery Developments

Although slavery was abolished in the 19th century, racial discrimination did not end. Instead, it evolved into new forms such as segregation, discriminatory laws, and institutional barriers. In the United States, the Jim Crow era codified racial segregation and inequality, while apartheid in South Africa institutionalized racial discrimination on a national scale (The Global Humanitarian, 2024; Britannica, 2025).

Systemic racism became a focus of scholarly investigation in the late 20th century, highlighting how racial inequalities are embedded in institutions affecting wealth, education, healthcare, and civil rights (Britannica, 2025). Movements like the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. and anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa challenged these systems but did not fully eradicate racial discrimination.

### Contemporary Manifestations

Today, racial discrimination manifests in both overt and subtle forms, including microaggressions, stereotypes, and institutional biases. The rise of “new racism” or “differentialist racism” reflects changing patterns of discrimination that often operate under the guise of cultural or national differences rather than explicit racial animus (University of Sheffield, 2024).

Movements such as Black Lives Matter underscore the ongoing reality of racialized violence and systemic discrimination, particularly in criminal justice, employment, education, and healthcare (University of Sheffield, 2024). Despite legal advances like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, racial disparities remain deeply entrenched in many societies, including the United States (EBSCO Research Starters, 2024).

## Concrete Opinion and Analysis

Based on the comprehensive review of historical and contemporary sources, it is clear that racial discrimination started as a deliberate social and ideological construct designed to justify economic exploitation and political domination. The Transatlantic Slave Trade was the critical historical juncture where racial categories were invented and codified to legitimize slavery and colonialism. Scientific racism and eugenics provided a veneer of legitimacy to these hierarchies, embedding racial discrimination into the fabric of Western thought and institutions.

Colonialism expanded and institutionalized racial discrimination globally, creating systems of inequality that persist today. The persistence of racial discrimination is not an accidental byproduct of human prejudice but the outcome of centuries of deliberate policies, scientific rationalizations, and institutional practices designed to maintain racial hierarchies.

Therefore, racial discrimination started as a tool of economic and political power, constructed through pseudoscientific and religious justifications, and reinforced by colonial and institutional structures. Understanding this origin is crucial for addressing its contemporary manifestations and working toward genuine racial justice.

## Conclusion

Racial discrimination began as a constructed ideology to justify slavery and colonial exploitation, rooted in the invention of race during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. It was reinforced by scientific racism, eugenics, and colonial policies that institutionalized racial hierarchies. Despite abolition and civil rights advancements, racial discrimination has evolved and persists through systemic and institutional forms. Recognizing the deliberate origins and mechanisms of racial discrimination is essential for dismantling its enduring legacy and promoting equity.
