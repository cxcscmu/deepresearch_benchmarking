# The Roles of Government Bodies in Determining Fiscal Policy: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Fiscal policy is a critical economic tool used by governments to influence a nation's economy through taxation and spending decisions. In the United States, the determination and implementation of fiscal policy involve multiple government bodies, primarily the executive and legislative branches, with indirect influence from other entities such as the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the roles of these government bodies in shaping fiscal policy, their interactions, and the broader implications of their decisions on the economy. The report also offers a reasoned perspective on the sustainability and challenges of current U.S. fiscal policy.

## Defining Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy refers to government actions involving taxation and spending to influence economic activity, stabilize the business cycle, and promote growth and employment. Rooted in Keynesian economic theory, fiscal policy can be expansionary (increasing spending or reducing taxes) to stimulate growth or contractionary to cool down an overheating economy ([Investopedia, 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/who-sets-fiscal-policy-president-or-congress.asp)).

## Key Government Bodies Involved in Fiscal Policy

### 1. The Executive Branch

The executive branch, led by the President, plays a pivotal role in initiating fiscal policy. The President, advised by the Secretary of the Treasury and economic advisors, proposes an annual federal budget that outlines spending priorities and anticipated tax revenues for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins on October 1. This budget serves as a fiscal policy blueprint, signaling the administration's economic priorities, such as defense, education, and health care, and indicating whether the government plans to run a deficit or surplus ([Investopedia, 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/who-sets-fiscal-policy-president-or-congress.asp); [The Policy Circle, 2025](https://www.thepolicycircle.org/briefs/the-executive-branch/)).

The President also has the authority to sign or veto fiscal legislation passed by Congress, thus influencing the final shape of fiscal policy. Moreover, the executive branch can use regulatory agencies to implement policies indirectly affecting fiscal outcomes, as seen in historical examples where presidents have used executive actions to address policy gaps when Congress was gridlocked ([The Policy Circle, 2025](https://www.thepolicycircle.org/briefs/the-executive-branch/)).

### 2. The Legislative Branch (Congress)

Congress holds the constitutional power to enact laws related to taxation and government spending, making it a central actor in fiscal policy. Once the President submits the budget proposal, Congress develops budget resolutions that set spending and tax parameters. Subsequently, appropriations bills allocate funds to specific government programs and initiatives. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve these bills, which require the President's signature to become law ([Investopedia, 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/who-sets-fiscal-policy-president-or-congress.asp)).

Congress's role is not merely procedural; it involves deliberation, negotiation, and political balancing to reconcile competing interests and priorities. This process ensures that fiscal policy reflects a broader consensus or compromise among elected representatives, which can sometimes lead to delays or stalemates, impacting economic predictability ([Peachy Tutors, 2025](https://peachytutors.com/the-roles-of-government-bodies-in-determining-fiscal-policy-and-their-effects-on-the-economy/)).

### 3. The Federal Reserve (The Fed)

While the Federal Reserve does not directly set fiscal policy, it plays an influential indirect role. The Fed is responsible for monetary policy, which involves managing interest rates and the money supply to achieve macroeconomic objectives such as price stability and maximum employment. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regularly assesses fiscal policy developments to understand their potential impact on economic growth, inflation, and employment, adjusting monetary policy accordingly ([Federal Reserve, 2025](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12855.htm)).

The Fed's independence from political influence allows it to operate based on economic data and projections, but its policy decisions can complement or counteract fiscal measures. For example, excessive fiscal deficits may lead to inflationary pressures that the Fed might address through tighter monetary policy ([L&Y Tax Advisor, 2025](https://lytaxadvisors.com/blog/monetary-policy-vs-fiscal-policy/)).

### 4. The Department of the Treasury

The Treasury Department manages the federal government's finances, including issuing debt to finance deficits and servicing existing debt. It plays a technical but vital role in implementing fiscal policy by ensuring the government's financial operations run smoothly. The Treasury also provides economic analysis and advice to the President and Congress, influencing policy formulation ([Peachy Tutors, 2025](https://peachytutors.com/the-roles-of-government-bodies-in-determining-fiscal-policy-and-their-effects-on-the-economy/)).

### 5. The Judicial Branch

Although not directly involved in fiscal policy formulation, the judicial branch can impact fiscal policy by ruling on the constitutionality of laws related to taxation and spending. Courts may uphold, amend, or strike down fiscal measures, thereby shaping the legal framework within which fiscal policy operates ([Investopedia, 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/who-sets-fiscal-policy-president-or-congress.asp)).

## Fiscal Policy Process and Interactions

The fiscal policy process begins with the President's budget proposal, which reflects the administration's priorities and economic outlook. Congress then reviews, modifies, and approves the budget through resolutions and appropriations. The President's approval or veto power serves as a final check.

This tandem operation ensures a system of checks and balances, preventing unilateral fiscal decisions. However, it also means that political disagreements can delay or complicate fiscal policy implementation, sometimes resulting in the absence of a formal budget, which creates uncertainty for markets and economic agents ([Investopedia, 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/who-sets-fiscal-policy-president-or-congress.asp)).

The Federal Reserve monitors these developments closely, adjusting monetary policy to maintain economic stability. For example, if fiscal policy is expansionary, leading to higher growth and inflation, the Fed may raise interest rates to prevent overheating. Conversely, contractionary fiscal policy might prompt the Fed to lower rates to stimulate demand ([Federal Reserve, 2025](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12855.htm)).

## Effects of Fiscal Policy on the Economy

Fiscal policy directly affects production and employment. Expansionary fiscal policy, characterized by increased government spending and tax cuts, stimulates aggregate demand, leading to higher production and job creation. For instance, government investment in infrastructure not only creates construction jobs but also enhances productivity by improving transportation and logistics ([Peachy Tutors, 2025](https://peachytutors.com/the-roles-of-government-bodies-in-determining-fiscal-policy-and-their-effects-on-the-economy/)).

Conversely, contractionary fiscal policy, involving reduced spending or higher taxes, can slow economic activity to control inflation but may also increase unemployment if applied excessively.

Fiscal policy also plays a role in income redistribution through taxation and transfer payments, aiming to reduce poverty and promote social equity ([Wikipedia, 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy_of_the_United_States)).

## Challenges and Sustainability of U.S. Fiscal Policy

The U.S. fiscal policy faces significant challenges, primarily due to rising federal debt and persistent budget deficits. The debt held by the public has been growing faster than the economy, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), a sustainable fiscal policy requires that public debt grows at the same or slower rate than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to avoid increasing borrowing costs and economic risks ([GAO, 2025](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107714)).

Experts from institutions like the Hoover Institution emphasize the need for fiscal restraint and policy reforms to prevent economic stagnation similar to Japan's experience with prolonged low growth and artificially low interest rates. They warn that continued high deficits could lead to higher interest rates, crowding out private investment, and slowing wage growth ([Hoover Institution, 2025](https://www.hoover.org/research/us-fiscal-policy-sustainable-challenges-facing-us-economy)).

The Federal Reserve's role is also critical, as its monetary policy can either mitigate or exacerbate fiscal imbalances. The Fed's purchases of Treasury bonds have kept interest rates low, enabling sustained government borrowing, but this may not be sustainable in the long run ([Hoover Institution, 2025](https://www.hoover.org/research/us-fiscal-policy-sustainable-challenges-facing-us-economy)).

## Opinion and Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of authoritative sources, it is evident that fiscal policy in the United States is a complex interplay of multiple government bodies, each with distinct but interrelated roles. The President and Congress jointly determine fiscal policy through budget proposals, legislation, and appropriations, while the Federal Reserve indirectly influences fiscal outcomes through monetary policy adjustments.

The current trajectory of U.S. fiscal policy, characterized by large deficits and growing debt, poses significant risks to economic stability and growth. Without a strategic and coordinated approach to fiscal restraint and reform, the nation may face higher borrowing costs, reduced investment, and slower wage growth, undermining long-term prosperity.

Therefore, it is imperative for policymakers in both the executive and legislative branches to collaborate on sustainable fiscal strategies that balance short-term economic support with long-term fiscal health. The Federal Reserve's independent monetary policy should continue to complement these efforts by maintaining price stability and maximum employment.

In conclusion, the determination of fiscal policy in the U.S. is a shared responsibility that requires prudent governance, informed decision-making, and a commitment to economic sustainability.
