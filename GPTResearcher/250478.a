# The Impact of Birth Order on Personality: A Comprehensive Review

## Introduction

The question of whether birth order influences personality has intrigued psychologists, researchers, and the general public for over a century. The theory posits that the order in which a child is born within a family—firstborn, middle child, youngest, or only child—may shape their personality traits, behavior, and even intelligence. This concept, initially popularized by Alfred Adler in the early 20th century, has since been the subject of extensive empirical research, yet findings remain inconclusive and often contradictory.

This report aims to provide a detailed, evidence-based examination of how birth order affects personality, drawing on the most recent and methodologically robust studies. It will explore theoretical foundations, empirical findings, methodological challenges, and the current consensus in the field, concluding with a reasoned opinion based on the available evidence.

## Theoretical Background

Alfred Adler, the founder of individual psychology, was among the first to suggest that birth order plays a significant role in personality development. He theorized that firstborns often assume leadership roles and are more conscientious, while later-born children might develop traits such as sociability and rebelliousness as adaptive strategies within the family dynamic. Frank Sulloway later expanded on this with his Family Niche Theory, suggesting that siblings adapt to different roles to reduce competition, which could lead to systematic personality differences based on birth order (Rohrer, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2015).

The Big Five personality traits—extraversion, emotional stability (neuroticism), agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience—are commonly used to operationalize personality in research. The hypothesis is that birth order influences these traits by shaping the social niches siblings occupy within the family system.

## Empirical Evidence on Birth Order and Personality

### Intelligence and Birth Order

Research consistently shows a small but statistically significant effect of birth order on intelligence. Firstborns tend to score higher on psychometric intelligence tests compared to their later-born siblings, with a slight decline observed in subsequent siblings (Rohrer et al., 2015). This effect is modest, approximately 10% of a standard deviation, but robust across large, representative samples from the United States, Great Britain, and Germany.

### Personality Traits and Birth Order

Contrary to popular belief and early theoretical claims, recent large-scale studies have found little to no meaningful effect of birth order on the Big Five personality traits. Rohrer et al. (2015) analyzed data from over 14,000 individuals across three countries using both between-family and within-family designs. Their results indicated no significant birth order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or openness to experience. These findings challenge earlier studies that reported substantial differences but often suffered from methodological limitations such as small sample sizes, reliance on self-reports from a single sibling, and failure to control for confounding variables.

### Methodological Considerations

One major reason for inconsistent findings in birth order research is the methodological approach. Between-family designs, which compare individuals from different families, are prone to confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, family size, and genetic differences. Within-family designs, which compare siblings within the same family, control better for these confounds but have historically been limited by small samples and potential biases in personality assessments.

Rohrer et al. (2015) addressed these issues by using large, representative samples and independent self-reports from multiple siblings within families. They also controlled for age differences, which is critical since older siblings naturally tend to be more mature at the time of assessment, potentially skewing results.

### The Role of Psychological Birth Order and Family Dynamics

Beyond numerical birth order, psychological birth order—the subjective experience and interpretation of one's birth position—may influence personality development. For example, an individual may identify with traits typically associated with a different birth order position due to family circumstances or parental treatment (JWU Online, 2025). Additionally, parenting styles often differ with each child, potentially affecting personality outcomes independently of birth order.

## Critical Analysis and Discussion

### The Small Effect Size and Practical Significance

While the intelligence advantage of firstborns is statistically significant, its practical impact is modest. For example, despite the average IQ decline from firstborns to later-borns, in about 40% of sibling pairs, the later-born sibling may still outperform the firstborn. This suggests that birth order is one of many factors influencing intelligence and personality, with individual variation playing a substantial role.

### Challenging Popular Stereotypes

Common stereotypes—such as firstborns being leaders and conscientious, middle children being peacemakers, and youngest children being rebellious or creative—are not strongly supported by empirical data. Large-scale, methodologically rigorous studies fail to find consistent patterns aligning with these stereotypes (Rohrer et al., 2015; Scientific American, 2019).

### Alternative Influences on Personality

Genetics, shared family environment, socioeconomic status, and unique experiences outside the family (e.g., peer groups, education) have been found to exert more substantial influences on personality development than birth order. Parents may also adapt their parenting based on each child's temperament rather than birth order per se, further complicating the causal relationship.

## Conclusion

Based on the current state of research, birth order appears to have a negligible effect on broad personality traits as measured by the Big Five. The only consistent and modest effect is observed in intelligence, where firstborns tend to score slightly higher than their later-born siblings. However, the effect size is small, and individual differences often overshadow birth order influences.

The longstanding belief that birth order shapes personality in meaningful and predictable ways is not supported by the most rigorous and comprehensive empirical evidence available today. Instead, personality development is better understood as a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and individual factors, with birth order playing a minimal role.

### Opinion

Given the weight of evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that while birth order may contribute subtly to intelligence differences, it does not have a meaningful or lasting impact on personality traits. Parents, educators, and psychologists should be cautious about attributing personality characteristics to birth order alone and instead consider a broader range of influences when understanding individual differences.
