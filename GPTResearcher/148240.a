## Introduction

Despite being executed over a century ago, the question persists: Is the study of Rizal still significant in contemporary times? This report aims to provide an in-depth, objective, and comprehensive analysis of the relevance of studying Rizal today, drawing from a wide range of scholarly sources, historical analyses, and contemporary reflections. It evaluates Rizal’s educational philosophy, nationalist advocacy, literary contributions, and moral legacy in the context of the Philippines' current socio-political landscape.

## Historical Context and Rizal’s Legacy

José Rizal was born in 1861 during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. He was a polymath—an intellectual, writer, physician, and reformist—who used his writings to expose the injustices of Spanish rule and to awaken Filipino nationalism. His two seminal novels, *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo*, unveiled the social inequalities and abuses perpetrated by the colonial government and the friars, inspiring a generation of reformists and revolutionaries ([Navigating Rizal's Legacy, 2025](https://www.academia.edu/113377780/Navigating_Rizals_Legacy_Unveiling_Complexities_in_Philippine_History)).

Rizal’s approach to colonial resistance was strategic and nonviolent, emphasizing education, intellectual discourse, and peaceful reform over armed conflict. He founded the Liga Filipina, an organization aimed at uniting Filipinos for social reforms, and his exile to Dapitan marked a period of continued advocacy through education and community development ([The Influence of Jose Rizal’s Literary Works in 21st Century, 2025](https://www.academia.edu/82489283/The_Influence_of_Jose_Rizals_Literary_Works_in_21st_Century)).

## The Mandate to Study Rizal: Republic Act 1425

The Philippine government institutionalized the study of Rizal’s life and works through Republic Act 1425, known as the Rizal Law. This law mandates the inclusion of Rizal’s novels and biography in the curricula of all public and private schools, colleges, and universities. The objective is to promote nationalism and develop a nationalistic consciousness among Filipinos by understanding the historical context of the 19th century and Rizal’s role in the Philippine revolution ([Navigating Rizal's Legacy, 2025](https://www.academia.edu/113377780/Navigating_Rizals_Legacy_Unveiling_Complexities_in_Philippine_History)).

The law’s enduring relevance is underscored by the continuing challenges faced by the Philippines, including corruption, social inequality, environmental degradation, and threats to democratic institutions. Rizal’s emphasis on education as the foundation for societal transformation remains a guiding principle for addressing these issues ([Jose Rizal’s continuing relevance: Guiding light to Filipino nation, 2024](https://mb.com.ph/2024/12/30/jose-rizal-s-continuing-relevance-guiding-light-to-filipino-nation)).

## Rizal’s Educational Philosophy and Its Contemporary Relevance

Rizal believed that education and enlightenment were the primary instruments for social and political change. His educational philosophy advocated for the development of critical thinking, moral integrity, and national pride among the youth. He famously stated, "The youth is the hope of the fatherland," highlighting his conviction that the younger generation holds the key to the nation’s future ([The Legacy of Rizal's Educational Philosophy, 2025](https://www.academia.edu/124614996/_The_Legacy_of_Rizals_Educational_Philosophy_Its_Relevance_in_Contemporary_Philippine_Education_Prepared_by)).

In contemporary times, Rizal’s educational ideals continue to resonate. The Philippines faces modern challenges such as digital misinformation, economic neocolonialism, and environmental crises. Rizal’s insistence on intellectual rigor and moral leadership provides a blueprint for cultivating informed and responsible citizens capable of critical engagement with these issues ([Jose Rizal’s continuing relevance: Guiding light to Filipino nation, 2024](https://mb.com.ph/2024/12/30/jose-rizal-s-continuing-relevance-guiding-light-to-filipino-nation)).

## Rizal’s Literary Works as Tools for Social Change

Rizal’s novels remain powerful tools for social critique and nationalist expression. *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo* exposed systemic injustices and inspired both reformists and revolutionaries. These works are not merely historical artifacts but continue to be relevant in understanding the roots of social inequality and the importance of civic engagement ([The Influence of Jose Rizal’s Literary Works in 21st Century, 2025](https://www.academia.edu/82489283/The_Influence_of_Jose_Rizals_Literary_Works_in_21st_Century)).

Contemporary educators and scholars emphasize that Rizal’s writings encourage critical reflection on governance, social justice, and human rights. They serve as a reminder that meaningful change requires both immediate action and long-term cultural shifts ([Jose Rizal’s continuing relevance: Guiding light to Filipino nation, 2024](https://mb.com.ph/2024/12/30/jose-rizal-s-continuing-relevance-guiding-light-to-filipino-nation)).

## Rizal’s Moral and Nationalistic Legacy

Rizal’s advocacy for peaceful reform, moral advancement, and national unity remains a cornerstone of Philippine nationalism. His life exemplifies resilience, intellectual courage, and compassion for fellow Filipinos. These qualities continue to inspire Filipinos to strive for justice, liberty, and patriotism ([Rizal in The Contemporary Era, 2025](https://www.scribd.com/document/669447781/RIZAL-IN-THE-CONTEMPORARY-ERA-RELEVANCE-OF-DR-RIZALS-LIFE-AND-WORKS-TO-THE-PRESENT-GENERATION)).

Critics sometimes argue that Rizal’s reformist approach lacks the immediacy required to address today’s urgent social problems. However, this critique overlooks the depth of Rizal’s strategy, which combined intellectual resistance with laying the groundwork for revolutionary change. His legacy is not static but dynamic, offering principles that can be adapted to contemporary struggles ([Jose Rizal’s continuing relevance: Guiding light to Filipino nation, 2024](https://mb.com.ph/2024/12/30/jose-rizal-s-continuing-relevance-guiding-light-to-filipino-nation)).
