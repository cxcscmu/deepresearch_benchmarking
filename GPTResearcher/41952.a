#### 1.3 Funding and Institutional Support

Science requires substantial funding, and societal institutions such as governments, universities, and private organizations act as enablers or constrainers of scientific research. The allocation of resources is often influenced by societal values and political agendas. For instance, the German Ministry for Education and Research emphasizes integrating dialogue with society into scientific reputation, highlighting the increasing importance of societal impact in science governance ([Bornmann, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8281339/)).

#### 1.4 Science as a Social Good and Capacity Building

Scientific knowledge is recognized as an irreducibly social good, meaning its value is deeply embedded in social contexts and institutions. This recognition shifts the focus from mere access to knowledge toward building capacities within societies to generate and use scientific knowledge effectively. Strengthening institutional and governance processes alongside technical skills is essential for sustainable scientific development ([De Oliveira et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6591180/)).

### 3. The Mutual Shaping of Science and Society

#### 3.1 The Two-Way Relationship

The interplay between science and society is bidirectional and mutually constitutive. Society shapes science by inspiring research questions and funding priorities, while science shapes society through technological and conceptual innovations. This mutual shaping is evident in the development and use of technologies, scientific labor’s socialization, and the evolving cultural context of scientific practice ([Davies, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04617-1); [Cabinian, 2025](https://www.scribd.com/document/557154380/How-did-society-shape-science-and-how-did-science-shape-society)).

#### 3.2 Science Studies and Sociological Perspectives

Since the early 20th century, the field of science studies has explored this relationship, emphasizing how social, economic, and political factors influence scientific knowledge production. Pioneers like Boris Hessen and Robert King Merton highlighted the social context of scientific work, including the “Matthew effect,” which describes how recognition and resources tend to accumulate among already prominent scientists ([Davies, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04617-1)).

#### 3.3 Research Culture and Responsible Innovation

The culture within scientific communities affects how science is conducted and communicated. A positive research culture promotes openness, cooperation, and ethical responsibility, aligning scientific progress with societal needs. Frameworks like Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) encourage engagement with diverse stakeholders, including policymakers and the public, to ensure ethical, legal, and social considerations are integrated into research processes ([De Oliveira et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8380464/)).
