# Report on Legislative Steps to Address Court Delay in the United States

## Introduction

Court delay and backlog have long been significant challenges in the U.S. judicial system, affecting the timely delivery of justice and public confidence in legal institutions. The problem is multifaceted, involving increasing caseloads, workforce shortages, and procedural inefficiencies. This report examines the legislative measures taken to address court delays, drawing on recent studies, legislative initiatives, and expert analyses. The focus is on concrete legislative actions, their rationale, and their potential impact, supported by relevant data and expert commentary.

## Scope and Significance of Court Delays

Recent surveys and reports highlight the severity of court delays across federal, state, county, and municipal levels. According to a 2023 Thomson Reuters Institute study, 79% of judges and court professionals reported hearing delays exceeding 15 minutes, primarily due to failures to appear, workforce shortages, and stagnant or reduced staffing budgets ([Weiss, 2023](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/us-court-system-is-facing-perfect-storm-of-delays-backlogs-and-workforce-shortages-report-says)). Backlogs have increased in 44% of courts over two years, with caseloads rising in 45% of jurisdictions. These delays have cascading effects including prolonged pretrial detention, increased costs, and diminished public trust.

## Legislative Responses to Court Delay

### 1. Expansion of Judicial Capacity: The JUDGES Act of 2024

One of the most direct legislative responses to court delays is the Judicial Understaffing Delays Getting Emergencies Solved (JUDGES) Act of 2024. Passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2024, this bipartisan bill proposes adding 63 permanent federal judgeships over a decade, targeting the most understaffed and backlogged federal court districts ([Houston Daily, 2024](https://houstondaily.com/stories/666911824-house-passes-judges-act-to-tackle-federal-court-backlog)).

- **Rationale:** The bill addresses judicial vacancies primarily caused by retirements and aims to realign judicial resources with growing caseloads.
- **Scope:** Besides permanent judgeships, it authorizes temporary district court judgeships in Oklahoma and additional case locations in Utah, Texas, and California.
- **Challenges:** Despite bipartisan support in Congress, the Biden Administration threatened to veto the bill, citing political concerns, which could delay implementation.

While increasing the number of judges is a necessary step, experts caution that it alone cannot resolve systemic delays, especially at state and local levels where the majority of cases are handled.

### 2. Legislative Reforms to Court Procedures and Discovery Processes

At the state level, legislative reforms have targeted procedural inefficiencies that contribute to delays. For example, New York State has introduced discovery reforms aimed at enhancing fairness but inadvertently created incentives for delaying discovery challenges, leading to case dismissals on technicalities ([Governor Kathy Hochul, 2025](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-proposals-combat-crime-and-strengthen-criminal-justice-system)).

- **Proposed Changes:** Governor Hochul has proposed amendments to eliminate incentives for delaying discovery challenges and to ensure proportional responses to discovery errors.
- **Expected Impact:** These reforms aim to reduce unnecessary delays that keep individuals incarcerated pretrial and prevent dismissals unrelated to case merits, thereby improving case processing times.

Additionally, New York's court system is implementing common-sense legislative measures such as improving discovery oversight, accelerating pretrial hearings, deploying personnel to resolve case obstacles, and establishing firm trial dates ([Zayas, 2024](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2024/10/11/new-yorks-court-system-says-more-work-is-needed-to-clear-up-case-delays/)).

### 3. Legislative Encouragement of Specialized Courts and Alternative Dispute Resolution

Legislatures have also promoted the use of specialized court programs and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to reduce caseloads and delays:

- **Specialized Courts:** Drug courts, veterans’ courts, and mental health courts help divert cases from traditional dockets, reducing backlog and addressing underlying issues more effectively ([Settles, 2024](https://patimes.org/justice-delayed-the-growing-impact-of-judicial-backlogs/)).
- **Restorative Justice Programs:** These programs reduce the burden on prosecution, public defense, and corrections resources, contributing to more efficient case resolution.

Such legislative initiatives recognize that reducing the number of cases reaching trial is a critical component of delay reduction.

### 4. Legislative Support for Technological Investments

While not always direct legislation, many legislative bodies have supported funding and policies encouraging courts to invest in technology that streamlines processes:

- **Remote Hearings:** Legislation has facilitated the adoption of virtual hearings, which 81% of courts now use to improve access and reduce delays ([Weiss, 2023](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/us-court-system-is-facing-perfect-storm-of-delays-backlogs-and-workforce-shortages-report-says)).
- **Digital Evidence Management:** Laws and funding have supported courts in implementing digital evidence systems that reduce administrative burdens and prevent delays caused by missing evidence ([Thomson Reuters Legal Blog, 2023](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/how-to-mitigate-court-system-roadblocks/)).
- **Legal Research Tools:** Legislative backing for modern legal research technologies helps judges make faster, more confident decisions, reducing decision-making delays.

### 5. Legislative Adjustments to Jurisdiction and Case Flow Management

Some legislative efforts have focused on altering court jurisdiction and case management rules to reduce the number of cases handled by overburdened courts:

- **Jurisdictional Changes:** Legislatures have enacted laws such as decriminalization and “no-fault” legislation to reduce causes of action in courts ([Peters, n.d.](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/introduction-and-outline-some-problems-court-delay-crime-control)).
- **Encouraging Settlements and Diversion:** Laws promote settlements, guilty pleas, and diversion to noncourt forums to lessen trial caseloads.
- **Controlled Case Flow Management:** Legislation supports early and continuous court control of cases, scheduling events within short time limits, and accommodating attorneys’ schedules to ensure predictability and reduce delays ([Friesen, 1984](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/cures-court-congestion-state-art-court-delay-reduction)).

### 6. Legislative Emphasis on Data-Driven and Experimental Approaches

Modern legislative strategies encourage controlled experimentation and rigorous evaluation of delay reduction programs:

- **Data-Driven Scheduling:** Research shows that adjusting judicial time allocation between early and later case stages can reduce delays by up to 65% without adding judges ([Bakshi et al., 2024](https://phys.org/news/2025-04-court-backlogs-clogging.html)).
- **Legislative Support for Innovation:** Legislatures have supported pilot programs and funding for innovative scheduling and case management techniques to improve court efficiency.

## Critical Analysis and Opinion

While legislative efforts have made important strides in addressing court delays, the problem remains complex and multifactorial. The JUDGES Act represents a significant federal legislative commitment to increasing judicial capacity, but its impact will be limited if not complemented by procedural reforms and technological investments. State-level reforms, such as New York’s discovery process amendments and specialized court programs, demonstrate a more holistic approach by targeting procedural bottlenecks and alternative dispute resolution.

Moreover, the adoption of technology, supported by legislative funding and policies, is crucial for modernizing court operations and reducing administrative delays. However, technology alone cannot solve workforce shortages or systemic inefficiencies without corresponding legislative and administrative reforms.

The research on judicial time management highlights an often-overlooked aspect: smarter scheduling can dramatically reduce delays without additional resources. Legislatures should prioritize funding and policies that encourage courts to adopt data-driven scheduling and case flow management techniques.

In conclusion, the most effective legislative approach to court delay combines:

- Increasing judicial capacity where necessary (e.g., JUDGES Act),
- Reforming procedural rules to eliminate unnecessary delays,
- Promoting specialized courts and alternative dispute resolution,
- Supporting technological modernization,
- Encouraging data-driven and experimental management of court resources.

This multifaceted strategy acknowledges the complexity of court delays and leverages legislative power to create systemic improvements rather than piecemeal fixes.
