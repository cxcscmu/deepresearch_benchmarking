# To What Extent Do Conservatives Agree on Society? — A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Conservatism, as a political and social philosophy, encompasses a range of views about society, its structure, and its evolution. While conservatives broadly share certain fundamental beliefs—such as the importance of order, tradition, and hierarchy—there are significant nuances and disagreements within the ideology regarding the nature of society and its governance. This report explores the extent of agreement among conservatives on society, drawing from authoritative sources and scholarly analyses. It aims to provide a detailed, objective, and well-structured examination of conservative perspectives on society, highlighting areas of consensus and divergence.

## Core Conservative Beliefs About Society

### 1. Society as an Organic Whole

A foundational conservative belief is that society is an **organic entity** that evolves naturally over time to meet the needs of its members. This concept, deeply influenced by Edmund Burke, emphasizes gradual change and continuity rather than abrupt, revolutionary transformations. Burke famously described society as a contract "not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born" ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/organic-society-state-conservatism)).

This organic view implies that society is composed of interdependent parts—families, communities, institutions—that develop spontaneously and should be preserved to maintain social stability. Conservatives generally reject abstract, idealistic attempts to reorder society radically, warning that such efforts often lead to chaos, as exemplified by Burke’s critique of the French Revolution ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

### 2. The Necessity of Hierarchy

Another key tenet is the belief in **natural hierarchy** within society. Conservatives argue that societies are inherently stratified, with individuals occupying different social strata based on birth, ability, or achievement. This hierarchy is seen as functional and necessary for social order. Edmund Burke defended the authority of the ruling classes, claiming they govern disinterestedly and possess accumulated wisdom passed down through generations ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

Hierarchy is not viewed as oppressive but as a framework within which individuals have roles and responsibilities. Conservatives emphasize the importance of recognizing obligations tied to one's social status to ensure societal cohesion. Burke’s metaphor of “loving the little platoon in society to which we belong” encapsulates this sense of belonging and duty ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

### 3. Opposition to Revolution and Support for Evolution

Conservatives agree on the rejection of **revolutionary change**, favoring instead **evolutionary development** of society. The principle of “evolution, not revolution” underscores the conservative preference for incremental reform based on empirical experience rather than abstract theory ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

This evolutionary approach supports the idea that society can and should adapt to changing circumstances but only through processes that respect tradition and accumulated wisdom. The organic society concept reinforces this, suggesting that social institutions and norms evolve naturally rather than being engineered ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/organic-society-state-conservatism)).

## Areas of Agreement Among Conservatives on Society

### 1. The Importance of Tradition and Continuity

Across conservative thought, there is a strong consensus on the **value of tradition** as a guide for social order. Tradition embodies the collective wisdom of past generations and serves as a stabilizing force. Conservatives argue that breaking with tradition risks undermining social cohesion and leads to unintended consequences ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

### 2. The Role of the Family and Small Communities

Traditional conservatives emphasize society as a collection of **small communities or “little platoons”**, such as families and local groups, which form the building blocks of society. These communities are seen as organic, naturally arising, and vital for nurturing social responsibility and moral values ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/differences-and-conflict-within-conservatism)).

The family, in particular, is viewed as a cornerstone of social stability, a view reinforced by both traditional conservatives and neoconservatives, albeit with some differences in emphasis ([academia.edu, 2021](https://www.academia.edu/61427654/Roundtable_Review_Melinda_Cooper_Family_Values_Between_Neoliberalism_and_the_New_Social_Conservatism)).

### 3. Recognition of Human Imperfection

Conservatives broadly agree on a **pessimistic or realistic view of human nature**, acknowledging human imperfection and limitations. This view justifies the need for social order, hierarchy, and strong institutions to manage inherent human flaws. Hobbes’ idea that life without the state would be “nasty, brutish, and short” is foundational here ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/to-what-extent-do-conservatives-agree-about-the-role-of-the-state)).

### 4. The Necessity of the State for Social Order

There is broad agreement that the **state plays a crucial role in maintaining social order and stability**. Traditional conservatives advocate for a paternalistic state led by a natural ruling class, while neo-conservatives emphasize law enforcement and societal cohesion. Even neo-liberals, despite advocating minimal state intervention, recognize the state’s role in protecting liberty and order ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/to-what-extent-do-conservatives-agree-about-the-role-of-the-state)).

## Areas of Disagreement Among Conservatives on Society

### 1. The Basis and Nature of Hierarchy

While conservatives agree on the existence of hierarchy, there is disagreement on its **basis and legitimacy**:

- **Traditional conservatives** support a hierarchy based on birth and inherited status, favoring an aristocratic ruling class as natural governors ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

- **New Right conservatives** reject aristocracy and emphasize meritocracy, where status is earned through achievement rather than inherited. They are more skeptical of paternalistic elites and prefer a society defined by individual success ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/differences-and-conflict-within-conservatism)).

### 2. The Role of the State and Extent of Intervention

Conservatives diverge significantly on the **role and size of the state**:

- **Traditional conservatives** favor a paternalistic state that intervenes moderately to preserve social stability and uphold tradition ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/to-what-extent-do-conservatives-agree-about-the-role-of-the-state)).

- **One-nation conservatives** support more extensive state intervention, especially during crises, to safeguard society and the economy, as seen in the UK government's furlough scheme during the COVID-19 pandemic ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/differences-and-conflict-within-conservatism)).

- **New Right conservatives**, particularly neo-liberals, advocate for rolling back the state, reducing welfare, and promoting individual responsibility. However, neo-conservatives within the New Right still emphasize the need for a strong state to maintain law and order ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/to-what-extent-do-conservatives-agree-about-the-role-of-the-state)).

### 3. Views on Capitalism and the Economy

There is also disagreement on economic matters:

- **Traditional conservatives** are wary of unregulated capitalism due to its potential to increase inequality and threaten national unity. They are open to Keynesian economics and state intervention ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/differences-and-conflict-within-conservatism)).

- **New Right conservatives** strongly favor free-market capitalism, privatization, deregulation, and reduced state spending ([thepoliticsteacher, 2017](https://thepoliticsteacherorg.thepoliticsteacher.org/home/a-and-as-politics-2017/unit-1-politics-in-the-uk-year-12--13/year-13-a2-core-political-ideas/differences-and-conflict-within-conservatism)).

### 4. The Social Role of the Family

While the family is universally acknowledged as central, there are nuanced differences in how various conservative factions view its role in society and policy. For example, neoconservatives and social conservatives emphasize traditional family values as a bulwark against social decay, while neoliberals focus more on individual responsibility within family structures ([academia.edu, 2021](https://www.academia.edu/61427654/Roundtable_Review_Melinda_Cooper_Family_Values_Between_Neoliberalism_and_the_New_Social_Conservatism)).

## Evaluation and Opinion

Based on the evidence, conservatives **largely agree on the fundamental nature of society as an organic, hierarchical entity that evolves gradually and requires a strong sense of tradition and order**. They concur on the importance of social institutions like the family and the necessity of the state to maintain social cohesion and stability.

However, the **extent and nature of hierarchy, the role of the state, and economic policies are significant points of contention** within conservative thought. Traditional conservatives and one-nation conservatives lean towards a more paternalistic and interventionist approach, while New Right conservatives emphasize meritocracy, individualism, and limited government.

This diversity reflects conservatism’s broad tent and its adaptation to changing social and economic contexts. It also illustrates the tension between preserving tradition and embracing necessary change, a dynamic that defines conservative ideology.

Therefore, conservatives **agree substantially on the broad contours of society but differ markedly on implementation and policy specifics**, especially regarding governance and economic management.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, conservatives share a **core agreement on society as an organic, hierarchical, and tradition-bound entity** that must evolve cautiously to maintain stability. They also agree on the necessity of the state to uphold order and tradition. Nonetheless, **internal disagreements about hierarchy’s basis, the state’s role, and economic approaches reveal the complexity and pluralism within conservatism**. These differences are not trivial but shape distinct conservative responses to contemporary social and political challenges.
