# How Illegal Immigration Helps America: An In-Depth Economic and Social Analysis

## Introduction

Illegal immigration remains a highly debated topic in the United States, often framed in terms of national security, social services, and labor market competition. However, a comprehensive review of recent research and data reveals that illegal immigration contributes significantly to the U.S. economy and society in multifaceted ways. This report synthesizes findings from authoritative sources, including government reports, academic studies, and policy analyses, to provide an objective, detailed, and data-driven understanding of how illegal immigration helps America. The report covers labor market contributions, tax revenues, entrepreneurship, demographic impacts, and broader economic effects, while addressing common misconceptions.

## Labor Market Contributions

### Filling Critical Labor Gaps

Illegal immigrants play a vital role in filling labor shortages in key sectors of the U.S. economy, particularly in agriculture, construction, food processing, and service industries. These sectors often face chronic shortages of native-born workers willing to accept low-wage, physically demanding jobs. According to the Center for Migration Studies of New York, 78% of undocumented Latino immigrants participate in the labor force, a higher rate than U.S.-born Latinos (68%) and the general U.S.-born population (63%) ([Sugrue, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noreensugrue/2025/02/25/deporting-undocumented-immigrants-carries-high-economic-costs/)).

The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) highlights that unauthorized immigrants provide essential manpower in agriculture, construction, food processing, and maintenance jobs, which are crucial for the productivity of these industries ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/immigrants-and-the-economy/)). Without this labor supply, many businesses would face higher costs and reduced output, leading to increased prices for consumers and potential job losses in related sectors.

### Impact on Wages and Employment

Contrary to popular belief, illegal immigration does not significantly increase unemployment among native-born workers. In fact, studies show modest positive wage effects for native workers, especially those with lower educational attainment. The EPI reports cumulative wage increases for U.S.-born workers between 2000 and 2022, with gains of 2.775% for those without a high school diploma and 3.15% for high school graduates ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/immigrants-and-the-economy/)).

Moreover, illegal immigrants often complement rather than directly compete with native-born workers by occupying jobs that are less attractive to the latter. This dynamic helps sustain industries that rely on a diverse labor force and supports overall economic growth.

## Economic Output and Entrepreneurship

### Immigrants’ Economic Output

Immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, contribute disproportionately to the U.S. economy relative to their population share. In 2023, immigrants accounted for 14.3% of the U.S. population but contributed 18.0% of total wage, salary, and business proprietor income, amounting to approximately $2.1 trillion in economic output ([Economic Policy Institute, 2025](https://www.epi.org/publication/immigrants-and-the-economy/)).

Undocumented immigrants, while a subset of the immigrant population, are integral to this contribution. Their labor supports critical supply chains and service sectors, ensuring the smooth functioning of the broader economy.

### Entrepreneurship and Job Creation

Illegal immigrants exhibit a higher rate of entrepreneurship compared to native-born Americans. Over one million undocumented individuals are entrepreneurs, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. For example, undocumented Latino immigrants have been shown to start businesses at higher rates than their U.S.-born counterparts, contributing to economic dynamism and community development ([Sugrue, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noreensugrue/2025/02/25/deporting-undocumented-immigrants-carries-high-economic-costs/)).

These businesses often hire both immigrant and native-born workers, purchase supplies from American companies, and contribute to the tax base, illustrating the intertwined nature of immigrant and native economic interests.

## Tax Contributions and Public Revenues

### Significant Tax Payments

Illegal immigrants contribute billions of dollars annually in federal, state, and local taxes. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) estimates that undocumented immigrants paid approximately $96.7 billion in taxes in 2022, including $59.4 billion in federal taxes and $13.6 billion in state and local taxes ([ITEP, 2024](https://itep.org/study-undocumented-immigrants-contribute-nearly-100-billion-in-taxes-a-year/)).

These tax payments support essential public services such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, programs from which undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible to benefit. For instance, undocumented immigrants contributed nearly $26 billion to Social Security and over $6 billion to Medicare in 2022 ([Sugrue, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noreensugrue/2025/02/25/deporting-undocumented-immigrants-carries-high-economic-costs/)).

### Impact of Legalization on Tax Revenues

Legalizing undocumented immigrants would further increase their tax contributions due to higher wages and labor market mobility. ITEP estimates that providing lawful permanent resident status to all undocumented immigrants would raise state and local tax revenues by $2.1 billion annually, with federal tax revenues increasing substantially as well ([American Immigration Council, 2016](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/adding-billions-tax-dollars-paid-undocumented-immigrants)).

Executive actions granting work authorization to subsets of undocumented immigrants have also been shown to increase tax revenues significantly, as legalized workers emerge from the underground economy and pay payroll taxes for the first time ([American Immigration Council, 2016](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/adding-billions-tax-dollars-paid-undocumented-immigrants)).

## Demographic and Social Contributions

### Addressing Demographic Challenges

Immigration, including illegal immigration, helps mitigate demographic challenges faced by the U.S., such as an aging population and declining birth rates. Immigrants tend to be younger and contribute to the labor force participation rate, which supports economic growth and the sustainability of social programs.

### Social Integration and Community Contributions

Undocumented immigrants are often deeply woven into the fabric of American communities. Many have resided in the U.S. for over five years, participate actively in local economies, and contribute to social cohesion through entrepreneurship and civic engagement ([Sugrue, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noreensugrue/2025/02/25/deporting-undocumented-immigrants-carries-high-economic-costs/)).

## Economic Costs of Deportation

### High Fiscal and Economic Costs

Mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would have severe negative economic consequences. The American Immigration Council estimates a one-time mass deportation would cost taxpayers approximately $315 billion, not including lost economic output and tax revenues ([Sugrue, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noreensugrue/2025/02/25/deporting-undocumented-immigrants-carries-high-economic-costs/)).

The Peterson Institute for International Economics projects that deporting 1.3 million undocumented immigrants would reduce U.S. GDP by 1.2% and employment by 1.1% by 2028, primarily due to labor shortages in agriculture, construction, and other low-wage sectors ([Sugrue, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noreensugrue/2025/02/25/deporting-undocumented-immigrants-carries-high-economic-costs/)).

### Impact on Prices and Consumer Costs

Removing undocumented workers would increase labor costs for employers, leading to higher prices for goods and services such as restaurant meals and agricultural products. This price increase would affect all consumers, including low-income households, thereby reducing overall economic welfare ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States)).

## Policy Considerations and Recommendations

### Balancing Enforcement and Economic Needs

While the U.S. has the right to control its borders, immigration policy must balance enforcement with the economic realities of labor market demands and the contributions of undocumented immigrants. Policies that integrate undocumented immigrants into the legal economy, such as work authorization and pathways to legalization, can enhance economic productivity and tax revenues ([Forbes, 2024](https://www.forbes.com/sites/solangecharas/2024/12/23/project-2025s-immigration-policy-impact-on-us-workforce-and-economy/)).

### Protecting Worker Rights

Enhanced enforcement measures under initiatives like Project 2025 raise concerns about worker rights, particularly for immigrant workers in vulnerable sectors. Labor unions and worker advocacy groups emphasize the need for solidarity and legal protections to prevent exploitation and ensure fair wages, which ultimately benefits the entire workforce ([Cornell ILR, 2025](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/worker-institute/blog/news/protecting-worker-rights-under-project-2025-changing-landscape-immigration-enforcement-need-worker)).

## Conclusion

Illegal immigration plays a crucial and positive role in the American economy and society. Undocumented immigrants fill essential labor shortages, contribute significantly to tax revenues, foster entrepreneurship, and support demographic stability. The economic costs of mass deportation and exclusion far outweigh perceived benefits, underscoring the importance of policies that recognize and integrate undocumented immigrants. A balanced approach that protects national security while harnessing the economic contributions of immigrants will best serve the interests of the U.S. workforce and economy.
