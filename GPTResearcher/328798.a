# Report on Public Sentiment Toward Taxation in the United States

## Introduction

Taxation remains a critical and often contentious issue in the United States, reflecting deep-seated views about fairness, government role, and economic policy. Public opinion on taxation is multifaceted, influenced by political affiliation, income level, perceptions of government effectiveness, and beliefs about economic inequality. This report synthesizes recent and reliable data from Pew Research Center, Gallup, Stanford Graduate School of Business, and other reputable sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Americans feel about taxation as of early 2025.

## General Sentiments on Taxation

### Fairness Concerns

A dominant theme in American attitudes toward taxation is the perception of fairness. A significant majority of Americans express frustration with the belief that some corporations and wealthy individuals do not pay their fair share of taxes. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, about 61% of adults are bothered "a lot" by the feeling that some corporations do not pay their fair share, and a nearly identical share (60%) feel the same about wealthy people ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/07/top-tax-frustrations-for-americans-the-feeling-that-some-corporations-wealthy-people-dont-pay-fair-share/)).

This concern about fairness extends to support for policy changes. In 2025, 63% of U.S. adults favored raising tax rates on large businesses and corporations, with 34% supporting substantial increases. Similarly, 61% supported raising taxes on households earning over $400,000 annually ([Pew Research Center, 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/19/most-americans-continue-to-favor-raising-taxes-on-corporations-higher-income-households/)).

### Complexity and Personal Tax Burden

Complexity of the tax system is another significant source of frustration. Over half of Americans (53%) reported being bothered "a lot" by the complexity of the federal tax system, with Republicans expressing slightly higher levels of frustration (59%) compared to Democrats (49%) ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/07/top-tax-frustrations-for-americans-the-feeling-that-some-corporations-wealthy-people-dont-pay-fair-share/)).

Regarding personal tax burdens, more than half of Americans (56%) feel they pay more than their fair share of taxes relative to what they receive from the federal government, a sentiment that has increased from 49% in 2021. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to feel overburdened by taxes (63% vs. 50%), though the share of Democrats feeling this way has risen in recent years ([Pew Research Center, 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/09/7-facts-about-americans-and-taxes/)).

## Partisan and Ideological Divides

### Divergent Views on Tax Fairness

Political affiliation is a critical determinant of attitudes toward taxation. Republicans and Democrats differ sharply in their perceptions of the fairness of the tax system and the economic system more broadly. As of 2019, about 64% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents considered the tax system very or moderately fair, compared to only 32% of Democrats and Democratic leaners ([Pew Research Center, 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/04/growing-partisan-divide-over-fairness-of-the-nations-tax-system-2/)).

This partisan gap has widened over time, reflecting diverging ideological narratives about economic fairness. Democrats are more likely to view the economic system as unfairly favoring powerful interests, with 81% expressing this view compared to 40% of Republicans ([Pew Research Center, 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/04/growing-partisan-divide-over-fairness-of-the-nations-tax-system-2/)).

### Tax Policy Preferences

Democrats tend to support higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, aligning with broader beliefs in redistribution and economic equity. For instance, three-quarters of Democrats are bothered "a lot" by the perception that corporations and wealthy people do not pay their fair share, and a similar proportion supports raising taxes on these groups ([Pew Research Center, 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/09/7-facts-about-americans-and-taxes/)).

Conversely, Republicans are more divided, with a growing minority advocating for lower tax rates on large businesses and high-income households. By 2025, about a third of Republicans favored lowering corporate tax rates, up from previous years, and about 27% supported lowering taxes on households earning over $400,000 ([Pew Research Center, 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/19/most-americans-continue-to-favor-raising-taxes-on-corporations-higher-income-households/)).

### Underlying Beliefs About Fairness and Government Role

Research by Harvard economist Stefanie Stantcheva highlights that views on tax policy are deeply intertwined with broader beliefs about fairness and the role of government. Democrats are more likely to believe that taxes have fewer economic costs and that tax cuts rarely "pay for themselves," whereas Republicans tend to emphasize efficiency and economic incentives ([The Fiscal Times, 2020](https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/08/18/Why-Republicans-Democrats-Think-Differently-About-Taxes)).

Moreover, fairness is a subjective concept. While most Americans agree that people with similar incomes should pay similar taxes (horizontal equity), opinions diverge sharply on whether taxes should be used to redistribute wealth more broadly (vertical equity). Democrats overwhelmingly support redistribution, while Republicans emphasize the right of the wealthy to retain their income ([Forbes, 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2020/09/11/what-do-people-think-about-taxes-they-are-partisan-dazed-and-confused/)).

## Misunderstandings and Complexity

Many Americans harbor significant misunderstandings about who pays taxes and how much. Studies indicate that people tend to overestimate the tax burden on median-income households and underestimate the taxes paid by the wealthiest ([Forbes, 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2020/09/11/what-do-people-think-about-taxes-they-are-partisan-dazed-and-confused/)).

This confusion contributes to frustration with the tax system's complexity and perceptions of unfairness. The complexity itself is a top frustration, especially among Republicans, who are more likely to be bothered by it than Democrats ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/07/top-tax-frustrations-for-americans-the-feeling-that-some-corporations-wealthy-people-dont-pay-fair-share/)).

## Support for Tax Increases on the Wealthy and Corporations

Despite partisan divides, there is broad support across income levels and political affiliations for raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations. A Stanford Graduate School of Business survey found that 65% of Americans support a wealth tax on fortunes over $50 million, although support diminishes if the tax is perceived to harm the economy or increase unemployment ([Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2020](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/americans-views-taxes-are-surprisingly-complicated)).

Similarly, Pew Research data from 2025 shows sustained majority support for raising tax rates on large businesses and high-income households ([Pew Research Center, 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/19/most-americans-continue-to-favor-raising-taxes-on-corporations-higher-income-households/)).

## Perceptions of Government and Taxation

Trust in government institutions influences attitudes toward taxation. Americans generally rate local governments more favorably than state or federal governments, with only 22% expressing favorable views of the federal government as of late 2023 ([Pew Research Center, 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/11/americans-rate-their-federal-state-and-local-governments-less-positively-than-a-few-years-ago/)).

Partisan alignment with state governments also affects perceptions. Republicans and Democrats tend to view their state governments more favorably when their party controls state leadership ([Pew Research Center, 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/11/americans-rate-their-federal-state-and-local-governments-less-positively-than-a-few-years-ago/)).

This trust differential may shape how individuals perceive the fairness and effectiveness of taxation and government spending.

## Summary and Conclusion

Americans' views on taxation are complex and deeply influenced by political affiliation, income, and perceptions of fairness and government performance. Key findings include:

- A majority of Americans are frustrated by the perception that corporations and wealthy individuals do not pay their fair share of taxes.
- There is strong support for raising taxes on large businesses and high-income households, though Republicans are increasingly more supportive of lowering these taxes than in previous years.
- The complexity of the tax system is a significant source of frustration, especially among Republicans.
- Partisan divides are stark, with Democrats generally viewing the tax system and economic system as unfair and supporting redistribution, while Republicans tend to see the system as fairer and emphasize economic efficiency.
- Misunderstandings about tax burdens are widespread, contributing to confusion and dissatisfaction.
- Trust in government, especially at the federal level, is low, which may influence attitudes toward taxation and government spending.

In my assessment, the prevailing sentiment reflects a desire for a tax system perceived as fairer and more transparent, with a willingness among a broad segment of the population to increase taxes on corporations and the wealthy to address economic inequality. However, partisan polarization and differing beliefs about fairness and government roles complicate consensus on tax policy. Addressing misunderstandings and simplifying the tax code could help alleviate some frustrations and foster more informed public discourse.
