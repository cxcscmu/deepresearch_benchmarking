# Report: Do Americans Wish More Autonomy in Their Work?

## Introduction

The nature of work in the United States has undergone significant transformation over the past decade, accelerated by technological advancements, the COVID-19 pandemic, and evolving workforce expectations. A central theme emerging from recent research is the growing desire among American workers for greater autonomy in their work. This report examines whether the American population wishes for more autonomy in their work, drawing on multiple recent studies and surveys from reputable sources such as MBO Partners, McKinsey & Company, RAND Corporation, and Harvard Business Review. The analysis integrates quantitative data and qualitative insights to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based answer to the query.

## Defining Work Autonomy

Work autonomy refers to the degree of control employees have over various aspects of their work, including when, where, and how they perform their tasks. It encompasses flexibility in work location (remote or on-site), scheduling (flexible hours), and discretion over work methods and priorities. Autonomy is linked to job satisfaction, productivity, and well-being, making it a critical factor in contemporary workforce dynamics.

## Evidence of Desire for Greater Autonomy

### Rise of Independent Work and Choice

A pivotal indicator of the desire for autonomy is the rapid growth of independent workers in the U.S. labor market. According to the 2024 MBO Partners State of Independence in America report, 72.7 million Americans engaged in independent work in 2024, representing a significant increase from previous years. Notably, 61% of these independents chose this path by choice rather than necessity, reflecting a proactive pursuit of autonomy and self-direction in their careers ([MBO Partners, 2024](https://www.mbopartners.com/blog/press/new-study-shows-rise-in-independent-by-choice-workers-over-traditional-employment/)).

Full-time independent workers report high levels of satisfaction with autonomy: 84% say they are happier working on their own, 79% report better health outcomes, and 65% feel more secure compared to traditional employment. These figures underscore that autonomy is not only desired but also associated with positive personal and professional outcomes ([MBO Partners, 2024](https://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/)).

### Flexible Work as a Core Expectation

McKinsey & Company’s research highlights that flexibility—an essential component of autonomy—is now a mainstream expectation among American workers. Approximately 58% of the workforce has the ability to work remotely at least part-time, and 87% of those offered flexible work arrangements take advantage of them. Moreover, 65% of employed respondents expressed willingness to work remotely full-time if given the choice ([McKinsey, 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it)).

This widespread adoption and preference for flexible work arrangements indicate a strong collective desire for autonomy over work location and schedule. The data also reveal demographic nuances, such as younger workers and women being slightly less likely to have remote work opportunities, suggesting ongoing challenges in equitable access to autonomy ([McKinsey, 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it)).

### Autonomy and Job Satisfaction

The RAND Corporation’s American Working Conditions Survey (2017) provides additional insight into autonomy’s role in workplace satisfaction. It found that 75% of American workers can choose the order of their tasks, indicating some level of task autonomy. However, 78% must be physically present at work, limiting location autonomy for many. Importantly, older workers (ages 50 and above) report higher autonomy and flexibility than mid-career workers, correlating with greater job satisfaction among older cohorts ([RAND, 2017](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9972.html)).

Moreover, 31% of traditional jobholders now perceive independent work as less risky than permanent employment, a significant increase from 18% in 2018, reflecting shifting attitudes toward autonomy and self-employment ([MBO Partners, 2024](https://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/)).

### Autonomy’s Impact on Productivity and Engagement

Research also links autonomy with increased productivity and engagement. A Gallup study cited by Forbes found that flexible work arrangements, a form of autonomy, drive employee engagement, which in turn leads to better performance outcomes such as 40% fewer quality defects and 21% higher profitability. Additionally, 43% of workers reported that flexible working hours helped them achieve more productivity ([Forbes, 2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2022/03/23/why-flexible-work-boosts-employee-productivity/)).

Similarly, McKinsey emphasizes that autonomy over work location and timing is critical for attracting and retaining talent, especially among Millennials and Gen Z, who prioritize flexibility and purpose over traditional job structures ([McKinsey, 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it)).

### Challenges and Barriers to Autonomy

Despite the strong desire for autonomy, barriers remain. RAND’s survey highlights that 36% of workers have work hours set by their employer with no possibility for change, and about 20% report experiencing workplace hostility or verbal abuse, which can undermine the benefits of autonomy ([RAND, 2017](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9972.html)).

Furthermore, McKinsey notes that while flexibility is highly desired, not all employers offer it equitably, and some workers face obstacles such as lack of technology, managerial resistance, or job roles that inherently require physical presence ([McKinsey, 2022](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it)).

### Autonomy Supported by Technology

Telecommuting and digital platforms have facilitated greater autonomy, enabling workers to control their schedules and work environments. A study of telecommuting in Japan before the COVID-19 pandemic found that telework increased perceived autonomy, which positively affected motivation and productivity. The study emphasized the need for organizational reforms and supportive management systems to sustain autonomy in telework settings ([PMC, 2023](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047464/)).

Similarly, AI and automation are empowering independent workers to enhance their competitiveness and autonomy. MBO Partners reports that 59% of independents feel that generative AI makes them more competitive, illustrating how technology can augment autonomy rather than diminish it ([MBO Partners, 2024](https://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/)).

## Synthesis and Opinion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the American population does indeed wish for more autonomy in their work. This desire manifests in multiple dimensions:

- **Choice of Work Mode:** A significant majority prefer flexible or remote work options, with many willing to work remotely full-time if offered.
- **Control Over Schedule:** Workers value the ability to set their own hours, balancing work with personal and caregiving responsibilities.
- **Self-Directed Careers:** The rise in independent workers choosing this path by choice reflects a broader cultural shift toward autonomy, purpose, and financial independence.
- **Positive Outcomes:** Autonomy correlates with higher job satisfaction, better health, increased productivity, and a stronger sense of security.

However, this desire is not uniformly met across all sectors or demographics. Structural barriers, managerial attitudes, and job nature limit autonomy for many workers. Organizations that fail to adapt risk losing talent and facing reduced engagement and productivity.

Given these insights, it is imperative for employers, policymakers, and workforce strategists to prioritize autonomy-enhancing policies and practices. This includes expanding flexible work arrangements, investing in technology and training, and fostering organizational cultures that support employee discretion and well-being.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the American workforce strongly desires greater autonomy in their work, encompassing flexibility in location, schedule, and work methods. This trend is supported by the rapid growth of independent work, widespread adoption of flexible work arrangements, and robust evidence linking autonomy to positive work outcomes. While challenges remain, the trajectory is clear: autonomy is becoming a central pillar of the American work experience, reshaping expectations and redefining career success.
