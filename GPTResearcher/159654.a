# Why Are People Taking Ivermectin for COVID-19? An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the urgent need for effective treatments has driven both the scientific community and the public to explore various therapeutic options. Among these, ivermectin—a drug originally approved for parasitic infections—has garnered significant attention. Despite widespread scientific consensus and regulatory guidance advising against its use for COVID-19 outside clinical trials, many people continue to take ivermectin for prevention or treatment of the disease. This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind this phenomenon, drawing on recent scientific literature, clinical trial data, regulatory positions, and sociocultural factors. The objective is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of why ivermectin remains in use for COVID-19, despite conflicting evidence about its efficacy and safety.

## Background on Ivermectin

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating parasitic worm infections, head lice, and rosacea in humans. It is also widely used in veterinary medicine for parasite control in animals ([FDA, n.d.](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/ivermectin-animal-medicines)). Its mechanism involves interfering with nerve and muscle function in parasites, which does not directly translate to antiviral activity in humans.

The interest in ivermectin as a potential COVID-19 treatment originated from a 2020 laboratory study published in *Antiviral Research*, which demonstrated that ivermectin could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro with a 5,000-fold reduction over 48 hours ([Caly et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32392200/)). However, this study used doses much higher than those safely achievable in humans, raising concerns about the clinical relevance of the findings ([Russo, 2023](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a62908112/new-science-ivermectin-research/)).

## Scientific Evidence and Clinical Trials

### Conflicting Clinical Data

Following the initial in vitro findings, numerous clinical trials and observational studies were conducted to evaluate ivermectin’s efficacy in COVID-19 patients. Early meta-analyses suggested potential benefits, including improved survival, faster viral clearance, and symptom relief ([Bryant et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/); [Kory et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8248252/)). Some reviews reported reductions in mortality by up to 75% in certain populations ([Bryant et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/)).

However, more recent and comprehensive analyses, including data up to April 2024, have shown that while ivermectin may alleviate symptoms, it does not significantly reduce critical outcomes such as mortality, hospitalization rates, or the need for mechanical ventilation ([Annals of Medicine and Surgery, 2025](https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2025/02000/the_impact_of_ivermectin_on_covid_19_outcomes__a.43.aspx); [Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11918548/)). Two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conclusively demonstrated no significant efficacy or safety advantage over placebo, leading to recommendations against its use for COVID-19 treatment outside clinical trials ([Reis et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35395114/); [Lim et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35395115/)).

### Regulatory and Health Authority Positions

Major health organizations, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), recommend against the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment outside of clinical trials due to insufficient evidence of benefit and potential safety risks ([NIH, 2021](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/); [WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-therapeutics-2021.1)).

## Reasons People Take Ivermectin for COVID-19

Despite the lack of robust clinical evidence supporting ivermectin’s efficacy for COVID-19, several factors contribute to its continued use:

### 1. Early Promising Laboratory and Clinical Data

The initial laboratory study showing ivermectin’s antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 generated hope that an existing, widely available drug could be repurposed quickly. Early meta-analyses and observational studies, some of which were later retracted or criticized for methodological flaws, suggested benefits that fueled public and medical interest ([Bryant et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/); [Hill et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-148845/v1)).

### 2. Accessibility and Cost

Ivermectin is inexpensive and widely available globally, including in low-resource settings. This accessibility makes it an attractive option for individuals and healthcare providers seeking affordable treatments, especially where access to newer antiviral drugs or vaccines is limited ([Annals of Medicine and Surgery, 2025](https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2025/02000/the_impact_of_ivermectin_on_covid_19_outcomes__a.43.aspx)).

### 3. Misinformation and Social Media Influence

Misinformation campaigns and endorsements by some public figures and online communities have amplified ivermectin’s perceived efficacy. This has led to increased demand, including use of veterinary formulations intended for animals, which poses significant safety risks ([Prevention, 2023](https://www.prevention.com/health/a37594991/why-people-think-ivermectin-works-for-covid/); [CNN, 2025](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/ivermectin-infection-treatment-prevention-wellness/index.html)).

### 4. Distrust in Official Guidance and Healthcare Systems

Some individuals distrust official health recommendations and pharmaceutical companies, leading them to seek alternative treatments. The politicization of COVID-19 treatments has also contributed to skepticism about vaccines and approved therapies, with ivermectin positioned by some as a “miracle drug” or alternative cure ([The Conversation, 2023](https://theconversation.com/thinking-of-trying-ivermectin-for-covid-heres-what-can-happen-with-this-controversial-drug-167178)).

### 5. Anecdotal Reports and Personal Testimonials

Personal stories and anecdotal evidence shared via social media and community networks have influenced individuals to try ivermectin, often in the absence of strong scientific backing. These testimonials can be compelling, especially in the context of fear and uncertainty during the pandemic ([Prevention, 2023](https://www.prevention.com/health/a37594991/why-people-think-ivermectin-works-for-covid/)).

### 6. Limited Treatment Options Early in the Pandemic

At the pandemic’s start, few effective treatments were available. Ivermectin’s antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, demonstrated in vitro and in animal studies, made it a candidate for off-label use and compassionate treatment, which in some cases persisted even after more data became available ([Bryant et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/); [Heidary & Gharebaghi, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8248252/)).

## Risks and Concerns Associated with Ivermectin Use for COVID-19

### Safety Issues

Ivermectin is generally safe when used at approved doses for parasitic infections. However, misuse—especially with veterinary formulations or high doses—can cause serious adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, seizures, coma, and even death ([The Conversation, 2023](https://theconversation.com/thinking-of-trying-ivermectin-for-covid-heres-what-can-happen-with-this-controversial-drug-167178); [MensHealth, 2023](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a62908112/new-science-ivermectin-research/)).

### Lack of Efficacy in Key Clinical Outcomes

Recent high-quality RCTs and meta-analyses have shown no significant benefit of ivermectin in reducing mortality, hospitalization, or progression to severe disease ([Annals of Medicine and Surgery, 2025](https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2025/02000/the_impact_of_ivermectin_on_covid_19_outcomes__a.43.aspx); [Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11918548/)).

### Potential for Misinformation to Undermine Public Health Efforts

The promotion of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment despite insufficient evidence can distract from proven interventions such as vaccination, mask-wearing, and social distancing. It may also lead to delays in seeking appropriate medical care ([NIH, 2021](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/ivermectin/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The continued use of ivermectin for COVID-19 is driven by a complex interplay of early promising but limited scientific data, accessibility, misinformation, distrust in official guidance, and anecdotal influences. While ivermectin has demonstrated antiviral properties in laboratory settings, robust clinical evidence consistently shows it does not significantly improve critical COVID-19 outcomes such as mortality or hospitalization rates.

Given the current state of evidence, ivermectin should not be used for COVID-19 treatment or prevention outside of well-conducted clinical trials. Public health authorities must prioritize clear, evidence-based communication to counter misinformation and emphasize proven preventive and therapeutic measures. Efforts should also focus on addressing the underlying causes of mistrust and misinformation to ensure that patients receive safe and effective care.
