# Why Do People Get Abortions? A Comprehensive and In-Depth Report

## Introduction

Abortion remains a complex and multifaceted issue influenced by a variety of personal, social, economic, and health-related factors. Understanding why people seek abortions requires a nuanced examination of motivations that go beyond simplistic or moralistic explanations. This report synthesizes recent global and U.S.-based research to provide an objective, comprehensive overview of the reasons people choose abortion, supported by empirical data and scholarly analysis. The aim is to present a well-rounded, evidence-based understanding of abortion motivations as of 2025.

## Motivations for Abortion: Multifactorial and Interrelated

A recent scoping review of global literature on abortion motivations found that decisions to terminate an unwanted pregnancy are influenced by multiple, interrelated factors. These include family planning considerations, relationship dynamics, material and life circumstances, and social stigma ([Dalmijn, Visse, & van Nistelrooij, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39843393/)).

### Family Planning and Timing

Many individuals seek abortion because their family is already complete or because they do not desire children at that time. Timing plays a critical role; some people feel unprepared emotionally, financially, or socially to raise a child. For example, about 36% of people in a U.S. study cited timing-related reasons, such as not being ready emotionally or financially, or feeling too old or too young for parenthood ([Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reasons-for-abortions)).

### Economic and Material Circumstances

Financial concerns are among the most frequently cited reasons for abortion. Approximately 40% of people mention financial reasons, including the inability to afford a child or provide adequate care. This includes worries about housing, food security, transportation, and general economic stability. Many women seeking abortion live below the federal poverty level and face significant hardships, such as difficulty paying for basic living expenses ([Foster et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5803812/); [Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reasons-for-abortions)).

The Turnaway Study, a landmark longitudinal research project, found that women denied abortions were significantly more likely to experience economic hardship, including unemployment and poverty, compared to those who received abortions ([University of California, 2022](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/turnaway-study-shows-impact-abortion-access-well-being)).

### Relationship Factors

Relationship dynamics heavily influence abortion decisions. About 31% of people report partner-related reasons, such as unstable or unsupportive relationships, abusive partners, or the desire to marry before having children. The presence of a supportive partner can also motivate continuation of an unwanted pregnancy ([Dalmijn, Visse, & van Nistelrooij, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39843393/); [Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reasons-for-abortions)).

### Health Concerns

Health-related reasons, including concerns about the pregnant person's physical or mental health or the fetus's health, also contribute to abortion decisions. Around 12% of individuals cite health issues, such as worsening preexisting conditions, medication effects, or substance use, as factors ([Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reasons-for-abortions)).

### Emotional and Mental Preparedness

Emotional readiness is a significant factor. Nearly 19% of people report being emotionally or mentally unprepared for parenthood. This includes feelings of immaturity, lack of independence, or mental health challenges ([Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reasons-for-abortions)).

### Social and Stigma-Related Factors

Social stigma, shame, and fear of negative reactions from family or community can influence abortion decisions. Some individuals fear judgment or pressure from family members, which can lead to seeking abortion to avoid social repercussions ([Dalmijn, Visse, & van Nistelrooij, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39843393/); [Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reasons-for-abortions)).

## Socioeconomic Consequences of Abortion Access or Denial

The socioeconomic context is both a cause and consequence of abortion decisions. Women denied abortions face exacerbated economic hardships, including increased poverty, unemployment, and reliance on public assistance programs. These outcomes are not only immediate but persist over years, affecting family stability and children's well-being ([Foster et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5803812/); [University of California, 2022](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/turnaway-study-shows-impact-abortion-access-well-being)).

### Employment and Poverty

Women denied abortions were three times more likely to be unemployed and four times more likely to live below the poverty line than women who received abortions. This economic instability often leads to increased reliance on social safety nets, which, while mitigating some hardships, do not fully compensate for the increased household size and financial burden ([Foster et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5803812/)).

### Family Structure and Support

The Turnaway Study also found that women denied abortions were more likely to raise children alone without partner or family support, increasing the challenges of single parenthood ([University of California, 2022](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/turnaway-study-shows-impact-abortion-access-well-being)).

## Impact of Abortion Restrictions and Access

Since the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion access in the U.S. has become more restricted in many states. Despite these restrictions, abortion rates have risen, partly due to increased unwanted pregnancies linked to reduced contraception access and deteriorating social safety nets ([Washington Monthly, 2025](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/04/25/how-reproductive-freedom-advocates-outsmarted-the-anti-abortion-movement/)).

Telehealth abortion and community support networks have played a crucial role in maintaining access to abortion services in restrictive environments ([Washington Monthly, 2025](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/04/25/how-reproductive-freedom-advocates-outsmarted-the-anti-abortion-movement/)).

## Psychological and Mental Health Considerations

The denial of abortion can lead to significant mental health challenges, including increased depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Conversely, the majority of people who have abortions report that it was the right decision for them, with no evidence of long-term mental health problems attributable to abortion itself ([Biggs et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10196497/); [University of California, 2022](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/turnaway-study-shows-impact-abortion-access-well-being)).

## Summary of Key Motivations

- **Financial Hardship:** Inability to afford a child or provide stable housing, food, and transportation.
- **Timing and Life Circumstances:** Feeling unprepared emotionally, socially, or financially; not the right time for children.
- **Relationship Issues:** Unstable, unsupportive, or abusive partners; desire to marry before having children.
- **Health Concerns:** Physical or mental health risks to the pregnant person or fetus.
- **Emotional and Mental Readiness:** Lack of maturity or mental capacity to parent.
- **Social Stigma and Pressure:** Fear of judgment or family/community pressure.

## Conclusion and Opinion

The decision to have an abortion is deeply personal and influenced by a complex interplay of factors, predominantly centered around economic stability, timing, relationships, and health. The evidence clearly shows that financial and material hardships are primary drivers, with many individuals seeking abortion to avoid exacerbating existing poverty or instability. Restrictive abortion policies disproportionately harm economically vulnerable populations and exacerbate socioeconomic disparities.

Given the robust data demonstrating that abortion access correlates with better economic and mental health outcomes, policies should prioritize maintaining and expanding access to safe abortion services. Efforts to reduce unwanted pregnancies should focus on improving access to contraception and social support systems rather than restricting abortion access, which leads to adverse outcomes for individuals and families.

This comprehensive understanding underscores the importance of treating abortion as a critical component of reproductive health care and social equity.
