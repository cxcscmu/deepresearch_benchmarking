# How Did the Armenian Genocide Happen?  
## A Comprehensive Report

---

### Introduction

The Armenian Genocide, which occurred primarily between 1915 and 1923, represents one of the most tragic and systematically executed ethnic cleansings of the 20th century. It involved the mass extermination, forced deportation, starvation, and brutalization of approximately 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire. This report aims to provide a detailed, well-structured, and comprehensive account of how the Armenian Genocide happened, drawing on reliable and recent sources to present an objective analysis.

### Historical Background and Context

The Armenians had lived in Anatolia and the surrounding regions for thousands of years, with documented presence dating back to the sixth century BCE. They were predominantly Christian in a Muslim-majority Ottoman Empire, which governed from 1300 to 1923. The Ottoman state was ruled by Muslim Turks under the sultanate of the Osmanli dynasty and governed according to Islamic law, which relegated non-Muslims, including Armenians, to second-class status. Armenians were subjected to discriminatory policies such as the millet system, which allowed religious communal autonomy but denied political participation and imposed extra taxes ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/ottoman.html)).

The decline of Ottoman power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, marked by territorial losses and internal revolts, exacerbated tensions. Sultan Abdul-Hamid II initiated mass killings of Armenians between 1894 and 1896 (the Hamidian massacres), killing up to 300,000 Armenians and restricting their economic roles. These massacres set a precedent for state-sanctioned violence against Armenians ([AGBU, 2025](https://agbu.org/remembering-past-redefining-future/origins-evolution-armenian-genocide)).

### The Rise of the Young Turks and Nationalist Ideology

The Young Turk movement, led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), took control of the Ottoman government in 1909. Initially promising reform and modernization, the regime quickly adopted a nationalist and authoritarian ideology focused on Turkification—aiming to create a homogenous Turkish Muslim state. Armenians and other Christian minorities were increasingly portrayed as internal enemies and traitors, accused of conspiring with foreign powers such as Russia ([Heritage Christian School, 2025](https://heritage-schools.org/life/story/2025-04-24/the-armenian-genocide-a-tragedy-that-will-never-be-forgotten)).

This nationalist ideology fostered an "affective disposition" of fear, anger, and resentment toward Armenians, who were constructed as an existential threat to the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish nation. Although Armenians had been considered a loyal millet historically, after 1878 they were increasingly seen as instruments of foreign intervention ([Wilson Center, 2025](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/eliminating-existential-threat-the-armenian-genocide-1915-1916)).

### The Outbreak of World War I and Genocidal Implementation

World War I provided the Ottoman government with cover and opportunity to implement their genocidal plans. The war's chaos and the empire's military defeats intensified nationalist fears and justified extreme measures. In 1914, the Ottoman government agreed to reforms protecting Armenians but used the war as a pretext to abandon these promises and initiate mass deportations and killings ([Wilson Center, 2025](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/eliminating-existential-threat-the-armenian-genocide-1915-1916)).

In April 1915, the genocide began with the arrest and execution of hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople (now Istanbul), a date now commemorated as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day ([Heritage Christian School, 2025](https://heritage-schools.org/life/story/2025-04-24/the-armenian-genocide-a-tragedy-that-will-never-be-forgotten)). Following this, the Ottoman government orchestrated the systematic deportation of Armenians from their homes, primarily in the six eastern provinces known as the Six Vilayets (Bitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzerum, Harput, Sivas, and Van) ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide)).

### Methods of Extermination

The deportations were disguised as resettlement programs but were in reality death marches. Armenians were forced to march hundreds of miles toward the Syrian desert without adequate food, water, or shelter. Starvation, exhaustion, exposure, and outright massacre claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands during these marches ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/encyclopedia/genocide.htm); [ANF, 2025](https://anfenglish.com/features/110-years-ago-the-armenian-genocide-79025)).

The Ottoman government made no provisions for the deported population's survival, deliberately denying food and water to hasten death. Survivors who reached northern Syria were placed in concentration camps and often sent further into the desert to die under harsh conditions ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/encyclopedia/genocide.htm)).

Additionally, able-bodied Armenian men were disarmed, conscripted into labor battalions, or executed. This eliminated most resistance and facilitated the mass deportations and killings ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/encyclopedia/genocide.htm)).

The government also authorized paramilitary groups, including convicts released from prison, to form killing squads known as the Special Organization (Teshkilâti Mahsusa), which carried out massacres and looting ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/encyclopedia/genocide.htm)).

### Scale and Impact

Estimates of the number of Armenians killed during the genocide range from 600,000 to 1.5 million, with most scholars agreeing on approximately 1 million deaths. By 1918, hundreds of thousands of Armenians had been killed, and many more were displaced, homeless, and stateless refugees. By 1923, virtually the entire Armenian population of Anatolian Turkey had disappeared ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/encyclopedia/genocide.htm); [History.com, 2025](https://www.history.com/articles/armenian-genocide)).

The genocide also resulted in the destruction of Armenian cultural heritage and the erasure of their historic presence in eastern Anatolia. Surviving Armenian women and children were often forcibly converted to Islam and integrated into Muslim households ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/event/Armenian-Genocide/Genocide)).

### Resistance and International Response

Armenian resistance was limited but notable in places like Musa Dagh and the city of Van, where Armenians defended themselves until relief arrived or they were forced to flee. However, most Armenians were disarmed and lacked the means to resist effectively ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/encyclopedia/genocide.htm)).

International witnesses, including diplomats such as U.S. Ambassador Henry Morgenthau Sr., missionaries, and journalists, reported extensively on the atrocities. Despite warnings and documentation, the Allied Powers took little effective action to stop the genocide during the war ([USC Shoah Foundation, 2025](https://sfi.usc.edu/news/2025/04/37271-educational-advisory-armenian-genocide)).

### Post-War Trials and Denial

After World War I, the Ottoman government held military tribunals and parliamentary investigations (1919-1921) that uncovered evidence of the genocide and issued guilty verdicts against Young Turk leaders. However, nationalist pressure prevented the execution of sentences, and the tribunals were closed ([Armenian Genocide Encyclopedia](https://www.armenian-genocide.org/ottoman.html)).

The subsequent Turkish Republic adopted policies denying the genocide and dismissing claims of a deliberate extermination plan. This denial persists today, despite recognition by over 30 countries and numerous scholars ([Heritage Christian School, 2025](https://heritage-schools.org/life/story/2025-04-24/the-armenian-genocide-a-tragedy-that-will-never-be-forgotten)).

### Causes and Motivations

The genocide was driven by a combination of economic, political, religious, and social factors:

- **Economic:** Armenians were relatively prosperous, and their wealth and properties were expropriated during the deportations and massacres ([Armenian Weekly, 2018](https://armenianweekly.com/2018/04/24/what-were-the-main-causes-of-the-armenian-genocide/)).

- **Political:** The Young Turks sought to consolidate power and create a homogenous Turkish state, viewing Armenians as a threat due to their perceived ties to foreign powers and demands for reform ([AGBU, 2025](https://agbu.org/remembering-past-redefining-future/origins-evolution-armenian-genocide)).

- **Religious and Social:** Armenians, as Christian minorities, were marginalized and subjected to discrimination and violence, which intensified under nationalist and Islamist ideologies ([Wilson Center, 2025](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/eliminating-existential-threat-the-armenian-genocide-1915-1916)).

### Conclusion and Opinion

The Armenian Genocide was a meticulously planned and systematically executed campaign of extermination by the Ottoman Empire, particularly under the Young Turk regime. It was not a spontaneous act of war but the culmination of decades of discrimination, nationalist ideology, and opportunistic violence during World War I. The use of forced deportations disguised as resettlement, death marches, starvation, paramilitary killings, and cultural destruction underscores the genocidal intent.

While some Ottoman officials and civilians resisted or aided Armenians, the overwhelming state machinery was mobilized to annihilate the Armenian population. The genocide resulted in the near-total destruction of an ancient people’s presence in their historic homeland and created a diaspora that persists today.

The post-war failure to hold perpetrators accountable and the ongoing denial by the Turkish government have compounded the tragedy. Recognition and education about the Armenian Genocide remain essential to honoring the victims and preventing future atrocities.
