# Report: Why is Ethical Transgression Argued to be Pervasive in Social Research?

## Introduction

Ethical transgression in social research refers to the breaches or violations of established ethical norms and principles during the conduct of research involving human participants or social phenomena. It is widely argued that such transgressions are pervasive and, to some extent, inevitable in social research. This report explores the reasons behind this argument by analyzing the complexities inherent in social research ethics, the practical challenges researchers face, and the structural and methodological factors that contribute to ethical lapses. Drawing on recent scholarly sources, the report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based, and objective examination of why ethical transgressions occur frequently in social research.

## Understanding Ethical Transgression in Social Research

Ethical transgression encompasses any deviation from ethical standards such as informed consent, confidentiality, honesty, and respect for participants’ autonomy. In social research, these standards are critical due to the sensitive nature of human subjects and the potential for harm, whether physical, psychological, or reputational. Despite the existence of professional codes of ethics and institutional review boards, breaches still occur, ranging from minor oversights to serious misconduct.

## The Argument for Pervasiveness of Ethical Transgression

### 1. The Necessity of Partial Disclosure and Deception

One central reason ethical transgressions are considered pervasive is the inherent tension between the need for informed consent and the methodological demands of social research. Researchers often withhold or partially disclose information to participants to avoid biasing their responses or compromising the validity of the study. This practice, known as partial disclosure or deception, is ethically contentious but sometimes deemed necessary for scientific rigor.

Bryman (2012) highlights that researchers rarely provide participants with all the information they might want to know about a project because full disclosure could influence participant behavior and invalidate results. For example, revealing hypotheses or socio-economic assumptions might bias responses ([Bryman, 2012](https://ktpu.kpi.ua/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/social-research-methods-alan-bryman.pdf); [MCQtimes, 2025](https://mcqtimes.com/why-is-it-argued-that-ethical-transgression-is-pervasive-in-social-research/)).

Similarly, the use of deception in research methodologies—such as placebo-controlled trials or psychological experiments—raises ethical concerns but is sometimes justified by the potential scientific benefits. However, deception can cause psychological distress, emotional discomfort, and loss of trust among participants, which complicates the ethical landscape ([Kyi et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11785864/)).

### 2. Practical and Methodological Challenges

Ethical decision-making in social research is complicated by practical constraints. Researchers must balance ethical ideals with the realities of data collection, participant recruitment, and research design. For instance, fully informing participants about every detail of a study may be impractical or disruptive, especially in observational or covert research settings.

The British Sociological Association (BSA) acknowledges that covert research and deception can be justified in certain circumstances to minimize reactivity and obtain authentic data ([Bryman, 2012](https://ktpu.kpi.ua/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/social-research-methods-alan-bryman.pdf)). However, this flexibility introduces ethical ambiguity and increases the risk of transgressions.

Moreover, informed consent forms, while essential, can paradoxically reduce participant willingness to engage, leading to biased samples and ethical dilemmas about participant autonomy versus research validity ([Bryman, 2012](https://ktpu.kpi.ua/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/social-research-methods-alan-bryman.pdf)).

### 3. Ambiguity and Variability in Ethical Guidelines

Ethical standards in social research are not universally fixed but vary by discipline, culture, and institutional policies. This variability creates grey areas where researchers must interpret and apply ethical principles, sometimes leading to inconsistent practices.

Research ethics committees (RECs) or institutional review boards (IRBs) face difficulties in evaluating protocols involving partial disclosure or deception due to incomplete context and complex ethical implications ([Kyi et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11785864/)). This uncertainty can result in ethical oversights or permissive approvals that allow questionable practices to proceed.

### 4. The Influence of Researcher Bias and Professional Pressures

Researchers themselves may contribute to ethical transgressions through negligence, carelessness, or intentional misconduct. Professional pressures to publish, secure funding, or achieve desired outcomes can incentivize cutting corners or employing deceptive methods ([Kyi et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11785864/)).

Furthermore, the political and social context of research influences ethical decisions. Researchers often negotiate access and cooperation with gatekeepers who may impose conditions affecting transparency and participant protection ([Bryman, 2012](https://ktpu.kpi.ua/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/social-research-methods-alan-bryman.pdf)).

### 5. Ethical Transgression as an Inevitable Aspect of Social Research

Some scholars argue that minor ethical transgressions are unavoidable given the nature of social research. The complexity of human behavior, the need for methodological rigor, and the limitations of ethical codes mean that researchers must sometimes engage in partial deception or withhold information to conduct meaningful studies ([Bryman, 2012](https://ktpu.kpi.ua/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/social-research-methods-alan-bryman.pdf)).

This perspective does not condone unethical behavior but recognizes the pragmatic challenges researchers face. It calls for ethical flexibility and ongoing dialogue to balance scientific goals with participant rights.

## Implications and Recommendations

The pervasiveness of ethical transgression in social research highlights the need for:

- **Enhanced Ethical Training:** Researchers should receive comprehensive education on ethical principles, dilemmas, and best practices, emphasizing transparency and participant welfare.

- **Robust Ethical Oversight:** Ethics committees must develop clearer guidelines for partial disclosure and deception, including standardized operating procedures and institutional awareness campaigns ([Kyi et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11785864/)).

- **Improved Informed Consent Processes:** Consent procedures should balance thoroughness with practicality, possibly incorporating verbal consent or tiered disclosure to maintain participant autonomy without compromising research integrity.

- **Promotion of Research Integrity:** Institutions and journals should enforce strict policies against misconduct and encourage open reporting of ethical challenges and resolutions.

- **Recognition of Ethical Complexity:** Ethical frameworks should allow for case-by-case evaluations, acknowledging the nuanced nature of social research ethics.

## Conclusion

Ethical transgression is argued to be pervasive in social research due to the inherent tension between methodological demands and ethical principles, practical challenges in fully informing participants, variability in ethical guidelines, researcher biases, and the complex social contexts in which research occurs. While not all transgressions are intentional or severe, the frequent occurrence of minor ethical breaches reflects the difficulties in balancing scientific rigor with respect for participant autonomy and welfare. Addressing this pervasiveness requires a multifaceted approach involving enhanced education, clearer ethical oversight, and flexible yet principled ethical frameworks.
