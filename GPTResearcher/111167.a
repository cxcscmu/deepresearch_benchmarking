# Report: Why Are Staff Leaving Higher Education?

## Introduction

The higher education sector in the United States is currently experiencing an unprecedented wave of employee turnover, often referred to as part of the broader phenomenon known as the "Great Resignation." This trend has been marked by a significant increase in voluntary departures among non-faculty staff, including administrators, professionals, and non-exempt employees. Understanding the reasons behind this exodus is crucial for institutional leaders aiming to retain talent and sustain their missions. This report synthesizes recent empirical data and qualitative research to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of why staff are leaving higher education.

## Overview of the Turnover Crisis in Higher Education

Voluntary turnover rates in higher education have reached their highest levels since systematic tracking began. According to the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA-HR), turnover for full-time exempt staff rose from 7.9% in 2020-21 to 14.3% in 2022-23, while non-exempt staff turnover increased from 9.4% to 15.2% over the same period ([CUPA-HR, 2023](https://www.cupahr.org/surveys/research-briefs/higher-ed-employee-retention-survey-findings-september-2023/)). This escalation reflects a broader national labor market trend but is particularly acute in higher education due to sector-specific challenges.

More than half (56%) of surveyed higher education employees indicated they are at least somewhat likely to seek other employment within the next 12 months, with one-third expressing a high likelihood of leaving ([HigherEdJobs, 2023](https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=3641)). The turnover is especially pronounced among younger employees, men, and people of color, as well as in specific functional areas such as student affairs and enrollment management.

## Key Reasons for Leaving

### 1. Overwork and Increased Job Demands

A dominant theme emerging from multiple studies is the perception of being overworked. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing workload pressures, with many employees working beyond their contracted hours. CUPA-HR reports that two-thirds of full-time higher education employees worked more hours than considered full-time by their institutions, with 10% working 16 or more extra hours weekly ([SCU, 2023](https://www.scuhs.edu/front-page-news/higher-ed-and-the-great-resignation/)).

Academic staff face particularly intense job demands, including increased teaching loads, larger class sizes, higher student numbers, and pressure to produce research outputs. These quantitative demands are compounded by qualitative and organizational challenges such as work-life balance difficulties, complex student support needs, organizational politics, and insufficient mental health resources ([Naidoo-Chetty & Du Plessis, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260971/)). The cumulative effect leads to job dissatisfaction, burnout, and intentions to leave.

### 2. Compensation and Economic Pressures

Compensation remains a critical factor driving turnover. Many higher education employees cite a desire for pay increases as a primary reason for considering departure. The economic climate, characterized by inflation and budgetary constraints, has led to salary stagnation and reduced benefits, intensifying financial pressures on staff ([SCU, 2023](https://www.scuhs.edu/front-page-news/higher-ed-and-the-great-resignation/)). This economic strain is particularly salient given the rising cost of living and the competitive labor market outside academia.

### 3. Lack of Remote Work Opportunities and Flexibility

The pandemic shifted employee expectations around work arrangements, with many higher education staff seeking remote or hybrid work options. However, CUPA-HR's 2023 survey highlights a persistent gap between employee desires and institutional offerings regarding remote work policies ([CUPA-HR, 2023](https://www.cupahr.org/surveys/research-briefs/higher-ed-employee-retention-survey-findings-september-2023/)). The inability to access flexible work arrangements contributes to dissatisfaction and turnover intentions.

### 4. Perceived Lack of Support and Recognition

Employees report feeling undervalued and unsupported by institutional leadership. The prioritization of enrollment numbers and political considerations over employee well-being has fostered a climate of disillusionment. Many staff feel their contributions are overlooked, and their professional development and career advancement opportunities are limited ([NASPA, 2023](https://www.naspa.org/blog/take-this-job-and-change-it-the-great-resignation-in-higher-education)).

### 5. Organizational and Political Pressures

Higher education institutions have faced increasing political interference and economic challenges, leading to budget cuts, legislative incursions, and contentious campus climates. These external pressures exacerbate workplace stress and contribute to feelings of alienation and "academic anomie," a state of normlessness and disconnection from institutional values ([Watermeyer et al., 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-024-01268-0)).

### 6. Career Realignment and Values Shift

The pandemic prompted many employees to reevaluate their career goals and personal values. A significant number of staff express a desire to seek more meaningful work, better work-life balance, and environments aligned with their values. This realignment has led to increased turnover as employees pursue opportunities outside or within higher education that better fit their aspirations ([NASPA, 2023](https://www.naspa.org/blog/take-this-job-and-change-it-the-great-resignation-in-higher-education)).

## Demographic and Functional Group Variations

Turnover intentions and actual departures are not uniform across the higher education workforce. Younger employees (under 45), men, and people of color are more likely to consider leaving their positions ([CUPA-HR, 2023](https://www.cupahr.org/surveys/research-briefs/higher-ed-employee-retention-survey-findings-september-2023/)). Functionally, student affairs professionals and administrators exhibit higher turnover rates compared to faculty, reflecting distinct job stressors and organizational dynamics in these roles ([HigherEdJobs, 2023](https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=3653)).

## Implications of Turnover

High turnover imposes both visible and invisible costs on institutions, including recruitment and training expenses, loss of institutional knowledge, decreased morale, and disruption to student services and academic programs ([Ithaka S+R, 2023](https://sr.ithaka.org/blog/the-great-resignation-and-higher-education-employees/)). The cumulative effect threatens the ability of colleges and universities to fulfill their educational missions effectively.

## Recommendations for Retention

To address these challenges, higher education leaders should consider multifaceted strategies:

- **Enhance Compensation and Benefits:** Address salary stagnation and improve benefits to remain competitive in the labor market.
- **Expand Remote and Flexible Work Options:** Align work arrangements with employee preferences to improve satisfaction.
- **Reduce Overwork:** Implement workload management practices and provide mental health support.
- **Foster Supportive Leadership:** Cultivate a culture of recognition, career development, and employee engagement.
- **Address Organizational Climate:** Mitigate political and economic pressures through transparent communication and shared governance.
- **Support Career Development:** Facilitate opportunities for professional growth aligned with employee values.

## Conclusion

The exodus of staff from higher education is driven by a complex interplay of overwork, inadequate compensation, lack of flexibility, insufficient support, and broader socio-political pressures. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these factors, catalyzing a reevaluation of work-life priorities among employees. Addressing this retention crisis requires intentional, evidence-based interventions tailored to the diverse needs of the higher education workforce.
