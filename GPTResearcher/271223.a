# Should Underaged Children Be Allowed to Own Social Media Accounts?  
## A Comprehensive and Evidence-Based Analysis  

---

### Introduction  

The question of whether underaged children should be allowed to own social media accounts is increasingly pressing in the digital age. Social media platforms have become ubiquitous, with children and adolescents engaging daily in various forms of online interaction. However, the implications of early social media use on mental health, privacy, and safety have sparked significant debate among parents, policymakers, educators, and researchers. This report examines the pros and cons of underaged children owning social media accounts, evaluates recent legislative trends, and analyzes empirical evidence on mental health impacts to provide a well-informed, balanced, and objective conclusion.

### Background and Legal Context  

In the United States, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) sets the minimum age for social media account ownership at 13, aiming to protect children’s online privacy by requiring parental consent for data collection from children under 13 (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2024). Despite this, many children under 13 circumvent these rules by falsifying their age, exposing themselves to risks without adequate legal protection ([AAP, 2024](https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/qa-portal/qa-portal-library/qa-portal-library-questions/age-to-introduce-social-media/)).

Recently, several U.S. states have enacted stricter laws. For example, Florida’s House Bill 3 (HB 3), effective January 1, 2025, prohibits children under 14 from having their own social media accounts, with enforcement mechanisms including age verification and account termination for violators ([Social Media Victims Law Center, 2025](https://socialmediavictims.org/blog/what-to-know-about-floridas-new-social-media-law/)). Similarly, Utah and other states have passed laws requiring parental consent and age verification, reflecting growing legislative efforts to mitigate social media harms among minors ([Mayer Brown, 2025](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/protecting-the-next-generation-how-states-and-the-ftc-are-holding-businesses-accountable-for-childrens-online-privacy)).

### The Pros of Underaged Children Owning Social Media Accounts  

#### 1. Social Connection and Communication  
Social media enables children to maintain connections with friends and family, fostering communication skills and social support networks. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat allow children to express opinions, share creative content, and engage in communities, which can contribute positively to identity exploration and skill development ([The Digital Parents, 2023](https://thedigitalparents.com/social-media/the-pros-and-cons-of-children-having-their-own-social-media-accounts/); Behavioral Health News, 2025).

#### 2. Access to Educational and Mental Health Resources  
Many adolescents use social media to access educational content and mental health resources. Professionals and organizations disseminate evidence-based guidance on coping strategies, reducing stigma, and promoting well-being ([Behavioral Health News, 2025](https://behavioralhealthnews.org/the-impact-of-social-media-on-youth-mental-health-risks-benefits-and-family-approaches/)). This access can be particularly valuable for marginalized groups such as LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC youth, who find affirmation and culturally relevant support online.

#### 3. Digital Literacy and Skill Development  
Managing social media accounts helps children develop digital skills essential for modern life. Early exposure, when guided appropriately, can enhance technological proficiency and critical thinking related to online information evaluation ([The Digital Parents, 2023](https://thedigitalparents.com/social-media/the-pros-and-cons-of-children-having-their-own-social-media-accounts/)).

### The Cons of Underaged Children Owning Social Media Accounts  

#### 1. Mental Health Risks  
There is substantial evidence linking early and excessive social media use with negative mental health outcomes, including increased anxiety, depression, stress, and body image concerns. The dopamine-driven design of social media platforms fosters addictive behaviors, impairing impulse control and attentional capacities in youth ([Behavioral Health News, 2025](https://behavioralhealthnews.org/the-impact-of-social-media-on-youth-mental-health-risks-benefits-and-family-approaches/); Scientific Reports, 2024).

A cross-sectional study among university students found associations between social media use and elevated levels of depression, eating disorders, and suicidality, especially among young females ([Scientific Reports, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94355-w)). Problematic social media use correlates with mental health challenges in youth receiving clinical care for depression and suicidal ideation ([PubMed, 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39800073/)).

#### 2. Exposure to Cyberbullying and Online Harassment  
Cyberbullying is a significant risk, with studies showing that nearly 46% of children have experienced online bullying, which exacerbates mental health issues and can lead to social isolation ([The Digital Parents, 2023](https://thedigitalparents.com/social-media/the-pros-and-cons-of-children-having-their-own-social-media-accounts/); Behavioral Health News, 2025). Vulnerable populations, including BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ youth, face disproportionate harassment ([Behavioral Health News, 2025](https://behavioralhealthnews.org/the-impact-of-social-media-on-youth-mental-health-risks-benefits-and-family-approaches/)).

#### 3. Privacy and Safety Concerns  
Children often lack the cognitive maturity to understand privacy risks, leading to impulsive sharing of personal information and susceptibility to online predators. Despite COPPA and other regulations, enforcement is challenging, and many platforms do not adequately verify age or protect minors from targeted advertising and data exploitation ([Openr, 2022](https://openr.co/the-pros-and-cons-of-children-using-social-media/); Mayer Brown, 2025).

#### 4. Impact on Real-Life Social Development  
Excessive social media use can displace face-to-face interactions and physical activities, potentially hindering social skills development and contributing to sedentary lifestyles ([The Digital Parents, 2023](https://thedigitalparents.com/social-media/the-pros-and-cons-of-children-having-their-own-social-media-accounts/)).

### Legislative and Societal Responses  

Several states have enacted or proposed laws to restrict social media access for minors, reflecting concerns about mental health and safety. Florida’s HB 3, for example, bans social media accounts for children under 14 and mandates age verification, with penalties for non-compliance ([DISA, 2025](https://disa.org/impact-of-new-florida-legislation-effective-2025/)). Similar laws in Utah and Tennessee require parental consent and provide parents with monitoring tools ([Mayer Brown, 2025](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/protecting-the-next-generation-how-states-and-the-ftc-are-holding-businesses-accountable-for-childrens-online-privacy)).

Public opinion surveys indicate strong adult support for parental consent, age verification, and time restrictions on minors’ social media use, though teens are less supportive, particularly regarding time limits ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/31/81-of-us-adults-versus-46-of-teens-favor-parental-consent-for-minors-to-use-social-media/)).

### Discussion  

The evidence suggests that while social media offers notable benefits for social connection, education, and identity development, the risks for underaged children—particularly those under 13 or 14—are substantial and well-documented. Mental health challenges, cyberbullying, privacy violations, and developmental concerns weigh heavily against unrestricted access.

Given the cognitive and emotional immaturity of many children under 14, they are often ill-equipped to navigate the complexities and dangers of social media independently. Age verification and parental consent mechanisms, while imperfect, are critical tools in mitigating these risks.

Moreover, legislative trends toward restricting social media access for younger children reflect a precautionary approach aligned with current scientific understanding. These laws aim to protect children’s mental health and privacy while allowing older adolescents, who may have greater maturity, to engage with social media under appropriate supervision.

Parental involvement remains essential. Open communication, education on online safety, and promoting balanced media use alongside real-life activities can help children develop healthier digital habits.

### Conclusion and Recommendation  

Based on the comprehensive review of current research, legal frameworks, and societal perspectives, **underaged children, particularly those under 14, should generally not be allowed to own social media accounts independently**. The risks to mental health, privacy, and safety outweigh the benefits at this developmental stage.

However, social media use by older adolescents (14 and above) may be appropriate when combined with parental oversight, education, and platform safeguards. Policymakers should continue to enforce and refine age verification and parental consent laws, while social media companies must improve protective measures against harmful content and addictive features.

Parents and educators should prioritize digital literacy and healthy social media habits to empower youth to use these platforms responsibly as they mature.
