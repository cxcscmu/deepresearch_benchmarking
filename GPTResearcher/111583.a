# Why Centers of Excellence Fail: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Centers of Excellence (CoEs) are specialized entities within organizations designed to concentrate expertise, standardize best practices, and drive innovation in particular domains. They promise enhanced performance, innovation, and operational efficiency by centralizing knowledge and resources. However, despite their potential, many CoEs fail to achieve their intended impact, leading to wasted investments and missed opportunities. This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of why Centers of Excellence fail, drawing on recent and authoritative sources across healthcare, corporate, and operational domains. The objective is to identify concrete causes of failure and propose informed perspectives to guide future CoE initiatives.

## Defining Centers of Excellence

A Center of Excellence is typically a team or entity that builds deep expertise in a specific area and disseminates this knowledge across the organization to promote consistency, innovation, and superior outcomes ([UserTesting, 2023](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/coe-center-of-excellence)). In healthcare, CoEs focus on delivering high-quality, interdisciplinary care for specific medical conditions, while in corporate settings they aim to standardize processes and foster innovation.

## Common Reasons for Failure of Centers of Excellence

### 1. Lack of Clear Strategy and Alignment with Organizational Vision

One of the most critical reasons CoEs fail is the absence of a clear, coherent strategy aligned with the broader organizational goals. Without this alignment, CoEs struggle to demonstrate value or drive innovation effectively. Misalignment leads to fragmented efforts, unclear priorities, and diminished executive support, which undermines the CoE’s legitimacy and impact ([UserTesting, 2023](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/coe-center-of-excellence)).

### 2. Insufficient Leadership and Buy-In

Strong leadership commitment is essential for the authorization, funding, and sustainability of CoEs. Failure to secure and maintain buy-in from top executives and departmental leaders results in inadequate resources and support. This can cause CoEs to become isolated or underpowered, limiting their ability to influence organizational practices or scale initiatives ([PMC5516836, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5516836/)).

### 3. Poor Engagement and Participation

Active engagement of CoE members and stakeholders is vital. Many CoEs suffer from low participation, leading to minimal collaboration, knowledge sharing, and shared ownership. This disengagement reduces the CoE’s effectiveness and ability to drive meaningful change. Strategies such as fostering open communication, involving team members early, and emphasizing shared goals are necessary to overcome resistance and build commitment ([Your Learning Academy, 2024](https://yourlearningacademy.online/top-5-reasons-why-corporate-centers-of-excellence-fail-to-make-an-impact)).

### 4. Siloed Knowledge and Ineffective Knowledge Management

CoEs are designed to centralize and disseminate expertise. However, if knowledge remains siloed within the CoE and is not effectively shared across the organization, the broader benefits are lost. Failure to implement robust knowledge management systems and training programs prevents the institutionalization of best practices and continuous learning ([UserTesting, 2023](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/coe-center-of-excellence)).

### 5. Limited Scope and Incremental Focus

CoEs that focus solely on incremental improvements rather than transformational change fail to keep the organization competitive. A narrow scope restricts innovation and limits the CoE’s ability to address evolving business challenges or leverage emerging technologies ([UserTesting, 2023](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/coe-center-of-excellence)).

### 6. Inadequate Performance Measurement and Accountability

Without clear metrics and regular performance evaluations, CoEs cannot demonstrate their value or identify areas for improvement. The absence of a performance management framework leads to stagnation and loss of stakeholder confidence. Establishing KPIs aligned with strategic objectives is crucial for sustaining momentum and justifying continued investment ([UserTesting, 2023](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/coe-center-of-excellence)).

### 7. Resource Constraints and Lack of Training

Limited access to necessary resources, including skilled personnel, technology, and funding, hampers CoE development. Insufficient training and support prevent teams from reaching their full potential and adapting to new methodologies or tools. Early identification and remediation of resource gaps are essential ([COE Director, 2024](https://coedirector.com/qa/7-unexpected-challenges-in-building-a-center-of-excellence/)).

### 8. Resistance to Change and Cultural Barriers

Organizational inertia and resistance from employees accustomed to existing workflows can obstruct CoE initiatives. Overcoming this requires deliberate change management efforts, transparent communication, and involvement of stakeholders to build trust and demonstrate benefits ([COE Director, 2024](https://coedirector.com/qa/7-unexpected-challenges-in-building-a-center-of-excellence/)).

### 9. Overlapping Responsibilities and Redundancy

Proliferation of multiple CoEs without clear differentiation can lead to overlap, confusion, and inefficiency. Organizations must carefully consider the number and focus of CoEs to avoid redundancy and ensure each center delivers distinct value ([UserTesting, 2023](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/coe-center-of-excellence)).

### 10. Failure to Adapt to Evolving Business Needs

Static CoE models that do not evolve with changing market conditions, technologies, or organizational priorities become obsolete. Continuous alignment with business goals and agility in strategy execution are necessary for sustained relevance ([COE Director, 2024](https://coedirector.com/qa/7-unexpected-challenges-in-building-a-center-of-excellence/)).

## Sector-Specific Insights: Healthcare CoEs

In healthcare, CoEs aim to consolidate expertise to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency. However, empirical studies reveal mixed results regarding their effectiveness. Some evaluations found that designated Centers of Excellence hospitals are only modestly better than non-designated ones in outcomes, raising concerns about the criteria used for designation and the actual superiority of care ([Mehrotra & Dimick, 2015](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Fulltext/2015/02000/Ensuring_Excellence_in_Centers_of_Excellence.4.aspx)).

Moreover, CoE programs can have unintended negative consequences, such as reduced access for minority populations due to travel distances and disruption of existing patient-physician relationships. These factors underscore the need for improved designation methods and evidence-based validation of CoE excellence ([Mehrotra & Dimick, 2015](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Fulltext/2015/02000/Ensuring_Excellence_in_Centers_of_Excellence.4.aspx)).

## Lessons from Supply Chain CoEs

Studies in supply chain management show that having a CoE alone does not guarantee improved operational performance. Success depends on clear definitions of excellence aligned with business strategy and proactive use of analytics. Companies with strong what-if analysis capabilities and proactive analytics outperform those relying solely on CoEs. This highlights the importance of integrating CoEs with data-driven decision-making tools and strategic clarity ([Cecere, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-reasons-why-supply-chain-centers-excellence-failed-lora-cecere-gf0ue/)).

## Operational and Corporate CoEs: Broader Challenges

Corporate CoEs face challenges such as ineffective technology use, poor alignment with business needs, and lack of continuous learning cultures. These issues contribute to failure in driving innovation and transformation. Addressing these requires investment in training, clear scalability processes, and leadership that fosters buy-in and strategic alignment ([Your Learning Academy, 2024](https://yourlearningacademy.online/top-5-reasons-why-corporate-centers-of-excellence-fail-to-make-an-impact)).

## The Role of Leadership and Organizational Culture

Leadership changes can profoundly impact CoE success. Organizations with strong, consistent leadership tend to sustain CoE initiatives, while those experiencing leadership turnover often see declines in performance and engagement ([Lassiter, 2025](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/why-good-organizations-sometimes-fail-pen-jan-2025/)). Moreover, complacency and failure to continuously assess and improve CoE operations contribute to decline.

## Recommendations for Avoiding Failure

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations emerge for organizations seeking to establish or sustain successful CoEs:

- **Develop and Communicate a Clear Strategic Vision:** Ensure CoE goals align tightly with organizational objectives and communicate this vision broadly.

- **Secure and Sustain Leadership Commitment:** Engage top executives and departmental leaders to provide ongoing support and resources.

- **Foster Active Engagement and Collaboration:** Promote open communication, involve stakeholders early, and create shared ownership.

- **Implement Robust Knowledge Management:** Establish systems for capturing, sharing, and institutionalizing best practices.

- **Define Clear Performance Metrics:** Use KPIs aligned with strategic goals and conduct regular evaluations.

- **Invest in Training and Resources:** Address skill gaps and provide necessary tools for CoE teams.

- **Manage Change Effectively:** Address resistance through transparent communication and involvement.

- **Avoid Redundancy:** Carefully plan the number and scope of CoEs to prevent overlap.

- **Adapt Continuously:** Regularly review and adjust CoE strategies to evolving business needs.

- **Integrate Data and Analytics:** Leverage proactive analytics to enhance decision-making and operational impact.

## Conclusion

Centers of Excellence hold significant promise for driving innovation, standardizing best practices, and enhancing organizational performance. However, their failure is often rooted in strategic misalignment, leadership gaps, poor engagement, resource constraints, and inability to adapt. Healthcare and supply chain studies illustrate the complexity and potential unintended consequences of CoE initiatives. To realize their full potential, organizations must approach CoE development with clear strategy, strong leadership, robust knowledge management, and continuous performance evaluation. Only through such disciplined and adaptive approaches can CoEs become true engines of excellence rather than costly experiments.
