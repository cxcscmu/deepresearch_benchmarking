# Why Are Cubans Protesting? A Comprehensive Analysis of the Causes and Context of Recent Cuban Protests

## Introduction

In recent years, Cuba has witnessed a notable increase in public protests, a phenomenon historically rare on the tightly controlled island. The protests, which have gained international attention, are primarily driven by a severe economic crisis marked by food and medicine shortages, prolonged power outages, inflation, and widespread social dissatisfaction. This report provides a detailed, well-structured, and comprehensive analysis of the underlying causes of these protests, drawing from a wide range of reliable and recent sources. It aims to present an objective understanding of why Cubans are protesting, incorporating economic data, political context, and social dynamics, while also assessing the role of U.S. policies and internal Cuban governance.

## Economic Crisis as the Primary Driver

### Severity of the Economic Crisis

Cuba is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in over three decades, characterized by a sharp contraction of the economy, soaring inflation, and critical shortages of essential goods. The economy shrank by nearly 2% in 2023, with inflation reaching official estimates of around 24.88%, though some experts believe it to be higher ([El País, 2025](https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-04-20/the-chain-of-favors-that-keeps-cubans-afloat-in-the-face-of-state-abandonment.html); [People's World, 2024](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/u-s-policy-implicated-in-the-economic-crisis-driving-cuban-protests/)).

Fuel prices have surged dramatically, with increases exceeding 500% in some months, and electricity rates have risen by 25%. These price hikes have exacerbated the cost of living for ordinary Cubans, who rely on an average monthly state salary of approximately $16 ([NBC News, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-hundreds-take-streets-rare-protests-economic-crisis-deepens-rcna143871)). The government’s austerity measures, including steep hikes in gasoline prices, have further strained household budgets.

### Food and Medicine Shortages

Food scarcity is a critical issue fueling public discontent. Cuba imports over 70% to 80% of its food, and disruptions in international trade, compounded by inflation and limited foreign currency reserves, have led to shortages of staples such as rice, cooking oil, eggs, milk, and meat ([ABC News, 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-protestors-demand-answers-economic-crisis/story?id=78839073); [The Nation, 2024](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-embargo-sanctions-scarcity-rubio/)). Medicine shortages are equally dire, with hospitals postponing surgeries due to lack of supplies and equipment, and many Cubans forced to buy medicines on the black market at inflated prices ([The Nation, 2024](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-embargo-sanctions-scarcity-rubio/)).

### Energy Crisis and Blackouts

Frequent and prolonged power outages have become a daily reality for many Cubans, with some areas experiencing blackouts lasting up to 18 hours a day ([BBC News, 2024](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68595885); [AP News, 2024](https://apnews.com/article/cuba-santiago-protest-power-outages-ee4b60277107ab3ce781b6e912198304)). These blackouts disrupt daily life, hinder food preservation, and exacerbate the hardships caused by shortages. The energy crisis is largely attributed to fuel shortages, which in turn are linked to both economic difficulties and external factors.

### Mass Emigration and Brain Drain

The economic hardships have triggered a significant exodus of Cubans seeking better opportunities abroad. Over one million Cubans, nearly 10% of the population, have left the country in recent years, including 425,000 migrants arriving in the United States in 2022 and 2023 alone ([The Nation, 2024](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-embargo-sanctions-scarcity-rubio/); [People's World, 2024](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/u-s-policy-implicated-in-the-economic-crisis-driving-cuban-protests/)). This migration includes critical professionals such as healthcare workers (9% of the workforce) and thousands of educators, further weakening the country’s capacity to address its crises.

## Role of U.S. Policy and the Embargo

### Impact of the U.S. Embargo

The longstanding U.S. embargo on Cuba, in place since the early 1960s and intensified under the Trump administration, is widely cited by Cuban officials and some analysts as a major factor exacerbating the economic crisis. The embargo restricts trade, investment, and financial transactions, limiting Cuba’s ability to import food, medicine, fuel, and other essential goods ([People's World, 2024](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/u-s-policy-implicated-in-the-economic-crisis-driving-cuban-protests/); [NBC News, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-exploded-protests-goes-us-embargo-pandemic-rcna1399)).

The embargo has also disrupted remittances, a vital source of income for many Cubans, by closing Western Union’s operations in Cuba and restricting travel by Cuban Americans who traditionally bring food and medicine during visits ([NBC News, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-exploded-protests-goes-us-embargo-pandemic-rcna1399)). The COVID-19 pandemic further compounded these disruptions by halting tourism and travel, which are critical to Cuba’s economy.

### Criticism and Limitations of the Embargo Narrative

While the embargo undeniably imposes significant constraints, some economists and observers argue that it is not the sole or even the primary cause of Cuba’s economic woes. Cuba’s centrally planned, Soviet-style economy, characterized by inefficiency and resistance to market reforms, has also played a critical role in the country’s stagnation and inability to respond effectively to crises ([NBC News, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-exploded-protests-goes-us-embargo-pandemic-rcna1399); [Cuba Capacity Building Project, 2025](https://horizontecubano.law.columbia.edu/news/magnitude-economic-crisis-cuba)).

Experts like Ricardo Torres and Pavel Vidal emphasize that economic reforms toward a market-oriented system are necessary for sustainable recovery, independent of the embargo’s removal ([NBC News, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-hundreds-take-streets-rare-protests-economic-crisis-deepens-rcna143871); [NBC News, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-exploded-protests-goes-us-embargo-pandemic-rcna1399)).

## Political and Social Context

### Government Response and Repression

The Cuban government, led by President Miguel Díaz-Canel, acknowledges the protests and the economic difficulties but attributes much of the unrest to external interference, particularly by the United States. Díaz-Canel has accused “terrorists” and “enemies of the Revolution” based in the U.S. of fomenting unrest via social media and other means ([People's World, 2024](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/u-s-policy-implicated-in-the-economic-crisis-driving-cuban-protests/); [Remezcla, 2024](https://remezcla.com/culture/cuba-breaks-out-rare-protests-again-heres-what-happened/)).

The government has also employed police presence and repression to contain protests, with reports of arbitrary detentions and harassment of activists and critics. Human Rights Watch and other organizations document ongoing violations of civil liberties, including the detention of hundreds of political prisoners and suppression of dissent ([Human Rights Watch, 2025](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/cuba)).

### Social Discontent and Civil Society

The protests reflect widespread social discontent beyond economic grievances. Issues such as lack of political freedoms, repression, and inequality have fueled frustration. The participation of diverse groups, including Black Cubans who face institutional discrimination, highlights the multifaceted nature of the unrest ([In These Times, 2021](https://inthesetimes.com/article/cuban-revolution-protest-july-united-states)).

Civil society and opposition groups remain fragmented and lack unified leadership or a coherent program for change, limiting their ability to translate protests into political transformation ([Cubasiglo21, 2025](https://cubasiglo21.com/cuba-2025-possibilities-and-probabilities/)).

### Role of the Cuban Diaspora

The Cuban diaspora, especially in the United States, plays a significant role in supporting protests through remittances, advocacy, and organizing global demonstrations demanding political prisoners' release and democratic reforms ([CiberCuba, 2025](https://en.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-03-24-u1-e208933-s27061-nid299490-convocan-protestas-globales-libertad-presos)). However, the diaspora is politically diverse and lacks a unified agenda, which complicates its influence on the island’s politics.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Cubans are protesting primarily due to a profound and multifaceted economic crisis that has severely undermined their quality of life. The crisis is marked by inflation, food and medicine shortages, prolonged blackouts, and mass emigration. While the U.S. embargo and related sanctions have undeniably exacerbated these problems by restricting trade, investment, and remittances, internal factors such as Cuba’s centrally planned economy, government mismanagement, and resistance to reforms are equally significant contributors.

The protests are not merely economic but are also expressions of political and social frustration, including demands for greater freedoms and improved governance. The Cuban government’s repressive response and attribution of blame to external enemies have not addressed the root causes, leading to persistent unrest.

To move forward, a combination of lifting or easing the embargo, implementing meaningful economic reforms towards a more market-oriented system, and expanding political openness will be necessary. The Cuban people’s resilience and desire for change are evident, but sustainable progress requires both internal transformation and constructive international engagement.
