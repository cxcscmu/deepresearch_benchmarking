# Why Do People Want to Overturn Roe v. Wade? — A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision *Roe v. Wade* established a constitutional right to abortion in the United States, grounding it in the right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. For nearly five decades, this ruling shaped abortion access nationwide, limiting states’ ability to restrict abortion, particularly in the first trimester. However, on June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned *Roe* in the case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization*, returning the authority to regulate abortion to individual states. This seismic shift has reignited debates about the motivations behind the push to overturn *Roe*.

This report provides an in-depth, objective analysis of why people—primarily conservative legal scholars, political actors, and social movements—have sought to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. Drawing from legal, political, social, and ideological perspectives, it examines the constitutional arguments, political strategies, and broader cultural contexts driving the anti-*Roe* movement.

## Historical and Legal Arguments Against Roe v. Wade

### Constitutional Originalism and Historical Interpretation

A central argument for overturning *Roe* is rooted in constitutional originalism—the belief that the Constitution should be interpreted according to the original understanding at the time of its framing. Opponents of *Roe* argue that the Constitution makes no explicit reference to abortion or a right to privacy encompassing abortion decisions. Justice Samuel Alito, author of the majority opinion in *Dobbs*, contended that *Roe* was “egregiously wrong from the start” because it created a right to abortion out of “thin air” without historical or textual basis ([FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/), [Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/history-stare-decicis-and-fallout-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-legal-reasoning-in-bombshell-draft-opinion-that-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

Alito emphasized that only rights “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” qualify as fundamental rights deserving strict judicial protection. Since abortion was historically regulated by states for nearly two centuries before *Roe*, he argued it should be returned to the democratic process ([Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/history-stare-decicis-and-fallout-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-legal-reasoning-in-bombshell-draft-opinion-that-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

### Critique of Judicial Overreach and Stare Decisis

Opponents of *Roe* also criticize it as an example of judicial overreach, where the Court usurped legislative authority by imposing a nationwide abortion regime. The *Dobbs* majority viewed *Roe* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as destabilizing legal chaos rather than settling the abortion debate ([FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/), [Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/history-stare-decicis-and-fallout-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-legal-reasoning-in-bombshell-draft-opinion-that-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

The principle of stare decisis—respect for precedent—was weighed, but the majority concluded that *Roe* failed key criteria such as sound reasoning, workability, and reliance interests. They argued that the Court is not the proper body to resolve the moral and political questions surrounding abortion; instead, these should be left to state legislatures and the democratic process ([Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/history-stare-decicis-and-fallout-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-legal-reasoning-in-bombshell-draft-opinion-that-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

## Political and Social Motivations

### Longstanding Conservative and Religious Opposition

The movement to overturn *Roe* has been a central goal of social conservatives, particularly religious groups, for decades. The decision to overturn *Roe* was described as the culmination of a 50-year effort by mainly Republican conservatives involving fundraising, political organizing, judicial nominations, and legislative strategies ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/26/1107713190/where-will-conservatives-focus-their-political-energy-now-roe-has-been-overturne)).

Conservative Christian movements and right-wing legal organizations have viewed *Roe* as a moral wrong, framing abortion as the taking of innocent life. Their strategy included appointing conservative justices who were skeptical of *Roe* during Republican administrations, notably under President Donald Trump, who appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, shifting the Court’s balance ([The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/roe-v-wade-overturned-supreme-court-justices-b2116042.html), [FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/what-gorsuch-kavanaugh-and-barrett-said-about-roe-at-confirmation-hearings/)).

### Return of Abortion Regulation to States

A key political argument is that abortion regulation should be a matter for states, not the federal judiciary. The *Dobbs* decision explicitly returned authority to the people and their elected representatives, reflecting a federalist approach. Proponents argue this respects democratic principles by allowing diverse state populations to decide abortion laws according to local values ([FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-courts-argument-for-overturning-roe-v-wade/), [Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/history-stare-decicis-and-fallout-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-legal-reasoning-in-bombshell-draft-opinion-that-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

This approach appeals to those who believe that the Supreme Court should not impose uniform moral standards on a pluralistic society and that abortion is a deeply divisive issue better resolved through political processes.

### Concerns About Judicial Legitimacy and Precedent

Some conservatives expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the Court and the stability of legal precedents. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, emphasized during his confirmation hearings the importance of precedent and the need to consider reliance interests and workability before overturning landmark cases ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/03/1096108319/roe-v-wade-alito-conservative-justices-confirmation-hearings)).

However, the majority in *Dobbs* rejected these concerns, arguing that *Roe* and *Casey* had failed to create settled expectations and had instead fueled ongoing controversy and legal uncertainty ([Law & Crime](https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/history-stare-decicis-and-fallout-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-legal-reasoning-in-bombshell-draft-opinion-that-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

## Broader Ideological and Social Contexts

### Intersection with Broader Conservative Agendas

The overturning of *Roe* fits within a broader conservative agenda to reshape American legal and political landscapes. This includes efforts to restrict abortion access, promote traditional family values, and influence judicial philosophy toward originalism and textualism ([The Week](https://theweek.com/roe-v-wade/1013205/3-explosive-political-consequences-of-overturning-roe)).

The decision also reflects strategic judicial appointments aimed at reversing not only *Roe* but potentially other precedents related to substantive due process rights, such as same-sex marriage and contraception access, as noted by Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn)).

### Sociopolitical Implications and Critiques

Critics argue that the push to overturn *Roe* is intertwined with broader social and political power dynamics, including systemic racism and moral conservatism. The rollback of abortion rights disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly Black and Hispanic women, exacerbating health inequities and limiting bodily autonomy ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9404636/), [Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41134-024-00366-4)).

Further, some scholars highlight the convergence of anti-abortion rhetoric with exclusionary ideologies such as white nationalism and nativism, which use “protecting the unborn” as a cover for advancing agendas that perpetuate systemic inequalities ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41134-024-00366-4)).

### Public Opinion and Political Polarization

Public opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans opposed overturning *Roe*, reflecting deep societal divisions on abortion. However, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority prioritized constitutional interpretation over public sentiment ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/26/1107713190/where-will-conservatives-focus-their-political-energy-now-roe-has-been-overturne)).

The decision has intensified political polarization, with activists on both sides becoming more radicalized. Some pro-life advocates face the challenge of demonstrating support for women beyond restricting abortion access, while pro-choice supporters mobilize to protect reproductive rights at state and federal levels ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/26/1107713190/where-will-conservatives-focus-their-political-energy-now-roe-has-been-overturne), [The Week](https://theweek.com/roe-v-wade/1013205/3-explosive-political-consequences-of-overturning-roe)).

## Conclusion

The desire to overturn *Roe v. Wade* stems from a complex interplay of constitutional, political, ideological, and social factors. Legally, opponents argue that *Roe* lacked constitutional grounding and represented judicial overreach, thus warranting reversal to restore democratic decision-making to states. Politically, the movement reflects decades of conservative mobilization aimed at reshaping American jurisprudence and policy around abortion and related social issues.

However, this legal and political project is also embedded within broader social dynamics, including religious conservatism, systemic inequalities, and ideological movements that complicate the discourse around reproductive rights. The overturning of *Roe* has profound implications not only for abortion access but also for the future of constitutional rights, federalism, and social justice in the United States.
