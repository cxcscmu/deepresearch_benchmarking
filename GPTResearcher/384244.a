# The Relationship Between Thinking, Intelligence, and Creativity: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Understanding the interplay between thinking, intelligence, and creativity is a complex endeavor that has engaged scholars across psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. These constructs, while distinct, are deeply intertwined in human cognition and behavior. This report synthesizes contemporary empirical findings and theoretical frameworks to provide a comprehensive, nuanced understanding of how these faculties relate, interact, and differ. Drawing on recent peer-reviewed studies and authoritative sources, this analysis aims to clarify the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying intelligence and creativity, their shared and unique components, and the role of different types of thinking in mediating their relationship.

## Defining the Constructs: Thinking, Intelligence, and Creativity

**Thinking** is a broad cognitive process encompassing mental activities such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and idea generation. It can be subdivided into **convergent thinking**, which seeks a single correct solution, and **divergent thinking**, which involves generating multiple novel ideas or solutions ([The Lab School, 2025](https://www.labschool.org/news/stories/what-are-current-theoretical-models-relationship-between-intelligence-and-creativity)).

**Intelligence** traditionally refers to the ability to reason, learn, and solve problems, often measured by IQ tests emphasizing convergent thinking and abstract reasoning. Modern theories, such as Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory, expand intelligence to include analytical, creative, and practical components, recognizing creativity as a facet of intelligence ([Psychologs, 2025](https://www.psychologs.com/the-hidden-links-between-creativity-and-intelligence/)).

**Creativity** is the capacity to produce ideas or products that are both novel and useful. It is closely associated with divergent thinking, originality, and intrinsic motivation. Creativity involves complex cognitive control processes that enable the generation, evaluation, and refinement of ideas ([Beaty et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6034981/)).

## Theoretical Perspectives on the Relationship

### Overlapping but Distinct Constructs

Sternberg and O’Hara (1999) proposed a framework encompassing five possible relationships between intelligence and creativity: one as a subset of the other, coincident sets, independent but overlapping sets, or completely disjoint sets. Empirical evidence supports the view that intelligence and creativity are overlapping but distinct constructs, sharing some cognitive and neural substrates while also engaging unique processes ([Kaufman & Plucker, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3682183/)).

### The Threshold Hypothesis

One influential but contested theory is the **threshold hypothesis**, which posits that intelligence is necessary for creativity up to a certain point (often an IQ of about 120), beyond which higher intelligence does not predict greater creativity. However, recent rigorous analyses challenge this hypothesis, suggesting a linear relationship between intelligence and creativity across the spectrum, with no clear threshold ([Forthmann et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7709632/)).

### Cognitive Control as a Common Mechanism

Cognitive control processes, including executive functions such as updating, inhibition, and shifting, are critical for both intelligence and creativity. These functions enable flexible manipulation of information, suppression of dominant but irrelevant responses, and strategic retrieval from memory, facilitating both convergent and divergent thinking ([Benedek et al., 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4175011/); [Beaty et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6034981/)).

## Empirical Evidence on Cognitive and Neural Correlates

### Behavioral and Psychometric Findings

- **Correlation Between Intelligence and Creativity**: Studies consistently find a positive correlation between intelligence (especially fluid intelligence) and creative potential measured by divergent thinking tasks, though the strength of this correlation varies by the creativity measure used ([Nusbaum & Silvia, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3682183/)).

- **Role of Executive Functions**: Executive functions, particularly updating and inhibition, predict individual differences in both intelligence and creativity. Updating ability explains a significant portion of their correlation, while inhibition is more specifically related to creativity ([Benedek et al., 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4175011/)).

- **Crystallized Intelligence and Creativity**: Crystallized intelligence, reflecting accumulated knowledge and verbal abilities, shows higher correlations with certain creative tasks, such as metaphor creation and elaboration of ideas, highlighting the importance of domain knowledge in creative processes ([Cho et al., 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3682183/)).

### Neural Network Perspectives

- **Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT)**: Intelligence is associated with activation and connectivity in frontal and parietal brain regions, facilitating reasoning and problem-solving ([Jung & Haier, 2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6034981/)).

- **Creativity and Brain Dynamics**: Creativity involves dynamic interactions between the default mode network (DMN), which supports self-referential and imaginative thought, and the executive control network (ECN), responsible for goal-directed attention and inhibition. This interplay enables the generation and evaluation of novel ideas ([Beaty et al., 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706335/)).

- **Network Control Theory Findings**: Intelligence relates to the ability to drive the brain into easy-to-reach states in contextual association regions, whereas creativity involves driving the brain into both easy and difficult-to-reach states, particularly in regions integrating bottom-up and top-down processes ([Cocchi et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6034981/)).

- **Neural Signal Complexity**: Measures of brain signal complexity during creative thinking and cognitive control tasks reveal shared neural inhibition states underlying fluency and originality in creativity, but these neural patterns do not fully overlap with those associated with fluid and crystallized intelligence ([Kaur et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706335/)).

## The Role of Different Types of Thinking

### Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking

- **Convergent Thinking**: Typically linked to intelligence, convergent thinking involves narrowing down multiple possibilities to find a single correct answer. Intelligence tests often measure this ability ([Psychologs, 2025](https://www.psychologs.com/the-hidden-links-between-creativity-and-intelligence/)).

- **Divergent Thinking**: Central to creativity, divergent thinking is the ability to generate multiple, diverse, and original ideas. It requires cognitive flexibility and associative abilities, which are supported by executive functions and knowledge retrieval ([The Lab School, 2025](https://www.labschool.org/news/stories/what-are-current-theoretical-models-relationship-between-intelligence-and-creativity)).

### Integration in Problem Solving

Creative problem solving involves both divergent and convergent thinking stages: idea generation (divergent) and idea evaluation/selection (convergent). Intelligence contributes to the evaluation and refinement stages, highlighting the complementary roles of these cognitive processes ([Mumford et al., 2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5292426/)).

## Personality and Motivational Factors

Personality traits, especially Openness/Intellect, mediate the relationship between intelligence and creativity. Openness fosters curiosity and engagement with new information, which supports creative potential, while Intellect relates more closely to cognitive abilities ([Feist, 1998; DeYoung et al., 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6866609/)).

Intrinsic motivation also plays a crucial role in creativity, enabling sustained engagement with creative tasks beyond what intelligence alone predicts ([Psychologs, 2025](https://www.psychologs.com/the-hidden-links-between-creativity-and-intelligence/)).

## Critical Evaluation and Synthesis

The relationship between thinking, intelligence, and creativity is best conceptualized as a **complex, dynamic interplay** rather than a simple linear or threshold-based association. Intelligence provides foundational cognitive resources, such as working memory, reasoning, and knowledge, that support creative thought, especially in the evaluation and elaboration of ideas. Creativity, however, extends beyond intelligence by engaging unique cognitive control processes that facilitate the generation of novel and original ideas through divergent thinking.

Neurocognitive evidence supports overlapping but distinct brain networks underlying these faculties, with creativity requiring flexible transitions between brain states and the integration of bottom-up and top-down processes. Executive functions, particularly updating and inhibition, serve as shared mechanisms that partly explain the covariance between intelligence and creativity.

The threshold hypothesis, once popular, lacks robust empirical support and may oversimplify the nuanced relationship. Instead, intelligence and creativity appear to relate in a **linear and continuous manner**, moderated by task demands, measurement methods, and individual differences in personality and motivation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, thinking, intelligence, and creativity are interrelated cognitive constructs that collectively contribute to human problem-solving and innovation. Intelligence, characterized by convergent thinking and executive control, provides essential cognitive infrastructure for creativity. Creativity, characterized by divergent thinking and originality, relies on but also transcends intelligence through dynamic cognitive control and motivational factors. Their relationship is best understood as overlapping yet distinct, with shared executive functions and neural substrates facilitating their interaction. Future research integrating behavioral, neurocognitive, and personality perspectives will further elucidate the mechanisms linking these vital cognitive abilities.
