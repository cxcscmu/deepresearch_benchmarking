# Report on the Increasing Oil Prices in 2025

## Introduction

Oil prices have experienced significant fluctuations in 2025, with notable increases that have impacted global economies, consumers, and energy markets. Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind these price rises is crucial for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and consumers alike. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors driving the increase in oil prices in 2025, drawing on recent data and expert analyses to deliver an in-depth, objective overview.

## Supply and Demand Dynamics

### Revised Demand Growth and Economic Outlook

Global oil demand growth for 2025 has been revised downward to 730 thousand barrels per day (kb/d), a reduction of 300 kb/d from previous forecasts. This revision reflects escalating trade tensions that have dampened the economic outlook worldwide. Despite this, the first quarter of 2025 saw robust oil consumption, rising by 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) year-on-year, marking the strongest growth rate since 2023 ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

However, the demand growth is expected to slow further in 2026 to 690 kb/d due to a fragile macroeconomic environment and the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), which reduce reliance on oil. Despite these headwinds, demand remains strong enough to support higher prices, especially when combined with supply-side constraints.

### Supply Constraints and OPEC+ Production Decisions

World oil supply increased by 590 kb/d to 103.6 mb/d in March 2025, with non-OPEC+ countries leading monthly and annual gains. Nonetheless, OPEC+ announced plans to increase output targets by 411 kb/d in May 2025, nearly tripling the initially expected increase. However, actual production increases may be smaller due to overproduction by some members such as Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq, who are already producing above their quotas. Some countries have also committed to compensating for earlier overproduction, which may negate much of the planned increase ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

Moreover, OPEC+ delayed its output increase to April 2025 and extended production cuts into 2026, signaling an acknowledgment that weaker-than-expected demand growth cannot absorb all returning supply. This cautious approach to supply management supports higher prices by preventing oversupply ([OilPrice.com, 2025](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/OPEC-Delays-Output-Increase-to-April-2025-Extends-Cuts-Into-2026.html)).

### Impact of US Shale and Conventional Oil Production

The US shale industry faces profitability challenges due to the drop in oil prices, with firms requiring an average price of $65 per barrel to profitably drill new wells. Additionally, new tariffs have increased the cost of steel and equipment, further discouraging drilling activity. Consequently, the US oil supply forecast for 2025 has been revised downward by 150 kb/d to 490 kb/d. Nevertheless, conventional oil projects remain on track, and total non-OPEC+ supply is expected to rise by 1.3 mb/d ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

## Geopolitical and Trade Factors

### US Tariffs and Trade Tensions

The reintroduction and escalation of US tariffs in 2025 have significantly impacted oil prices. President Donald Trump's administration imposed blanket 10% tariffs on all imports into the US, with additional levies on countries with large trade surpluses against the US. These tariffs have introduced uncertainty and inefficiencies in global oil supply chains, forcing companies to rethink trade routes, suppliers, and logistics strategies, leading to longer transit times and increased costs ([World Energy Report, 2025](https://www.worldenergyreport.com/how-trade-tariffs-are-shaping-the-future-of-oil-12-key-takeaways/)).

The tariffs have also disrupted refining operations, as refineries optimized for specific crude types face challenges adapting to new sources, increasing operational costs and reducing margins. For example, US refiners dependent on Venezuelan heavy crude had to seek costlier alternatives from Canada and the Middle East, raising refining costs and contributing to higher consumer prices ([World Energy Report, 2025](https://www.worldenergyreport.com/how-trade-tariffs-are-shaping-the-future-of-oil-12-key-takeaways/)).

### Sanctions on Russia and Their Effects

US sanctions targeting Russia's energy sector have further tightened supply conditions. The sanctions aim to reinforce the G7 oil price cap mechanism and restrict Russian oil exports, potentially reducing them by 0.5 to 1 mb/d in the short term. These measures have widened discounts for Russian Urals crude relative to Brent, increasing transaction costs and reducing Russia's profit per barrel ([Columbia University CGEP, 2025](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/qa-how-will-new-us-sanctions-affect-russias-energy-sector/)).

Despite Russia's efforts to circumvent sanctions through alternative shipping arrangements, the increased costs and discounts contribute to tighter global supply and support higher prices. Additionally, the sanctions have pressured Russia's state budget, which saw a 24% decline in oil and gas revenues in 2023, leading to potential tax hikes that could reduce future output ([Atlantic Council, 2025](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/russia-tomorrow/oil-gas-and-war/)).

### Geopolitical Conflicts and Supply Disruptions

Ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have caused supply disruptions. A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Kropotkinskaya pumping station reduced oil flows via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium by 30-40%, withdrawing up to 380,000 barrels per day from global supply. Additionally, extreme cold weather in the US, notably in North Dakota, reduced oil output by up to 150,000 barrels per day, tightening supply further ([OilPrice.com, 2025](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Geopolitical-Tensions-and-Supply-Disruptions-Lift-Oil-Prices.html)).

## Market Sentiment and Speculation

Oil prices have been volatile in 2025, influenced by market sentiment reacting to tariff announcements, geopolitical developments, and supply forecasts. For instance, Brent crude futures fell below $60 per barrel in early April due to escalating trade tensions and expectations of increased OPEC+ supply but later recovered to around $65 per barrel after some tariff implementations were postponed ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

Speculative investment has also played a role in price movements. Analysts note that much of the price surge beyond $85 per barrel is driven by speculative money rather than fundamental supply-demand imbalances, as there remains sufficient oil supply to meet current demand ([AP News, 2025](https://apnews.com/article/why-have-oil-prices-gone-up-a9f4ddbd815dd6c6fd90698443e7b8b3)).

## Supply Chain Disruptions and Inventory Management

Supply chain disruptions have compounded the challenges in the oil market. Tariffs and geopolitical conflicts have introduced inefficiencies and delays in the global oil supply chain, leading to longer transit times and increased costs. These disruptions have forced companies to alter trade routes and suppliers, often at higher costs, contributing to price increases ([World Energy Report, 2025](https://www.worldenergyreport.com/how-trade-tariffs-are-shaping-the-future-of-oil-12-key-takeaways/)).

Inventory levels have fluctuated, with global observed oil inventories rising by 21.9 million barrels in February 2025 but still remaining near the bottom of the five-year range. Preliminary data indicate further inventory builds in March, led by crude increases in non-OECD countries. However, product inventories fell, reflecting tighter market conditions ([IEA, 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-april-2025)).

## Summary and Opinion

The increase in oil prices in 2025 is driven by a complex interplay of supply constraints, geopolitical tensions, trade tariffs, and market sentiment. While global demand growth has been revised downward due to economic uncertainties and trade tensions, supply-side factors such as OPEC+ production management, US shale profitability challenges, and sanctions on Russia have tightened the market.

Trade tariffs, particularly those imposed by the US, have disrupted global oil supply chains, increased costs, and introduced uncertainty, further supporting higher prices. Geopolitical conflicts and supply disruptions have also removed significant volumes from the market, exacerbating tightness.

Market speculation has amplified price volatility, but fundamental supply constraints and geopolitical risks underpin the overall upward price trend. Inventory data suggest that while some stock builds have occurred, they are insufficient to offset supply concerns fully.

In my assessment, oil prices will remain elevated in the near term due to these persistent supply-side challenges and geopolitical risks. However, price growth may moderate as demand growth slows and alternative energy adoption increases. The market remains vulnerable to shocks from trade policy changes and geopolitical developments, which could cause further volatility.
