# Why Are Some People Transgender? A Comprehensive Review of Biological and Social Factors

## Introduction

The question of why some people are transgender—meaning their gender identity differs from the sex assigned to them at birth—has been the subject of extensive scientific inquiry and social debate. This report synthesizes current research findings on the biological, genetic, hormonal, neuroanatomical, and social aspects influencing transgender identity. It aims to provide an in-depth, evidence-based understanding of the origins of transgender identity, drawing from recent and reliable sources, and offering a nuanced perspective that transcends simplistic nature versus nurture dichotomies.

## Defining Transgender Identity

Transgender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of their gender, which may not align with the sex assigned at birth. This identity can manifest as male, female, neither, both, or outside the traditional gender binary. Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation, which concerns the direction of romantic or sexual attraction ([Mayo Clinic, 2025](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/transgender-facts/art-20266812)).

## Biological Foundations of Transgender Identity

### Genetic Contributions

Genetic studies have explored potential links between specific genes and transgender identity, though evidence remains limited and inconclusive. Family and twin studies have not provided clear support for a strong genetic basis for transgender identity, indicating that genetics alone cannot explain this complex phenomenon ([Guillamón et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6677266/)). However, some research suggests that genes associated with sex hormone receptors and steroid hormone genetics may play a role in the biological underpinnings of gender identity ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

### Hormonal Influences and Prenatal Environment

Prenatal exposure to sex steroids, such as testosterone and estrogen, has been extensively studied. Conditions involving disorders or differences of sex development (DSD), such as penile agenesis, provide natural experiments showing how variations in hormone levels during critical developmental periods can influence gender identity and behavior ([Ristori et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11771763/)). Hormonal influences continue into puberty and adulthood, with cross-sex hormone treatments demonstrating brain plasticity in transgender individuals ([Giordano et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7139786/)).

### Neuroanatomical and Neurofunctional Correlates

Neuroimaging studies reveal that brain structures and connectivity patterns in transgender individuals often align more closely with their experienced gender than with their sex assigned at birth. For example, transgender women (male-to-female) frequently exhibit white matter microstructure, cortical thickness, and hypothalamic responses more typical of cisgender women, while transgender men (female-to-male) show brain patterns closer to cisgender men ([TransVitae, 2025](https://www.transvitae.com/what-science-says-about-transgender-identity-and-the-brain/); [ENIGMA Working Group, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34030966/)).

However, these neurobiological traits do not represent a simple “brain sex reversal.” Instead, transgender brains often show a mosaic of masculine, feminine, and demasculinized traits, reflecting the complexity of gender identity development ([Guillamón et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8022811/)). This mosaic pattern challenges binary models and supports the view of gender as a spectrum.

### Limitations and Epistemic Considerations

Despite promising findings, many studies face limitations such as small sample sizes and methodological inconsistencies. Moreover, critical analyses highlight epistemic injustices in brain studies of transgender identity, including the exclusion of biosocial, developmental, and contextual approaches, which may lead to incomplete or biased interpretations ([Guillamón et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8022811/)). A transdisciplinary dialogue incorporating neuroscience and gender studies is necessary for a more holistic understanding.

## Social and Environmental Influences

While biological factors provide a foundational basis, social and environmental contexts also significantly shape gender identity and expression. Gender is influenced by cultural, historical, and social norms, which interact dynamically with biological predispositions ([Stanford Medicine, 2025](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/sex-gender-nature-and-nurture-stanford-school-of-medicine-dean-lloyd-minor/)).

### Nature and Nurture Interplay

The development of gender identity exemplifies the complex interplay between innate biological factors and socialization processes. For instance, studies show that in more gender-equal societies, innate gender-related preferences become more pronounced, suggesting that social environments can either suppress or facilitate the expression of biological predispositions ([Desmet, 2022](https://phys.org/news/2022-03-gender-gap-nature-nurture-complicated.html)). This interaction underscores that neither nature nor nurture alone can fully explain transgender identity.

### Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria and Social Contagion Hypotheses

Recent increases in transgender identification among adolescents, particularly natal females, have sparked discussions about social influences such as peer dynamics, internet exposure, and cultural shifts. The concept of rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) posits that some youth may experience sudden gender dysphoria influenced by social contagion and online communities ([Veissière, 2018](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-mind-and-brain/201811/why-is-transgender-identity-the-rise-among-teens)).

While this hypothesis remains controversial and requires further research, it highlights the importance of considering social contexts, especially in youth, alongside biological factors.

## Clinical and Social Implications

Recognizing the biological basis of transgender identity has important implications for medical care, social acceptance, and legal rights. It challenges misconceptions that gender identity can be changed through psychiatric treatment alone and supports affirming approaches including hormonal and surgical interventions ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

Moreover, validating transgender identities through scientific evidence promotes dignity, respect, and equal rights, emphasizing that transgender individuals seek recognition of their authentic selves rather than special treatment ([TransVitae, 2025](https://www.transvitae.com/what-science-says-about-transgender-identity-and-the-brain/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports that transgender identity has a significant biological basis involving genetic, hormonal, and neuroanatomical factors. However, this biological foundation is neither exclusive nor deterministic; social and environmental factors intricately interact with biology to shape gender identity. The brain’s mosaic nature in transgender individuals exemplifies this complexity, defying simplistic binary categorizations.

Given the current state of research, it is prudent to adopt a biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the multifaceted origins of transgender identity. This approach respects the lived experiences of transgender people and guides compassionate, evidence-based clinical care.

Future research should prioritize large-scale, longitudinal, and transdisciplinary studies that integrate biological, psychological, and social dimensions. Such efforts will deepen understanding and help dismantle stigma, fostering a society that affirms gender diversity as a natural and valid human phenomenon.
