# Attachment in the School Setting: An Educator’s Perspective

## Introduction

Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, has become an essential framework for understanding children's emotional and social development, particularly in educational settings. Attachment refers to the emotional bond between a child and their primary caregivers, which influences their sense of security and ability to explore the world. In schools, educators often become secondary attachment figures, playing a critical role in supporting children's learning engagement, emotional wellbeing, and social adjustment. This report synthesizes current research and expert opinions on the role of attachment in the school setting, focusing on how attachment relationships—both familial and school-based—impact children's learning, behavior, and psychological development. It also explores practical implications for educators and school systems.

## The Role of Attachment in Children’s Learning Engagement

Recent empirical studies emphasize the importance of multiple attachment relationships in fostering children's learning engagement. A comprehensive study by Li, Wang, and Qin (2025) highlights that attachment relationships from both family and school environments uniquely influence learning engagement in children, with notable gender differences. Specifically, mother–child attachment and teacher-student relationships significantly promote boys' learning engagement, while peer attachment and teacher-student relationships are more influential for girls ([Li, Wang, & Qin, 2025](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-025-02633-z)).

The teacher-student relationship emerges as a universally critical factor, positively affecting learning engagement across genders. This relationship provides a "secure base" that fosters a sense of belonging, self-worth, and motivation, which are fundamental psychological needs according to self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Children who experience warmth, sensitivity, and support from teachers are more likely to participate actively in learning activities and persist through challenges ([Li, Wang, & Qin, 2025](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-025-02633-z)).

## Attachment Theory Applied to the School Environment

Attachment theory posits that children seek proximity and security from attachment figures, which in early childhood are typically parents but can extend to teachers and peers in school settings. Secure attachment relationships enable children to explore their environment confidently and engage in learning. Conversely, insecure attachments can manifest as behavioral difficulties, reduced curiosity, and poor social skills in classrooms ([ProActive Approaches, 2024](https://proactiveapproaches.co.uk/applying-attachment-theory-to-the-school-setting/)).

Teachers often act as "ad hoc" attachment figures, especially for children who may lack secure attachments at home. Positive teacher-student relationships characterized by closeness and low conflict have been linked to better psychological adjustment and academic success (Pianta, 1992; Farmer et al., 2011). However, children with insecure attachments to parents may exhibit behaviors such as clinginess, hostility, or avoidance, which can make it challenging for teachers to form secure relationships with them ([Pianta, 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-009-9104-0)).

Research indicates that while secure parent-child attachment does not guarantee secure teacher-student attachment, it influences the likelihood of positive relationships forming in school. For younger children, teacher attachments can partially compensate for insecure parental attachments, promoting prosocial behavior and emotional positivity ([Mitchell-Copeland et al., 1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-009-9104-0)). However, for older children, insecure parental attachments often correlate with insecure teacher attachments, suggesting the importance of early intervention.

## Behavioral Manifestations of Attachment Styles in School

Attachment styles—secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized—manifest distinctly in classroom behavior. Securely attached children tend to seek help when needed, form positive peer relationships, and display curiosity and motivation. Anxiously attached children may be clingy and anxious, avoidant children may appear withdrawn and self-reliant, and disorganized attachment often results in erratic or aggressive behavior ([Attachment Project, 2024](https://www.attachmentproject.com/psychology/attachment-in-classroom/)).

Teachers' responses to these behaviors can either reinforce or mitigate attachment-related difficulties. For example, teachers may adopt controlling or rejecting attitudes toward children exhibiting resistant or avoidant behaviors, which can exacerbate disaffection and disengagement ([Pianta, 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-009-9104-0)). Therefore, educators' awareness and sensitivity to attachment-related behaviors are crucial for fostering inclusive and supportive classroom environments.

## The Importance of Consistency and Relationship Building

Attachment theory underscores the importance of consistent, sensitive caregiving for secure attachment development. In school settings, this translates to minimizing frequent changes in educators, especially for infants and toddlers, to allow stable relationships to form. Attachment-based approaches such as Primary Caregiving and Continuity of Care have been recommended to support secure attachments in early childhood education ([Storypark Blog, 2024](https://blog.storypark.com/2024/04/attachment-theory-for-early-childhood-educators/)).

For older children, consistent and sensitive teacher interactions that disconfirm insecure internal working models can foster secure attachments. This requires teachers to consciously provide warmth, high expectations, and responsiveness, even when faced with challenging student behaviors ([Pianta, 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-009-9104-0)).

## Gender Differences and Targeted Interventions

The research by Li et al. (2025) reveals gender-specific patterns in attachment influences on learning engagement. Boys’ engagement is more strongly associated with mother–child attachment and teacher-student relationships, while girls’ engagement is more influenced by peer attachments and teacher-student relationships. This suggests that interventions to improve learning engagement should be tailored accordingly: enhancing mother–child attachment quality for boys and fostering positive peer relationships for girls, alongside universally improving teacher-student relationships ([Li, Wang, & Qin, 2025](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-025-02633-z)).

## Implications for Educators and Schools

### Training and Awareness

Educators need training to understand attachment theory and recognize attachment-related behaviors. This knowledge enables teachers to interpret behaviors as communication of underlying needs rather than mere discipline issues, fostering empathy and appropriate responses ([ResearchED, 2019](https://researched.org.uk/2019/02/28/attachment-theory-what-do-teachers-need-to-know/)).

### Creating Safe and Supportive Environments

Schools should strive to create environments where students feel safe and supported. Positive teacher-student relationships characterized by trust and emotional support are foundational. Teachers should aim to be sensitive, involved, and consistent, providing a secure base for exploration and learning ([PMC Editorial, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11656072/)).

### Addressing Insecure Attachments

Given that a significant proportion of children have insecure attachments, schools must adopt strategies to support these students. While teachers are not therapists and cannot diagnose attachment disorders, they can implement attachment-informed practices, such as providing predictable routines, offering emotional support, and fostering peer connections ([ResearchED, 2019](https://researched.org.uk/2019/02/28/attachment-theory-what-do-teachers-need-to-know/)).

### Collaboration with Families

Schools should engage families to support attachment security, recognizing the complementary roles of parents and teachers. For boys, strengthening mother-child attachment may be particularly beneficial, while for girls, peer relationships in school are vital. Family-school partnerships can enhance these dynamics ([Li, Wang, & Qin, 2025](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-025-02633-z)).

## Conclusion

Attachment theory provides a robust framework for understanding and enhancing children's learning and development in school settings. Educators recognize the critical role of secure attachment relationships—not only with parents but also with teachers and peers—in promoting learning engagement and emotional wellbeing. Teacher-student relationships stand out as universally impactful, while family and peer attachments show gender-specific influences. To optimize educational outcomes, schools must adopt attachment-informed practices, provide consistent and sensitive caregiving, and tailor interventions to meet diverse student needs. Training educators to understand attachment dynamics and fostering collaborative family-school relationships are essential steps toward creating nurturing educational environments where all children can thrive.
