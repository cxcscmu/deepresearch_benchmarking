# How Can the Government Stop Climate Change?  
## A Comprehensive and In-Depth Report  

---

## Introduction  

Climate change represents one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century, with profound implications for environmental stability, public health, economic development, and national security. Governments worldwide have a critical role in mitigating climate change through policy, regulation, and coordination across multiple levels of governance. This report explores how governments—particularly focusing on the United States as a case study—can effectively stop or significantly slow climate change. It synthesizes recent research, policy analyses, and expert recommendations to provide a detailed, evidence-based framework for government action.

## The Role of Governments in Combating Climate Change  

While individual actions contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, systemic change requires coordinated government intervention. Governments have unique capacities to enact large-scale policies, regulate emissions, invest in clean technologies, and foster international cooperation. The complexity of climate change demands multifaceted strategies that address both mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (preparing for climate impacts).

## Key Government Strategies to Stop Climate Change  

### 1. Comprehensive Policy Frameworks and Climate Security Strategies  

Governments must develop and implement overarching climate policies that integrate security, economic, and environmental objectives. In the U.S., bipartisan acknowledgment of climate risks has led to evolving strategies across administrations, documented extensively by the Center for Climate and Security (Baxter, 2025). These include executive orders, national climate assessments, and agency-specific plans that coordinate defense, homeland security, and environmental agencies to address climate-related risks comprehensively ([Baxter, 2025](https://climateandsecurity.org/2025/01/resource-us-government-climate-security-analysis-strategies-and-policies-across-republican-and-democratic-administrations/)).

### 2. Fossil Fuel Supply and Demand Reduction  

A fundamental government role is to regulate and reduce fossil fuel consumption and production. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report scenarios indicate that to limit warming to 1.5°C, global coal, oil, and natural gas supply must decline by approximately 95%, 62%, and 42% respectively by 2050 compared to 2020 levels (Ritchie et al., 2023). This requires governments to enact policies that phase out fossil fuels, restrict new fossil fuel infrastructure, and incentivize clean energy alternatives ([Ritchie et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41105-z)).

### 3. Carbon Pricing Mechanisms  

Carbon pricing, including carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems, is widely regarded as the most effective economic tool to internalize the environmental costs of greenhouse gas emissions. By 2025, approximately 23% of global emissions are priced at an average of USD 32 per tonne, up from 12% at USD 7 per tonne in 2014. Governments can use carbon pricing to incentivize emission reductions across sectors, encourage technological innovation, and generate revenue for reinvestment in green infrastructure and social equity programs (Markandya et al., 2025). However, careful policy design is essential to mitigate regressive impacts on vulnerable populations ([Markandya et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56540-3)).

### 4. Accelerating the Sustainable Energy Transition  

Governments must prioritize transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This includes setting ambitious renewable energy targets, reforming fossil fuel subsidies, implementing cost-reflective energy pricing, and creating stable policy environments that reduce investment risks (UNDP Climate Promise, 2025). Innovative financing mechanisms and public-private partnerships are critical to mobilize the capital needed for infrastructure development and technology deployment ([UNDP Climate Promise, 2025](https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-sustainable-energy-transition-and-why-it-key-tackling-climate-change)).

### 5. State and Local Government Engagement  

While federal governments can coordinate large-scale initiatives, state and local governments play a vital role in implementing climate policies on the ground. Many U.S. states have adopted climate action plans, renewable portfolio standards, and energy efficiency mandates that complement federal efforts. Local governments also innovate through green infrastructure projects and community-based adaptation strategies. Moreover, trans-municipal networks like C40 Cities and ICLEI facilitate knowledge sharing and collective action (Bromley-Trujillo et al., 2022; CFR Education, 2025) ([Bromley-Trujillo et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8853238/); [CFR Education, 2025](https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/federal-state-local-government-climate)).

### 6. International Cooperation and Climate Diplomacy  

Climate change is a global problem requiring coordinated international responses. Governments must actively participate in global agreements such as the Paris Agreement, commit to nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and support mechanisms for technology transfer and climate finance to developing countries. These efforts enhance global mitigation and adaptation capacity and promote equity in climate action (AIDA, 2019) ([AIDA, 2019](https://aida-americas.org/en/blog/5-ways-our-governments-can-confront-climate-change)).

## Addressing Challenges and Ensuring Equity  

### Overcoming Political and Economic Obstacles  

Climate policy often faces opposition from vested interests in fossil fuel industries and political gridlock. Governments must employ strategic media framing, coalition-building, and inclusive stakeholder engagement to build broad-based support for climate action (Bromley-Trujillo et al., 2022). Additionally, integrating climate justice principles ensures that policies do not disproportionately burden marginalized communities but instead create green jobs and promote social equity ([Bromley-Trujillo et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8853238/)).

### Ensuring a Just Transition  

The transition to a low-carbon economy can disrupt livelihoods, especially in fossil fuel-dependent regions. Governments should implement just transition policies that provide retraining, social safety nets, and economic diversification to support affected workers and communities (UNDP Climate Promise, 2025). This approach fosters political feasibility and social acceptance of climate policies ([UNDP Climate Promise, 2025](https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-sustainable-energy-transition-and-why-it-key-tackling-climate-change)).

### Technological Innovation and Deployment  

Rapid deployment of clean energy technologies, energy efficiency measures, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) is essential. Governments can accelerate innovation through research funding, tax incentives, and regulatory support. However, reliance on CCS and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies must be balanced with demand reduction to avoid locking in fossil fuel dependence (Ritchie et al., 2023) ([Ritchie et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41105-z)).

## Policy Recommendations  

Based on the synthesis of current research and policy analyses, the following recommendations emerge for governments seeking to stop climate change:

1. **Implement Robust Carbon Pricing**: Establish or strengthen carbon pricing mechanisms with complementary redistributive measures to ensure equity and political support.

2. **Phase Out Fossil Fuels**: Enact policies to reduce fossil fuel supply and demand, including banning new fossil fuel infrastructure and incentivizing clean energy adoption.

3. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment**: Set ambitious renewable energy targets, reform subsidies, and streamline permitting to attract investment.

4. **Support State and Local Climate Initiatives**: Provide funding and technical assistance to subnational governments to scale up mitigation and adaptation efforts.

5. **Promote International Climate Cooperation**: Fulfill and enhance commitments under global climate agreements, supporting developing countries’ transition.

6. **Ensure a Just Transition**: Develop programs to assist workers and communities affected by the energy transition.

7. **Invest in Innovation**: Increase funding for clean technology research and deployment, balancing CCS/CDR with demand-side reductions.

## Conclusion  

Stopping climate change requires decisive, coordinated government action across multiple sectors and levels of governance. Evidence indicates that comprehensive policy frameworks combining carbon pricing, fossil fuel phase-out, renewable energy transition, and equitable social policies are essential. Governments must also overcome political and economic barriers through inclusive strategies and international cooperation. While the challenge is immense, the integration of these approaches provides a viable pathway toward limiting global warming and securing a sustainable future.
