# Does Banning Guns Reduce Gun Violence? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Gun violence remains a critical public health and safety issue in the United States, sparking intense debate over the effectiveness of gun control measures, particularly gun bans. This report synthesizes current scientific evidence, drawing from rigorous systematic reviews, empirical studies, and expert analyses to evaluate whether banning guns reduces gun violence. The report focuses on the effects of various gun policies, including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks, and restrictions on firearm possession by high-risk individuals. The goal is to provide an objective, evidence-based assessment to inform policymakers, stakeholders, and the public.

## Overview of Gun Violence and Policy Context

The United States has a large stock of privately owned firearms, estimated between 200 million and 300 million (Morrall, 2018). Gun violence encompasses firearm-related homicides, suicides, accidental deaths, and mass shootings. Policymakers have implemented diverse gun policies at federal and state levels aiming to reduce these harms, but the effectiveness of these policies varies and is often contested.

## Evidence on the Effectiveness of Gun Bans

### Assault Weapon and High-Capacity Magazine Bans

#### Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB)

The FAWB, effective from 1994 to 2004, banned the sale of certain semi-automatic firearms and large-capacity magazines. Several studies have evaluated its impact on mass shootings and gun violence:

- A Northwestern Medicine study found that the FAWB significantly reduced public mass shootings, gun deaths, and injuries during its enforcement period, estimating it prevented approximately 10 mass shootings in 10 years (Paul, 2021).
- A counterfactual trend analysis concluded that the FAWB was associated with fewer public mass shooting events, fatalities, and injuries, and that its continuation could have prevented up to 38 mass shootings (PubMed, 2023).
- However, some analyses, such as those by RAND, note methodological limitations in studies of the FAWB, including lack of comparison groups, making it difficult to conclusively attribute reductions in mass shootings to the ban alone (RAND, 2024).

#### State-Level Assault Weapon and High-Capacity Magazine Bans

- RAND's 2024 review found **limited evidence** that assault weapon bans reduce school shooting injuries and **limited evidence** that high-capacity magazine bans reduce mass shootings. The evidence for assault weapon bans reducing mass shootings overall was inconclusive (RAND, 2024).
- Webster et al. (2020) found uncertain evidence linking assault weapon bans to mass shooting incidents but significant associations between high-capacity magazine bans and a 48% reduction in mass shooting incidents, with a suggestive 33% reduction in fatalities (RAND, 2024).
- The challenges in detecting effects stem from the rarity of mass shootings, statistical power issues, and the presence of "grandfathered" weapons exempt from bans (Johns Hopkins, 2021).

### Policies Regulating Gun Sales and Ownership

#### Universal Background Checks and Restrictions on High-Risk Individuals

- Multiple studies demonstrate that laws regulating *who* can access firearms—such as universal background checks, prohibitions on firearm possession by individuals with violent misdemeanor convictions, and "may issue" concealed carry permit laws—are associated with significant reductions in firearm homicides.
- Siegel et al. (2019) found that states with universal background checks had 15% lower homicide rates, and those prohibiting firearm possession by violent offenders had an 18% reduction in homicides (Boston University, 2019).
- These policies appear more effective than bans on specific types of firearms in reducing firearm-related homicides (Boston University, 2019).

#### Waiting Periods and Domestic Violence-Related Prohibitions

- There is moderate evidence that waiting periods reduce firearm suicides and total homicides.
- Gun possession prohibitions related to domestic violence are linked to reductions in intimate partner homicides (RAND, 2024).

### Other Gun Policies

- Evidence is inconclusive or insufficient regarding the effects of lost or stolen firearm reporting, firearm safety training requirements, gun-free zones, and bans on low-quality handguns (RAND, 2024).
- Licensing requirements for firearm purchasers have shown promise in reducing fatal mass shootings (Johns Hopkins, 2021).

## Contrasting Perspectives and Limitations

### Studies Suggesting Gun Bans May Increase Crime

- A Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy report argues that banning guns may increase crime, citing social factors as more decisive in violence than gun prevalence and suggesting that violent criminals will obtain weapons regardless of laws (Kates & Mauser, 2015).
- This perspective emphasizes that reducing gun ownership among law-abiding citizens does not necessarily reduce violent crime and may undermine self-defense capabilities.

### Methodological Challenges

- The rarity of mass shootings and the complexity of gun violence make it difficult to isolate the effects of specific policies.
- Many studies rely on observational data with potential confounding factors.
- Policies often coexist with other laws and social factors, complicating causal inference.

## Synthesis and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of current scientific literature and policy analyses, the evidence indicates that **banning guns, particularly assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, has limited but positive effects on reducing certain types of gun violence, especially mass shootings and school shooting injuries**. However, these effects are modest and statistically challenging to detect due to the low frequency of such events and the existing large stock of firearms.

More robust and consistent evidence supports the effectiveness of **policies regulating who can access firearms**, such as universal background checks, prohibitions on possession by individuals with violent histories, and waiting periods. These policies are associated with significant reductions in firearm homicides and suicides.

The evidence does not support the claim that banning guns broadly or specific types of guns leads to increased crime; rather, it highlights the importance of targeted regulations focusing on high-risk individuals and comprehensive background checks.

Therefore, **gun bans alone are insufficient to substantially reduce overall gun violence but can be an important component of a multifaceted approach that includes strict regulation of firearm access and ownership**.

## Conclusion

Gun violence reduction requires a nuanced, evidence-based strategy. While bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines may contribute to reducing mass shooting fatalities, the most effective policies focus on controlling access to firearms by individuals at high risk of violence. Universal background checks, waiting periods, and prohibitions related to violent misdemeanors show stronger and more consistent associations with reductions in firearm-related homicides.

Policymakers should prioritize these evidence-backed interventions while continuing to support rigorous research to fill gaps in knowledge, especially regarding the long-term impacts of gun bans and other firearm regulations.
