# Detailed Report: How Did Sojourner Truth Escape Slavery?

## Introduction

Sojourner Truth (c. 1797–1883), born Isabella Baumfree, was an African American abolitionist, women's rights activist, and former slave who escaped bondage in New York State in 1826. Her escape from slavery and subsequent activism have made her a significant figure in American history. This report provides a comprehensive and detailed account of how Sojourner Truth escaped slavery, drawing from multiple reliable sources and historical records. It explores the context of slavery in New York, the legal framework of gradual emancipation, her personal circumstances leading to escape, and the aftermath of her liberation, including her legal victory to recover her son.

## Background: Slavery and Gradual Emancipation in New York

Contrary to popular belief that slavery was predominantly a Southern institution, slavery existed in Northern states, including New York, well into the early 19th century. New York enacted gradual emancipation laws starting in 1799, which did not immediately free all enslaved people but instead established staggered dates of freedom based on age, gender, and birth date. For example, slaves born before a certain date remained enslaved for life or until a set age, while those born after were freed gradually ([Vaughn, 2021](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/literature-and-writing/analysis-narrative-sojourner-truth)).

By 1790, over 20,000 slaves lived in New York State, including Sojourner Truth, who was born into slavery in Ulster County near Swartekill, New York ([Digital Library of Pennsylvania, 1850](http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/truth/1850/1850.html)). The gradual emancipation laws meant that many enslaved individuals, including Truth, remained in bondage into the 1820s despite the growing abolitionist sentiment in the North.

## Early Life and Enslavement

Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree between 1797 and 1800 to James and Betsey, slaves of Colonel Ardinburgh, a Dutch-descended landowner in Ulster County, New York. She grew up speaking Dutch as her first language, which later caused communication difficulties with English-speaking owners ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth)).

Throughout her childhood and early adulthood, Isabella was sold multiple times and endured harsh treatment typical of slavery. She was married to a fellow slave named Thomas, with whom she had five children. Despite promises from her owners that she would be freed, these promises were broken, fueling her resolve to seek freedom ([Black History, 2022](https://www.blackhistory.com/2022/03/at-29-years-old-sojourner-truth-escaped-slavery-with-her-young-daughter.html)).

## The Escape: Walking Away from Slavery

At approximately 29 years old, in 1826, Sojourner Truth made the courageous decision to escape slavery. Unlike many fugitive slaves who fled under cover of darkness or by running, Truth famously stated, "I did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right" ([World History Encyclopedia, 2025](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2694/sojourner-truths-escape-from-slavery/)). This statement reveals her moral and spiritual reasoning behind her escape, reflecting her deep religious convictions.

She escaped with her infant daughter Sophia, leaving behind her other children who were still enslaved. The escape was facilitated by her belief in divine guidance and a strong sense of justice. After fleeing, she was taken in by a white abolitionist family, the Van Wageners, who helped her secure her freedom legally by purchasing it shortly after her escape ([Black History, 2022](https://www.blackhistory.com/2022/03/at-29-years-old-sojourner-truth-escaped-slavery-with-her-young-daughter.html); [World History Encyclopedia, 2025](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2694/sojourner-truths-escape-from-slavery/)).

## Legal Emancipation and the Struggle to Reunite with Her Children

New York's emancipation law, passed in 1827, legally freed Sojourner Truth and other slaves in the state. However, the law's gradual nature meant that many enslaved people, including her children, remained in bondage. When she learned that her five-year-old son Peter had been sold illegally to a slaveholder in Alabama, she took legal action to recover him.

Sojourner Truth filed a lawsuit in the Ulster County Courthouse, arguing that the sale violated New York’s emancipation law, which prohibited the sale of slaves out of state if it denied them the benefits of emancipation ([Historical Society of the New York Courts, 2022](https://history.nycourts.gov/sojourner-truth-first-african-american-woman-to-win-a-lawsuit/)). She won the case in late 1828, becoming the first Black woman in the United States to win a lawsuit against a white man. Her lawyer, Charles H. Ruggles, provided legal assistance without charging a fee, highlighting the support she received from abolitionist allies ([Historical Society of the New York Courts, 2022](https://history.nycourts.gov/sojourner-truth-first-african-american-woman-to-win-a-lawsuit/)).

## Aftermath and Legacy

Following her escape and legal victory, Sojourner Truth became a prominent itinerant preacher and activist. In 1843, she changed her name from Isabella to Sojourner Truth after claiming a divine calling to preach truth and justice. She became a powerful voice for abolition, women's rights, and temperance, traveling widely and delivering speeches that drew from her experiences as a former slave ([Women's History, 2015](https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/sojourner-truth)).

Her autobiography, *The Narrative of Sojourner Truth*, dictated to Olive Gilbert and published in 1850, remains a vital historical document. It provides rare insight into the life of a Northern slave and the complexities of emancipation in the North ([Digital Library of Pennsylvania, 1850](http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/truth/1850/1850.html); [EBSCO Research Starters, 2021](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/literature-and-writing/analysis-narrative-sojourner-truth)).

## Conclusion

Sojourner Truth's escape from slavery was a deliberate and morally grounded act of self-liberation. Unlike many fugitive slaves who fled in secrecy, she "walked off" slavery, guided by her religious beliefs and a sense of righteousness. Her escape was facilitated by the gradual emancipation laws in New York, the support of abolitionist allies like the Van Wageners, and her own determination. Her subsequent legal victory to recover her son marked a historic milestone as the first Black woman to win a lawsuit against a white man in the United States. Truth's story challenges the common perception of slavery as solely a Southern phenomenon and highlights the persistence of slavery and racial injustice in the North. Her legacy as an abolitionist, women's rights advocate, and symbol of resilience continues to inspire.
