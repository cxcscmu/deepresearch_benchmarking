# What Do People Look for in a President? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The qualities and traits that voters seek in a president have evolved over time and vary significantly across demographic groups, political affiliations, and societal contexts. As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, understanding these preferences is crucial for candidates, political strategists, and scholars alike. This report synthesizes recent and authoritative research findings to provide an in-depth, evidence-based examination of what Americans look for in a president. It highlights generational differences, the balance between character and leadership skills, the importance of shared values versus policy positions, and the psychological dimensions influencing voter preferences.

## Generational Differences in Presidential Traits

A nationwide survey by Sachs Media Group reveals marked differences between younger and older voters regarding the traits they prioritize in a presidential candidate. Millennials (ages 18-34) tend to value education, charisma, motivation, and compassion highly. Specifically, 72% of Millennials consider a highly educated candidate "very important" or "most important," 69% prioritize compassion, and 59% look for charisma and motivation ([Sachs Media Group, 2025](https://sachsmedia.com/poll-younger-older-voters-seek-different-things-in-president/)).

In contrast, voters aged 65 and older emphasize strength, decisiveness, patriotism, and the ability to command respect internationally. For instance, 87% of older voters rate "strong and decisive" as a critical trait, 81% value patriotism, and 88% want a president who commands respect from other countries ([Sachs Media Group, 2025](https://sachsmedia.com/poll-younger-older-voters-seek-different-things-in-president/)).

Despite these differences, some traits enjoy bipartisan and cross-generational support. Both Millennials and older voters highly value honesty and trustworthiness (90% and 88%, respectively), open-mindedness (78%), and a sense of humor (40% Millennials, 50% older voters) ([Sachs Media Group, 2025](https://sachsmedia.com/poll-younger-older-voters-seek-different-things-in-president/)).

These findings suggest that presidential candidates must navigate a complex landscape of voter expectations, balancing intellectual and emotional appeal to resonate across age groups.

## Character Versus Leadership Skills

Gallup's 2024 survey highlights a dichotomy in voter perceptions of the two leading candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which reflects broader voter priorities. Harris is perceived more favorably on likability, moral character, honesty, and trustworthiness, while Trump is seen as stronger and more decisive, with a greater ability to "get things done" ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651692/voters-choice-character-leadership-skill.aspx)).

Interestingly, when asked whether each candidate possesses "the personality and leadership qualities a president should have," Harris leads Trump by 51% to 45%. This suggests that while decisiveness and strength are valued, attributes such as likability and moral character may weigh more heavily in holistic assessments of presidential suitability ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651692/voters-choice-character-leadership-skill.aspx)).

Moreover, the consistent finding that candidates with higher honesty and trustworthiness ratings tend to win presidential elections underscores the paramount importance of character in voter decision-making ([Gallup, 2024](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651692/voters-choice-character-leadership-skill.aspx)).

## Importance of Political Beliefs Over Shared Demographics

While personal traits matter, Pew Research Center data indicates that Americans prioritize shared political beliefs far more than demographic similarities such as religion, race, gender, or economic background when choosing candidates. Approximately 66% of U.S. adults say it is extremely or very important that candidates share their views on political issues, a sentiment consistent across demographic groups ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/03/americans-differ-over-how-important-it-is-for-political-candidates-they-support-to-share-their-personal-traits/)).

In contrast, fewer than 25% of Americans consider it very important that candidates share their religious values, racial or ethnic background, or gender. For example, only 22% of women and 13% of men find it important that candidates share their gender ([Pew Research Center, 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/03/americans-differ-over-how-important-it-is-for-political-candidates-they-support-to-share-their-personal-traits/)).

This emphasis on policy alignment over identity traits suggests that while candidates' personal characteristics can influence voter perceptions, issue positions remain the primary driver of support.

## Media Consumption and Information Sources Across Generations

Understanding what voters look for in a president also requires considering how different demographic groups consume political information. Research from Georgetown University's Civic Education Research Lab shows that Millennials increasingly rely on digital platforms such as YouTube and Twitter for political news, whereas Baby Boomers predominantly use traditional media like television and newspapers ([Georgetown University, 2025](https://cerl.georgetown.edu/generational-differences-in-political-media-use/)).

This divergence in media consumption influences the traits voters prioritize. Younger voters exposed to diverse and often more progressive digital content may emphasize education, compassion, and charisma, while older voters consuming traditional media may focus on strength, decisiveness, and patriotism.

## Psychological Profile of Leadership: The Case of Donald Trump

An analysis of Donald Trump's 2025 presidency through a psychological lens reveals traits such as grandiose narcissism, authoritarian tendencies, and transactional logic. Trump's leadership style is characterized by a grandiose self-image, a need for admiration, and a confrontational approach to governance. These traits manifest in policies that are often polarizing and implemented with less attention to nuance or coalition-building ([Simply Put Psych, 2025](https://simplyputpsych.co.uk/global-psych/the-psychological-of-trumps-2025-presidency-traits-behaviours-and-underlying-dynamics/)).

While supporters view this style as disruptive and necessary for change, opponents argue it undermines democratic institutions and fosters division. This dichotomy reflects the broader debate about the kind of leadership Americans desire: one that is strong and decisive versus one that is collaborative and principled.

## Comprehensive Qualities of a Great President

Beyond polling data, normative frameworks outline the ideal qualities a president should possess. According to Strengthen the Nation (2025), a great president is a "complete man" unified in mind and spirit, with a broad vision for freedom and a commitment to truth and goodness. The 24 essential qualities include being spiritually true, strong in character, wise, humble, patriotic, courageous, personable, smart, effective communicator, socially conscious, fiscally sound, and inspiring, among others ([Strengthen the Nation, 2025](https://www.strengthenthenation.com/24-qualities-of-a-great-president/)).

This holistic view emphasizes that presidential greatness transcends individual traits or skills, requiring a dynamic integration of personal virtues, intellectual capabilities, and practical competencies.

## Public Preferences on Presidential Qualities: Survey Insights

YouGov's 2024 survey of American voters identified the top traits deemed very important in a president, with over 80% of respondents highlighting intangible qualities such as leadership skills, decision-making abilities, honesty, mental health, future vision, integrity, intelligence, calmness under pressure, and respect for the rule of law. Notably, concrete metrics like experience and educational attainment ranked lower in importance ([YouGov, 2024](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50225-what-do-americans-want-in-a-president)).

This aligns with Sachs Media Group's findings on Millennials valuing education but suggests that voters prioritize how a candidate applies their knowledge and character in leadership roles over formal credentials alone.

## Trust in Institutions and Checks on Presidential Power

Public trust in institutions, including the Supreme Court, impacts expectations of presidential behavior. The Annenberg Public Policy Center reports that 69% of Americans believe the president should follow Supreme Court rulings even if they conflict with national security concerns, reflecting a strong preference for checks and balances in governance ([Annenberg Public Policy Center, 2025](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-americans-support-checks-on-presidential-power/)).

This underscores that voters not only seek personal qualities in a president but also expect adherence to constitutional norms and institutional respect.

## Conclusion and Opinion

The multifaceted data indicate that Americans look for a president who embodies a blend of strong character, effective leadership, and alignment with their political beliefs. While generational divides exist—with younger voters emphasizing education, compassion, and charisma, and older voters prioritizing strength, decisiveness, and patriotism—there is consensus on the importance of honesty, trustworthiness, open-mindedness, and a sense of humor.

Moreover, voters place greater weight on shared political views than on demographic similarities, highlighting the primacy of policy alignment. The psychological profile of leadership styles, such as that of Donald Trump, reveals how personality traits can profoundly shape governance and voter perceptions, for better or worse.

Ultimately, the ideal president is one who integrates personal virtues, intellectual acumen, and practical skills while respecting democratic institutions and fostering national unity. Candidates and political parties must recognize these nuanced voter expectations to effectively engage the electorate in an increasingly polarized and complex political landscape.
