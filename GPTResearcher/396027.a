# Does the Use of CAFOs Compromise Ben & Jerry’s Mission? An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Ben & Jerry’s, a globally recognized ice cream brand, has long positioned itself as a socially responsible and environmentally conscious company. Its mission encompasses social, product quality, environmental, and economic dimensions, aiming to create “linked prosperity for everyone connected to their business” (Organic Consumers Association, 2017). However, the company’s reliance on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) for milk sourcing has raised significant concerns regarding whether this practice aligns with or compromises its stated mission. This report critically examines the extent to which the use of CAFOs conflicts with Ben & Jerry’s mission, drawing upon a range of sources, including corporate communications, independent investigations, and environmental advocacy reports.

## Understanding Ben & Jerry’s Mission

Ben & Jerry’s mission is articulated through three interrelated components:

- **Social Mission:** To operate in ways that improve quality of life locally, nationally, and internationally.
- **Product Mission:** To produce the finest quality ice cream with wholesome, natural ingredients while promoting environmentally respectful business practices.
- **Economic Mission:** To operate sustainably with profitable growth, increasing stakeholder value and employee opportunities (Take Control, 2017).

The company also emphasizes commitments to animal welfare, regenerative agriculture, and reducing its carbon footprint through initiatives like the Caring Dairy program and the Low Carbon Dairy pilot project (The Bullvine, 2023). These programs claim to support farmers, improve soil health, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## What Are CAFOs and Their Environmental Impact?

CAFOs are large-scale industrial agricultural facilities where animals are confined in high densities and fed primarily on grain-based diets, often genetically modified and treated with pesticides. These operations are associated with significant environmental problems, including:

- **Water Pollution:** Runoff from manure and fertilizer contaminates waterways with nitrogen and phosphorus, causing harmful algal blooms and ecosystem degradation (Organic Consumers Association, 2017).
- **Air Pollution:** CAFOs emit large amounts of methane, ammonia, and particulate matter, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air quality deterioration.
- **Soil Degradation:** Intensive monoculture feed production for CAFOs relies heavily on synthetic inputs, reducing soil biodiversity and health.
- **Animal Welfare Concerns:** High mortality rates and poor living conditions are common, with mortality rates in CAFO herds exceeding 10%, compared to less than 4% in 2002 (Organic Consumers Association, 2017).

## Evidence of Ben & Jerry’s Use of CAFO Milk

Despite its public image, Ben & Jerry’s sources much of its milk from CAFOs, particularly in Vermont, where mega-dairies supply the brand (Organic Consumers Association, 2017). The company’s marketing often depicts idyllic family farms with happy cows grazing on pastures, but investigations reveal this is misleading. The reality involves large-scale factory farms that contribute to environmental pollution and animal welfare issues.

Independent testing by the Organic Consumers Association found glyphosate residues—a herbicide banned in Europe but widely used on GMO feed corn—in 10 out of 11 Ben & Jerry’s ice cream flavors, indicating the use of conventional, chemically intensive feed inputs (Organic Consumers Association, 2017). This finding contradicts the company’s product mission of using wholesome, natural ingredients.

## Conflicts Between CAFO Use and Ben & Jerry’s Mission

### 1. Environmental Sustainability and Product Quality

Ben & Jerry’s product mission emphasizes natural ingredients and environmentally respectful practices. However, sourcing milk from CAFOs that rely on GMO feed and chemical herbicides undermines this commitment. The presence of glyphosate residues in products suggests that the milk is not as “wholesome” or “natural” as claimed.

Moreover, CAFOs are significant contributors to environmental degradation through water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and soil depletion. This conflicts with Ben & Jerry’s environmental goals, including its Low Carbon Dairy pilot project aimed at reducing emissions by 50% and improving soil health through regenerative practices (The Bullvine, 2023). The company’s failure to transition to organic or regenerative dairy sourcing means that its environmental impact remains substantial.

### 2. Social Mission and Community Impact

Ben & Jerry’s social mission involves improving quality of life and supporting farmers and communities. However, CAFOs have been linked to negative social outcomes, including pollution-related health issues in local communities and exploitation of farmworkers. The contamination of Lake Carmi in Vermont, a recreational and ecological asset, by phosphorus-rich manure from industrial dairy farms supplying Ben & Jerry’s, exemplifies the environmental injustice faced by local residents (Organic Consumers Association, 2017).

While Ben & Jerry’s claims to support farmers through the Caring Dairy program, critics argue that the company has neglected to lead a transition toward organic and regenerative farming, which would better align with social and environmental justice goals.

### 3. Animal Welfare

Ben & Jerry’s Caring Dairy program highlights animal welfare as a foundation, with third-party audits and G.A.P. accreditation to ensure humane treatment (The Bullvine, 2023). However, CAFOs are widely criticized for poor animal welfare standards, including overcrowding, high mortality rates, and stressful conditions. The discrepancy between the company’s animal welfare claims and the realities of CAFO farming raises questions about the authenticity of its commitments.

### 4. Economic Mission and Profitability

Ben & Jerry’s has openly acknowledged that transitioning to organic dairy production would reduce profitability. According to reports, Ben & Jerry’s founders declined to move toward organic milk because it would not “maximize profits” (Organic Consumers Association, 2017). This prioritization of economic goals over environmental and social missions reflects a fundamental tension within the company’s operations.

While profitable growth is a legitimate business objective, the refusal to adopt more sustainable practices undermines the company’s broader mission and damages its credibility among socially and environmentally conscious consumers.

## Corporate Initiatives vs. Criticisms: A Balanced View

Ben & Jerry’s has launched several initiatives aimed at sustainability, including the Low Carbon Dairy pilot project, which uses data-driven methods to reduce emissions and improve soil health on select farms (The Bullvine, 2023). Early data show a 16% reduction in emissions and progress toward a 50% carbon footprint reduction target.

The company also collaborates with organizations like the University of Vermont Extension Service to promote regenerative agriculture and animal welfare programs such as C.O.W.S. (Cow Comfort and Welfare Scoring) (The Bullvine, 2023).

However, these efforts are limited in scope and have not yet resulted in a comprehensive shift away from CAFO sourcing. Only 13% of U.S. Caring Dairy farms participate in the Low Carbon initiative, with plans to expand (Dairy Business Middle East & Africa, 2024). Critics argue that these measures constitute greenwashing, as the company continues to rely heavily on environmentally harmful CAFO milk (Organic Consumers Association, 2017; Take Control, 2017).

## Conclusion: Does the Use of CAFOs Compromise Ben & Jerry’s Mission?

Based on the evidence, the use of CAFOs by Ben & Jerry’s significantly compromises its mission, particularly its product, environmental, and social commitments. While the company has made strides through pilot projects and sustainability programs, the core sourcing of milk from CAFOs undermines the authenticity of its claims to environmental stewardship, animal welfare, and social responsibility.

The presence of glyphosate residues, the environmental degradation linked to industrial dairy farms, and the refusal to transition to organic or regenerative dairy production reveal a disconnect between Ben & Jerry’s stated mission and operational realities. Economic considerations appear to have taken precedence over the company’s social and environmental goals, leading to accusations of greenwashing.

For Ben & Jerry’s to fully align with its mission, a comprehensive transition to organic, grass-fed, and regenerative dairy sourcing is necessary. This shift would better support animal welfare, reduce environmental harm, and enhance product quality, thereby restoring credibility and fulfilling the company’s longstanding commitments.
