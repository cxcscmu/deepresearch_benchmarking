# Why Should Abortions Be Legal? A Comprehensive and Evidence-Based Report

## Introduction

The legality of abortion remains a pivotal and often contentious issue worldwide, intersecting with public health, human rights, socio-economic factors, and ethical considerations. This report aims to provide a detailed, evidence-based, and objective analysis of why abortions should be legal, drawing from recent research, international health standards, and socio-economic data. The discussion prioritizes reliable and contemporary sources, emphasizing the implications of abortion access on health outcomes, human rights, economic stability, and social equity.

## 1. Public Health and Safety

### 1.1 Reduction of Maternal Mortality and Morbidity

Unsafe abortions are a significant public health concern globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified unsafe abortion as a major contributor to maternal mortality since 1967. Evidence consistently shows that restrictive abortion laws correlate with higher rates of unsafe procedures, leading to increased maternal deaths and complications ([World Health Organization, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3673257/)).

For example, South Africa's liberalization of abortion laws in 1996 led to a 91% decline in abortion-related maternal mortality within a few years ([World Health Organization, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3673257/)). Similarly, countries with broad legal access to abortion experience significantly lower maternal mortality ratios compared to those with restrictive laws ([World Health Organization, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3673257/)).

### 1.2 Safe Medical Practices and Self-Managed Abortion

Since the late 1980s, self-managed abortion using medication has become increasingly common and safe when conditions allow. The availability of medications like misoprostol, which can be stored at room temperature and administered without direct medical supervision, has expanded access to safe abortion, particularly in resource-limited settings ([Kapp et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233026/)).

Despite this, many legal frameworks still overregulate abortion, requiring clinical settings and medical supervision, which can create barriers to access. Reducing these burdensome requirements, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic when the FDA relaxed in-person dispensing rules for abortion drugs, demonstrates that less medicalized models are both feasible and desirable ([Kapp et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233026/)).

## 2. Human Rights and Autonomy

### 2.1 Reproductive Rights as Fundamental Human Rights

Access to abortion is embedded within the broader context of reproductive rights, which are recognized as fundamental human rights. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health has characterized the criminalization of abortion as incompatible with the right to the highest attainable standard of health ([United Nations, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3673257/)).

Legal restrictions on abortion not only limit access but also disproportionately affect marginalized groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, youth, and economically disadvantaged individuals, exacerbating health inequities ([Brysk, 2025](https://news.ucsb.edu/2025/021776/abortion-rights-backlash-and-globalization)).

### 2.2 Bodily Autonomy and Empowerment

Legal abortion empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their bodies and reproductive futures. This autonomy is crucial for gender equality, enabling women and pregnant people to participate fully in society, pursue education and careers, and avoid unwanted pregnancies ([CTEEC, 2024](https://cteec.org/reasons-why-abortion-should-be-legal-essay/)).

## 3. Socioeconomic Benefits

### 3.1 Economic Stability for Individuals and Families

Unplanned pregnancies can impose significant financial burdens. Legal access to abortion allows individuals to manage their reproductive lives effectively, contributing to economic stability by enabling continued education and workforce participation ([CTEEC, 2024](https://cteec.org/reasons-why-abortion-should-be-legal-essay/)).

Research indicates that women denied abortions face greater economic hardships, including increased poverty and reliance on public assistance, compared to those who obtain wanted abortions ([American Medical Association, 2023](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/access-abortion-and-women-s-health-what-research-shows)).

### 3.2 Broader Societal Economic Impact

At the societal level, increased access to contraception and legal abortion has been linked to improved material resources for families and children and has promoted economic equality for women ([Sonfield et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4075263/)).

## 4. Mental Health and Well-being

Contrary to some claims, authoritative studies have debunked the myth that abortion increases mental health risks. Instead, restrictive abortion laws can negatively impact mental health by forcing individuals to carry unwanted pregnancies, which is associated with increased stress, anxiety, and adverse mental health outcomes ([Gerdts et al., 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10199416/)).

## 5. Legal and Policy Considerations

### 5.1 Evidence-Based Legal Frameworks

Recent legal reforms have begun to incorporate evidence and human rights standards, recognizing the safety and feasibility of self-managed abortion. However, many laws still criminalize self-managed abortion or impose unnecessary medical supervision, which contradicts the latest evidence and WHO recommendations ([Kapp et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233026/)).

### 5.2 Impact of Restrictive Laws

Restrictive abortion policies have been shown to delay care, increase second-trimester abortions (which carry higher risks), and discourage care-seeking behavior due to fear of legal consequences ([United Nations, 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3673257/)). These policies also contribute to health disparities and undermine justice and equality ([Kapp et al., 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233026/)).

## 6. Ethical and Social Dimensions

While opponents of abortion often cite moral and religious reasons, these perspectives do not negate the public health evidence supporting abortion access. Ethical frameworks that prioritize women's health, autonomy, and social justice argue for legal abortion as a means to address power imbalances and systemic inequalities ([Reproductive Rights, Reproductive Justice, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9930478/)).

## Conclusion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the legalization of abortion as a critical component of public health, human rights, and socio-economic well-being. Legal abortion reduces maternal mortality and morbidity, protects bodily autonomy, promotes gender equality, and enhances economic stability for individuals and society. Restrictive abortion laws, conversely, increase unsafe procedures, exacerbate health disparities, and impose significant social and economic costs.

Therefore, abortion should be legal to ensure safe, equitable, and evidence-based reproductive health care, aligned with international human rights standards and contemporary medical knowledge.
