# Report: Why Are There Competing Systems of Innovation Classification?

## Introduction

Innovation is a multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in economic development, technological progress, and competitive advantage among nations and firms. However, understanding and categorizing innovation is complex due to its diverse manifestations across industries, technologies, and socio-economic contexts. This complexity has led to the emergence of multiple competing systems of innovation classification. This report aims to provide an in-depth, comprehensive analysis of why these competing classification systems exist, drawing on recent scholarly insights and authoritative sources. The report will explore the conceptual, methodological, and contextual reasons behind the multiplicity of innovation taxonomies, emphasizing the implications for research, policy, and practice.

## Conceptual Ambiguity and Diversity in Innovation

One of the primary reasons for competing innovation classification systems is the inherent ambiguity and diversity in the concept of innovation itself. Innovation encompasses a wide range of activities, from incremental improvements to radical breakthroughs, spanning products, processes, organizational methods, and business models. The economic literature and related fields use different terminologies and frameworks to describe similar phenomena, while sometimes the same terms are applied to different types of innovation. This terminological inconsistency creates confusion and hinders the development of a unified classification system ([Coccia, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08955)).

Moreover, innovation is not confined to technological change alone but includes social, institutional, and systemic dimensions. For example, the National Innovation System (NIS) framework highlights that innovation outcomes result from the interaction of various economic, political, and social institutions, including financial systems, education, labor markets, and culture ([ITIF, 2025](https://itif.org/publications/2025/02/20/understanding-comparing-national-innovation-systems-us-korea-china-japan-taiwan/)). This broad scope complicates the classification effort because innovation can be analyzed from multiple disciplinary perspectives—economics, sociology, management, engineering, and policy studies—each emphasizing different aspects and criteria.

## Methodological Differences and Disciplinary Perspectives

The methodological approaches to studying innovation significantly contribute to the existence of competing classification systems. Different research traditions employ diverse methods such as patent analysis, citation networks, co-authorship studies, case studies, and scientometric techniques to map innovation pathways and roles ([Yu, Wei, & Liu, 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-024-05225-7)). These methods capture distinct facets of innovation, such as technological convergence, interdisciplinary knowledge flow, or organizational roles, leading to varied typologies and categorizations.

For instance, patent literature often informs technology convergence classifications, focusing on the combination and integration of technological fields. In contrast, scientific literature and citation analysis emphasize disciplinary convergence and knowledge diffusion patterns. The choice of data sources, analytical tools, and theoretical lenses shapes the resulting classification system, making it difficult to reconcile different taxonomies into a single framework.

Additionally, innovation research spans multiple domains—product design, manufacturing processes, organizational innovation, and policy innovation—each with specialized classification needs. Product innovation design, for example, uses structured methods like TRIZ, axiomatic design, and function-behavior-structure models to classify innovation types based on problem-solving strategies and technological conflicts ([Scientific Reports, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99097-3)). These domain-specific approaches reflect the practical requirements of innovation management but may not align with broader economic or systemic classifications.

## Contextual and Socioeconomic Factors

Innovation classification systems are also shaped by the socioeconomic and geopolitical contexts in which innovation occurs. National innovation systems differ significantly across countries due to variations in institutional arrangements, cultural attitudes, policy priorities, and economic structures ([ITIF, 2025](https://itif.org/publications/2025/02/20/understanding-comparing-national-innovation-systems-us-korea-china-japan-taiwan/)). For example, the innovation "hunger" or urgency varies, with countries like China, Korea, and Taiwan exhibiting higher motivation for innovation leadership compared to the United States and Japan, where risk aversion and post-capitalist ethos may dampen innovation drive.

These contextual differences necessitate tailored classification systems that reflect unique national or regional innovation dynamics. A classification that fits the U.S. innovation ecosystem, characterized by strong private enterprises and research universities, may not be suitable for China’s state-led innovation model or Korea’s industrial policy-driven system. Consequently, competing systems emerge to accommodate the diversity of innovation environments and policy objectives.

Furthermore, the evolving global order and competition for techno-economic dominance, especially between major powers like the U.S. and China, add complexity to innovation classification. Innovation is increasingly linked to economic security and geopolitical strategy, requiring classifications that capture not only technological attributes but also strategic and security dimensions ([ITIF, 2025](https://itif.org/publications/2025/02/20/understanding-comparing-national-innovation-systems-us-korea-china-japan-taiwan/)).

## The Role of Innovation Purpose and Function

Another factor contributing to competing classification systems is the different purposes and functions that innovation taxonomies serve. Some classifications aim to support academic research by providing theoretical clarity and analytical rigor. Others are designed for practical application in policy-making, helping governments identify strengths and weaknesses in their innovation systems and formulate targeted interventions.

For example, classifications based on the National Innovation System framework focus on institutional roles and interactions, guiding policy design to enhance systemic innovation performance ([ITIF, 2025](https://itif.org/publications/2025/02/20/understanding-comparing-national-innovation-systems-us-korea-china-japan-taiwan/)). In contrast, innovation methods in product design prioritize problem-solving strategies and creativity enhancement, leading to classifications based on innovation processes and cognitive approaches ([Scientific Reports, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99097-3)).

The multiplicity of objectives—academic, managerial, policy, technological—means that no single classification can satisfy all needs simultaneously. This functional diversity encourages the development of multiple, sometimes competing, systems tailored to specific contexts and goals.

## Challenges in Standardization and Integration

Efforts to standardize innovation classifications face significant challenges due to the dynamic and evolving nature of innovation itself. Innovation continuously transforms with technological advances, emerging interdisciplinary fields, and changing market demands. Static classification systems risk becoming obsolete or irrelevant as new forms of innovation emerge.

Moreover, the integration of different classification systems is hindered by the lack of consensus on fundamental definitions and boundaries. The economic literature, technometrics, management of technology, and other fields often use overlapping but distinct categories, making harmonization difficult ([Coccia, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08955)).

The complexity of innovation ecosystems, involving multiple actors, institutions, and knowledge flows, further complicates the creation of unified taxonomies. For example, the roles of brokers and gatekeepers in interdisciplinary innovation networks highlight the intricate social structures underlying innovation, which are not easily captured by traditional classification schemes ([Yu, Wei, & Liu, 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-024-05225-7)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

In conclusion, the existence of competing systems of innovation classification is a natural and inevitable outcome of the conceptual complexity, methodological diversity, contextual variability, functional multiplicity, and dynamic evolution of innovation. Attempts to impose a single, universal classification system are constrained by the multifaceted nature of innovation phenomena and the diverse needs of stakeholders.

My opinion, based on the evidence, is that rather than striving for a monolithic classification system, the innovation research and policy community should embrace a pluralistic approach. This approach recognizes the legitimacy of multiple classification systems, each optimized for particular analytical, managerial, or policy purposes. Efforts should focus on developing interoperable frameworks and meta-taxonomies that facilitate communication and comparison across different systems without forcing artificial uniformity.

Such pluralism would enhance the richness of innovation understanding and support more nuanced and effective innovation policies and management practices tailored to specific contexts and challenges. It also aligns with the reality of innovation as a complex socio-technical phenomenon embedded in diverse institutional and cultural settings.
