# What Causes IPO Underpricing? New Evidence from China’s SME Market

## Introduction

Initial Public Offering (IPO) underpricing, the phenomenon where IPO shares are priced below their market value leading to significant first-day returns, is a well-documented anomaly in global capital markets. China, particularly its Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) market, exhibits some of the highest levels of IPO underpricing worldwide. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the causes of IPO underpricing in China’s SME market, drawing on recent empirical studies and theoretical insights. The focus is on disentangling deliberate underpricing by issuers from market misvaluation driven by investor behavior and regulatory factors.

## Overview of IPO Underpricing in China’s SME Market

China’s IPO market, especially for SMEs, is characterized by extreme underpricing. Studies show first-day returns averaging well above 80%, with some segments like the ChiNext market exhibiting even higher figures (Meng, Zhang, & Zou, 2016). This level of underpricing far exceeds that observed in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe, where typical first-day returns range between 10% and 20% ([Qian et al., 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jabes-05-2023-0161/full/html)).

The pronounced underpricing in China’s SME market raises critical questions about its underlying causes, which have significant implications for investors, regulators, and policymakers.

## Theoretical Frameworks Explaining IPO Underpricing

Several theories attempt to explain IPO underpricing:

1. **Information Asymmetry Theory:** Issuers possess superior information about their intrinsic value compared to investors. To compensate investors for this uncertainty, issuers deliberately lower the offer price, resulting in underpricing (Rock, 1986; Benveniste & Spindt, 1989).

2. **Investor Sentiment and Market Misvaluation:** Behavioral factors, such as investor over-optimism and irrational exuberance, can inflate demand and lead to market misvaluation, causing prices to deviate from fundamental values (Barry & Brown, 1985; Chen et al., 2003).

3. **Regulatory and Institutional Factors:** Unique regulatory frameworks and market interventions, such as pricing caps and selective approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), influence IPO pricing and contribute to underpricing (Tian, 2011; Qian et al., 2024).

4. **Political Uncertainty:** Frequent local government official turnovers create political uncertainty, which impacts IPO pricing decisions, especially for politically connected firms (Wang & Yao, 2021).

## Empirical Evidence from China’s SME Market

### Deliberate Underpricing vs. Market Misvaluation

Meng et al. (2016) employ a stochastic frontier approach to estimate the fair value of IPOs in China’s ChiNext market and decompose IPO initial returns into deliberate underpricing and market misvaluation components. Their findings indicate that **market misvaluation, driven primarily by the irrational behavior of individual investors, is the dominant cause of IPO underpricing in China’s SME market**, rather than deliberate underpricing by issuers. This suggests that investor sentiment and demand imbalances significantly inflate post-IPO prices beyond their intrinsic values.

Similarly, Zou et al. (2019) analyze 755 IPOs on China’s SME board from 2006 to 2016 and conclude that **misvaluation factors, especially individual investor irrationality, mainly drive IPO underpricing**, with deliberate underpricing playing a lesser role. They also note that IPO pricing characteristics vary over time, influenced by regulatory policy changes.

### Role of Regulatory Policies

China’s IPO market operates under a merit-based review system controlled by the CSRC, which contrasts with the disclosure-based regimes in developed markets. The CSRC imposes **pricing caps and restricts IPO share supply**, which artificially limit offer prices and create pent-up demand among retail investors. This regulatory intervention leads to **excessive oversubscription and frenzied aftermarket trading**, exacerbating underpricing (Tian, 2011; Qian et al., 2024).

Price limit policies introduced in 2014 intended to stabilize IPO pricing have paradoxically **increased underpricing rates** in some market segments (Wang & Wang, 2021). This suggests that regulatory attempts to control IPO pricing can have unintended consequences, further distorting market valuations.

### Investor Behavior and Market Sentiment

Retail investors dominate China’s SME IPO market and tend to exhibit **overoptimism and herd behavior**, bidding aggressively for IPO shares. This exuberance inflates aftermarket prices and contributes to high initial returns (Boulton et al., 2011; Kimbro, 2005). The imbalance between private information held by issuers and public information available to investors leads to **opinion divergence and speculative trading**, reinforcing misvaluation (Easley et al., 2002).

### Political Uncertainty and Connections

Political factors uniquely influence IPO underpricing in China. Frequent **local official turnovers induce political uncertainty**, which compels IPO firms to reduce offering prices voluntarily to mitigate valuation risks (Wang & Yao, 2021). Firms with **pre-IPO political connections** experience more pronounced underpricing, reflecting the strategic role of political ties in navigating regulatory approvals and market access (Francis et al., 2009; Li & Zhou, 2015).

### Ownership Structure and Firm Characteristics

State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned firms exhibit different underpricing dynamics. SOEs often underprice IPOs deliberately to secure post-IPO government support, while private firms rely more heavily on IPO proceeds and political connections for growth, influencing their pricing strategies (Wang & Zhang, 2006; Wang & Yao, 2021).

Moreover, firms in politically sensitive industries and those listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board show higher sensitivity to political uncertainty effects on underpricing (Wang & Yao, 2021).

## Quantitative Highlights

- Average first-day IPO returns in China’s A-share market: **86.36%** (Zhang & Wang, 2020).
- IPO underpricing in ChiNext market primarily driven by market misvaluation rather than deliberate underpricing (Meng et al., 2016).
- Oversubscription ratios and overallotment exercises positively correlate with IPO underpricing, indicating demand-supply imbalances (Qian et al., 2024).
- Political uncertainty increases IPO underpricing through voluntary price reductions, especially for politically connected firms (Wang & Yao, 2021).

## Discussion and Synthesis

The preponderance of evidence suggests that IPO underpricing in China’s SME market is a **multifaceted phenomenon** driven by a combination of market misvaluation, regulatory constraints, investor behavior, and political factors.

- **Market Misvaluation Dominance:** The irrational exuberance of retail investors and demand imbalances are the primary drivers of underpricing, overshadowing deliberate issuer strategies.
- **Regulatory Impact:** Pricing caps and merit-based approvals create artificial constraints that distort market-clearing prices, leading to excessive aftermarket gains.
- **Political Environment:** Political uncertainty and connections uniquely shape IPO pricing, reflecting China’s institutional context.
- **Firm Heterogeneity:** Ownership type, industry sensitivity, and market board listing influence the degree and mechanisms of underpricing.

This nuanced understanding challenges simplistic narratives that attribute underpricing solely to issuer incentives or investor irrationality. Instead, it highlights the **interplay between institutional frameworks, market participants, and political economy** in shaping IPO outcomes.

## Conclusion

IPO underpricing in China’s SME market is primarily caused by **market misvaluation driven by individual investor irrationality and regulatory market frictions**, rather than deliberate underpricing by issuers alone. Regulatory policies such as pricing caps and selective IPO approvals exacerbate supply-demand imbalances, fueling excessive initial returns. Political uncertainty further influences IPO pricing, particularly for firms with political ties and in sensitive industries.

For policymakers, these findings underscore the importance of **reforming regulatory mechanisms** to enhance price discovery and market efficiency, while for investors, awareness of these dynamics is crucial for managing IPO investment risks in China’s SME market.
