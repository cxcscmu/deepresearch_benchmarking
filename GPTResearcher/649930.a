# Why Are Southeast Asians and Black Ethnicities More Prone to Type 2 Diabetes? A Comprehensive Analysis

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health challenge with significant ethnic disparities in prevalence, incidence, and outcomes. Among these disparities, Southeast Asian and Black populations exhibit notably higher risks and earlier onset of T2DM compared to White populations. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based analysis of the underlying factors contributing to this increased susceptibility, focusing on genetic, biological, socioeconomic, and lifestyle determinants. The synthesis draws on recent and authoritative studies, emphasizing findings relevant to these ethnic groups.

## 1. Epidemiological Overview of T2DM in Southeast Asian and Black Populations

Epidemiological data consistently show that Southeast Asian and Black populations have a 2 to 4 times higher prevalence of T2DM compared to White populations in countries like the United Kingdom (Nagar et al., 2021). For example, in the UK Biobank cohort, T2DM prevalence was highest among Asian individuals at 17.9%, followed by Black individuals at 11.7%, compared to 5.5% in Whites ([NIMHD, 2021](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/news-events/research-spotlight/socioeconomic-deprivation-and-ancestry-influence-type-2-diabetes-t2d)). Similarly, studies in Singapore reveal that ethnic Malays and Indians have approximately double the risk of developing T2DM compared to ethnic Chinese, with odds ratios of 2.08 and 2.22, respectively (Koh et al., 2023).

These disparities are not confined to prevalence but extend to earlier age of onset and more rapid disease progression. South Asians, a group closely related to Southeast Asians, develop T2DM on average 8 years earlier than Whites (Hodgson et al., 2024). Black populations also tend to be diagnosed at younger ages and with more severe disease phenotypes.

## 2. Genetic and Biological Factors

### 2.1 Genetic Predisposition and Polygenic Risk

Genetic ancestry plays a crucial role in T2DM susceptibility. Partitioned polygenic risk scores (pPS) have been used to uncover genetic pathways predisposing British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals to T2DM, highlighting variants related to insulin deficiency and lipodystrophy (Hodgson et al., 2024). These genetic factors influence β-cell function and insulin sensitivity, critical determinants of glucose homeostasis.

While many T2DM-associated genes have been identified primarily in European populations, allele frequencies and polymorphisms differ in Southeast Asian and Black populations, potentially modifying disease risk and progression (Tysoe, 2024). For example, South Asians exhibit a higher burden of genetic variants that impair β-cell function, leading to earlier β-cell failure and hyperglycemia.

### 2.2 Pathophysiology: Insulin Resistance and β-Cell Dysfunction

The pathophysiology of T2DM in Southeast Asians and Blacks involves a complex interplay between insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction.

- **Insulin Resistance:** Both groups exhibit increased insulin resistance compared to Whites, even at lower body mass index (BMI) levels. This is partly due to higher visceral adiposity and ectopic fat deposition in organs such as the liver and muscle (Gujral et al., 2019; Petersen et al., 2017).

- **β-Cell Dysfunction:** There is evidence that β-cell dysfunction precedes insulin resistance in South Asians, with early impairments in insulin secretion capacity (Tysoe, 2024; Petersen et al., 2017). This early β-cell failure limits compensatory insulin production, accelerating disease onset.

### 2.3 Body Composition and Ectopic Fat

Southeast Asians and Blacks tend to have a more adverse body composition profile characterized by higher visceral fat and ectopic fat deposits despite lower overall BMI (Gujral et al., 2019). For instance, South Asians have higher abdominal visceral fat, intermuscular fat, and pericardial fat volumes compared to Whites, which are strongly linked to insulin resistance and T2DM risk.

Studies from the MASALA and MESA cohorts demonstrate that differences in body composition partially mediate the elevated prevalence of glycemic impairment in South Asians compared to Whites and Hispanics, though less so compared to Chinese Americans (Gujral et al., 2019).

## 3. Socioeconomic and Environmental Influences

### 3.1 Socioeconomic Deprivation (SED)

Socioeconomic deprivation significantly exacerbates T2DM risk in Southeast Asian and Black populations. SED encompasses factors such as food insecurity, limited access to healthcare and exercise facilities, and chronic stress exposure.

Nagar et al. (2021) found that SED interacts with genetic ancestry in non-additive ways, with the greatest impact on T2DM risk observed in South Asian and African ancestry groups. South Asians with high SED had an odds ratio of 7.95 for T2DM compared to low SED Whites, indicating a synergistic effect of socioeconomic and genetic factors.

### 3.2 Lifestyle and Environmental Factors

Urbanization, migration, and lifestyle changes contribute to increased T2DM risk. Dietary shifts toward high-fat, low-fiber foods, reduced physical activity, and increased psychosocial stress are common in these populations, both in native countries and diaspora communities (Misra & Ganda, 2007).

Moreover, structural oppression and systemic inequalities contribute to disparities in health behaviors and access to preventive care, further increasing T2DM risk among these ethnic groups (Nagar et al., 2021).

## 4. Ethnic-Specific Risk Profiles and Clinical Implications

### 4.1 Unique Biological Risk Factors

Southeast Asians and Blacks exhibit distinct biological risk profiles:

- **Southeast Asians:** Higher insulin resistance at lower BMI, early β-cell dysfunction, and greater visceral adiposity. They also have lower circulating adiponectin and higher leptin levels, hormones involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (Gujral et al., 2019; Tysoe, 2024).

- **Blacks:** Increased insulin resistance and higher prevalence of obesity-related metabolic disturbances, though some studies suggest relatively preserved β-cell function compared to South Asians (NIMHD, 2021).

### 4.2 Mortality and Complications

Interestingly, despite higher T2DM prevalence, some studies report lower all-cause mortality in South Asian and Black individuals with T2DM compared to Whites, possibly due to younger age at diagnosis and differences in comorbidities (Sattar et al., 2023). However, South Asians have higher rates of microvascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy, while Blacks have increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The increased susceptibility to T2DM among Southeast Asian and Black populations is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, adverse body composition, early β-cell dysfunction, and socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. These populations develop T2DM at younger ages and lower BMI, underscoring the need for ethnic-specific screening and intervention strategies.

**Recommendations include:**

- Development of tailored polygenic risk scores and biomarkers to improve early detection in these populations.

- Community-specific interventions addressing socioeconomic barriers, improving diet quality, physical activity, and healthcare access.

- Further research into the mechanistic pathways of β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance unique to these ethnicities.

- Public health policies that incorporate cultural sensitivity and address structural determinants of health.

Understanding the complex interplay of genetics, biology, and environment is critical to reducing T2DM disparities and improving outcomes for Southeast Asian and Black populations.
