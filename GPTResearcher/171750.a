# Report on the Credibility of Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)

## Introduction

In an era marked by an overwhelming volume of information and increasing concerns about misinformation and media bias, platforms that evaluate the credibility and bias of news sources have become essential tools for media literacy. Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), founded in 2015 by Dave M. Van Zandt, is one such platform that has gained significant attention and usage. This report provides a comprehensive and objective analysis of the credibility of MBFC, drawing on multiple sources, including academic reviews, user feedback, and independent evaluations. The report aims to assess MBFC’s methodology, reliability, transparency, and reception within the media and academic communities as of April 2025.

## Overview of Media Bias/Fact Check

MBFC is an independent website dedicated to rating the political bias and factual accuracy of media outlets worldwide. It boasts a database of over 9,300 media sources, journalists, and politicians, making it one of the most extensive media bias resources available online ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)).

The platform evaluates sources based on two primary dimensions:

- **Political Bias:** Rated on a scale from left to right, with categories such as Left, Left-Center, Least Biased, Right-Center, and Right.
- **Factual Reporting:** Assessed based on the accuracy and sourcing of information, with ratings ranging from Very High to Low.

MBFC employs a combination of objective measures and subjective analysis, supported by human evaluators who follow a detailed methodology developed and refined since the site's inception ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/about/)).

## Methodology and Transparency

### Methodology

MBFC’s methodology, updated in 2025, uses a comprehensive weighted scoring system to evaluate ideological bias and factual reliability systematically. This methodology considers political, social, and journalistic dimensions to provide a transparent and replicable assessment of media sources ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/)).

Key features of the methodology include:

- **Bias Scale:** Sources are placed on a bias scale visually represented by a yellow dot, indicating their political alignment.
- **Fact-Check Verification:** MBFC incorporates findings from credible fact-checkers affiliated with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), considering only fact checks from the last five years.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The platform provides detailed explanations of its funding, organizational structure, and corrections policy.
- **Nonpartisanship:** MBFC commits to applying the same standards across the political spectrum and does not advocate for any political party or ideology.

Despite these strengths, MBFC acknowledges that bias measurement is inherently subjective and that its methodology is not a scientifically tested formula but rather a practical guide to help users understand media bias ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/)).

### Transparency and Funding

MBFC is 100% independent and human-driven. It is funded through reader donations, third-party advertising, and membership subscriptions, explicitly avoiding funding from corporations, foundations, or advocacy groups to prevent conflicts of interest ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/about/)).

The site maintains transparency by openly sharing its methodology, funding sources, and organizational details, which enhances its credibility and trustworthiness.

## Credibility and Reliability

### Accuracy and Factual Reporting

MBFC is widely regarded as a reliable source for assessing media bias and factual reporting. It uses multiple layers of verification and cross-references reputable sources to ensure accuracy. For example, MBFC’s ratings for fact-checking organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact are consistent with independent evaluations, rating FactCheck.org as "Least Biased" and "Very High" for factual reporting ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/factcheck/)).

Moreover, scientific studies have found that MBFC’s ratings show high agreement with independent fact-checking datasets from 2017 and correlate strongly with other credibility rating systems such as NewsGuard (correlation coefficient r = 0.81) ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias/Fact_Check)).

### Use in Academic and Media Research

MBFC has been utilized in various academic studies and media research projects analyzing mainstream media, social media, and disinformation. Its data has been employed in cross-platform studies involving TikTok, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and Google Web Search, demonstrating its acceptance as a credible resource in scholarly work ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias/Fact_Check)).

### Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its strengths, MBFC has faced criticism, primarily concerning the subjectivity of its bias ratings and methodology. The Poynter Institute, which develops PolitiFact, has noted that while MBFC is widely cited, its method is "in no way scientific" and may "misfire" ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias/Fact_Check)).

Similarly, the Columbia Journalism Review described MBFC’s assessments as "subjective" and prone to human biases or inconsistencies ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias/Fact_Check)).

However, these criticisms are common to many media bias rating systems due to the inherently subjective nature of bias evaluation. MBFC mitigates this by using a transparent methodology, multiple evaluators, and continuous updates to its ratings.

## Comparative Evaluation with Other Fact-Checking Organizations

MBFC is often compared with other fact-checking organizations such as Snopes, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and The Washington Post Fact-Checker. According to a 2025 review by AHelp, MBFC scored 97/100, slightly higher than Snopes (95/100) and PolitiFact (94/100), indicating a high level of trustworthiness and reliability ([AHelp, 2025](https://academichelp.net/fact-checking-websites/media-bias-review.html)).

MBFC also curates fact checks from IFCN signatories and integrates these into its evaluations, reinforcing its commitment to credible fact-checking standards ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)).

## Practical Use and Impact

MBFC provides a valuable search feature allowing users to check the bias and credibility of any news source by name or URL, helping individuals navigate the complex media landscape. Its extensive database and daily updates make it a practical tool for journalists, researchers, educators, and the general public ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2025](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)).

The platform’s commitment to transparency, nonpartisanship, and detailed reporting supports media literacy efforts and contributes to combating misinformation.

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of available information, Media Bias/Fact Check is a credible and reliable resource for assessing media bias and factual accuracy. Its strengths include:

- An extensive and regularly updated database of over 9,300 sources.
- A transparent and detailed methodology that incorporates objective and subjective analyses.
- Use of credible fact-checking data from IFCN signatories.
- Independence from corporate or political funding.
- Recognition and usage in academic research and media studies.
- High scores in independent reviews compared to other fact-checking organizations.

While MBFC’s methodology is not a scientifically validated formula and involves some subjectivity, this is a common challenge in media bias evaluation. MBFC addresses this through transparency, continuous refinement, and adherence to ethical standards.

Therefore, MBFC should be considered a trustworthy and valuable tool for media consumers seeking to understand media bias and factual reporting, with the caveat that users should remain aware of the inherent complexities and subjectivities involved in bias assessment.
