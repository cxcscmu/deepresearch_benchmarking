## Overview of Climate Change and Health

Climate change alters weather patterns, increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and disrupts ecosystems. These environmental changes directly and indirectly affect human health by increasing exposure to health risks such as heat stress, infectious diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, food and water insecurity, injuries, and mental health disorders. The World Health Organization identifies climate change as a "threat multiplier" that exacerbates existing health disparities and undermines decades of progress in global health ([WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health)).

## Direct Health Impacts of Climate Change

### 1. Heat-Related Illnesses and Mortality

Rising global temperatures have led to an increased incidence of heatwaves, which pose serious risks, especially to older adults, children, and individuals with preexisting health conditions. Heat stress can cause heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Projections estimate an additional 250,000 deaths annually worldwide between 2030 and 2050 attributable to heat stress, malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria linked to climate change ([WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health); [Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/climate-change-and-health)).

### 2. Injuries and Deaths from Extreme Weather Events

Climate change intensifies extreme weather events such as storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires. These events cause direct physical injuries, fatalities, and disrupt healthcare infrastructure. Floods and storms can lead to drowning, trauma, and increase the risk of waterborne diseases. Wildfires release hazardous smoke that deteriorates air quality, aggravating respiratory illnesses ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22148-x); [EPA, 2024](https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-health)).

## Indirect Health Impacts of Climate Change

### 1. Infectious Diseases

Climate change influences the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease. Changes in temperature, precipitation, and humidity affect the habitats and life cycles of vectors like mosquitoes and ticks, potentially expanding their geographic range and transmission seasons. Systematic reviews consistently show associations between meteorological factors and increased incidence of vector-borne diseases globally ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8191619/); [Infectious Diseases of Poverty, 2023](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-023-01102-2)).

Food- and water-borne illnesses also rise due to climate-related disruptions in water quality and food safety, exacerbated by flooding and drought conditions ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22148-x)).

### 2. Respiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases

Worsening air quality resulting from increased ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and wildfire smoke contributes to respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cardiovascular diseases. Reviews indicate a proportional relationship between air pollution exposure and adverse respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8191619/); [EPA, 2024](https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-health)).

### 3. Mental Health Impacts

Climate change-related disasters and chronic environmental stressors are linked to increased mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse. Vulnerable groups, such as older adults and socially marginalized populations, are disproportionately affected. However, mental health impacts remain under-researched compared to physical health outcomes ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22148-x); [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/2021-who-health-and-climate-change-survey)).

## Vulnerable Populations and Health Inequities

Certain populations bear a disproportionate burden of climate-sensitive health risks:

- **Older Adults:** Older individuals face higher risks due to physiological vulnerabilities, pre-existing conditions, and social determinants such as poverty and isolation. Research highlights a lack of targeted studies on older populations despite their increasing global numbers ([PMC, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11116931/)).

- **Children:** Children are more susceptible to heat stress, malnutrition, and infectious diseases due to developing immune systems and higher exposure rates ([Medical News Today, 2024](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/climate-change-and-health)).

- **Low-Income and Marginalized Communities:** These groups often have limited access to healthcare, live in high-risk areas, and face barriers to adaptation, exacerbating health disparities ([WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health)).

- **People with Preexisting Health Conditions:** Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory illnesses increase vulnerability to climate-related health impacts ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22148-x)).

## Challenges in Assessing Climate Change Health Impacts

Despite growing evidence, significant challenges remain in accurately quantifying the health impacts of climate change:

- **Data Gaps:** There is a lack of comprehensive, high-quality climate-health data, especially from low- and middle-income countries, limiting global generalizability ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22148-x)).

- **Focus on Physical Health:** Most research centers on physical health outcomes, with limited exploration of psychosocial and mental health impacts ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8191619/)).

- **Regional and Disease-Specific Limitations:** Many studies are region-specific or disease-specific, hindering comprehensive understanding and policy formulation ([BMC Public Health, 2025](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-22148-x)).

- **Equity in Research:** The majority of studies are conducted by institutions in high-income countries, despite many vulnerable populations residing in low- and middle-income regions ([PMC, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8191619/)).

## Public Health Responses and Adaptation Strategies

Effective responses to climate-sensitive health risks require integrated, multisectoral approaches:

- **Surveillance and Monitoring:** Enhancing health surveillance systems that integrate meteorological and climate data can improve early warning and response to climate-sensitive diseases ([WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/2021-who-health-and-climate-change-survey)).

- **Strengthening Health Infrastructure:** Climate-proofing healthcare facilities and ensuring continuity of care during extreme events is critical ([EPA, 2024](https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-health)).

- **Policy Development:** National health and climate change plans are essential but remain underdeveloped or underfunded in many countries. As of 2021, only about 52% of surveyed countries had developed such plans ([WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240038509)).

- **Community Engagement:** Increasing climate change literacy among vulnerable populations, including older adults, and promoting intergenerational dialogue can enhance resilience ([PMC, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11116931/)).

- **Mitigation Efforts:** Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable transport, energy use, and food systems can yield significant health co-benefits by improving air quality and reducing disease burdens ([WHO, 2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence unequivocally demonstrates that climate change adversely affects human health through multiple direct and indirect pathways, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations such as older adults, children, and marginalized communities. While the physical health impacts—heat-related illnesses, infectious diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions—are well documented, mental health effects and broader psychosocial outcomes require further research and attention.

There is an urgent need to close data gaps, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and to adopt a holistic approach that includes mental health and social determinants of health. National and global health policies must prioritize climate adaptation and mitigation with adequate financing and multisectoral collaboration.

In my assessment, addressing climate change as a health emergency is imperative. Integrating climate considerations into public health planning, strengthening surveillance, and fostering community resilience are essential steps. Moreover, equity must be central to research and policy to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected. Failure to act decisively risks reversing decades of health progress and exacerbating global health inequities.
