# Why Didn't People Smile in Old Photographs? An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The phenomenon of unsmiling faces in old photographs has long intrigued historians, photographers, and the general public alike. Unlike today’s ubiquitous smiling portraits and selfies, photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries predominantly feature subjects with serious, stoic, or neutral expressions. This report aims to provide a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of the reasons behind this cultural and technological peculiarity, drawing on a wide range of reliable and recent sources. The discussion will cover technological constraints, cultural norms, aesthetic traditions, dental health considerations, and the evolution of photographic practices.

## Technological Limitations of Early Photography

### Long Exposure Times

One of the most frequently cited reasons for the lack of smiles in early photographs is the technical limitation of long exposure times. Early photographic processes, such as the daguerreotype introduced in 1839, required subjects to remain perfectly still for extended periods—sometimes up to several minutes—to avoid blurring the image ([Open Culture, 2019](https://www.openculture.com/2019/03/why-nobody-smiles-in-old-photos.html); [History Facts, n.d.](https://historyfacts.com/science-industry/article/why-are-people-never-smiling-in-old-photographs/)). Holding a smile for such durations was physically challenging and unnatural, often leading to blurry or distorted images if the subject moved even slightly.

By the mid-19th century, technological advancements had reduced exposure times significantly—from 20 minutes in the 1840s to as little as 20 seconds by the early 1840s ([History Facts, n.d.](https://historyfacts.com/science-industry/article/why-are-people-never-smiling-in-old-photographs/)). Despite these improvements, the cultural practice of maintaining serious expressions persisted for decades afterward, indicating that technology alone does not fully explain the phenomenon.

### Practical Considerations

Maintaining a neutral or serious expression was simply easier and more comfortable during the lengthy photo sessions. Smiling is a fleeting, dynamic expression, not a sustained pose. Even today, holding a natural smile for extended periods can become uncomfortable or forced ([Upworthy, 2024](https://www.upworthy.com/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photographs-it-wasn-t-just-about-the-long-exposure-times-ex1)). Therefore, early photographers and their subjects preferred expressions that could be held steadily without fatigue or blurring.

## Cultural and Social Norms

### Influence of Painted Portraiture

Photography, when it emerged in the 19th century, was heavily influenced by the conventions of painted portraiture, which had dominated for centuries. Painted portraits typically featured serious or neutral expressions, as smiling was rarely depicted except in subtle forms like the enigmatic Mona Lisa smile ([Vox, 2015](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs); [Upworthy, 2024](https://www.upworthy.com/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photographs-it-wasn-t-just-about-the-long-exposure-times-ex1)).

Portraits were formal, dignified representations intended to convey the subject’s status, wisdom, and composure. Smiling was often associated with frivolity, foolishness, or lower social status. This tradition carried over into early photography, where subjects were posed to emulate the solemnity and gravitas of painted portraits ([History Facts, n.d.](https://historyfacts.com/science-industry/article/why-are-people-never-smiling-in-old-photographs/); [Nebraska State Historical Society, n.d.](https://history.nebraska.gov/why-so-serious-3-reasons-why-you-never-see-a-smile-in-old-photographs/)).

### Victorian and Edwardian Attitudes Toward Smiling

In Western cultures during the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in Victorian and Edwardian societies, smiling was often viewed as undignified or inappropriate for formal occasions. Smiling was linked to buffoonery, drunkenness, or immorality, and was thus discouraged in portraits intended for posterity ([Public Domain Review, 2013](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-serious-and-the-smirk-the-smile-in-portraiture/); [Vox, 2015](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs)).

Art historian Nicholas Jeeves noted that smiling had a "centuries-long history of being viewed as something only buffoons did," and showing teeth was considered a breach of etiquette among the upper classes ([Upworthy, 2024](https://www.upworthy.com/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photographs-it-wasn-t-just-about-the-long-exposure-times-ex1)). Mark Twain famously remarked that a photograph was a serious document, and a "silly, foolish smile" would be "damning to go down to posterity" ([Nebraska State Historical Society, n.d.](https://history.nebraska.gov/why-so-serious-3-reasons-why-you-never-see-a-smile-in-old-photographs/)).

### The Seriousness of the Occasion

Early photography was an expensive and rare event, often reserved for significant life milestones such as weddings, funerals, or commemorations. These were solemn occasions where a serious demeanor was deemed appropriate to reflect the gravity of the moment ([Amazing World Reality, 2024](https://www.amazingworldreality.com/2024/09/the-mystery-of-no-smiles-why-smiles.html); [History Time Machine, n.d.](https://historytimemachine.com/unmasking-the-mystery-why-people-rarely-smiled-in-old-photos/)).

The photograph was considered a legacy to be passed down, and subjects aimed to project dignity, composure, and respectability rather than transient emotions like joy or amusement.

## Dental Health and Aesthetic Considerations

### Poor Dental Hygiene

Another commonly cited explanation is the poor state of dental health in the 19th century. Dental care was rudimentary, and many people suffered from tooth decay, missing teeth, and other oral health issues. Smiling openly could reveal these imperfections, which subjects preferred to conceal ([MemoryCherish, n.d.](https://memorycherish.com/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/); [Amazing World Reality, 2024](https://www.amazingworldreality.com/2024/09/the-mystery-of-no-smiles-why-smiles.html)).

However, some scholars argue that since poor dental health was widespread, it was not necessarily considered unattractive or shameful at the time, and therefore may not fully explain the lack of smiles ([PetaPixel, 2013](https://petapixel.com/2013/09/23/didnt-people-smile-old-photos/); [Public Domain Review, 2013](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-serious-and-the-smirk-the-smile-in-portraiture/)).

### Aesthetic Norms

The aesthetic ideal of the time favored closed-mouth, composed expressions. Smiling was often associated with vulgarity or a lack of refinement, and thus was avoided in formal portraits ([MemoryCherish, n.d.](https://memorycherish.com/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/); [Amazing World Reality, 2024](https://www.amazingworldreality.com/2024/09/the-mystery-of-no-smiles-why-smiles.html)).

## The Evolution of Smiling in Photography

### Technological Advancements and Democratization of Photography

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, technological improvements such as the introduction of the Kodak Brownie camera made photography more accessible and less time-consuming ([Open Culture, 2019](https://www.openculture.com/2019/03/why-nobody-smiles-in-old-photos.html); [History Facts, n.d.](https://historyfacts.com/science-industry/article/why-are-people-never-smiling-in-old-photographs/)).

Shorter exposure times allowed subjects to hold smiles without blurring the image, and photography shifted from a rare, formal event to a common, casual activity. This democratization contributed to the rise of candid and joyful expressions in photographs ([Amazing World Reality, 2024](https://www.amazingworldreality.com/2024/09/the-mystery-of-no-smiles-why-smiles.html)).

### Influence of Popular Media and Changing Cultural Attitudes

The advent of motion pictures and Hollywood in the early 20th century played a significant role in normalizing smiling as a desirable expression. Films captured a range of human emotions, including joy and laughter, which influenced public perception and photographic norms ([Upworthy, 2024](https://www.upworthy.com/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photographs-it-wasn-t-just-about-the-long-exposure-times-ex1)).

By the 1920s and 1930s, smiling in photographs became increasingly common, reflecting broader social changes and a cultural shift toward expressing happiness and approachability ([TIME, 2016](https://time.com/4568032/smile-serious-old-photos/)).

## Conclusion

The absence of smiles in old photographs is a multifaceted phenomenon shaped by a combination of technological, cultural, social, and aesthetic factors. While the long exposure times of early cameras made holding a smile difficult, this technical limitation alone does not fully explain the prevalence of serious expressions. The influence of painted portraiture traditions, Victorian and Edwardian social norms that associated smiling with frivolity or lower status, the solemnity of photographic occasions, and considerations about dental health and aesthetics all contributed significantly.

As photographic technology advanced and societal attitudes evolved, smiling gradually became the norm in photographic portraits, reflecting a broader cultural embrace of expressing joy and warmth. Understanding this history enriches our appreciation of old photographs, reminding us that the stoic faces captured were deliberate and meaningful representations of their time.
