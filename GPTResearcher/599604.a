# Why Are People Against Critical Race Theory?  
## A Detailed and Comprehensive Report  

### Introduction  
Critical Race Theory (CRT) is an academic framework originating in the late 1970s and early 1980s, primarily developed by legal scholars such as Derrick Bell, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and Richard Delgado. CRT examines how race and racism are embedded within legal systems and societal structures, emphasizing that racism is systemic rather than merely individual prejudice. Despite its academic origins and focus, CRT has become a highly contentious topic in public discourse, especially concerning its perceived role in K-12 education. This report aims to explore in depth why people oppose CRT, analyzing the social, political, and cultural factors driving the backlash, supported by empirical data and scholarly insights.

### Understanding Critical Race Theory  
CRT posits that race is a social construct and that racism is deeply ingrained in legal systems and policies, not just individual attitudes. It challenges the notion that laws and institutions are neutral and instead argues that they often reinforce racial hierarchies and inequalities ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05)). In education, CRT scholars investigate how policies contribute to racial disparities, such as school segregation, funding inequities, and discriminatory disciplinary practices. CRT is distinct from culturally relevant teaching but shares the goal of helping students critically analyze social inequalities ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05)).

### Core Reasons for Opposition to CRT  

#### 1. Misrepresentation and Misunderstanding of CRT  
One of the primary reasons for opposition is widespread misunderstanding and misrepresentation of CRT. Critics often conflate CRT with any discussion of race, racism, or diversity initiatives, extending the label to culturally responsive teaching, anti-racism training, and social justice education ([Pinkney, 2025](https://azani.medium.com/critical-truth-telling-and-legal-arguments-in-the-anti-crt-era-codifying-the-academic-freedom-ce5e7bac87de)). This broad and inaccurate framing has led many to believe CRT promotes division by categorizing people into “oppressors” and “oppressed” groups, which critics argue fosters resentment and intolerance ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05)).

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has attributed a wide array of social issues to CRT, including protests, LGBTQ clubs, and diversity training, portraying it as destructive to constitutional values ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05)). This expansive and often inaccurate portrayal fuels fear and opposition among parents and policymakers.

#### 2. Political and Ideological Factors  
The opposition to CRT is deeply intertwined with political and ideological divides. Republican lawmakers and conservative media have strategically framed CRT as a cultural threat, particularly targeting its supposed influence in K-12 education despite CRT rarely being taught at that level ([Sprunt, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/20/1008449181/understanding-the-republican-opposition-to-critical-race-theory)). This framing has been effective in mobilizing a political base by tapping into fears about racial division and perceived threats to traditional American values ([Pinkney, 2025](https://azani.medium.com/critical-truth-telling-and-legal-arguments-in-the-anti-crt-era-codifying-the-academic-freedom-ce5e7bac87de)).

For example, Fox News has mentioned CRT over 1,300 times in a few months, significantly shaping public opinion and legislative agendas ([Ray & Gibbons, 2021](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/)). The timing of the CRT backlash aligns with heightened racial protests following George Floyd’s murder in 2020, which conservatives perceived as threatening to the existing power structures ([Cohen, 2021](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/article/the-push-to-cancel-critical-race-theory-scholars-explain-factors-driving-the-backlash/)).

#### 3. Fear of Racial Division and Impact on White Students  
Opponents often argue that CRT harms white students by making them feel guilty or responsible for systemic racism. This fear is rooted in the misconception that CRT accuses all white people of being racist or oppressors, which CRT scholars explicitly reject ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05); [Brookings, 2021](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/)). Nonetheless, this perception has led to anxiety among parents and educators about exposing children to content that could be seen as demoralizing or divisive ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05)).

Republican lawmakers have voiced concerns that teaching about systemic racism and white privilege exacerbates social divisions rather than healing them ([Sprunt, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/20/1008449181/understanding-the-republican-opposition-to-critical-race-theory)). This has led to legislative efforts to restrict how race and racism can be discussed in schools, often under the guise of promoting unity and avoiding “divisive concepts” ([Waxman, 2023](https://time.com/6266865/critical-race-theory-data-exclusive/)).

#### 4. Legal and Policy Controversies  
The legal implications of CRT-related teachings have also fueled opposition. Several states have passed or proposed laws banning CRT or related concepts in public education, citing concerns about indoctrination and discrimination ([Miller, Fernandez, & Hutchens, 2023](https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/mlr/vol88/iss1/6/)). These laws often use vague language about “divisive concepts” and “race-neutral” policies, which critics argue obscure the actual content being targeted ([Corbin, 2024](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4409726)).

Legal scholars have raised concerns that these bans infringe on academic freedom and free speech rights, particularly in higher education, where CRT is more commonly studied ([Pinkney, 2025](https://azani.medium.com/critical-truth-telling-and-legal-arguments-in-the-anti-crt-era-codifying-the-academic-freedom-ce5e7bac87de); [Miller et al., 2023](https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/mlr/vol88/iss1/6/)). The complexity and ambiguity of these laws contribute to confusion and fear among educators about what they can or cannot teach.

#### 5. Cultural and Social Backlash  
The backlash against CRT is part of a broader cultural conflict often described as a “culture war.” CRT has become a symbol in debates over race, history, and identity politics. Opponents see it as part of a “woke” agenda that challenges traditional narratives about American history and values ([Cohen, 2021](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/article/the-push-to-cancel-critical-race-theory-scholars-explain-factors-driving-the-backlash/)).

This cultural framing has been amplified by conservative activists like Christopher Rufo, who have redefined CRT as a threat to social cohesion and American patriotism ([Pinkney, 2025](https://azani.medium.com/critical-truth-telling-and-legal-arguments-in-the-anti-crt-era-codifying-the-academic-freedom-ce5e7bac87de)). The term “critical race theory” itself has become a political lightning rod, eliciting stronger opposition than the academic concepts it originally described ([Safarpour et al., 2024](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/public-opinion-toward-critical-race-theory-in-academia-legislation-and-name/0D174C2EF498B86534957DB6C91965D2)).

### Empirical Evidence on Opposition to CRT  

A study published in the *Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics* found that public support for banning CRT varies significantly depending on how the concept is framed. When presented with an academic description of CRT, support for bans was low. However, when the term “Critical Race Theory” was used or when descriptions mirrored legislative language, support for bans increased, especially among Republicans ([Safarpour et al., 2024](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/public-opinion-toward-critical-race-theory-in-academia-legislation-and-name/0D174C2EF498B86534957DB6C91965D2)).

This indicates that political messaging and framing significantly influence public opinion, with conservative elites more actively shaping negative perceptions of CRT than their Democratic counterparts ([Safarpour et al., 2024](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/public-opinion-toward-critical-race-theory-in-academia-legislation-and-name/0D174C2EF498B86534957DB6C91965D2)).

### Conclusion and Opinion  

The opposition to Critical Race Theory is multifaceted, rooted in a combination of misunderstanding, political strategy, cultural conflict, and fears about social division. While CRT as an academic framework seeks to analyze and address systemic racism, its portrayal in public discourse has often been distorted to serve political agendas that capitalize on racial anxieties and cultural polarization.

Given the evidence, it is clear that much of the backlash is less about CRT’s actual content and more about how it has been framed and weaponized in political and cultural debates. The conflation of CRT with broader diversity and inclusion efforts, combined with strategic misinformation, has created a climate of fear and resistance that obscures the potential benefits of critically examining systemic racism.

From an objective standpoint, opposition to CRT reflects broader societal struggles with race, identity, and power. While concerns about divisiveness merit thoughtful consideration, banning or misrepresenting CRT risks undermining efforts to achieve racial equity and social justice. Education should empower students to understand complex social realities, including systemic racism, rather than avoid them due to political sensitivities.
