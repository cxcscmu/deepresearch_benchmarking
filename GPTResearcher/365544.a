## Introduction

Simone Biles, widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time, has faced extraordinary pressures stemming from her athletic achievements and global fame. Since her Olympic debut in 2016, Biles has not only set records but also become a prominent advocate for mental health awareness in sports. This report examines how Simone Biles has coped with the multifaceted pressures of fame, including public scrutiny, mental health challenges, and the expectations of being a global icon. Drawing on a variety of recent and reliable sources, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of her coping strategies and their broader implications.

## The Nature of Fame and Its Pressures on Simone Biles

Simone Biles’ rise to fame was meteoric, marked by unprecedented success at a young age. By 19, she had already won multiple Olympic gold medals and dominated World Championships, earning her the title of the "Greatest of All Time" (G.O.A.T.) in gymnastics ([Good Housekeeping, 2022](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/inspirational-stories/a40911368/simone-biles-mental-health-interview-2022/)). However, with fame came intense public scrutiny and expectations. Biles has openly described the double-edged sword of fame, noting that constant recognition prevents her from experiencing normalcy and can be mentally exhausting ([EssentiallySports, 2024](https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-gymnastics-news-despite-lebron-james-comparisons-simone-biles-exposes-the-negative-side-of-fame-sometimes-its-scary/)).

The pressure to maintain perfection, often invisible to the public, has been a persistent challenge. Unlike physical injuries, mental health struggles are less visible and often misunderstood or judged harshly by the public and media ([Forbes, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauladavis/2021/07/28/simone-biles-mental-health--the-pressure-to-be-perfect/)). Biles’ experience highlights the psychological toll of living up to the "push through pain" mentality pervasive in elite sports.

## Mental Health Challenges and Public Vulnerability

Biles’ candidness about her mental health struggles, including anxiety, ADHD, and the dangerous "twisties" phenomenon, has been pivotal in reshaping public discourse around athlete well-being ([NeuroLaunch, 2025](https://neurolaunch.com/simone-biles-mental-health/)). The "twisties," a mental block causing loss of spatial awareness mid-air, posed a significant threat to her safety and performance during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, leading to her withdrawal from several events ([CNN, 2021](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/22/sport/simone-biles-gymnastics-spt/index.html)).

By prioritizing her mental health over competition, Biles challenged traditional notions of strength and resilience, demonstrating that vulnerability is a form of courage. This decision sparked widespread conversation and advocacy for mental health support in sports organizations worldwide ([NeuroLaunch, 2025](https://neurolaunch.com/simone-biles-mental-health/)).

## Coping Strategies Employed by Simone Biles

### Professional Therapy and Mental Health Support

One of the cornerstone strategies Biles has employed is seeking professional mental health support. She has openly discussed the benefits of therapy and medication in managing her anxiety and ADHD, helping to destigmatize mental health treatment in the athletic community ([OurMental.Health, 2024](https://www.ourmental.health/stars-struggles/simone-biles-overcoming-anxiety-and-adhd-a-champions-mental-health-journey)). Biles’ transparency about therapy normalizes the idea that even elite athletes require psychological support, encouraging others to seek help without shame.

### Mindfulness and Stress-Reduction Techniques

Biles incorporates mindfulness practices such as meditation and breathing exercises into her routine to manage stress and maintain focus amid the chaos of competition and public scrutiny ([NeuroLaunch, 2025](https://neurolaunch.com/simone-biles-mental-health/)). These techniques help her stay grounded and improve her mental resilience, illustrating a holistic approach to athlete well-being that balances physical and psychological training.

### Boundary-Setting and Saying “No”

Recognizing the importance of protecting her mental space, Biles has learned to set firm boundaries, including limiting her exposure to social media and declining certain commitments that may overwhelm her ([NeuroLaunch, 2025](https://neurolaunch.com/simone-biles-mental-health/)). This conscious effort to say “no” is a vital coping mechanism that helps prevent burnout and preserves her mental health.

### Creating Balance Beyond Gymnastics

Biles emphasizes the importance of having interests and relationships outside of gymnastics to maintain a sense of identity beyond her athletic achievements ([NeuroLaunch, 2025](https://neurolaunch.com/simone-biles-mental-health/)). This balance contributes to her overall well-being and resilience, allowing her to navigate the pressures of fame with a grounded perspective.

### Support Systems and Advocacy

Biles’ strength also derives from robust support systems, including her family, coaches, and teammates, who provide emotional stability and encouragement ([CircleDNA, 2024](https://circledna.com/blog/simone-biles-and-the-power-of-resilience-in-overcoming-adversity/)). Moreover, her advocacy work, particularly speaking out against sexual abuse in gymnastics, has empowered her and others, transforming personal adversity into collective resilience and reform efforts.

## Impact of Media and Public Perception

The media’s role in shaping the narrative around Biles’ mental health has been complex. While some coverage has been supportive, highlighting her “radical courage” and champion mindset, other commentary has been critical, questioning her toughness and commitment ([Columbia Journalism Review, 2021](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/biles_osaka_olympics_mental_health.php)). Biles has had to navigate this polarized environment, often choosing to focus on her mental health and block out negative commentary ([The SportsRush, 2024](https://thesportsrush.com/gymnastics-news-you-almost-hit-a-wall-simone-biles-recalls-rising-to-fame-with-an-identity-crisis/)).

Despite the challenges, Biles’ openness has contributed to a shift in public perception, encouraging a more empathetic and informed dialogue about mental health in sports and society at large ([OurMental.Health, 2024](https://www.ourmental.health/stars-struggles/simone-biles-overcoming-anxiety-and-adhd-a-champions-mental-health-journey)).

## Personal Reflections and Resilience

Biles has expressed that coping with fame and its pressures has sometimes been “scary” and disorienting, describing moments of identity crisis and self-doubt ([The SportsRush, 2024](https://thesportsrush.com/gymnastics-news-you-almost-hit-a-wall-simone-biles-recalls-rising-to-fame-with-an-identity-crisis/)). However, her resilience is evident in her ability to prioritize self-care and mental health, even when facing criticism.

Her decision to step back during the Tokyo Olympics was a defining moment, illustrating that resilience is not about relentless toughness but about recognizing limits and taking purposeful action to protect well-being ([Forbes, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauladavis/2021/07/28/simone-biles-mental-health--the-pressure-to-be-perfect/)). Biles’ journey underscores the importance of redefining strength to include vulnerability and self-compassion.

## Conclusion

Simone Biles has coped with the pressures of fame through a multifaceted approach that includes professional therapy, mindfulness, boundary-setting, and maintaining a balanced life beyond gymnastics. Her openness about mental health challenges and advocacy has not only helped her manage the intense scrutiny and expectations but also sparked a global conversation about athlete well-being. Biles’ resilience and courage in prioritizing mental health over medals represent a transformative shift in sports culture, emphasizing that true strength encompasses vulnerability and self-care.

Her journey offers valuable lessons for athletes and the broader public, highlighting the necessity of support systems, mental health resources, and compassionate media coverage. As Biles continues to compete and advocate, her legacy extends beyond gymnastics, inspiring a healthier, more sustainable approach to fame and athletic excellence.
