# Why Should We Increase the Minimum Wage?  
## A Comprehensive and Evidence-Based Analysis  

### Introduction  
The federal minimum wage in the United States has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009, failing to keep pace with inflation, productivity growth, and the rising cost of living. This stagnation has sparked widespread debate on whether increasing the minimum wage—specifically to $15 per hour—is necessary and beneficial. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based analysis of the reasons for increasing the minimum wage, drawing on recent research and authoritative sources. The report examines economic, social, and fiscal impacts, considering both benefits and potential drawbacks, to offer a balanced, objective perspective.

### 1. Economic Necessity: Addressing Inadequate Living Standards  

#### 1.1 Current Minimum Wage Insufficiency  
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is insufficient for workers to meet basic living expenses. Research shows that even in 2021, a full-time worker earning minimum wage could not afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in any U.S. county ([Jackson Lewis, 2021](https://www.jacksonlewis.com/insights/advantages-and-disadvantages-raising-federal-minimum-wage-15)). Moreover, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) highlights that in virtually all urban and rural areas, a single adult without children must earn more than $15 per hour to cover housing and other essentials ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)).

#### 1.2 Impact on Poverty and Income Inequality  
Raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would lift the pay of approximately 32 million workers, representing 21% of the U.S. workforce, with an average annual pay increase of about $3,300 per affected worker ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)). This increase would significantly reduce poverty rates, especially among families with incomes below $50,000, who constitute nearly 57% of affected workers. It would also help reduce racial and gender wage gaps, as 31% of Black workers and 26% of Hispanic workers would benefit from wage increases ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)).

### 2. Social Benefits of Increasing the Minimum Wage  

#### 2.1 Improved Quality of Life and Reduced Poverty  
Increasing the minimum wage would improve the standard of living for low-wage workers, enabling them to better afford rent, childcare, healthcare, and other necessities. Studies indicate that higher wages reduce poverty and improve family health, school attendance, and reduce crime rates ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/procon/minimum-wage-debate); [Oxfam, 2025](https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/6-simple-reasons-we-should-raise-the-minimum-wage/)). For example, raising the California minimum wage to $13 an hour was projected to increase incomes for 7.5 million families and reduce dropout rates among teens ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/procon/minimum-wage-debate)).

#### 2.2 Enhanced Employee Morale and Productivity  
Higher wages contribute to increased employee morale, reducing turnover and absenteeism, which in turn can boost productivity and customer satisfaction ([Jackson Lewis, 2021](https://www.jacksonlewis.com/insights/advantages-and-disadvantages-raising-federal-minimum-wage-15); [Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/procon/minimum-wage-debate)). This creates a more stable and efficient workforce, benefiting employers and the economy.

### 3. Economic Growth and Fiscal Impacts  

#### 3.1 Boosting Consumer Demand and Economic Activity  
Low-wage workers tend to spend additional earnings immediately on basic needs, which stimulates aggregate demand and economic growth. Research shows that minimum wage increases are associated with higher consumer spending, particularly in areas with many low-wage workers ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)). The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago predicted that a $1.75 increase in the minimum wage would boost household spending by $48 billion the following year ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/procon/minimum-wage-debate)).

#### 3.2 Fiscal Benefits and Reduced Government Spending  
Raising the minimum wage reduces reliance on government assistance programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), leading to lower public spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a $15 minimum wage would lift nearly 1 million people out of poverty and decrease government outlays on income support programs ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/blog/cbo-analysis-confirms-that-a-15-minimum-wage-raises-earnings-of-low-wage-workers-reduces-inequality-and-has-significant-and-direct-fiscal-effects-large-progressive-redistribution-of-income-caused/)). Additionally, increased earnings lead to higher tax revenues, resulting in net savings for the federal government ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8286698/)).

### 4. Addressing Common Concerns and Counterarguments  

#### 4.1 Employment Effects and Job Loss  
A common argument against raising the minimum wage is the potential for job losses, particularly in small businesses. However, extensive research shows that modest increases in the minimum wage do not lead to significant job losses. A 2019 review found the median employment effect to be essentially zero ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/blog/cbo-analysis-confirms-that-a-15-minimum-wage-raises-earnings-of-low-wage-workers-reduces-inequality-and-has-significant-and-direct-fiscal-effects-large-progressive-redistribution-of-income-caused/)). Historical data from the 1968 peak minimum wage period also showed wage growth and reduced racial earnings gaps without employment declines ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/why-america-needs-a-15-minimum-wage/)).

#### 4.2 Impact on Small Businesses and Operating Costs  
While opponents argue that higher wages increase operating costs and tighten margins for small businesses, many small business owners support raising the minimum wage, believing it would spark consumer demand and help retain employees ([Oxfam, 2025](https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/6-simple-reasons-we-should-raise-the-minimum-wage/)). Moreover, increased consumer spending from higher wages can offset some cost increases by boosting sales.

#### 4.3 Childcare and Service Costs  
Raising the minimum wage may increase costs in sectors like childcare, where wages are currently low. For example, a federally mandated $15 minimum wage could increase childcare labor costs by about 33%, potentially raising childcare costs by 21% ([Jackson Lewis, 2021](https://www.jacksonlewis.com/insights/advantages-and-disadvantages-raising-federal-minimum-wage-15)). Policymakers should consider complementary measures to mitigate these effects.

### 5. Broader Societal and Historical Context  

#### 5.1 Longstanding Demand for a Living Wage  
The demand for a $15 minimum wage aligns with historical civil rights goals. The 1963 March on Washington called for a $2.00 minimum wage, equivalent to $15 today after inflation adjustment ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)). This underscores the enduring nature of the fight for fair wages.

#### 5.2 Addressing Inequality and Supporting Vulnerable Workers  
Increasing the minimum wage is a direct way to reduce income inequality and support vulnerable populations, including women, minorities, and single parents. Nearly one in three working single parents would receive a raise, helping to alleviate poverty and improve family stability ([EPI, 2021](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)).

### 6. Complementary Policies to Maximize Impact  

Research suggests that the poverty-reducing effects of minimum wage increases can be modest due to imperfect targeting and interactions with income support programs ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8286698/)). To maximize benefits, coupling wage increases with expanded public investments, such as employer tax credits and reduced marginal tax rates for low-income workers, can enhance upward mobility and reduce poverty more effectively ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8286698/)).

### Conclusion  

Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour is a necessary and evidence-supported policy to improve the economic well-being of millions of American workers and their families. It addresses the inadequacy of current wages to meet basic living costs, reduces poverty and income inequality, boosts consumer demand and economic growth, and decreases reliance on government assistance programs. While concerns about employment effects and increased costs exist, extensive research shows these impacts are minimal or manageable. Complementary policies can further enhance the anti-poverty effects of wage increases. Thus, raising the minimum wage is a prudent, equitable, and economically sound strategy for the United States in 2025 and beyond.
