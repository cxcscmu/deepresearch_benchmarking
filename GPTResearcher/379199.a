# Report on the Causes of Sexism

## Introduction

Sexism, defined as prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender, predominantly affects women and marginalized genders but can also impact men in certain contexts. It manifests through individual biases, institutional practices, and deeply ingrained societal structures that perpetuate gender inequalities. Understanding the causes of sexism requires a multifaceted exploration of psychological, social, cultural, institutional, and structural factors. This report synthesizes current research and authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive analysis of the causes of sexism, highlighting how sexism is reproduced and maintained across different levels of society.

## Defining Sexism and Its Scope

Sexism involves beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that devalue individuals based on their sex or gender. It often aligns with patriarchal norms that prioritize male dominance and masculinity over femininity and other gender expressions. Sexism can be explicit or implicit, conscious or unconscious, and operates at individual, institutional, and structural levels ([Masequesmay, 2009](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sexism)).

While sexism primarily targets women and girls, it also affects transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming individuals through overlapping prejudices such as transmisogyny ([Strong, 2022](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-sexism)). The systemic nature of sexism results in disparities in power, resources, opportunities, and social status.

## Psychological and Social Origins of Sexism

### Prejudice and Stereotypes

Sexism begins with prejudices—biased attitudes based on myths, stereotypes, and generalizations learned from socialization agents such as family, education, and media. These stereotypes often portray women as weaker, less competent, and more emotional, relegating them to domestic and nurturing roles while positioning men as rational leaders ([Britannica, 2025](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sexism)).

Ambivalent Sexism Theory (AST) explains how sexism persists through two complementary forms: hostile sexism, which punishes women who resist traditional gender roles, and benevolent sexism, which rewards women who conform to them. This dynamic reinforces male dominance and female subordination by managing the tension between interdependence and societal hierarchy ([Glick & Fiske, 1996](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5657003/)).

### Social Norms and Gender Roles

Social norms—informal, often unspoken rules governing behavior—play a critical role in perpetuating sexism. These norms dictate expected behaviors for men and women, reinforcing stereotypes such as men being agentic and women being communal. The pressure to conform to these norms is sustained through social interactions and cultural expectations ([PMC, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066375/)).

Media representations further entrench these norms by portraying restrictive and stereotypical images of gender, which influence public perceptions and individual self-concepts. Exposure to such portrayals strengthens sexist attitudes, fosters harassment, and limits women's career ambitions ([PMC, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10218532/)).

### Internalized Sexism

Internalized sexism occurs when individuals absorb and accept sexist beliefs about their own gender, leading to self-limiting behaviors and attitudes. This internalization can reduce resistance to oppression and even cause individuals to perpetuate sexism themselves, often as a coping mechanism to fit into patriarchal societies ([Strong, 2022](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-sexism)).

## Institutional and Structural Causes of Sexism

### Historical and Institutional Foundations

Sexism is deeply embedded in social institutions such as law, education, work, and politics. Historically, these institutions were designed to benefit wealthy, white men, excluding women and marginalized groups from citizenship and power. Although social movements like feminism have challenged these structures, sexist and genderist frameworks persist in modified forms ([University of Minnesota, 2025](https://pressbooks.umn.edu/interculturaldialogues/chapter/chapter-7-gender-and-sexism/)).

Institutional sexism manifests in policies and practices that disadvantage women, such as the gender wage gap, underrepresentation in leadership, and biased medical treatment. For example, women earned only 84% of what men earned in 2020 in the United States, reflecting systemic economic disparities ([Medical News Today, 2025](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-sexism)).

### Organizational Structures and Workplace Sexism

Workplaces often reflect and reinforce societal sexism through organizational structures, processes, and decision-making practices. Gender inequalities in leadership, hiring, promotion, and workplace culture contribute to hostile and benevolent sexism among organizational decision-makers. These attitudes influence HR practices, leading to gender-biased decisions and discriminatory behaviors such as sexual harassment and incivility ([PMC, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4584998/)).

The socialization of organizational members within sexist environments perpetuates these attitudes, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. For instance, men with hostile sexist beliefs may tolerate or engage in harassment, while benevolent sexism can justify protective but limiting treatment of women ([PMC, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4584998/)).

### Structural Sexism

Structural sexism refers to sexism embedded in the societal framework, including institutions, cultural norms, and social relations. It normalizes and legitimizes gender inequalities across macro (state, national), meso (community, organizational), and micro (individual) levels. Structural sexism is reproduced through ideology, gender socialization, and systemic harm such as violence and economic exclusion ([SpringerLink, 2024](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-71060-0_90-1)).

This form of sexism is sustained by social constructions of gender and sex, where biological differences are conflated with socially prescribed roles and hierarchies. Patriarchy, as a gender system, intersects with other systems of inequity, reinforcing the status quo and limiting social change ([SpringerLink, 2024](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-71060-0_90-1)).

## Cultural and Global Influences

Sexism is not uniform across cultures but shares pervasive patterns related to gender and age stereotypes. These stereotypes balance perceptions of warmth and competence, often valuing men as competent but less warm and women as warm but less competent. Such ambivalent stereotypes serve to manage societal hierarchies and interpersonal interdependence ([PMC, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5657003/)).

Global capitalism, Western imperialism, militarism, and racism also contribute to gender inequalities worldwide. These forces create conditions that exacerbate sexism, especially in non-Western contexts, where cultural and religious norms intersect with global power dynamics ([University of Minnesota, 2025](https://pressbooks.umn.edu/interculturaldialogues/chapter/chapter-7-gender-and-sexism/)).

## Summary of Causes

The causes of sexism are multifaceted and interrelated:

- **Psychological causes**: Prejudices, stereotypes, and social norms learned through socialization create biased attitudes toward gender roles.
- **Social causes**: Reinforcement of gender roles through media, cultural expectations, and social interactions perpetuate sexist beliefs.
- **Institutional causes**: Historical exclusion and ongoing discriminatory policies in law, education, and workplaces maintain gender inequalities.
- **Structural causes**: Sexism embedded in societal frameworks normalizes and legitimizes gender disparities across multiple levels.
- **Cultural and global causes**: Cross-cultural patterns of ambivalent sexism and global power structures influence the persistence and variation of sexism worldwide.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Sexism is a deeply entrenched social phenomenon sustained by a complex interplay of individual biases, institutional practices, and structural inequalities. Its persistence is not merely a product of individual prejudice but is embedded in societal frameworks that reproduce gender hierarchies. Addressing sexism requires comprehensive strategies targeting psychological attitudes, social norms, institutional reforms, and structural transformations.

Given the evidence, it is clear that sexism cannot be eradicated solely through changing individual attitudes; systemic change is imperative. Efforts must focus on dismantling patriarchal structures, reforming institutions, and promoting equitable social norms. Additionally, recognizing the intersectionality of sexism with other forms of oppression is crucial for effective interventions.

The economic cost of sexism, estimated at $12 trillion globally, underscores the urgency of addressing this issue not only as a matter of social justice but also of economic and public health significance ([Medical News Today, 2025](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-is-sexism)). Ultimately, combating sexism demands coordinated action across societal levels and cultural contexts to foster genuine gender equality.
