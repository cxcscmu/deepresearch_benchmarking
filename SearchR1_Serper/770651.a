<search>specific causes of long-term climate change</search>

<think>I found out that long-term climate change is caused by factors such as greenhouse gases, volcanic eruptions, and solar variations. I'll search for more detailed information about these causes.</think>

<search>greenhouse gases causing long-term climate change</search>

<think>I found out that greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, cause long-term climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. Now I'll search for other causes.</think>

<search>volcanic eruptions causing long-term climate change</search>

<think>I found out that volcanic eruptions can cause short-term climate change, but they can also contribute to long-term climate change by releasing gases and particles into the atmosphere. Now I'll search for the last cause.</think>

<search>solar variations causing long-term climate change</search>

<think>I found out that solar variations, such as changes in the sun's output of energy, can cause long-term climate change. Now I have the main causes of long-term climate change.</think>
