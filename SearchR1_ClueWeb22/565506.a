<think>I need to understand how the carbon cycle affects climate change. I found out that the carbon cycle involves the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, terrestrial biosphere, and lithosphere. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, leading to climate change. I'll search for more information on how the carbon cycle affects climate change.</think>
