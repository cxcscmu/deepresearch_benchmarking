<think>I found out that abortion is the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy. I also found out that the ongoing debate of whether abortion should remain legal or illegal arose in the 1970's during the Roe vs. Wade case. I need to determine if abortion should be legal or illegal.</think>

<answer>should abortion be legal</answer>
