<answer>Stress and emotional state can affect a woman's menstrual cycle by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased levels of cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This can suppress normal levels of reproductive hormones, potentially leading to abnormal ovulation, anovulation, or amenorrhea.</answer>
