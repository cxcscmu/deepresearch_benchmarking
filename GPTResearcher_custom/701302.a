## Historical and Ethnic Roots of the Conflict

The origins of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh trace back to the Soviet era. Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous region internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians (approximately 95%) ([Drishti IAS, 2020](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/armenia-azerbaijan-conflict)).

### Soviet Legacy and Territorial Arrangements

- **1920**: The Soviet Union established the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic despite its Armenian majority population ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war)).
- **Late 1980s**: As the Soviet Union weakened, the Nagorno-Karabakh legislature voted to join Armenia, which Moscow refused to sanction. This decision ignited ethnic tensions and demands for unification with Armenia ([CBS News, 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-caucasus-lands-why-it-could-get-uglier/)).
- **1991**: Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence, leading to a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The war resulted in approximately 30,000 deaths and displaced over one million people, mostly Azerbaijanis ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war); [Drishti IAS, 2020](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/armenia-azerbaijan-conflict)).

### Ethnic and Religious Dimensions

The conflict also has a significant ethnic and religious dimension:

| Aspect              | Armenia                             | Azerbaijan                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Ethnic Majority     | Armenian                          | Azerbaijani                     |
| Religious Majority  | Christian (Armenian Apostolic)   | Muslim (Shia Islam majority)    |

This religious and ethnic divide has deepened hostilities and complicated reconciliation efforts ([Drishti IAS, 2020](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/armenia-azerbaijan-conflict)).

## Political Dynamics and Domestic Factors

### Nationalist Sentiments and Leadership

Both Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders have used the Nagorno-Karabakh issue to consolidate domestic political support, often fueling nationalist rhetoric and hardening positions against compromise ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war)).

- Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who came to power in 2018 amid a popular uprising, has taken a firmer stance on Nagorno-Karabakh, including calls for its formal integration into Armenia ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war)).
- Azerbaijan, under President Ilham Aliyev, has pursued a more aggressive military posture, motivated partly by domestic pressures and economic challenges, including losses from low oil prices ([Wilson Center, 2020](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-expert-analysis)).

### Failed Diplomatic Efforts and Ceasefires

- A Russian-brokered ceasefire in 1994 ended the first war but failed to resolve the underlying territorial dispute ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war)).
- Sporadic clashes have continued, including a significant flare-up in 2016 (the "Four-Day War") and renewed hostilities in July 2020 before the major escalation in September 2020 ([Drishti IAS, 2020](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/armenia-azerbaijan-conflict); [Wilson Center, 2020](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-expert-analysis)).

## Military and Strategic Considerations

### Military Buildup and Capabilities

Both countries have engaged in military buildups, with Azerbaijan significantly increasing its defense spending, leveraging oil revenues to modernize its forces ([NationMaster, n.d.](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Armenia/Azerbaijan/Military)).

| Military Aspect      | Armenia                           | Azerbaijan                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Military Size       | Smaller but experienced          | Larger, better funded           |
| Equipment          | Older Soviet-era equipment       | Modernized with Turkish and Israeli support |
| Recent Conflicts   | Defensive posture in Nagorno-Karabakh | Offensive operations in 2020    |

### 2020 Escalation

- On September 27, 2020, a significant offensive by Azerbaijan, reportedly with Turkish backing, marked the most serious fighting since 1994 ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war); [Wilson Center, 2020](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-expert-analysis)).
- The fighting involved heavy artillery, tanks, drones, and infantry, resulting in hundreds of casualties and widespread destruction ([CBS News, 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-caucasus-lands-why-it-could-get-uglier/)).

## International Dimensions and Regional Rivalries

### Role of Russia

- Russia has historically been the dominant external player, acting as a mediator and arms supplier, particularly to Armenia.
- However, Armenia perceives Moscow’s support as increasingly ambivalent, especially after Pashinyan's rise to power ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war)).

### Role of Turkey

- Turkey has emerged as a significant supporter of Azerbaijan, providing military assistance and diplomatic backing.
- This involvement has intensified the conflict and introduced a new dimension to the Turkish-Russian rivalry, which also plays out in Syria, Libya, and Ukraine ([Foreign Affairs, 2020](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2020-10-01/why-armenia-and-azerbaijan-are-brink-war)).

### International Mediation Efforts

- The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, the United States, and France, has led peace negotiations since 1994 but has failed to produce a lasting settlement ([CBS News, 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-caucasus-lands-why-it-could-get-uglier/)).
- The lack of effective international mediation and the absence of strong engagement by Western powers, particularly the U.S., have contributed to the conflict's persistence ([CBS News, 2020](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-caucasus-lands-why-it-could-get-uglier/)).

## Socioeconomic and Humanitarian Impact

### Displacement and Casualties

- The initial war displaced over one million people, mainly Azerbaijanis.
- The 2020 conflict resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, including civilian casualties due to shelling of populated areas ([NBC News, 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nagorno-karabakh-what-s-behind-fighting-between-armenia-azerbaijan-n1241538)).

### Economic Consequences

- Renewed fighting threatens regional stability, potentially disrupting oil and gas exports from Azerbaijan, a significant energy supplier to Europe and Central Asia ([Drishti IAS, 2020](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/armenia-azerbaijan-conflict)).
- Both countries face economic strains exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices, which may incentivize aggressive postures to rally domestic support ([Wilson Center, 2020](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/nagorno-karabakh-conflict-expert-analysis)).

## Summary and Opinion

The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is deeply rooted in historical territorial arrangements, ethnic and religious divisions, and competing nationalisms. The Soviet legacy of placing an Armenian-majority region within Azerbaijan's borders sowed the seeds of long-term discord.

Domestic political dynamics in both countries have hardened positions, with leaders leveraging nationalist sentiments for political gain. The failure of diplomatic efforts, combined with significant military buildups and external involvement—particularly Turkey’s support for Azerbaijan and Russia’s ambivalent role—has escalated the conflict beyond a frozen dispute.

The 2020 war marked a significant departure from previous skirmishes, with Azerbaijan launching a preplanned offensive supported by Turkey, aiming to alter the status quo militarily. Armenia’s government, under Pashinyan, has taken a more uncompromising stance, reflecting both domestic pressures and concerns over waning Russian support.

International mediation remains ineffective, and the risk of broader regional destabilization persists, given the involvement of major powers and the strategic importance of the South Caucasus.

**In my assessment, the conflict’s persistence and escalation are primarily driven by a combination of unresolved historical grievances, entrenched ethnic nationalism, domestic political calculations, and shifting regional power dynamics. Without a renewed and genuinely committed international mediation effort that addresses both the security concerns and political aspirations of all parties, the cycle of violence is likely to continue, with devastating humanitarian and regional consequences.**
