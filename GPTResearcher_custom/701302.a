## Historical Background of the Conflict

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous region internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians. The roots of the conflict trace back to the early 20th century and were exacerbated during the Soviet era when the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) was established within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic despite its Armenian majority ([BBC News, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772)).

As the Soviet Union began to collapse in the late 1980s, the Nagorno-Karabakh regional parliament voted to join Armenia, sparking ethnic clashes and eventually a full-scale war after both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence from Moscow. The war (1988-1994) resulted in approximately 30,000 deaths and displaced around one million people, mostly Azerbaijanis ([NBC News, 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/why-are-armenia-azerbaijan-fighting-nagorno-karabakh-n1240833)).

The 1994 Russian-brokered ceasefire left Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent districts under Armenian control, though the territory remained internationally recognized as Azerbaijani. Since then, Nagorno-Karabakh has been governed by a self-declared republic backed by Armenia but unrecognized internationally ([BBC News, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772)).

## Core Causes of the Conflict

### 1. Territorial Dispute

The primary cause is the territorial claim over Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan insists on its territorial integrity, including Nagorno-Karabakh, whereas Armenia supports the self-determination of the ethnic Armenian population in the region. The conflicting claims have been the trigger for recurrent violence and war.

### 2. Ethnic and Cultural Identity

Nagorno-Karabakh's population is majority Armenian, and Armenians view the region as part of their historic homeland, often referred to as "Artsakh." Conversely, Azerbaijanis consider Nagorno-Karabakh integral to their national identity and trace cultural heritage to the Karabakh Khanate of the 18th century ([NBC News, 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/why-are-armenia-azerbaijan-fighting-nagorno-karabakh-n1240833)).

### 3. Religious Differences

Armenia is predominantly Christian, while Azerbaijan is majority Muslim. Although religion is often used for propaganda, the conflict is primarily driven by secular nationalism rather than religious animosity ([NBC News, 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/why-are-armenia-azerbaijan-fighting-nagorno-karabakh-n1240833)).

### 4. Soviet Legacy and Geopolitical Maneuvering

The Soviet policy of "divide and rule" placed Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan despite its Armenian majority, sowing seeds for future conflict. Post-Soviet power vacuums and the involvement of regional powers such as Russia and Turkey have further complicated the dispute ([Falco, 2018](https://carc.sps.ed.ac.uk/mapping-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/)).

Azerbaijan's military superiority is largely attributed to its oil-funded defense budget, enabling significant arms purchases, including drones and missile technology, primarily from Turkey and Israel. Armenia, while militarily smaller, benefits from Russian arms supplies and maintains advanced air defense systems such as the S-300 ([Edsel.G, 2014](https://www.statista.com/statistics/)).

### Economic Disparities

Azerbaijan's oil wealth has allowed it to invest heavily in military capabilities, whereas Armenia's economy is smaller and more dependent on Russia. This economic imbalance has emboldened Azerbaijan to attempt military solutions to regain control over Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent territories ([BBC News, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772)).

## Geopolitical Dynamics

### Regional Powers and Alliances

- **Turkey**: Strongly supports Azerbaijan politically, militarily, and culturally, viewing Azerbaijan as a "brotherly" Turkic nation. Turkey's involvement includes military exercises and alleged support with Syrian mercenaries during the 2020 conflict ([NBC News, 2020](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/why-are-armenia-azerbaijan-fighting-nagorno-karabakh-n1240833)).

- **Russia**: Maintains a military base in Armenia and is allied with Armenia through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). However, Russia also maintains good relations with Azerbaijan and supplies arms to both sides. Russia brokered the 1994 ceasefire and the 2020 peace deal, deploying peacekeepers to monitor the truce ([BBC News, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772)).

- **Iran**: Supports Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh due to geopolitical rivalry with Turkey and concerns over regional stability ([Falco, 2018](https://carc.sps.ed.ac.uk/mapping-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/)).

### International Mediation Efforts

The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States, has mediated peace talks since 1992 but has failed to produce a lasting settlement. The 2020 conflict revealed the limitations of international mediation, especially with Turkey's overt involvement and the U.S.'s limited engagement ([BBC News, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54324772)).

## Recent Developments and Escalations

### 2020 War and Ceasefire

In late September 2020, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale offensive to retake Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding territories, supported overtly by Turkey. The conflict lasted six weeks, causing thousands of deaths and displacing tens of thousands more. The war ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire on November 10, 2020, resulting in Azerbaijan regaining control over several adjacent districts and the strategic city of Shusha within Nagorno-Karabakh ([BBC News, 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54882564)).

### Post-War Tensions

Despite the ceasefire, tensions remain high. Azerbaijan continues to pressure Armenia on issues like prisoner exchanges and territorial access, including demands for Armenia to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan and to allow transit through the Syunik province to the Nakhichevan exclave. Armenia faces internal political instability due to dissatisfaction with the ceasefire terms ([Poghosyan, 2021](https://www.armenian-institute.org/)).

## Analysis and Opinion

The Armenia-Azerbaijan war is a multifaceted conflict rooted in historical territorial claims, ethnic nationalism, and geopolitical rivalries. The collapse of the Soviet Union removed the central authority that had maintained a fragile status quo, allowing long-simmering tensions to erupt.

Azerbaijan's military and economic superiority, fueled by oil revenues and Turkish support, has shifted the balance of power, encouraging it to pursue military means to resolve the dispute. Armenia's reliance on Russia and its defensive military posture reflect its strategic constraints.

The involvement of regional powers, especially Turkey and Russia, complicates the conflict, turning it into a proxy battleground with broader geopolitical implications. Turkey's assertive support for Azerbaijan challenges Russia's traditional dominance in the South Caucasus, increasing the risk of wider regional instability.

The failure of international mediation and the absence of a comprehensive peace agreement leave the conflict frozen in a state of "no war, no peace," with periodic flare-ups likely. The demographic changes and territorial adjustments post-2020 war suggest a diminishing prospect for Nagorno-Karabakh's independence or unification with Armenia.

In my assessment, the conflict's resolution requires a pragmatic approach acknowledging the new realities on the ground, including Azerbaijan's regained territories and Armenia's security concerns. Continued Russian peacekeeping and diplomatic engagement are crucial, but the involvement of Turkey as a partisan actor complicates impartial mediation.

Without mutual concessions and international support for a durable political settlement that respects both territorial integrity and minority rights, the risk of renewed hostilities remains high.

## Conclusion

The Armenia-Azerbaijan war over Nagorno-Karabakh is driven by deep-rooted historical grievances, ethnic and nationalistic identities, and geopolitical rivalries. Military imbalances, economic disparities, and external interventions have escalated the conflict, making it one of the most dangerous flashpoints in Eurasia.

The 2020 war and subsequent ceasefire have altered the territorial and political landscape but have not resolved the fundamental disputes. The prospects for lasting peace depend on complex negotiations involving regional and international actors, with a need for compromise and security guarantees.
