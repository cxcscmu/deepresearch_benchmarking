## Background: The Kahlo Home and Studio Site

The House-Studio Museum of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, located in Mexico City’s San Ángel Inn neighborhood, is a landmark of modern Mexican architecture and cultural history. Designed by architect Juan O’Gorman between 1929 and 1931, the site consists of two separate buildings—one red for Diego Rivera and one blue for Frida Kahlo—connected by a rooftop bridge symbolizing their relationship. The buildings embody functionalist architectural principles inspired by Le Corbusier, emphasizing practical design, natural light, and integration with the environment.

Frida Kahlo lived and created many of her iconic works here, including *What the Water Gave Me* and *The Two Fridas*. The site also houses Diego Rivera’s extensive collection of pre-Columbian art and personal artifacts. Since their deaths, the site has been preserved as a museum, showcasing their lives and artistic legacies ([WikiArquitectura, n.d.](https://en.wikiarquitectura.com/building/house-studio-museum-of-diego-rivera-and-frida-kahlo/)).
