# Why Centers of Excellence Fail: An In-Depth Analysis

Centers of Excellence (CoEs) have emerged as strategic entities within organizations designed to drive best practices, foster innovation, and enhance capabilities across various domains. Despite their potential, many CoEs fail to deliver sustained value, often devolving into ineffective committees or side projects with limited impact. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of why Centers of Excellence fail, drawing on multiple authoritative sources and synthesizing key factors contributing to their shortcomings.

## Introduction

A Center of Excellence is typically a team, shared facility, or entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support, and/or training for a specific focus area within an organization. CoEs aim to implement and popularize best practices, add new capabilities, improve asset utilization, and upgrade employee skillsets ([Massaro Consulting, 2018](https://massaroconsulting.com/2018/03/launching-center-excellence-downloadable-executive-field-guide/)). However, the journey to excellence is fraught with challenges, and many CoEs struggle to maintain momentum and relevance over time.

## Key Reasons for Failure

### 1. **Limited Bandwidth and Overcommitment**

One of the most frequently cited reasons for CoE failure is that they are often staffed and managed by individuals who already have full-time jobs. This dual responsibility leads to limited bandwidth, making it difficult for CoE members to dedicate sufficient time and focus to CoE activities. High expectations combined with limited availability create a recipe for disappointment and burnout ([Massaro Consulting, 2018](https://massaroconsulting.com/2018/03/launching-center-excellence-downloadable-executive-field-guide/)).

### 2. **Lack of Executive Sponsorship and Support**

Executive sponsorship is critical for the success of a CoE. Without ongoing support from senior leadership, CoEs struggle to secure necessary funding, resources, and organizational buy-in. The perception of the CoE within the organization heavily depends on executive endorsement, which influences adoption and sustainability ([Catalant, 2020](https://gocatalant.com/coe-everything-you-need-to-know-about-centers-of-excellence/)).

### 3. **Unrealistic Expectations and Insufficient Planning**

Starting a CoE often generates excitement and high expectations. However, reality soon sets in as stakeholders face competing priorities, tight budgets, and longer-than-expected timelines for results. Many CoEs fail because they do not start small or set realistic goals, leading to early disappointment and loss of momentum. Adequate preparation, planning, and ramp-up time are essential but frequently overlooked ([Massaro Consulting, 2018](https://massaroconsulting.com/2018/03/launching-center-excellence-downloadable-executive-field-guide/)).

### 4. **Poor Design and Lack of Clear Structure**

A CoE must be well-designed on paper before execution. This includes clearly defined responsibilities, team structure, objectives, communication plans, budgets, and timelines. Failure to establish these foundational elements leads to chaos, confusion, and inefficiency. Utilizing maturity models to set expectations and ensure executive involvement at the right cadence can prevent such issues ([Massaro Consulting, 2018](https://massaroconsulting.com/2018/03/launching-center-excellence-downloadable-executive-field-guide/)).

### 5. **Insufficient Early Wins and Proof of Value**

Sustained success depends on demonstrating early wins that prove the CoE's worth. Without tangible results, it becomes difficult to gain wider support and justify continued investment. Gradual deployment and iterative prototyping help build momentum and allow for adjustments based on lessons learned. CoEs that fail to deliver early value often lose credibility and support ([Massaro Consulting, 2018](https://massaroconsulting.com/2018/03/launching-center-excellence-downloadable-executive-field-guide/)).

### 6. **Complexity and Misconceptions**

Some organizations perceive CoEs as complex entities requiring specialized expertise and extensive resources. This conservatism leads to a "wait-and-see" approach, causing delays and missed opportunities for improvement. The reality is that CoEs need common business sense, realistic goals, and a willingness to embrace new ideas and challenge past practices ([Automation Anywhere, n.d.](https://www.automationanywhere.com/company/blog/general-technology/why-you-need-a-center-of-excellence)).

### 7. **Voluntary Nature and Limited Funding**

CoEs often operate like voluntary mission organizations, with scarce funding and limited support. Participants engage because they see an opportunity to contribute to a better cause, but this voluntary nature can limit commitment and accountability. Without adequate funding and dedicated resources, CoEs struggle to maintain consistent activity and impact ([Massaro Consulting, 2018](https://massaroconsulting.com/2018/03/launching-center-excellence-downloadable-executive-field-guide/)).

### 8. **Failure to Adapt and Evolve**

A CoE must remain agile and responsive to organizational needs. Defining success criteria that hinge on changes from people outside the CoE is risky but necessary. CoEs that become rigid or act as compliance police rather than consultative partners risk alienating stakeholders and losing relevance. Continuous evolution and pivoting of offerings are critical to sustaining value ([Improving.com, n.d.](https://improving.com/thoughts/starting-an-agile-center-of-excellence)).

### 9. **Lack of Clear Metrics and Success Criteria**

Without clear business objectives and interim success metrics, CoEs cannot measure progress or demonstrate impact effectively. This lack of clarity leads to misaligned efforts and difficulty in securing ongoing support. Metrics should be tied to the organization's strategic goals and regularly reviewed ([Seilevel, n.d.](https://seilevel.com/business-analysis-center-excellence/)).

### 10. **Inadequate Knowledge Management and Expertise Access**

A major risk for organizations is the loss or inaccessibility of critical knowledge. CoEs are designed to centralize expertise and disseminate best practices, but failure to identify, nurture, and leverage subject matter experts (SMEs) undermines this goal. Without effective knowledge management, CoEs cannot fulfill their core mission ([AIIM, 2010](https://info.aiim.org/aiim-blog/newaiimo/2010/03/10/8-reasons-to-consider-a-center-of-excellence)).

## Conclusion

Centers of Excellence hold significant promise for organizations seeking to institutionalize best practices, enhance capabilities, and drive innovation. However, their failure is often rooted in a combination of structural, cultural, and operational challenges. Key issues include limited bandwidth of participants, lack of executive sponsorship, unrealistic expectations, poor design, and insufficient early wins. Additionally, misconceptions about complexity, voluntary participation without adequate funding, failure to adapt, unclear success metrics, and inadequate knowledge management further undermine CoE effectiveness.

To avoid failure, organizations must approach CoE implementation with realistic goals, strong executive backing, clear structures, and measurable outcomes. They should start small, focus on early wins, and maintain agility to evolve with organizational needs. Recognizing CoEs as strategic enablers rather than compliance bodies is essential for sustained success.
