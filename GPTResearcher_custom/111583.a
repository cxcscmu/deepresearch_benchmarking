# Why Centers of Excellence Fail: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Centers of Excellence (CoEs) have become a popular organizational approach to concentrate expertise, standardize best practices, and drive innovation across enterprises. Despite their potential benefits, many CoEs fail to deliver sustained value or even collapse after initial enthusiasm. Understanding the root causes of these failures is critical for organizations aiming to establish effective CoEs. This report provides a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of why Centers of Excellence fail, drawing on multiple authoritative sources and case studies to present a nuanced view.

## Defining Centers of Excellence and Their Objectives

A Center of Excellence is typically a centralized team or entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support, and training in a specific focus area. CoEs aim to:

- Implement and popularize best practices
- Add new capabilities or technologies
- Improve asset utilization
- Upgrade employee skillsets

They are often staffed by individuals who maintain full-time roles elsewhere, making CoEs a side project for many participants ([Papovsky, 2018](https://www.massaro.com/blog/launching-center-of-excellence)).

## Common Reasons for Failure of Centers of Excellence

### 1. Lack of Clear Design and Charter

A fundamental cause of CoE failure is the absence of a well-defined design phase. Without explicit responsibilities, team structure, objectives, communication plans, budgets, and timelines agreed upon by stakeholders, chaos ensues. Papovsky (2018) emphasizes that skipping the design phase leads to confusion and disorganization, turning CoEs into ineffective committees with low engagement.

### 2. Insufficient Executive Sponsorship and Support

Management buy-in is critical. Without a management champion or executive sponsor, CoEs struggle to secure funding and organizational priority. Beatty (n.d.) highlights that management support can make or break a CoE, especially when budgets tighten and priorities shift.

### 3. Staffing Challenges and Bandwidth Constraints

CoEs are often staffed by employees who have full-time jobs elsewhere. This limited bandwidth leads to high expectations but insufficient time commitment, resulting in slow progress and burnout. Papovsky (2018) notes that this "high expectations combined with limited bandwidth" is a recipe for disappointment.

### 4. Overambitious Scope and Unrealistic Goals

Launching a CoE with too many targets or overly ambitious goals can overwhelm the team and dilute focus. Starting small with realistic goals and proving worth through early wins is advised to maintain momentum and build support ([Papovsky, 2018](https://www.massaro.com/blog/launching-center-of-excellence)).

### 5. Poor Communication and Alignment

Misalignment among stakeholders and lack of clear communication channels can cause confusion and erode trust. For example, a lack of alignment on strategic direction or unclear translation of strategy into initiatives impedes CoE effectiveness ([Papovsky, 2018](https://www.massaro.com/blog/launching-center-of-excellence)).

### 6. Absence of Measurable Metrics and Feedback Loops

Without clear metrics to measure success and periodic evaluation, CoEs cannot demonstrate value or adjust course. Beatty (n.d.) stresses the importance of setting baseline metrics and regularly measuring them to motivate improvement and secure ongoing support.

### 7. Failure to Iterate and Adapt

Rigid adherence to initial plans without prototyping or iteration can lead to stagnation. Papovsky (2018) advocates for iterative prototyping to build momentum, learn from failures, and adapt operational models.

### 8. Lack of Standardization and Governance

CoEs that fail to establish and enforce standards, best practices, and governance mechanisms often lose credibility and effectiveness. Catalant (2020) identifies standardization and governance as critical components for CoE success.

### 9. Imbalanced Team Composition and Lack of Subject Matter Experts

An unbalanced team with uneven skill levels or insufficient subject matter experts (SMEs) leads to inefficiency and dissatisfaction. Maintaining competency charts and nurturing SMEs is essential to sustain performance ([Catalant, 2020](https://gocatalant.com/blog/center-of-excellence)).

### 10. Insufficient Resource Management and Demand Coordination

Inability to manage resources effectively, coordinate across teams, and prioritize demand results in bottlenecks and missed objectives. Catalant (2020) highlights the need for effective resource management and continuous improvement.

## Case Studies Illustrating Failure Modes

### Case Study 1: ERP Continuous Improvement Function

A client’s CoE initially collected numerous improvement ideas but took four months to analyze and prioritize them before holding the first steering meeting. This delay illustrates the importance of structured prioritization and stakeholder validation to avoid chaotic or unfocused efforts ([Papovsky, 2018](https://www.massaro.com/blog/launching-center-of-excellence)).

### Case Study 2: Office of Strategy Management (OSM)

Another client’s OSM faced alignment challenges among stakeholders. They conducted workshops with executives to agree on strategic direction before translating strategy into initiatives. This top-down alignment was critical to avoid miscommunication and ensure coherent action ([Papovsky, 2018](https://www.massaro.com/blog/launching-center-of-excellence)).

## The Role of Leadership and Culture in CoE Failure

Leadership flaws can exacerbate CoE failures. According to Zenger and Folkman (2016), poor leadership traits such as lack of energy, acceptance of mediocre performance, lack of vision, loss of trust, and resistance to new ideas create a "negative halo effect" that undermines effectiveness. These flaws can manifest in CoE contexts as lack of enthusiasm, unclear goals, poor collaboration, and failure to walk the talk, all of which contribute to CoE failure.

## Strategies to Prevent Failure and Ensure Success

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended:

| Strategy                          | Description                                                                                              | Expected Outcome                                          |

## Conclusion

Centers of Excellence fail primarily due to a combination of poor initial design, lack of executive support, staffing challenges, unrealistic goals, poor communication, absence of metrics, failure to iterate, lack of standardization, imbalanced teams, and ineffective resource management. Leadership deficiencies further compound these issues. However, by adopting a structured, phased approach with clear design, executive sponsorship, realistic goals, continuous measurement, and adaptive governance, organizations can significantly increase the likelihood of CoE success.
