# How Does Birth Order Affect Personality? An In-Depth Analysis

The question of whether birth order affects personality has intrigued psychologists, researchers, and the general public for over a century. The idea that the order in which a child is born within a family influences their personality traits, intelligence, and behavior has been popularized by early psychologists such as Alfred Adler and Sigmund Freud and has permeated popular culture. However, despite its intuitive appeal and widespread acceptance, the scientific evidence supporting birth order effects on personality remains contentious and inconclusive. This report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the current understanding of birth order’s impact on personality, drawing from a wide array of scholarly sources and recent large-scale studies.

## Historical Background and Theoretical Foundations

Alfred Adler, a contemporary of Freud and Jung, was among the first to propose that birth order significantly shapes personality. Adler suggested that firstborns, initially the sole focus of parental attention, might develop traits such as conscientiousness and neuroticism due to “dethronement” when siblings arrive. Middle children were theorized to be more stable and sociable, while lastborns were often characterized as spoiled and emotionally immature (Oxford Bibliographies, n.d.). This Adlerian perspective sparked decades of research exploring birth order’s influence on various psychological traits.

Frank J. Sulloway later expanded on these ideas, proposing that siblings adopt distinct “niches” within the family to reduce competition, with firstborns tending toward conscientiousness and laterborns toward openness and rebelliousness (UK Essays, 2016). However, these theories have faced substantial empirical scrutiny.

## Empirical Evidence: Mixed and Often Contradictory

### Early and Mid-20th Century Research

Early studies, such as those reviewed by Schooler (1972) and Ernst and Angst (1983), suggested that birth order effects were overstated or non-existent. Many of these studies lacked rigorous controls for confounding variables such as family size, socioeconomic status, and genetics (Oxford Bibliographies, n.d.).

### Recent Large-Scale and Methodologically Robust Studies

More recent research has benefited from larger sample sizes, better statistical controls, and within-family designs that compare siblings directly rather than unrelated individuals of similar birth order.

A landmark study published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* (Rohrer, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2015) analyzed data from over 20,000 adults across the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. This study used independent personality assessments and both within-family and between-family designs to test birth order effects on the Big Five personality traits: extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience.

The findings were striking:

- No significant birth order effects were found for extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, or conscientiousness.
- Only a small effect was observed for openness/intellect, with firstborns scoring slightly higher.
- The study achieved over 95% power to detect even subtle differences, suggesting that if birth order effects exist, they are minimal (Rohrer et al., 2015).

Similarly, a large study of 377,000 U.S. high school students found little evidence for personality differences based on birth order, contradicting predictions that firstborns would be more conscientious and neurotic, and laterborns more agreeable and sociable (The Atlantic, 2015).

### Contrasting Findings Within Families

Some within-family studies have reported modest differences consistent with Adlerian theory. For example, Paulhus, Trapnell, and Chen (1998) found that firstborns scored higher on conscientiousness and achievement orientation, while laterborns scored higher on openness and agreeableness. However, these effects were weak and often disappeared when comparing individuals across different families (Academized, 2016).

Psychologist Judith Rich Harris (2006) argued that while birth order may influence behavior within the family context, it does not have profound or lasting effects on personality development, as individuals’ personalities are shaped more by their broader social environments and genetic factors.

## Birth Order and Intelligence

While personality effects are minimal, evidence suggests that birth order may have a small but measurable impact on intelligence. Firstborns often have slightly higher IQ scores than their laterborn siblings, potentially due to more parental attention and resources during early development (Scientific American, 2010).

Rohrer et al. (2015) confirmed that birth order effects on IQ exist but are modest, with firstborns scoring on average about 1.5 IQ points higher than laterborns. This effect is statistically significant but small in practical terms.

## Factors Confounding Birth Order Effects

Several confounding variables complicate the interpretation of birth order research:

| Confounding Factor      | Description                                                                                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Family Size            | Larger families often have different socioeconomic statuses, which can influence development.     |
| Socioeconomic Status   | Lower SES is often associated with larger families, potentially affecting personality and IQ.      |
| Parental Investment    | Firstborns may receive more focused attention and resources, influencing cognitive development.   |
| Genetic Influences     | Genetic differences account for approximately 40% of personality variance, overshadowing birth order. |
| Non-Shared Environment | Siblings experience the family environment differently, which may explain personality differences. |

These factors make isolating birth order effects challenging and may explain why findings are inconsistent across studies (Oxford Bibliographies, n.d.; BetterHelp, n.d.).

## Psychological vs. Actual Birth Order

Alan E. Stewart (2012) distinguished between “actual” birth order (numerical position) and “psychological” birth order (self-perceived position), suggesting that personality may be more influenced by the latter. For example, an oldest sibling who perceives themselves as a “middle child” due to family dynamics may exhibit traits associated with middle children. This nuance complicates research but may help explain individual differences within birth order categories (Beliefnet, n.d.).

## Summary of Key Findings

| Personality Trait       | Birth Order Effect (Rohrer et al., 2015) | Other Findings and Notes                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Extraversion           | No significant effect                   | Earlier theories predicted laterborns to be more extraverted, not supported. |
| Emotional Stability    | No significant effect                   | Contradicts Adler’s view of firstborn neuroticism.       |
| Agreeableness          | No significant effect                   | Some studies found laterborns more agreeable, but weak evidence. |
| Conscientiousness      | No significant effect                   | Firstborns predicted to be more conscientious, not supported. |
| Openness/Intellect     | Small effect (firstborns slightly higher) | The only Big Five trait with a modest birth order effect. |
| Intelligence (IQ)      | Small effect (firstborns higher by ~1.5 points) | Consistent with some earlier findings.                    |

## Conclusion and Opinion

The comprehensive review of the literature and recent large-scale empirical studies strongly suggests that birth order has **minimal to no meaningful effect on personality traits** as measured by the Big Five model. While early psychological theories and some smaller studies posited distinct personality profiles for firstborns, middle children, and lastborns, these claims have not been robustly supported by modern, well-controlled research.

The small but consistent effect of birth order on intelligence, particularly the slight IQ advantage of firstborns, appears to be the most reliable finding in this domain. However, this effect is modest and likely mediated by parental investment and family dynamics rather than birth order per se.

Given the complexity of personality development, which involves genetic factors, non-shared environments, socioeconomic influences, and individual experiences, it is unsurprising that birth order alone does not exert a strong or consistent influence.

Therefore, while birth order may shape some family interaction patterns and social roles, it should not be regarded as a deterministic or primary factor in personality development. The popular notion that birth order defines personality is largely a myth, albeit one with some kernel of truth in specific contexts.
