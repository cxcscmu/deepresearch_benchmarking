# Report: How Has Racism Changed?

## Introduction

Racism, defined as the belief that one race or religion is superior to another, has been a persistent and evolving issue for centuries. This report examines how racism has changed from the early 1900s to the present day, analyzing historical contexts, legal frameworks, social attitudes, and institutional practices. Drawing upon a range of scholarly articles, historical accounts, and social analyses, this report provides a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the transformations in racism over the past century. The report also offers a critical perspective on the continuities and changes in racial discrimination, highlighting the complexities of modern racism.

## Historical Context of Racism in the Early 1900s

In the early 20th century, racism in the United States was overt, legally sanctioned, and deeply entrenched in social, economic, and political systems. African Americans, in particular, faced severe discrimination under Jim Crow laws that enforced segregation in schools, transportation, housing, and public facilities. Employment opportunities were limited, with black unemployment rates reaching approximately 50%, compared to 30% for whites, and wages for black workers were about 30% lower than those of white workers ([Bartleby, 2022](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Has-Racism-Changed-Since-The-Early-1900s-FKJX3Y6V4)).

Racial segregation was not only a Southern phenomenon but was also perpetuated in Northern cities through discriminatory housing policies. Governmental actions, such as racially restrictive covenants and zoning laws, explicitly excluded African Americans from white neighborhoods, reinforcing residential segregation and economic disparities ([Kennedy, 2017](https://prospect.org/power/color-law-forgotten-history-government-segregated-america/)).

Violence and intimidation were common tools to maintain racial hierarchies. Lynchings and race riots were widespread, and law enforcement often colluded with white mobs to suppress black communities. African Americans were systematically disenfranchised through poll taxes, literacy tests, and other discriminatory voting laws, which had profound implications for political representation and resource allocation ([Teachinghistory.org, 2020](https://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/25664)).

## Legal and Social Changes: Mid-20th Century Civil Rights Movement

The mid-20th century marked a significant turning point with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, which challenged institutionalized racism and segregation. Landmark legal decisions, such as *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954), declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to eliminate barriers to voting for African Americans ([Bartleby, 2022](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Has-Racism-Changed-Since-The-Early-1900s-FKJX3Y6V4)).

Despite these legal victories, social attitudes and practices did not change overnight. African Americans continued to face hostility, as exemplified by the resistance to school desegregation, including protests against the integration of African American students into white schools ([Laneuville, n.d.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Has-Racism-Changed-Since-The-Early-1900s-FKJX3Y6V4)). The persistence of separate and unequal facilities, such as the segregated NASA facilities depicted in *Hidden Figures*, illustrates the slow pace of social change ([Melfi, n.d.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Has-Racism-Changed-Since-The-Early-1900s-FKJX3Y6V4)).

## Institutional Racism and Residential Segregation

Institutional racism, defined as systemic policies and practices that produce racial inequalities, remains a significant barrier to racial equality. Government policies in the 20th century actively promoted segregation through housing and urban development programs. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) endorsed racially restrictive covenants and favored all-white neighborhoods in mortgage underwriting, contributing to the creation and maintenance of racially segregated ghettos ([Kennedy, 2017](https://prospect.org/power/color-law-forgotten-history-government-segregated-america/)).

The consequences of these policies are enduring. Residential segregation limits access to quality education, employment opportunities, and healthcare for African Americans, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social exclusion. The legacy of "Negro removal" through urban renewal projects and highway construction further displaced black communities and reinforced racial isolation ([Kennedy, 2017](https://prospect.org/power/color-law-forgotten-history-government-segregated-america/)).

## Evolution of Public Attitudes and Modern Racism

Public attitudes toward race have evolved significantly since the early 1900s. Surveys indicate increased acceptance of racial integration and interracial relationships. For example, acceptance of integrated transportation in the USA rose from 44% in 1942 to 88% in 1970 ([Pearn Kandola, 2021](https://www.thehrd.org/feature/what-is-modern-racism-how-and-why-racism-has-mutated/)).

However, the nature of racism has shifted from overt and explicit expressions to more subtle and covert forms, often termed "modern racism" or "aversive racism." Modern racists may reject overtly racist beliefs but still harbor unconscious biases and resist policies aimed at promoting racial equality. This form of racism manifests through avoidance of meaningful contact with minority groups, opposition to affirmative action, and the use of coded language or policy critiques to mask racial prejudice ([Dovidio et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316161579.012)).

The concept of "color-blindness," or the claim to not "see race," while well-intentioned, can obscure ongoing structural inequalities and hinder efforts to address systemic racism ([Pearn Kandola, 2021](https://www.thehrd.org/feature/what-is-modern-racism-how-and-why-racism-has-mutated/)).

## Continuities and New Forms of Racial Inequality

Despite legal progress and changing attitudes, significant racial disparities persist in criminal justice, education, healthcare, and economic outcomes. The criminal justice system disproportionately incarcerates African Americans, a phenomenon described as the "New Jim Crow," reflecting a continuation of racial control through different mechanisms ([Paperdue, 2015](https://www.paperdue.com/essay/has-racism-changed-in-the-past-100-years-2158910)).

Moreover, institutional racism is often embedded in policies that appear race-neutral but have disparate impacts. For example, drug laws have been enforced more harshly against black communities, contributing to mass incarceration and social marginalization ([Paperdue, 2015](https://www.paperdue.com/essay/has-racism-changed-in-the-past-100-years-2158910)).

## Critical Analysis and Opinion

Racism has undeniably changed in form and visibility since the early 1900s. The overt, legally sanctioned racism of the Jim Crow era has been replaced by more subtle, covert, and systemic forms of racial discrimination. Legal reforms and social movements have dismantled explicit segregation and discrimination, and public attitudes have shifted toward greater acceptance of racial equality.

However, these changes mask persistent and structural inequalities that continue to disadvantage racial minorities, particularly African Americans. Institutional racism remains deeply embedded in housing, education, criminal justice, and economic systems. Modern racism is often more difficult to detect and challenge because it operates through implicit biases, coded language, and policies that appear neutral but perpetuate disparities.

The notion that racism has been "solved" or is no longer a significant problem is misleading. Instead, racism has mutated, adapting to new social norms and legal frameworks while maintaining its harmful effects. Efforts to combat racism must therefore evolve to address these subtle and systemic forms, incorporating a sophisticated understanding of implicit bias, institutional practices, and historical context.

## Conclusion

Racism has transformed significantly over the past century, moving from explicit, legalized segregation and discrimination to more covert and institutionalized forms. While legal progress and changing social attitudes represent important milestones, the persistence of racial disparities and systemic inequalities indicates that racism remains a critical issue. Addressing modern racism requires acknowledging its complexity, recognizing the legacy of historical injustices, and implementing comprehensive policies aimed at structural change.
