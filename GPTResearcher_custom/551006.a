# How Has Racism Changed? A Comprehensive Analysis

Racism, defined as the belief that members of different races possess inherent characteristics that categorize them as inferior or superior, has been a persistent social issue for centuries. Over the last hundred years, racism has evolved significantly in its expression, mechanisms, and societal impact. This report provides an in-depth examination of how racism has changed from the early 1900s to the present day, drawing on a variety of scholarly and reputable sources. The analysis focuses on the transformation from overt to covert forms of racism, the institutionalization of racial biases, and the ongoing challenges despite legal and social progress.

## Historical Context: Racism in the Early 1900s

In the early 20th century, racism in the United States and many Western societies was predominantly overt and explicit. African Americans and other racial minorities were subjected to legalized segregation, disenfranchisement, and widespread social discrimination. For example, unemployment rates for Black Americans were approximately 50%, compared to 30% for whites, and wages for Black workers were about 30% lower than those of their white counterparts ([Bartleby, 2014](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Has-Racism-Changed-Since-The-Early-1900s-PCBWVKWZ6LV)).

Racism was openly expressed through language, social customs, and institutional policies. Slurs and explicit discriminatory practices were common and socially accepted in many regions, particularly in the American South. This period also saw the rise of scientific racism, where pseudo-scientific theories were used to justify racial hierarchies and the subjugation of non-white populations ([PBS, n.d.](https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_03-godeeper.htm)).

## Transition and Transformation: Mid-20th Century to Civil Rights Era

The mid-20th century marked a pivotal period in the evolution of racism. The Civil Rights Movement (1940s-1960s) challenged overt racism through legal reforms and mass social activism. Landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Voting Rights Act (1965) aimed to dismantle institutionalized segregation and discrimination.

Public attitudes began to shift, with increasing disapproval of overt racist behavior. For instance, acceptance of integrated public transportation in the U.S. rose from 44% in 1942 to 88% by 1970 ([theHRDirector, 2021](https://www.thehrdirector.com/features/diversity-and-equality/modern-racism-racism-mutated/)). However, despite legal progress, racial disparities in employment, housing, education, and the criminal justice system persisted, indicating that racism had not been eradicated but rather transformed.

## Modern Racism: From Overt to Covert and Subtle Forms

### Overt Racism Decline

With the rise of civil rights protections, overt racism—characterized by blatant and conscious expressions of racial hostility—has become largely taboo in mainstream society ([Fitchburg State University, n.d.](https://fitchburgstate.libguides.com/c.php?g=1046516&p=7619360)). Surveys and social research confirm a decline in explicit racial prejudice and hostile behaviors, as such acts are now widely condemned.

### Emergence of Covert and Aversive Racism

Despite reductions in overt racism, more subtle and covert forms have emerged. These include implicit biases, microaggressions, and institutional racism that operate under the surface of social interactions and policies. Aversive racism, a form of contemporary bias, is characterized by individuals who consciously endorse egalitarian values but harbor unconscious negative feelings and beliefs towards racial minorities ([Cambridge Handbook of the Psychology of Prejudice, 2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-the-psychology-of-prejudice/aversive-racism-and-contemporary-bias/82AFD1190EDD449F715231855DB0468E)).

Covert racism manifests in subtle discrimination such as unequal access to opportunities, stereotyping, and systemic barriers within institutions like the police and justice systems ([Gudwriter, n.d.](https://gudwriter.com/racism-essay-sample/)). Unlike overt racism, covert racism is often difficult to detect and challenge because it is embedded in societal norms and structures.

## Institutional Racism: Persistence and Impact

Institutional racism refers to the policies and practices within organizations and governments that produce and maintain racial inequalities, often unintentionally. This form of racism is deeply entrenched and perpetuated by social systems, making it resistant to change even when individuals within these systems reject racist beliefs ([All About Popular Issues, n.d.](https://www.allaboutpopularissues.org/the-history-of-racism-faq.htm)).

For example, African Americans continue to face disproportionate rates of incarceration, unemployment, and poverty compared to whites. These disparities are not solely due to individual prejudice but are linked to systemic factors such as discriminatory hiring practices, educational inequities, and biased law enforcement ([Bartleby, 2014](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Has-Racism-Changed-Since-The-Early-1900s-PCBWVKWZ6LV)).

## Quantitative Evidence of Change in Racial Attitudes

Research utilizing large-scale surveys such as the General Social Survey (GSS) and Pew Research Center studies reveals complex trends in racial attitudes over time.

| Aspect                         | Early 1900s                          | Mid-20th Century                   | 21st Century                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Overt Racism**               | High and socially accepted          | Declining due to civil rights     | Largely taboo but resurging in some incidents ([Fitchburg State University, n.d.](https://fitchburgstate.libguides.com/c.php?g=1046516&p=7619360)) |
| **Covert Racism**              | Less recognized                    | Emerging awareness                | Predominant form, subtle and systemic ([Cambridge Handbook, 2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-the-psychology-of-prejudice/aversive-racism-and-contemporary-bias/82AFD1190EDD449F715231855DB0468E)) |
| **Implicit Bias**              | Not studied                       | Early research begins             | Recognized as widespread, though declining ([HBR, 2019](https://hbr.org/2019/08/research-on-many-issues-americans-biases-are-decreasing)) |
| **Legal Protections**           | None                             | Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act | Expanded but uneven enforcement ([All About Popular Issues, n.d.](https://www.allaboutpopularissues.org/the-history-of-racism-faq.htm)) |
| **Public Acceptance of Integration** | Low (44% acceptance in 1942) | Increasing (88% by 1970)          | High but with persistent social divides ([theHRDirector, 2021](https://www.thehrdirector.com/features/diversity-and-equality/modern-racism-racism-mutated/)) |

## The Role of Social Norms and Psychological Factors

The civil rights era introduced new social norms that discouraged overt racist expressions, leading individuals to consciously manage their racial attitudes to appear non-prejudiced. However, implicit attitudes—automatic, unconscious biases—often persist despite these norms ([Psychological Science, 1996](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/spotlight-on-research-is-racism-on-the-decline-in-america)).

This ambivalence results in aversive racism, where people may unknowingly contribute to racial disparities even when they believe themselves to be non-prejudiced. Such biases influence decisions in employment, healthcare, education, and law enforcement, perpetuating inequality ([ResearchGate, n.d.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227539582_The_Nature_of_Contemporary_Prejudice_Insights_from_Aversive_Racism)).

## Contemporary Challenges and Ongoing Issues

Despite measurable progress, racism remains a significant social problem. Institutional racism continues to affect people of color disproportionately, and covert racism complicates efforts to achieve genuine equality.

Recent social movements and heightened awareness have brought renewed focus on systemic racism, but some argue that new forms of racialism have emerged under the guise of social justice activism, leading to complex dynamics in race relations ([Quora, 2021](https://www.quora.com/How-far-has-america-come-on-racism-Has-there-been-real-change-since-the-1970s-or-just-superficial-change)).

Moreover, while explicit biases have declined, implicit biases are more resistant to change but show signs of gradual reduction over the past decade ([HBR, 2019](https://hbr.org/2019/08/research-on-many-issues-americans-biases-are-decreasing)).

## Conclusion: A Nuanced Evolution of Racism

Racism has undeniably changed since the early 1900s. The most visible and socially accepted forms of overt racism have decreased significantly, largely due to legal reforms and shifting social norms. However, racism has not disappeared; it has mutated into more subtle, covert, and institutional forms that are harder to detect and address.

The persistence of racial disparities in economic, social, and legal spheres underscores that racism remains embedded in societal structures. Implicit biases and aversive racism continue to influence behaviors and decisions unconsciously, maintaining inequality despite conscious commitments to egalitarian values.

Therefore, while progress has been made, the fight against racism requires ongoing vigilance, education, and systemic change. Understanding the historical context and contemporary manifestations of racism is essential for developing effective interventions and fostering genuine racial equity.
