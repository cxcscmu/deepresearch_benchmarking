# Should Sign Language Be Taught in Schools? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

The question of whether sign language should be taught in schools has gained increasing attention in recent years, fueled by growing awareness of the needs of the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities, as well as the cognitive and social benefits of bilingualism. Sign languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Australian Sign Language (Auslan), are fully developed natural languages with unique grammar and syntax, used by millions worldwide. Despite this, sign language remains largely absent from mainstream school curricula in many countries.

This report presents an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of the arguments for and against teaching sign language in schools, drawing on recent research, policy discussions, and educational practices. The report concludes with a reasoned opinion advocating for the inclusion of sign language in school curricula, supported by moral, educational, and social justice considerations.

## Overview of Sign Language and Its Users

Sign language is a visual-manual mode of communication used primarily by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Globally, approximately 70 million people use sign language, with about 13% being teenagers over age 12 ([Ruggles, 2020](https://www.thewranglernews.com/should-sign-language-be-taught-at-schools/)). In countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, sign language communities are well-established, yet educational provision for sign language remains limited.

## Benefits of Teaching Sign Language in Schools

### 1. **Communication and Inclusion**

Teaching sign language in schools promotes communication accessibility and social inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. It facilitates smoother interaction between hearing and non-hearing peers, reducing social isolation and fostering empathy ([Ruggles, 2020](https://www.thewranglernews.com/should-sign-language-be-taught-at-schools/); [Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).

- Hearing students learning sign language can communicate directly with deaf peers without intermediaries.
- Sign language education can improve social integration for students with special needs who may have difficulties with verbal communication.

### 2. **Cognitive and Educational Advantages**

Learning sign language offers unique cognitive benefits beyond those of spoken second languages:

- **Bimodal Bilingualism:** Sign language is a visual-spatial language, so learning it alongside a spoken language creates bimodal bilingualism, which enhances executive function, multitasking, and spatial cognition ([Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).
- **Improved Listening and Attention:** Sign language requires sustained eye contact and attention, fostering better listening skills ([Anonymous, 2021](https://www.ivymoose.com/)).
- **Enhanced Expressiveness:** Sign language incorporates facial expressions and body movements, allowing nuanced emotional and grammatical expression.
- **Literacy Development:** Studies show that early exposure to sign language can improve vocabulary and literacy skills in children ([Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).

### 3. **Employment and Economic Opportunities**

Proficiency in sign language can be a valuable skill in the job market:

- Jobs in customer service, healthcare, education, and hospitality increasingly value sign language skills to serve deaf clients effectively.
- Teaching sign language in schools can increase demand for qualified sign language teachers, positively impacting employment rates ([Ruggles, 2020](https://www.thewranglernews.com/should-sign-language-be-taught-at-schools/)).

### 4. **Social Justice and Ethical Considerations**

Teaching sign language aligns with principles of social justice:

- Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals face systemic barriers, including poorer employment outcomes and limited access to healthcare and justice systems ([Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).
- Sign language education in schools helps fulfill obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), promoting linguistic identity and inclusion.
- It normalizes sign language use, reducing stigma and discrimination against deaf communities.

### 5. **Cultural Preservation and Identity**

Sign language is central to Deaf culture, a rich linguistic and cultural minority:

- Teaching sign language supports the flourishing of Deaf culture and provides deaf children with access to their linguistic heritage.
- It offers hearing children exposure to cultural diversity and fosters intercultural understanding ([Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).

## Challenges and Considerations

### 1. **Curriculum and Resource Constraints**

- Schools often have limited resources and time to add new subjects.
- There may be competing priorities for language instruction, especially in multilingual contexts.
- Qualified sign language teachers and materials may be scarce.

### 2. **Potential Impact on Other Language Learning**

- Some argue that prioritizing sign language might reduce opportunities to learn other spoken languages.
- However, data suggest that many students do not pursue second languages to advanced levels, and sign language can be offered alongside other languages without significant displacement ([Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).

### 3. **Variability in Sign Language Use**

- Different countries and regions use different sign languages (e.g., ASL, BSL, Auslan), complicating standardized curriculum development.
- Sign language is not a universal language; local adaptation is necessary.

### 4. **Ensuring Effective Instruction**

- Basic sign language knowledge may not be sufficient for professional interpreting or complex communication.
- Skilled interpreters remain essential in many contexts, especially medical and legal settings.

## Case Studies and Policy Developments

- **Australia:** The national curriculum for Auslan was launched in 2016 but is taught in only about 4% of Victorian public schools ([Dalzell, 2016](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-19/deaf-community-hails-school-rollout-of-auslan-curriculum/8132474)).
- **United Kingdom:** Campaigns and petitions have pushed for British Sign Language (BSL) to be part of the national curriculum, with 92% of young people supporting this ([National Deaf Childrenâ€™s Society, 2017](https://www.buzz.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/JR1219-Right-To-Sign-Report-AW-WEB.pdf)).
- **United States:** ASL is increasingly offered as a foreign language option in secondary schools, though still a minority choice ([Rosen, 2010](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/378810)).

## Moral and Ethical Arguments

Bowman-Smart et al. (2019) present a strong moral case for compulsory sign language education based on:

- Individual benefits of bimodal bilingualism.
- Justice considerations prioritizing marginalized groups.
- Preservation and flourishing of Deaf culture.
- Alignment with international human rights obligations.

They argue that the cost to individual students is minimal compared to the societal benefits, making sign language education a moral imperative ([Bowman-Smart et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-019-00101-0)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive review of evidence and arguments, it is clear that **sign language should be taught in schools** as a core or elective language option. The inclusion of sign language in school curricula offers significant benefits:

- Enhances communication accessibility and social inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.
- Provides unique cognitive and educational advantages through bimodal bilingualism.
- Supports employment opportunities and economic inclusion.
- Advances social justice by addressing the needs of a marginalized community.
- Preserves and promotes Deaf culture and identity.
- Aligns with international human rights commitments.

While challenges exist, they are surmountable through policy support, teacher training, curriculum development, and resource allocation. Sign language education need not replace other language offerings but can complement them, enriching the linguistic landscape of schools.

**Therefore, educational policymakers, school administrators, and communities should prioritize the integration of sign language into school curricula to foster a more inclusive, just, and linguistically diverse society.**
