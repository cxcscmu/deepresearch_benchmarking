# Report: Why Should the Death Penalty Be Legal?

## Abstract

The death penalty remains one of the most contentious issues in criminal justice and ethics. This report examines the arguments supporting the legalization and continued use of the death penalty, focusing on its historical context, deterrent effects, justice considerations, and cost implications. Drawing on empirical research, legal analyses, and international perspectives, the report evaluates whether the death penalty serves as an effective tool for crime prevention, retribution, and societal protection. The evidence suggests that while the death penalty is not without controversy, it holds significant value in deterring certain crimes, delivering proportional justice, and managing costs associated with long-term incarceration. The report concludes that the death penalty should remain legal, with stringent safeguards to ensure fairness and prevent miscarriages of justice.

## Introduction

Capital punishment, or the death penalty, is the state-sanctioned execution of individuals convicted of certain crimes, primarily murder, treason, and terrorism. Despite a global trend toward abolition, many countries, including the United States, China, and Japan, retain the death penalty as a legal punishment. Proponents argue that it serves multiple purposes: deterring crime, delivering just retribution, protecting society, and reducing costs associated with incarceration. Opponents raise ethical, moral, and practical concerns, including the risk of wrongful executions and the lack of conclusive evidence on deterrence.

This report focuses on the arguments supporting the legality of the death penalty, analyzing empirical data, theoretical frameworks, and international practices to provide a comprehensive and objective assessment.

## Historical and Legal Context

The death penalty has ancient origins, with codified laws dating back to Babylon's Code of Hammurabi (18th century BC), which prescribed death for 25 crimes. Over centuries, the scope of capital punishment has narrowed, with modern legal systems typically reserving it for the most serious offenses such as murder and terrorism ([UKEssays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php?vref=1)).

In the United States, the death penalty is authorized in 31 states and at the federal level, reflecting a legal tradition inherited from British colonial law. Other countries like China and Japan also maintain capital punishment, albeit with different methods and legal safeguards ([Studyfy, 2021](https://studyfy.com/essay-samples/death-penalty-should-be-legal)).

## Arguments Supporting the Death Penalty

### 1. Deterrence of Crime

A primary argument for the death penalty is its potential to deter serious crimes, particularly murder. The deterrence theory posits that individuals weigh the costs and benefits before committing crimes; thus, the threat of death may discourage would-be offenders.

Empirical studies provide mixed but notable evidence supporting deterrence:

- Professor Joanna Shepherd (2005) found that each death sentence deters approximately 4.5 murders, and each execution deters about 3 murders, indicating a measurable preventive effect ([Shepherd, 2005](https://studyfy.com/essay-samples/death-penalty-should-be-legal)).

- Economic analyses by Ehrlich (1975) and Yunker (1976) suggested that executions reduce homicide rates, although these findings have been contested due to methodological concerns ([Boyes & McPheters, 1977](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0090-5720(77)80005-3)).

- The National Research Council (2012) concluded that existing studies are inconclusive but recommended further research comparing capital punishment with alternative sanctions ([National Research Council, 2012](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty)).

Despite some conflicting results, the deterrent effect remains a compelling rationale, especially considering that the death penalty uniquely imposes the ultimate sanction, which life imprisonment cannot replicate.

### 2. Retributive Justice and Proportionality

Retribution theory holds that punishment should be proportional to the crime committed. The death penalty is viewed as a just response to the most heinous offenses, particularly murder, reflecting the principle of "an eye for an eye" ([UKEssays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php?vref=1)).

Philosophers like Kant argue that individuals who take a life forfeit their own right to life. This perspective emphasizes justice over revenge, distinguishing rational legal punishment from emotional retaliation.

Furthermore, the death penalty can provide closure to victims' families by ensuring that perpetrators receive a punishment commensurate with their crimes ([Studyfy, 2021](https://studyfy.com/essay-samples/death-penalty-should-be-legal)).

### 3. Protection of Society

Executing dangerous criminals, especially serial killers and terrorists, permanently removes the threat they pose to society. Unlike imprisonment, which carries risks of escape or recidivism, capital punishment guarantees incapacitation ([UKEssays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php?vref=1)).

This protective function is critical in maintaining public safety and reducing social anxiety, particularly in communities affected by violent crime.

### 4. Cost Implications

Proponents argue that the death penalty is more cost-effective than life imprisonment, which entails lifelong expenses for housing, feeding, and medical care of inmates.

While opponents highlight the high costs of legal appeals in capital cases, supporters contend that the overall financial burden of long-term incarceration exceeds that of executions ([UKEssays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php?vref=1)).

## Empirical Evidence and Statistical Analysis

A comprehensive cross-sectional study by Boyes and McPheters (1977) analyzed state-level data on violent crimes, incarceration, and executions in the United States. Key findings include:

| Crime Type | Deterrent Effect of Execution | Deterrent Effect of Imprisonment |
|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Homicide   | Insignificant                 | Significant                     |
| Rape       | Insignificant                 | Significant                     |
| Assault    | Insignificant                 | Insignificant                   |

The study concluded that while imprisonment deters homicide and rape, capital punishment does not have a statistically significant deterrent effect in cross-sectional analyses. However, time-series studies by Ehrlich (1975) and Yunker (1976) suggest a deterrent effect, indicating that methodology and data scope influence outcomes.

The National Research Council (2012) reviewed over 30 years of research and found that no study definitively proves whether the death penalty increases, decreases, or has no effect on homicide rates. They emphasized the need for research that compares capital punishment with alternative sanctions to assess relative deterrence ([National Research Council, 2012](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty)).

## Ethical and Moral Considerations

While ethical objections to the death penalty are significant, proponents argue that:

- The death penalty is not cruel or unusual when administered with due process and humane methods.

- It respects the rights of victims by ensuring justice is served.

- It aligns with societal values of proportionality and accountability.

Moreover, the risk of wrongful execution underscores the need for rigorous legal safeguards rather than abolition ([Studyfy, 2021](https://studyfy.com/essay-samples/death-penalty-should-be-legal)).

## International Perspectives

More than 70% of countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice, reflecting a global trend toward abolition. However, populous and authoritarian countries like China, the U.S., and Japan continue its use.

International human rights law does not prohibit the death penalty but encourages its restriction to the most serious crimes and humane application ([Death Penalty Information Center, 2020](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org)).

Disputes arise when countries without the death penalty oppose its use elsewhere, especially concerning foreign nationals on death row in the U.S. These tensions highlight the complex interplay between domestic law and international norms.

## Conclusion

The death penalty remains a legally and morally complex issue. The evidence indicates that:

- The death penalty can serve as a deterrent to certain crimes, though empirical findings vary.

- It fulfills a retributive function by providing proportional justice for the gravest offenses.

- It protects society by permanently incapacitating dangerous offenders.

- It may offer cost advantages over life imprisonment, considering long-term incarceration expenses.

Given these factors, the death penalty should remain legal, subject to strict procedural safeguards to ensure fairness, prevent wrongful convictions, and uphold human rights standards.

Future research should focus on comparative analyses of capital and noncapital punishments to clarify the death penalty's unique deterrent effects.
