# Why Do Women Get Paid Less Than Men? An In-depth Analysis

The gender pay gap—where women earn less than men on average—remains a persistent and complex issue worldwide. Despite decades of progress in education and workforce participation, women continue to earn significantly less than men across many countries and industries. This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind this disparity, drawing on recent research and authoritative sources to present a comprehensive understanding of why women get paid less than men.

## Overview of the Gender Pay Gap

Globally, women earn less than men for a variety of reasons that are often interrelated. In the United States, women earn approximately 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, a figure that has remained stubbornly consistent over recent years ([InHerSight, 2019](https://www.inhersight.com/blog/insight-commentary/gender-pay-gap-reasons)). In the UK, the gender pay gap for full-time workers is about 13.7%, with an overall median gap of 18.4% when including part-time workers ([Fawcett Society, 2018](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap)).

The persistence of this gap, despite legal frameworks aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work, suggests that the causes extend beyond overt wage discrimination. Instead, the pay gap is influenced by a combination of occupational segregation, societal norms, discrimination, and the motherhood penalty.

## Key Causes of the Gender Pay Gap

### 1. Occupational Segregation and Career Choices

One of the primary drivers of the gender pay gap is occupational segregation—men and women tend to work in different industries and roles, with women disproportionately represented in lower-paid, female-dominated fields such as education, nursing, childcare, and administrative work ([InHerSight, 2019](https://www.inhersight.com/blog/insight-commentary/gender-pay-gap-reasons); [Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/)).

Women’s concentration in care-oriented and service sectors, which are traditionally undervalued and underpaid, contributes significantly to the pay gap. For example, 80% of workers in low-paid care and leisure sectors are women, while only 10% of workers in better-paid skilled trades are women ([Fawcett Society, 2018](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap)).

Moreover, research indicates that wages tend to fall in sectors as they become female-dominated, a phenomenon observed in the United States and other countries ([The New Humanitarian, 2018](https://deeply.thenewhumanitarian.org/womensadvancement/background/the-gender-pay-gap)). This suggests that the undervaluation of “women’s work” is systemic rather than a result of women’s voluntary choices.

### 2. The Motherhood Penalty

Motherhood introduces a significant wage penalty for women, often larger than the overall gender pay gap. Mothers are frequently perceived as less committed, less dependable, and less authoritative than childless women or men, which negatively affects hiring, salary offers, and promotions ([Clayman Institute, 2009](https://gender.stanford.edu/news-publications/gender-news/motherhood-penalty-remains-pervasive-problem-workplace); [Correll, Benard, & Paik, 2007](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

The motherhood penalty manifests in several ways:

- **Wage Penalty:** Mothers earn less than non-mothers, with a per-child wage penalty documented across multiple industrialized nations ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherhood_penalty)).

- **Hiring Penalty:** Employers are less likely to hire mothers compared to equally qualified non-mothers or fathers ([Correll et al., 2007](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

- **Career Progression:** Mothers face barriers to promotions and professional development opportunities due to assumptions about their availability and commitment.

The penalty is compounded by societal expectations that women bear the majority of caregiving responsibilities, leading many mothers to work part-time or accept less demanding roles with lower pay ([Fawcett Society, 2018](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap)).

### 3. Discrimination and Implicit Bias

Despite legal prohibitions against pay discrimination, evidence shows that women are still paid less than men for the same work in many cases. Discrimination can be overt or subtle, including biases related to pregnancy, maternity leave, and assumptions about women’s commitment to work ([Fawcett Society, 2018](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap); [World Economic Forum, 2019](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/an-economist-explains-why-women-get-paid-less/)).

Even after controlling for education, experience, and occupation, a residual pay gap remains, which researchers attribute to discrimination and stereotyping ([InHerSight, 2019](https://www.inhersight.com/blog/insight-commentary/gender-pay-gap-reasons); [Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/)).

### 4. Unequal Caring Responsibilities

Women disproportionately shoulder caregiving duties for children, elderly, and sick relatives. This responsibility often forces women to reduce working hours or take career breaks, which impacts earnings and career progression ([Fawcett Society, 2018](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap)).

Part-time work is more common among women, and such roles tend to be lower paid with fewer opportunities for advancement. This dynamic reinforces the pay gap over a woman’s career.

### 5. Educational Attainment and Experience

While educational attainment gaps between men and women have narrowed significantly, pay disparities persist even among highly educated women. For instance, women with doctorates earn on average 32% less than men with the same degree, and the pay gap widens with age, reaching up to 36% at age 44 ([Salary.com, 2023](https://www.salary.com/blog/understanding-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

This suggests that education alone does not close the pay gap, as other factors such as occupational segregation, discrimination, and caregiving responsibilities play larger roles.

## Quantifying the Gender Pay Gap Components

The gender pay gap can be broken down into explained and unexplained components:

| Factor                          | Approximate Contribution to Pay Gap | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Occupational Segregation        | 25% - 50%                         | Women concentrated in lower-paying industries and roles.                                       |
| Caregiving and Part-time Work   | ~14%                             | Time off and reduced hours due to caregiving responsibilities.                                 |
| Discrimination (Unexplained Gap)| ~25% - 40%                       | Pay differences unexplained by measurable factors, attributed to bias and discrimination.      |
| Educational Differences         | Decreasing role                   | Narrowed significantly but still present in some fields and age groups.                        |

These figures illustrate that while occupational choices and caregiving explain a significant portion of the gap, a substantial unexplained portion remains, indicating persistent discrimination ([Eberhard, 2014](https://medium.com/@KristinEberhard/why-do-women-get-paid-less-than-men-75438990f549); [Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/)).

## Intersectionality and Race

The gender pay gap is not uniform across all women. Women of color face larger pay gaps compared to white women, with Black, Native American, and Latina women experiencing significantly lower earnings relative to white men ([Salary.com, 2023](https://www.salary.com/blog/understanding-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

| Group             | Equal Pay Day (Date Women Earn What Men Earned Previous Year) |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| White Women       | March 9                                                       |
| All Women         | March 24                                                      |
| Mothers           | June 4                                                       |
| Black Women       | August 3                                                     |
| Native American Women | September 8                                               |
| Latinas           | October 21                                                   |

This data highlights the compounded effects of gender and racial discrimination in the labor market.

## Societal Norms and Cultural Expectations

Gender norms and stereotypes influence occupational sorting and workplace dynamics. Women are often socialized and expected to prioritize caregiving roles, which limits their career opportunities and advancement ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/)).

Additionally, cultural biases that view women, especially mothers, as less committed or competent in professional settings contribute to wage penalties and slower career progression ([Correll et al., 2007](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

## Efforts and Solutions to Close the Gap

Addressing the gender pay gap requires multifaceted strategies:

- **Pay Equity Audits:** Regular assessments to identify and correct pay disparities within organizations ([Salary.com, 2023](https://www.salary.com/blog/understanding-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

- **Pay Transparency:** Making salary information accessible can reduce unexplained pay gaps ([The New Humanitarian, 2018](https://deeply.thenewhumanitarian.org/womensadvancement/background/the-gender-pay-gap)).

- **Legislation and Enforcement:** Strengthening equal pay laws and ensuring compliance, as seen in Iceland’s Equal Pay Standard ([The New Humanitarian, 2018](https://deeply.thenewhumanitarian.org/womensadvancement/background/the-gender-pay-gap)).

- **Support for Caregivers:** Implementing family-friendly workplace policies, affordable childcare, and flexible work arrangements to reduce motherhood penalties ([Fawcett Society, 2018](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/close-gender-pay-gap)).

- **Challenging Gender Norms:** Promoting gender diversity in all fields and combating stereotypes through education and workplace culture change ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The gender pay gap is a multifactorial issue rooted in occupational segregation, caregiving responsibilities, discrimination, and societal norms. While some portion of the gap can be explained by differences in job types and work patterns, a significant unexplained gap remains that is attributable to discrimination and bias.

The motherhood penalty is a critical factor that exacerbates the pay gap, reflecting deep-seated cultural biases about women’s roles in the family and workplace. Addressing this requires not only legal and policy interventions but also cultural change to value caregiving and promote gender equality in all spheres.

Given the evidence, it is clear that the gender pay gap is not simply a result of individual choices but is shaped by systemic factors and discrimination. Effective solutions must therefore be comprehensive, targeting both structural barriers and cultural attitudes to achieve true pay equity.
