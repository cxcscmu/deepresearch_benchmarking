# Why Do Women Get Paid Less Than Men? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The gender pay gap—where women earn less than men for comparable work—remains a persistent and complex issue worldwide. Despite decades of progress in educational attainment and labor force participation, women continue to earn less than men on average. Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind this disparity is crucial for policymakers, employers, and society to address wage inequality effectively.

This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of why women get paid less than men. It synthesizes findings from recent empirical research, meta-analyses, and authoritative reports, focusing on the role of occupational segregation, motherhood, discrimination, social norms, and structural factors. The report also highlights variations across countries and industries, emphasizing the nuanced nature of the gender wage gap.

## Overview of the Gender Pay Gap

Women working full-time earn approximately 15% less than men on average, though this figure varies by country, occupation, and demographic group ([The Economist, 2022](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/13/why-are-women-paid-less-than-men)). Importantly, this gap is not solely explained by differences in hours worked or education levels. Even when controlling for these factors, a significant unexplained wage gap remains, often attributed to discrimination and structural inequalities.

## Key Factors Explaining the Gender Pay Gap

### 1. Occupational Segregation and Career Choices

A substantial portion of the wage gap arises because women and men tend to work in different occupations and industries, with female-dominated fields generally paying less. For example, over 80% of teachers, nurses, secretaries, and health workers are women, and these jobs tend to have lower wages compared to male-dominated professions such as engineering or finance ([The Economist, 2022](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/13/why-are-women-paid-less-than-men); [Glassdoor, 2016](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-do-women-get-paid-less_n_57d9b7c5e4b0d8c9b4c9e3d0)).

However, this occupational sorting is influenced by societal norms, gender stereotypes, and discrimination that steer women toward lower-paying fields. Research shows that girls are often socialized from a young age to pursue "female-appropriate" careers, and women face barriers in entering and advancing in male-dominated industries, especially STEM fields ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

### 2. The Motherhood Penalty

Motherhood is a critical factor contributing to the gender wage gap. Women with children experience a "motherhood penalty," where they are perceived as less competent, less committed, and less promotable than childless women or men with children. This results in lower starting salaries, fewer promotions, and hiring discrimination ([Correll, Benard, & Paik, 2007](https://gender.stanford.edu/research-publications/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty); [Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

A meta-analysis of 39 studies found that each child is associated with an average wage decline of approximately 3.6–3.8%, with the penalty varying significantly by country and social context. The penalty is largely explained by lost work experience, career interruptions, and selection into family-friendly but lower-paying jobs. Discrimination also plays a role, especially in countries with weaker family support policies ([Cukrowska-Torzewska & Matysiak, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X20301168)).

### 3. Work Experience and Career Interruptions

Women are more likely than men to take career breaks or reduce working hours to care for children or elderly relatives. These interruptions lead to loss of human capital, slower wage growth, and fewer opportunities for advancement. Even after returning to work, women often face challenges in regaining their previous career trajectory ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap/); [Cukrowska-Torzewska & Matysiak, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X20301168)).

### 4. Discrimination and Bias

Even when controlling for occupation, experience, and education, women still earn less than men, indicating the presence of discrimination. Experimental studies using identical resumes differing only in gender and parental status reveal that mothers are rated as less competent and committed, leading to lower salary offers and fewer callbacks for interviews ([Correll, Benard, & Paik, 2007](https://gender.stanford.edu/research-publications/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

Implicit biases and stereotypes about women's roles and capabilities persist in hiring, promotion, and pay-setting decisions, contributing to the unexplained portion of the wage gap.

### 5. Differences in Work Hours and Flexibility

Women are more likely to work part-time or seek flexible work arrangements to balance family responsibilities. Part-time and flexible jobs often pay less per hour and offer fewer advancement opportunities. This "flexibility penalty" disproportionately affects women and contributes to wage disparities within occupations ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

### 6. Social Norms and Cultural Expectations

Gender norms influence both women's career choices and employer expectations. Societal expectations that women should prioritize caregiving roles lead to occupational segregation and biases against mothers in the workplace. These norms also affect men's and women's willingness to negotiate salaries and pursue leadership roles ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap/); [Correll, Benard, & Paik, 2007](https://gender.stanford.edu/research-publications/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

## Cross-National Variations in the Gender Pay Gap

The size and drivers of the gender pay gap vary significantly across countries, influenced by family policies, labor market institutions, and cultural attitudes ([Cukrowska-Torzewska & Matysiak, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X20301168)).

## Quantifying the Gender Pay Gap Components

A widely cited decomposition of the wage gap attributes approximately:

| Factor                                | Contribution to Wage Gap (%) | Explanation                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Occupational Sorting                | 25–50%                       | Women concentrated in lower-paying fields                                                    |
| Time Off for Caregiving             | 10–16%                       | Career interruptions and reduced hours due to caregiving                                    |
| Unexplained Gap (Discrimination)   | 25–35%                       | Differences unexplained by observable factors, attributed to bias and discrimination          |
| Other Factors                      | Remaining                    | Differences in negotiation, work experience quality, and unmeasured variables                |

## The Motherhood Penalty in Detail

The motherhood penalty is particularly salient:

- Mothers are perceived as less competent and committed than childless women and men with children ([Correll, Benard, & Paik, 2007](https://gender.stanford.edu/research-publications/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

- Mothers receive starting salaries approximately 10% lower than comparable non-mothers.

- The penalty persists across industries and occupations, even after controlling for experience and education.

- Fathers often experience a "fatherhood premium," being perceived as more committed and receiving higher wages ([Baranowska & Matysiak, 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-022-09616-3)).

## Discrimination Evidence from Experimental Studies

Experimental audit studies provide compelling evidence of discrimination:

- Identical resumes with motherhood status indicated receive fewer callbacks and lower salary offers than those without children ([Correll, Benard, & Paik, 2007](https://gender.stanford.edu/research-publications/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty)).

- Mothers are rated lower on competence, promotability, and commitment.

- Fathers do not face similar penalties; in some cases, they receive preferential treatment.

## The Role of Education and Negotiation

Women with higher education levels still face wage penalties, though the gap narrows. However, women are less likely to negotiate salaries aggressively and may face social penalties for doing so, contributing to lower wages ([Economic Policy Institute, 2016](https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap/)).

## Intersectionality: Race and Gender

The gender pay gap is compounded by racial disparities. Women of color often face larger wage gaps compared to white men and women, influenced by systemic racism and discrimination in education, hiring, and pay ([Rho, 2021](https://genderpolicyreport.umn.edu/what-causes-the-wage-gap/)).

## Policy Implications and Recommendations

Addressing the gender pay gap requires multifaceted approaches:

- **Family-Friendly Policies:** Expand access to affordable, high-quality childcare and paid parental leave to reduce career interruptions.

- **Anti-Discrimination Enforcement:** Strengthen laws and practices to detect and prevent gender and parental status discrimination.

- **Workplace Flexibility:** Promote flexible work arrangements without penalizing wages or advancement opportunities.

- **Cultural Change:** Challenge gender stereotypes and norms that limit women's career choices and reinforce caregiving roles.

- **Transparency:** Encourage pay transparency to expose and address wage disparities.

## Conclusion

Women get paid less than men due to a complex interplay of occupational segregation, motherhood-related penalties, career interruptions, discrimination, and social norms. While differences in job types and work hours explain part of the gap, a significant portion remains unexplained and is attributed to bias and structural inequalities. The motherhood penalty is a critical driver of wage disparities, with mothers facing systemic disadvantages in hiring, pay, and promotion.

Cross-national evidence shows that supportive family policies and egalitarian social norms can mitigate the motherhood penalty and reduce the gender wage gap. However, in many countries, persistent cultural expectations and inadequate institutional support continue to disadvantage women.

Addressing the gender pay gap requires comprehensive policy interventions, cultural shifts, and organizational commitment to equity. Only through sustained efforts can the wage gap be closed, ensuring fair compensation for women and fostering inclusive workplaces.
