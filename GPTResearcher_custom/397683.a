# Report on How *Charlotte Temple* Portrays Women's Role in Society During the 1800s

Susanna Rowson’s *Charlotte Temple* (1791) is a seminal work that provides a vivid portrayal of women’s roles and societal expectations during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Through its characters, narrative structure, and thematic concerns, the novel reflects the restrictive and often oppressive conditions faced by women in this era. This report analyzes how *Charlotte Temple* illustrates women’s roles in society during the 1800s, drawing upon scholarly analyses and historical context to provide a comprehensive understanding.

## Overview of Women’s Roles in the 1800s

During the early 1800s, women were largely confined to the domestic sphere, embodying what historians term the "Cult of Domesticity." Their primary responsibilities included childbearing, child-rearing, and maintaining the household. Legally and socially, women were considered inferior to men, lacking autonomy and often controlled first by their fathers and later by their husbands. Women were expected to be moral guardians of the family and society, yet they had limited opportunities for education, employment, or self-expression ([Bartleby, 2023](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Womens-Role-in-Society-in-the-1800s-PKC855AYVJ); [Studentshare, 2023](https://studentshare.org/history/2089155-womens-role-in-society-in-the-1800s-premium-essay)).

## Portrayal of Women in *Charlotte Temple*

### Charlotte as a Model of Virtue and Victimhood

Charlotte Temple, the novel’s protagonist, is portrayed as a young woman who is passive, morally vulnerable, and ultimately a victim of societal and male exploitation. Her characterization is deliberately bland and sparse in quirks or interests, a narrative choice by Rowson to make Charlotte a universal figure with whom young women could identify. This blandness serves Rowson’s didactic purpose: to teach virtue by illustrating the consequences of moral lapses ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/summary-preface-and-chapters-i-v)).

Charlotte’s downfall—seduction, abandonment, and death—reflects the limited options available to women who transgressed societal norms. The novel highlights how women’s fates were often determined by male actions and societal judgments rather than their own agency. For instance, Charlotte’s cold attitude toward her newborn daughter, whom she calls "the offspring of disobedience," reflects the harsh realities faced by women who bore children out of wedlock, as well as the diminished prospects for female children in that era ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/essay-questions)).

### Lucy Eldridge as the Ideal Woman

In contrast to Charlotte, Lucy Eldridge is portrayed as a model of virtue and sacrifice. She is passive and mute within the narrative, with her story told through the perspective of her father, Mr. Temple. Lucy embodies the ideal woman of the time—self-sacrificing, loyal, and supportive of her family despite hardships. This juxtaposition serves to reinforce societal expectations of women as dutiful and morally upright, highlighting the consequences of deviating from these roles ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/summary-preface-and-chapters-i-v)).

### Mrs. Temple as a Female Role Model

Mrs. Temple, Charlotte’s mother, is depicted as an honorable woman who endures economic hardship with dignity. The narrative often shifts to her point of view, emphasizing the impact of Charlotte’s choices on her mother and underscoring that mothers should not be blamed for their daughters’ moral failings. Mrs. Temple’s acceptance of her reduced circumstances and her role as the family’s sole support during her husband’s imprisonment reflect the resilience expected of women in difficult social positions ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/essay-questions)).

## Social Critique and Themes in *Charlotte Temple*

### Marriage and Economic Pressures

Rowson critiques the social pressures on men to marry for money rather than love, which often resulted in poor women becoming mistresses rather than wives. This dynamic is central to Charlotte’s downfall and reflects broader societal trends that disadvantaged women economically and socially. The novel condemns the greed of wealthy characters who fail to support the less fortunate, highlighting the social inequalities that constrained women’s lives ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/essay-questions)).

### Filial Piety and Moral Autonomy

Rowson’s portrayal of filial piety is nuanced. While obedience to family is encouraged as a means to avoid moral pitfalls, the novel asserts that personal morality should supersede family loyalty when the two conflict. This is evident in the contrasting approaches to marriage by Montraville and Mr. Temple, where moral integrity is ultimately valued over blind obedience ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/essay-questions)).

### Differences Between England and the American Colonies

The novel contrasts the social environments of England and the American colonies, illustrating how women’s experiences varied by geography. In England, social status was rigid and difficult to regain once lost, while the colonies offered more fluid social mobility but also greater dangers for women, such as the difficulty of tracing individuals and the instability caused by military life. This contrast underscores the precariousness of women’s social positions and the limited control they had over their destinies ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/essay-questions)).

|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domestic Role**              | Women as moral guardians and caretakers of family (Mrs. Temple) | Women confined to domestic duties and moral supervision      |
| **Agency and Voice**           | Charlotte is passive and silenced; Lucy’s story told by father  | Women had limited legal rights and social autonomy           |
| **Economic Dependence**        | Mr. Temple’s financial struggles affect family status           | Women economically dependent on male relatives or husbands   |
| **Social Mobility**            | Rigid in England, fluid but dangerous in colonies                | Social class largely inherited but with some colonial fluidity |
| **Moral Expectations**         | Emphasis on virtue and consequences of moral failure             | Women expected to uphold virtue; harsh penalties for transgressions |
| **Filial Piety**               | Encouraged but subordinate to personal morality                  | Family loyalty valued but sometimes conflicted with personal ethics |

This comparison reveals that *Charlotte Temple* accurately reflects many of the constraints and expectations placed on women during the 1800s, while also offering a moral critique of the social structures that limited women’s lives.

## Critical Perspective on Rowson’s Feminism

While *Charlotte Temple* addresses women’s issues, it is problematic to label Rowson as an early feminist. The novel devotes more narrative space to male characters, and Charlotte’s characterization is limited to serve didactic purposes rather than to explore female subjectivity deeply. The story reinforces traditional gender roles by presenting virtue as women’s primary value and by emphasizing the consequences of deviating from societal norms ([GradeSaver, 2023](https://www.gradesaver.com/charlotte-temple/study-guide/summary-preface-and-chapters-i-v)).

## Conclusion

*Charlotte Temple* serves as both a reflection and a critique of women’s roles in early 19th-century society. Through its portrayal of Charlotte, Lucy, and Mrs. Temple, the novel illustrates the limited agency, economic dependence, and moral expectations imposed on women. It highlights the social pressures and inequalities that shaped women’s lives, including the dangers of male exploitation and the rigid social hierarchies of the time. Although not feminist by modern standards, Rowson’s work provides valuable insight into the cultural and social dynamics that defined women’s roles during the 1800s.
