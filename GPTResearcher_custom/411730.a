# Does War Make States? Rentierism and the Formation of States in the Middle East

The question of whether war makes states is a longstanding debate in political science and international relations, particularly when applied to the Middle East—a region marked by complex histories of conflict, colonial legacies, and resource wealth. This report examines the dynamics of state formation in the Middle East through the dual lenses of war and rentierism, assessing how these forces have shaped the nature, strength, and stability of states in the region. Drawing on a range of scholarly sources, this report argues that while war has historically played a crucial role in state formation globally, the Middle East presents a unique case where war's impact is mediated by the rentier nature of many states, resulting in "hard" but not fully "strong" states with fragile socio-political cohesion.

## War and State Formation: Theoretical Background and Middle Eastern Context

The classic theory of state formation, famously encapsulated by Charles Tilly's dictum "war made the state, and the state made war," posits that external threats and warfare incentivize states to centralize authority, expand bureaucratic capacity, and consolidate territorial control (Warontherocks.com, 2015). In Western Europe, repeated wars led to the emergence of strong, centralized nation-states with clear borders and national identities.

However, the Middle East diverges from this pattern. The modern state system in the Middle East was largely imposed by Western imperial powers following World War I, particularly through the Sykes-Picot Agreement and the League of Nations mandates, which arbitrarily divided the region without regard for existing cultural, ethnic, or sectarian identities (Manchesteropenhive.com, 2021). This external imposition disrupted pre-existing supra-state identities based on the Islamic umma and created a fragmented system of territorial states lacking deep-rooted national identities.

The post-World War I period saw the consolidation of these states, but unlike the European experience, the Middle Eastern states did not emerge organically through war and conquest but rather through colonial design and later nationalist struggles. This has resulted in states that are "hard"—meaning they exercise coercive power and control over territory—but not "strong" in terms of socio-political cohesion and legitimacy (Internationalaffairs.org, 2017).

## Characteristics of Middle Eastern States: Hard vs. Strong

According to Zartman (2017), Middle Eastern states are "real states," but they fall short of the Weberian ideal of strong states characterized by a social contract of participation and accountability. Instead, most are "hard states," which maintain authority primarily through coercion and clientelistic networks rather than democratic legitimacy or inclusive governance. This distinction is critical in understanding the region's political insecurity and the nature of conflicts within and between states.

| Feature               | Hard States                              | Strong States                            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Basis of Authority    | Coercion and clientelism                 | Social contract, participation, legitimacy |
| State-Society Relation | Limited accountability, authoritarian   | Inclusive, accountable governance       |
| Stability             | Fragile, prone to collapse under shock  | Resilient, stable                        |
| Example in Middle East | Most states including Iraq, Syria, Egypt| Turkey, Israel, Iran (relatively stronger) |

This fragility was evident during the Arab Spring, where several hard states experienced rapid regime changes or collapse due to their inability to maintain legitimacy beyond coercion (Internationalaffairs.org, 2017; E-ir.info, 2019).

## The Role of War in Middle Eastern State Formation

While war has historically been a driver of state formation, in the Middle East, its role is more nuanced. The region has experienced numerous conflicts, including inter-state wars (e.g., Iran-Iraq War, Gulf War) and intra-state civil wars (e.g., Syrian Civil War). These conflicts have often led to militarization and increased state capabilities in terms of coercion but have rarely resulted in the consolidation of strong states.

The Arab uprisings demonstrated that many Middle Eastern states are vulnerable to internal strife, which can spill over into regional instability and invite foreign intervention (E-ir.info, 2019). Civil wars are not chronic in all states but tend to occur where socio-political cohesion is weak (Buzan, 1991). The militarization driven by wars has sometimes exacerbated sectarian and ethnic divisions rather than fostering national unity.

Moreover, the regional order is increasingly shaped by sectarian divides, such as the Shi'a "Fatal Crescent" versus Sunni blocs, rather than by clear-cut state boundaries or national identities (Internationalaffairs.org, 2017). This sectarianization complicates the traditional war-state formation nexus.

## Rentierism: Economic Foundations and Political Implications

A critical factor differentiating Middle Eastern states from classical state formation models is rentierism—the economic reliance on substantial external rents, primarily from oil and gas exports, which profoundly shapes state-society relations.

### Definition and Characteristics of Rentier States

Rentier states derive a significant portion of their revenue from external rents rather than domestic taxation. This economic structure leads to a break in the traditional work-reward relationship, as wealth is generated by resource rents rather than productive economic activity (Wikipedia.org, Rentier state).

Key characteristics include:

- **Low taxation of citizens:** Reduces the need for state accountability to society.
- **High state control:** Over economic, social, and political life.
- **Clientelism:** The state distributes rents to maintain loyalty and suppress opposition.
- **Weak civil society:** Due to economic dependence on the state.

### Rentierism and Authoritarian Durability

Eva Bellin (2004) argues that the strength of rentier states lies in their monopoly on coercion and control over rents, which reinforces authoritarianism. The state's capacity to distribute wealth through jobs, benefits, and modernization projects creates dependency, limiting democratic activism (E-ir.info, 2019).

However, rentierism also introduces paradoxes. Some rentier states (e.g., Kuwait, Qatar, UAE) have remained stable, while others (e.g., Algeria, Bahrain, Libya) have experienced violent unrest, especially during the Arab Spring (Wikipedia.org, Rentier state). This variation is linked to political legitimacy and governance quality rather than rentierism alone (Abulof, 2017).

## Interaction Between War and Rentierism in State Formation

The coexistence of war-driven militarization and rentier economic structures produces a complex dynamic in Middle Eastern state formation.

- **War increases militarization and coercive capacity:** States invest heavily in military capabilities to survive internal and external threats.
- **Rentierism reduces the need for taxation and political accountability:** Citizens are less empowered to demand representation, weakening the social contract.
- **Resulting states are "hard" but fragile:** They maintain control through coercion and rent distribution but lack deep legitimacy and socio-political cohesion.

This dynamic explains why many Middle Eastern states have not evolved into strong nation-states despite prolonged conflict and militarization. Instead, they remain vulnerable to shocks, as seen in Iraq and Syria, where war has led to state fragmentation rather than consolidation (E-ir.info, 2019).

## Historical and Contemporary Implications

### Colonial Legacy and Arbitrary Borders

The imposition of borders by colonial powers after World War I disrupted natural processes of state formation through war and conquest, freezing artificial boundaries that do not align with ethnic or sectarian realities (Manchesteropenhive.com, 2021). This has perpetuated internal conflicts and weakened state legitimacy.

### Sectarianism and Regional Order

The regional order is increasingly defined by sectarian identities rather than state sovereignty, with Iran's rise under the banner of Shi'ism and Sunni blocs forming opposing alliances (Internationalaffairs.org, 2017). This sectarianization complicates state consolidation and fuels intra-state and inter-state conflicts.

### The Role of External Powers

The diminishing role of traditional external powers like the US and Europe, alongside increased Russian involvement, adds layers of complexity to the regional state system, affecting sovereignty and state stability (Internationalaffairs.org, 2017).

### Rentierism and Political Reform

The wealth from rents has allowed some states to suppress demands for political reform by distributing social benefits, as observed during the Arab Spring when Gulf states quelled unrest with social packages (Foreignpolicynews.org, 2017). However, this strategy may only delay inevitable demands for representation and governance reform.

## Conclusion and Opinion

In conclusion, war alone does not "make" states in the Middle East in the classical sense of creating strong, cohesive nation-states. Instead, the region's state formation is shaped by a combination of imposed borders, sectarian divisions, and rentier economic structures that produce "hard" states with limited legitimacy and fragile socio-political cohesion.

Rentierism fundamentally alters the war-state formation nexus by reducing the state's reliance on taxation and political accountability, thereby weakening the social contract necessary for strong statehood. While war and conflict have increased militarization and state capacity for coercion, they have not translated into the consolidation of strong, Weberian states.

Therefore, the Middle East exemplifies a unique model where war contributes to state hardness but rentierism constrains state strength and legitimacy. Future stability and state formation in the region will likely depend on addressing the rentier state's structural limitations, fostering inclusive governance, and managing sectarian divisions rather than relying on militarization or external interventions alone.
