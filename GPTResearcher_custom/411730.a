# Does War Make States? Rentierism and the Formation of States in the Middle East

## Introduction

The question of whether war makes states has long been a central theme in political science and international relations, particularly in the context of state formation. The Middle East offers a compelling case study due to its unique historical trajectory, characterized by imperial legacies, colonial interventions, and resource-driven political economies. This report critically examines the role of war and rentierism in the formation and consolidation of states in the Middle East, drawing on recent scholarship and historical analyses. It challenges simplistic narratives that attribute state weakness solely to colonial border-making or war absence and explores how international conflict dynamics and resource rents have shaped state capacity and sovereignty.

## Theoretical Framework: War and State Formation

The classical theory of state formation, epitomized by Tilly's dictum "war made the state and the state made war," posits that interstate conflict incentivizes rulers to build centralized bureaucracies, expand taxation, and consolidate control over territory to mobilize resources for war ([Denison, 2015](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/bordering-on-conflict-real-talk-on-borders-war-and-states/)). In Western Europe, frequent wars and conquest drove the emergence of strong, centralized nation-states with clearly demarcated borders and national identities.

Applying this framework to the Middle East, however, reveals complexities. Unlike Western Europe, many Middle Eastern states experienced long periods of imperial rule (Ottoman, Habsburg, and colonial powers) that provided external security and reduced interstate conflict. This security paradoxically diminished incentives for local rulers to build strong, centralized states capable of defending borders independently ([Denison, 2015](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/bordering-on-conflict-real-talk-on-borders-war-and-states/)).

## Colonial Borders and Their Impact on State Formation

The legacy of colonial border-making in the Middle East is often blamed for contemporary conflicts and weak statehood. However, Denison (2015) and Sdiqui (2014) argue that the distinction between foreign-drawn and locally-drawn borders is misleading. Borders are social constructions by elites, and the international context—particularly the presence or absence of war threats—plays a more decisive role in state strength than the origin of borders themselves.

Colonial powers often imposed territorial integrity norms and uti possidetis principles, maintaining colonial borders post-independence to prevent interstate wars. This reduced interstate conflict but also removed the systemic incentives for nascent states to centralize authority and build robust state apparatuses ([Denison, 2015](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/bordering-on-conflict-real-talk-on-borders-war-and-states/)).

## The Role of War in Middle Eastern State Formation: The Balkan Exception and Beyond

The Balkans, often cited as a war-prone region, actually experienced fewer wars historically compared to Western Europe due to Ottoman and Habsburg imperial control. Only after imperial decline did wars and state formation accelerate, illustrating the war-state formation link ([Denison, 2015](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/bordering-on-conflict-real-talk-on-borders-war-and-states/)).

In the Middle East, the absence of interstate war during colonial and early postcolonial periods similarly inhibited state consolidation. The threat of war acts as a catalyst for centralization, but when security is externally provided or borders are uncontested, states lack the impetus to develop strong bureaucracies and military capacities ([Denison, 2015](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/bordering-on-conflict-real-talk-on-borders-war-and-states/)).

## Rentierism and Its Effects on State Capacity

A critical factor differentiating Middle Eastern states from European counterparts is the prevalence of rentierism—the reliance on substantial external rents, primarily from oil and gas revenues, rather than taxation of the domestic population. This economic structure has profound implications for state formation and strength.

### Rentier State Characteristics

- **Revenue Source**: Rentier states derive a significant portion of their income from external rents (e.g., oil exports), reducing dependence on domestic taxation.
- **State-Society Relations**: Reduced taxation weakens the social contract between the state and citizens, diminishing demands for accountability and political participation.
- **State Capacity**: With abundant rents, states can maintain security apparatuses and patronage networks without building broad-based bureaucracies or inclusive institutions.

### Rentierism and Weak State Formation

Blaydes (2017) highlights that Middle Eastern states historically possessed sophisticated bureaucratic and fiscal institutions dating back to ancient times, but rentierism altered incentives for state building in the modern era. The availability of resource rents allowed rulers to bypass the need for broad taxation and political negotiation, leading to "hard states" that prioritize regime survival over social contract and institutional development ([Blaydes, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023141)).

These rentier dynamics contribute to state fragility, as seen in the Arab Spring uprisings where states with less diversified economies and weaker institutional foundations were more vulnerable to collapse or severe unrest ([Zartman, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iix118)).

## Historical Continuities and Institutional Legacies

The Middle East's state institutions have deep historical roots, including:

- **Early Centralized States**: The region was home to some of the earliest and most sophisticated states, with centralized bureaucracies and fiscal capacities (Blaydes, 2017).
- **Military Elite**: Reliance on slave soldiers (mamluks) and state control of agricultural land shaped political authority and limited the emergence of autonomous landed elites.
- **Religious Institutions**: Islamic charitable foundations (waqf) became key intermediaries between state and society, providing public goods and influencing political legitimacy.

These institutions persisted well into the Ottoman period and influenced the nature of modern Middle Eastern states, which often inherited centralized but autocratic governance structures with limited social accountability ([Blaydes, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023141)).

## The Ottoman Empire and State Formation

The Ottoman Empire exemplifies the complex interplay of war, imperial control, and state formation:

- **Centralization**: The empire maintained centralized control over vast territories, using slave soldiers and land grants to sustain military elites.
- **Limited Representative Institutions**: Unlike Europe, the Ottoman system lacked representative bodies, concentrating power in the sultan and bureaucracy.
- **Economic Decline and Colonial Encroachment**: Economic weakness and European industrial dynamism led to Ottoman decline and increased vulnerability to colonial powers ([Owen, 2004](https://www.routledge.com/State-Power-and-Politics-in-the-Making-of-the-Modern-Middle-East-3rd-Edition/Owen/p/book/9780415297141)).

The empire's decline and eventual collapse after World War I created the conditions for the emergence of modern nation-states, often under colonial mandates.

## Post-Ottoman State Formation and Border Stability

Post-World War I, the Middle East saw the creation of new states with borders largely inherited from colonial agreements (e.g., Sykes-Picot). Despite perceptions of artificiality, these borders have proven remarkably stable, with most conflicts arising within states rather than over borders ([Zartman, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iix118)).

National identities have solidified around these state boundaries, even among displaced populations and refugees. Subnational groups, such as Kurds and Palestinians, remain exceptions in their pursuit of new sovereign entities, but face significant challenges to recognition and autonomy ([Zartman, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iix118)).

## War, Conflict, and State Strength in the Contemporary Middle East

The Middle East's international system is characterized by:

- **Hard States**: States with limited social contracts, focused on regime survival, often relying on coercion and patronage.
- **Fragility and Conflict**: Some states collapsed or weakened significantly during the Arab Spring (e.g., Libya, Yemen), while others persisted through repression or reform.
- **Subnational Autonomy**: Regions like Iraqi Kurdistan exhibit de facto autonomy, reflecting internal challenges to centralized authority ([Zartman, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iix118)).

The presence or absence of interstate war influences state consolidation. Where external threats exist, states may strengthen; where security is externally provided or conflict is internal, states may remain weak or fragmented ([Denison, 2015](https://warontherocks.com/2015/02/bordering-on-conflict-real-talk-on-borders-war-and-states/)).

## Conclusion

War has historically been a significant driver of state formation by incentivizing centralization, taxation, and bureaucratic development. However, in the Middle East, the presence of imperial rule and colonial protection reduced interstate conflict, diminishing these incentives. Consequently, many Middle Eastern states evolved as "hard states," relying heavily on rentierism—external resource rents—to sustain regimes without building strong social contracts or inclusive institutions.

Rentierism has thus played a critical role in shaping state formation in the Middle East, often substituting for the war-driven mechanisms that produced strong states in Europe. While the region boasts a deep institutional legacy of centralized governance and sophisticated bureaucracies dating back centuries, modern state capacity has been constrained by economic structures and international security dynamics.

The stability of colonial-era borders and the resilience of state identities suggest that the Middle East's state system is unlikely to undergo radical territorial reconfiguration in the near future. Instead, the region faces challenges of internal fragmentation, subnational autonomy movements, and the need to reconcile resource wealth with inclusive governance.

Understanding Middle Eastern state formation requires moving beyond simplistic attributions to colonial border-making or war absence, and instead appreciating the complex interplay of historical legacies, rentier economies, and international security environments.
