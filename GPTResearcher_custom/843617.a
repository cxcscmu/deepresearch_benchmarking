The government also focuses on optimizing digital infrastructure, promoting digital transformation in enterprises, and expanding international cooperation in the digital economy, which collectively foster a conducive environment for rapid digital growth.

## 2. Massive Domestic Market and Consumption Power

China's vast population and rapidly growing middle class provide an unparalleled domestic market that fuels digital economy growth. Key aspects include:

- **Large-Scale Market:** The extensive market space allows for abundant application scenarios, from e-commerce to mobile payments and digital public services.
- **High Consumer Adoption:** China is the world’s largest e-commerce market, accounting for over 40% of global e-commerce transaction value, a dramatic increase from less than 1% a decade ago ([McKinsey, 2017](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/china/chinas-digital-economy-a-leading-global-force)).
- **Mobile Payments Leadership:** China processes 11 times the mobile payment transaction value of the United States, highlighting the deep integration of digital technologies into daily life ([McKinsey, 2017](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/china/chinas-digital-economy-a-leading-global-force)).

This domestic demand drives innovation and scale, enabling Chinese digital companies to refine business models and technologies before expanding globally.
