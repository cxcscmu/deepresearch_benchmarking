## Will Apps Make the Web Irrelevant?

### Evidence Against the Web Becoming Irrelevant

1. **Coexistence Rather Than Replacement:**  
   Multiple sources emphasize that apps and the Web serve different purposes and user preferences. Apps excel in delivering specialized, personalized experiences, while the Web remains the go-to platform for broad information discovery and access ([Jean-Philippe Copers, n.d.](http://jeanphilippecopersebusinessintheeu3ion.weebly.com/will-apps-make-the-web-irrelevant.html); [CourseHero, n.d.](https://www.coursehero.com/file/64263010/Apps-make-the-web-irrelevantdocx/)).

2. **Web’s Omnipotence and Vastness:**  
   The Web’s vastness, encompassing countless websites and services, cannot be fully replicated by apps. Users often prefer the Web for tasks requiring exploration, comparison, or accessing multiple sources without the burden of downloading numerous apps ([Jean-Philippe Copers, n.d.](http://jeanphilippecopersebusinessintheeu3ion.weebly.com/will-apps-make-the-web-irrelevant.html)).
