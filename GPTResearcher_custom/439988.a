# Improving Medicaid While Delivering Cost Effectiveness: A Comprehensive Analysis

Medicaid, a vital public health insurance program in the United States, covers nearly one in five Americans, including low-income adults, children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with disabilities. It accounts for almost 30% of total state spending, making cost containment a critical policy goal for states ([National Conference of State Legislatures, 2021](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/improving-health-and-controlling-costs-in-medicaid-the-6-18-initiative.aspx)). Despite its importance, Medicaid faces persistent challenges related to rising costs, high prevalence of chronic conditions among enrollees, and the need to improve health outcomes efficiently. This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of strategies to improve Medicaid while achieving cost effectiveness, drawing on recent research, federal initiatives, and state-level innovations.

## 1. Context and Challenges in Medicaid Cost and Quality Management

Medicaid serves a disproportionately high-risk population with complex health needs, including chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. These conditions are among the most costly to treat and manage, contributing significantly to Medicaid expenditures ([National Conference of State Legislatures, 2021](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/improving-health-and-controlling-costs-in-medicaid-the-6-18-initiative.aspx)).

Historically, Medicaid operated under a fee-for-service (FFS) payment model, which incentivized volume over value, often leading to inefficiencies and fragmented care. Since the 1980s, there has been a gradual shift toward managed care and value-based payment models aimed at improving care coordination, quality, and cost control ([Annual Review of Public Health, 2020](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094345)).

Despite these reforms, evidence on cost savings remains mixed. Some studies report modest savings and quality improvements in specific states or populations, while others find limited or no cost reductions at the national level ([Annual Review of Public Health, 2020](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094345)). This variability underscores the need for targeted, evidence-based strategies tailored to Medicaid’s unique population and state contexts.

## 2. The CDC’s 6|18 Initiative: Targeting High-Burden Conditions with Evidence-Based Interventions

A promising approach to improving Medicaid cost effectiveness is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) 6|18 Initiative. This initiative focuses on six common, preventable health conditions—tobacco use, high blood pressure, inappropriate antibiotic use, asthma, unintended pregnancies, and type 2 diabetes—and 18 evidence-based interventions that have demonstrated health and cost benefits within 18 months of implementation ([CDC, 2021](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/improving-health-and-controlling-costs-in-medicaid-the-6-18-initiative.aspx)).

### Key Features of the 6|18 Initiative:

| Condition           | Examples of Evidence-Based Interventions                          | Potential Impact                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Tobacco Use         | Tobacco cessation counseling, nicotine replacement therapy       | Reduced smoking rates, decreased healthcare costs |
| High Blood Pressure | Hypertension screening, medication adherence programs            | Lower incidence of cardiovascular events        |
| Inappropriate Antibiotic Use | Provider education, prescribing guidelines                      | Reduced antibiotic resistance and costs          |
| Asthma              | Asthma action plans, environmental trigger reduction             | Fewer emergency visits and hospitalizations      |
| Unintended Pregnancies | Access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)           | Reduced unintended pregnancies and associated costs |
| Type 2 Diabetes     | Diabetes self-management education, medication adherence          | Improved glycemic control, reduced complications |

The 6|18 Initiative has engaged over 40 state, local, and territorial Medicaid and public health teams, facilitating collaboration, technical assistance, and peer learning to implement these interventions effectively ([CDC, 2021](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/improving-health-and-controlling-costs-in-medicaid-the-6-18-initiative.aspx)).

## 3. Delivery System and Payment Reforms: Shifting from Volume to Value

State Medicaid programs have increasingly adopted delivery system and payment reforms to align incentives with quality and cost outcomes. Common models include:

- **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs):** As of 2019, 33 states reported that 75% or more of Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in risk-based MCOs, which integrate behavioral and physical health services and incorporate quality incentives such as pay-for-performance (P4P) ([Kaiser Family Foundation, 2022](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-delivery-system-and-payment-strategies-aimed-at-improving-outcomes-and-lowering-costs-in-medicaid/)).

- **Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs):** These models emphasize coordinated, comprehensive primary care with a focus on prevention and chronic disease management.

- **Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs):** Medicaid ACOs hold providers accountable for cost and quality across a population. Early evidence from states like Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, and Vermont shows promising cost savings and quality improvements, including $77 million net savings in Colorado over four years and a 23% reduction in emergency department visits in Oregon ([National Conference of State Legislatures, 2016](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/accountable-care-organizations-health-costs.aspx)).

- **Episodes of Care and Global Budgets:** Emerging payment models that bundle payments for episodes of care or set global budgets to incentivize efficiency.

### Payment Model Spectrum and Provider Risk

| Payment Model Type                     | Provider Financial Risk | Incentive Focus                         |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Fee-for-Service (FFS)                 | None                   | Volume of services                    |
| Pay-for-Performance (P4P)             | Low                    | Quality and efficiency bonuses       |
| Shared Savings (One-sided Risk)       | Moderate               | Savings sharing without penalties    |
| Shared Risk (Two-sided Risk)           | High                   | Savings sharing and penalties for losses |
| Global Capitation                     | Very High              | Fixed payment for all care            |

States are increasingly incorporating Alternative Payment Models (APMs) in managed care contracts to encourage value-based care, though the impact varies by state and model maturity ([Kaiser Family Foundation, 2022](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/state-delivery-system-and-payment-strategies-aimed-at-improving-outcomes-and-lowering-costs-in-medicaid/)).

## 4. Medicaid Managed Care: Opportunities and Limitations

Medicaid managed care has been promoted as a mechanism to improve access, quality, and cost control by shifting risk to managed care organizations. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients are enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or similar managed care plans ([Annual Review of Public Health, 2020](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094345)).

### Evidence Summary:

- **Cost Savings:** National studies show mixed results, with some states achieving cost savings and others not. For example, Oregon’s Medicaid managed care program demonstrated reduced costs and improved outcomes, while other states showed limited savings ([Annual Review of Public Health, 2020](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094345)).

- **Quality and Access:** Managed care can improve access and quality, especially for high-risk populations, but results vary widely across states.

- **Budget Predictability:** Managed care may offer states more predictable budgeting, though fully capitated programs have not consistently improved this ([Perez, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC)).

- **Pharmacy Benefits:** Carving in drug benefits to managed care contracts has shown efficiency gains through lower drug prices and increased generic use ([Annual Review of Public Health, 2020](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094345)).

## 5. Policy Recommendations for Improving Medicaid Cost Effectiveness

Based on the evidence and initiatives reviewed, the following recommendations can guide Medicaid improvements toward cost effectiveness:

### 5.1. Expand Implementation of the CDC’s 6|18 Initiative

- **Rationale:** Targeting high-burden, preventable conditions with proven interventions can yield rapid health improvements and cost savings.

- **Action Steps:** States should integrate 6|18 interventions into Medicaid benefit designs, coverage policies, and care delivery models, leveraging CDC technical assistance and peer collaboration.

### 5.2. Strengthen Value-Based Payment Models

- **Rationale:** Transitioning from volume-based FFS to value-based payment aligns incentives with quality and cost control.

- **Action Steps:** States should expand risk-based managed care enrollment, incorporate APMs such as shared savings and global budgets, and require managed care plans to participate in value-based initiatives like ACOs and PCMHs.

- **Considerations:** Payment reforms must be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences like provider consolidation and ensure adequate risk adjustment.

### 5.3. Enhance Care Coordination and Integration

- **Rationale:** Coordinated care improves management of chronic conditions, reduces unnecessary utilization, and improves patient outcomes.

- **Action Steps:** Expand PCMHs, ACA Health Homes, and integrated behavioral health services within Medicaid.

### 5.4. Leverage Data and Quality Measurement

- **Rationale:** Timely access to claims and clinical data enables providers to monitor performance and implement improvements.

- **Action Steps:** Invest in health information technology, standardize quality measures across states, and align Medicaid metrics with Medicare and private payers to reduce provider burden.

### 5.5. Address Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)

- **Rationale:** SDOH significantly impact health outcomes and costs, particularly in Medicaid populations.

- **Action Steps:** Incorporate SDOH screening and interventions into Medicaid programs, incentivize managed care plans to address social needs, and collaborate with community-based organizations.

## 6. Conclusion

Improving Medicaid while achieving cost effectiveness requires a multifaceted approach that combines evidence-based clinical interventions, innovative payment and delivery reforms, and robust data infrastructure. The CDC’s 6|18 Initiative offers a practical framework for targeting high-impact conditions with proven strategies. Meanwhile, expanding value-based payment models such as managed care, PCMHs, and ACOs can align incentives toward better outcomes and cost control. States must tailor these approaches to their unique populations and contexts, continuously evaluate outcomes, and address broader determinants of health to realize sustainable improvements.
