# Improving Medicaid While Delivering Cost Effectiveness: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income Americans, plays a critical role in providing access to health care for vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with disabilities. However, Medicaid accounts for nearly 30% of total state spending, and its beneficiaries often have a higher prevalence of chronic conditions compared to privately insured individuals, leading to significant treatment and management costs ([National Association of State Budget Officers, 2018](https://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/reports-data/state-expenditure-report)). Improving Medicaid's cost-effectiveness while maintaining or enhancing health outcomes is thus a pressing policy priority.

This report synthesizes evidence-based strategies, payment reforms, and integration models to propose concrete approaches for improving Medicaid's efficiency and effectiveness. It draws extensively from the CDC’s 6|18 Initiative, CMS value-based care guidance, and international bundled-payment models, among other sources, to provide a detailed, data-driven analysis.

## 1. Evidence-Based Interventions Targeting High-Burden Conditions

The CDC's 6|18 Initiative identifies six common, preventable health conditions that disproportionately affect Medicaid populations and drive high healthcare costs: tobacco use, high blood pressure, inappropriate antibiotic use, asthma, unintended pregnancies, and type 2 diabetes. Eighteen evidence-based interventions have been developed to address these conditions, focusing on improving health outcomes and reducing costs within a short timeframe ([CDC, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/sixeighteen/index.htm)).

### 1.1 Tobacco Use

- **Prevalence & Impact**: Tobacco use is nearly twice as prevalent among Medicaid beneficiaries (24%) compared to privately insured individuals (10.5%), making it the leading cause of preventable disease and death ([CDC, 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2020-smoking-cessation/index.html)).
- **Cost-effective Strategies**:
  - Comprehensive cessation coverage including counseling and FDA-approved medications.
  - Removal of barriers such as copayments and prior authorizations.
  - Promotion of cessation benefits to increase utilization.
  
Despite all states covering some cessation services, many impose limits on treatment duration and access, impeding effectiveness ([DiGiulio et al., 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6906a2)).

### 1.2 High Blood Pressure Control

- **Prevalence & Impact**: Nearly 50% of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, but only half have it under control ([CDC, 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm)).
- **Cost-effective Strategies**:
  - Self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring with clinical support.
  - Use of fixed-dose combination medications to improve adherence.
  - Low copayments and extended medication refills.
  - Innovative pharmacy packaging and care coordination.

In 2014, only 10% of blood pressure medications filled by Medicaid were fixed-dose combinations, indicating room for improvement ([Ritchey et al., 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159366)).

### 1.3 Antibiotic Stewardship

- **Problem**: Approximately 30% of hospital antibiotic use is unnecessary or inappropriate, contributing to resistance and increased costs ([Fridkin et al., 2014](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6309a3.htm)).
- **Strategies**:
  - Mandatory Antibiotic Stewardship Programs (ASPs) in hospitals and nursing homes.
  - Provider incentives to adhere to outpatient stewardship guidelines.
  
CMS has mandated ASPs in Medicare and Medicaid participating hospitals since 2019, improving prescribing practices ([CMS, 2019](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/09/30/2019-20736/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-regulatory-provisions-to-promote-program-efficiency-transparency-and)).

### 1.4 Asthma Management

- **Prevalence & Impact**: Asthma affects over 24 million Americans, with low-income populations disproportionately burdened ([CDC, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/asthma_stats/Health_Care_Coverage_among_Children.htm)).
- **Strategies**:
  - Adoption of National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines.
  - Enhanced access to controller medications and devices.
  - Intensive self-management education and home visits to reduce triggers.
  
Rhode Island’s Home Asthma Response Program demonstrated a 75% reduction in asthma-related hospital and emergency department costs ([Cloutier et al., 2009](https://www.ajmc.com/journals/issue/2009/2009-06-vol15-n6/ajmc_09jun_cloutier_345to351)).

### 1.5 Preventing Unintended Pregnancies

- **Context**: Medicaid finances about 46% of births in the U.S., with nearly half of pregnancies unintended, leading to adverse outcomes and costs ([Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/births-financed-by-medicaid/)).
- **Strategies**:
  - Full reimbursement for contraceptive services and FDA-approved methods.
  - Unbundling payment for long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) from delivery services.
  - Removing administrative barriers to contraceptive access.
  
Colorado’s program increased LARC use among young women from 5% to 19%, reducing unintended pregnancies by 40% in teens ([Ricketts et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24961366/)).

### 1.6 Preventing Type 2 Diabetes

- **Prevalence**: 30 million Americans have diabetes; 84 million have prediabetes ([CDC, 2021](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html)).
- **Strategy**:
  - Expansion of Medicaid coverage for the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) lifestyle change program.
  
Twenty states offer some Medicaid coverage for National DPP, with ongoing efforts to expand access ([NACDD, 2020](https://coveragetoolkit.org/participating-payers/)).

## 2. Payment Reform and Delivery System Integration

Transitioning Medicaid from fee-for-service (FFS) to value-based payment (VBP) models is essential to incentivize cost-effective, high-quality care. Key reforms include bundled payments, accountable care organizations (ACOs), and alternative payment methodologies (APMs).

### 2.1 Bundled Payments

- **Definition**: Single payments covering all services during an episode of care, encouraging coordination and efficiency.
- **Evidence**: Systematic reviews show bundled payments reduce costs and maintain or improve quality, particularly in joint replacement surgeries ([Agarwal et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905061/); [Struijs et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.26099/936s-0y65)).
- **Implementation**: CMS’s Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative includes retrospective and prospective models, covering inpatient stays and post-acute care.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces fragmentation by aligning provider incentives.
  - Encourages evidence-based care pathways.
  - Demonstrated cost savings and quality improvements in multiple states and countries.

| Payment Model | Description | Risk Type | Services Covered | Example |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Retrospective Bundled Payment | Payments made after services, reconciled against target price | Shared risk | Hospital stay + post-acute care | BPCI Models 2 & 3 |
| Prospective Bundled Payment | Lump sum payment upfront for episode | Full provider risk | Hospital + physician services + readmissions | BPCI Model 4 |

### 2.2 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)

- **Concept**: Groups of providers jointly accountable for cost and quality of care for a defined population.
- **Medicare Experience**: Over 360 ACOs serve 5.3 million beneficiaries, generating $128 million in net savings ([CMS, 2014](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/index.html)).
- **Medicaid Application**: New York State’s Medicaid Payment Reform Roadmap aligns Medicaid and Medicare ACOs, promoting multi-payer integration and reducing administrative burden ([NYS DOH, 2015](https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/dsrip/)).

### 2.3 Alternative Payment Methodologies (APMs)

- **Definition**: Payment models that incentivize value over volume, including shared savings, downside risk, and capitation.
- **CMS Guidance**: Encourages states to adopt APMs consistent with Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network (HCP-LAN) framework to drive Medicaid VBC ([CMS, 2020](https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd20003.pdf)).

## 3. Delivery System Integration and Health Information Technology (HIT)

Fragmented care delivery leads to inefficiencies, poor outcomes, and higher costs. Integration through coordinated care models and HIT is crucial.

### 3.1 Care Coordination and Integration

- **Challenges**: Medicaid beneficiaries often navigate multiple providers and settings, leading to duplication and errors ([Toussaint, 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53926/)).
- **Successful Models**:
  - ThedaCare’s Collaborative Care Unit reduced inpatient costs by 25%.
  - Gundersen Lutheran’s end-of-life care coordination halved Medicare costs per enrollee.
- **Strategies**:
  - Implement patient-centered medical homes (PCMH).
  - Use standardized protocols and care pathways.
  - Enhance communication among providers.

### 3.2 Health Information Technology

- **Role**: EHRs and health information exchanges (HIEs) enable data sharing, reduce duplication, and support quality improvement ([Wiesenthal, 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53926/)).
- **Limitations**: HIT alone does not guarantee integration; organizational commitment and payment incentives are necessary.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Promote meaningful use of EHRs.
  - Establish regional HIEs aligned with referral patterns.
  - Remove regulatory barriers to data sharing.
  - Address patient privacy concerns to build trust.
