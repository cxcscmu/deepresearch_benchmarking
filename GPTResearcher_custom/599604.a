# Report: Why Are People Against Critical Race Theory?

## Introduction

Critical Race Theory (CRT) has become a highly contentious topic in American public discourse, particularly in education. Originating as an academic framework in the late 1970s and early 1980s, CRT examines how racism is embedded in legal systems and societal structures. Despite its academic roots, CRT has been widely debated, misunderstood, and politicized, leading to significant opposition, especially among conservatives and some moderate groups. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, well-structured, and balanced analysis of why people oppose CRT, drawing from diverse perspectives and reliable sources.

## Understanding Critical Race Theory

CRT is an academic and legal framework that posits that racism is not merely the product of individual bias but is embedded in laws, policies, and institutions, perpetuating racial inequalities ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/07)). It emerged from Critical Legal Studies and was formalized by scholars such as Derrick Bell, Kimberl√© Crenshaw, and Richard Delgado. CRT challenges the notion of colorblindness and argues that systemic racism is ordinary and ingrained in American society.

CRT also critiques liberalism, Enlightenment rationalism, and traditional legal reasoning, emphasizing the role of power and social constructs in maintaining racial hierarchies. It advocates for a proactive anti-racist stance and transformative social change rather than incremental reforms.

## Overview of Opposition to CRT

Opposition to CRT is multifaceted and stems from ideological, political, educational, and social concerns. The main reasons for opposition include:

1. **Perception of CRT as Divisive and Racist**
2. **Concerns Over Group Identity and Individualism**
3. **Misrepresentation and Political Weaponization**
4. **Fear of Indoctrination and Impact on Children**
5. **Disagreement Over Historical Interpretation and National Identity**
6. **Concerns About Marxist Roots and Anti-American Sentiments**
7. **Legislative and Policy Responses**

Each of these reasons is discussed in detail below.

## 1. Perception of CRT as Divisive and Racist

A significant portion of CRT opposition arises from the belief that CRT promotes division by emphasizing race and group identity over individual merit and universal values. Critics argue that CRT categorizes people into oppressors and oppressed based on race, which they see as a form of reverse racism.

For example, Phil King, a Texas legislator, argues that CRT judges people by group affiliation (skin color, sex, economic status) rather than as individuals, fostering prejudice and discrimination rather than reducing it ([King, 2021](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-i-oppose-critical-race-theory_3960489.html)). This view holds that CRT undermines Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of judging people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.

Similarly, some conservatives view CRT as inherently racist because it allegedly assumes all white people are oppressors and all people of color are victims, which they argue is itself a racist generalization ([Congressional Digest, 2021](https://congressionaldigest.com/pros-and-cons-of-teaching-critical-race-theory/)).

---

## 2. Concerns Over Group Identity and Individualism

Opponents often contend that CRT's focus on racial group identity conflicts with the American ideal of individualism. They argue that emphasizing race as a primary lens for understanding society divides people and diminishes personal responsibility and character.

This concern is echoed in conservative media and political rhetoric, which portrays CRT as promoting identity politics that pit racial groups against each other. For example, some critics claim CRT encourages students to view themselves and others primarily through racial categories, potentially fostering resentment and victimhood rather than unity ([Lattanzi, 2021](https://americanpigeon.com/why-conservatives-are-against-critical-race-theory/)).

---

## 3. Misrepresentation and Political Weaponization

A major factor fueling opposition is the widespread misrepresentation and politicization of CRT. Conservative media and political figures have often conflated CRT with any discussion of race, diversity training, or anti-racist education, regardless of whether these programs explicitly draw from CRT scholarship.

For instance, Fox News and conservative activists have used CRT as a catch-all term to criticize a broad range of diversity and inclusion efforts, often framing them as indoctrination or Marxist ideology ([Geonzon & Davison, 2021](https://www.mediamatters.org/critical-race-theory/numbers-year-conservative-media-fearmongering-over-critical-race-theory)).

Chris Rufo, a prominent conservative activist, admitted to appropriating the CRT label to brand various educational and workplace initiatives to make opposition easier, regardless of their actual content ([Reddit discussion, 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/criticalracetheory/comments/)).

This misrepresentation creates confusion and fear, leading many to oppose CRT based on inaccurate or exaggerated claims.

---

## 4. Fear of Indoctrination and Impact on Children

Many parents and educators express concern that CRT or related equity programs indoctrinate children with divisive or negative views about race and history. They worry that children, especially white children, are being taught to feel guilt or shame based on their race or to adopt a victim or oppressor identity.

For example, some conservative lawmakers and parents argue that CRT teaches children that the United States is fundamentally racist and that white people are inherently privileged or oppressive, which they see as harmful and demoralizing ([Congressional Digest, 2021](https://congressionaldigest.com/pros-and-cons-of-teaching-critical-race-theory/)).

Instances such as the controversy over equity trainings in Loudoun County, Virginia, and the San Francisco school board's handling of admissions policies have intensified fears about CRT's influence in schools ([Kang, 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/critical-race-theory.html)).

---

## 5. Disagreement Over Historical Interpretation and National Identity

Opposition to CRT also stems from differing views on American history and identity. Critics reject the narrative that the United States was founded on racism or that systemic racism is foundational to American institutions.

Phil King, for example, disputes claims from the 1619 Project that the American Revolution aimed to protect slavery, emphasizing America's legal progress against racial discrimination ([King, 2021](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-i-oppose-critical-race-theory_3960489.html)).

Some opponents view CRT as unpatriotic or anti-American, arguing that it undermines national unity and pride by focusing excessively on racial grievances and historical injustices ([Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/07)).

---

## 6. Concerns About Marxist Roots and Anti-American Sentiments

Several critics link CRT to Marxism, claiming it promotes a Marxist worldview that emphasizes class struggle and power dynamics, but through the lens of race. This association fuels fears that CRT is part of a broader left-wing agenda to destabilize American society.

Phil King explicitly states that CRT is rooted in Marxism rather than constitutional principles protecting individual rights ([King, 2021](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-i-oppose-critical-race-theory_3960489.html)).

This framing resonates with conservative constituencies wary of socialist or Marxist ideologies, especially in the context of broader culture wars.

---

## 7. Legislative and Policy Responses

In response to these concerns, multiple states have enacted or proposed legislation banning CRT or related concepts in public schools. As of mid-2021, states including Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, New Hampshire, Arizona, and South Carolina have passed or considered laws restricting CRT teaching ([Congressional Digest, 2021](https://congressionaldigest.com/pros-and-cons-of-teaching-critical-race-theory/); [Sawchuk, 2021](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/07)).

These laws often use vague language, making it unclear what content is prohibited, leading to fears of a chilling effect on educators and self-censorship.

## Conclusion and Opinion

The opposition to Critical Race Theory is deeply rooted in differing worldviews about race, history, education, and national identity. While CRT as an academic framework aims to critically analyze systemic racism and promote equity, its popular representation has been distorted and politicized, fueling fears of division, indoctrination, and anti-Americanism.

Many opponents express legitimate concerns about the potential for CRT-related teachings to emphasize group identity over individual character, to portray the nation negatively, and to influence children in ways they find objectionable. However, much of the opposition is also based on misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations of CRT‚Äôs academic content and goals.

Given the complexity of the issues, it is crucial for educators, policymakers, and communities to engage in transparent, nuanced discussions about race, history, and education. Blanket bans or politicized attacks on CRT risk silencing important conversations about systemic inequities and may hinder efforts toward a more equitable society.

In my assessment, while CRT‚Äôs academic rigor and critical perspectives are valuable for understanding systemic racism, its application in K-12 education should be carefully contextualized, age-appropriate, and balanced with multiple perspectives. Opposition rooted in misinformation should be addressed through education and dialogue rather than censorship.
