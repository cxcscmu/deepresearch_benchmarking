# Report: When Do Children Normally Form Their Own Views?

## Introduction

Understanding when children form their own views is a critical question in developmental psychology, education, and parenting. The formation of a child's views encompasses their self-concept, moral compass, identity, and worldview. These views influence how children perceive themselves, relate to others, and navigate social environments. This report synthesizes current research and theories on the developmental timeline and processes by which children construct their own views, drawing on recent and authoritative sources to provide a comprehensive and evidence-based answer.

## Early Foundations of Self-Concept and Views

Children are born without a predefined sense of self or moral understanding. The construction of views begins in infancy and early toddlerhood, where children start to recognize themselves and differentiate their experiences from others.

### Self-Recognition and Early Self-Concept

Research indicates that by 15 to 18 months, toddlers begin to recognize themselves in mirrors, an early indicator of self-awareness and the beginning of self-concept formation. For example, the classic "red dot test" shows that toddlers at this age will touch their own nose when they see a red dot on their reflection, indicating recognition of self as distinct from others (Myers, 2014). Additionally, toddlers conceptualize the self as unique, stable over time, and located within the body, particularly the head or behind the eyes (Starmans, University of Toronto).

### Cognitive Ability for Self-Worth

Even toddlers demonstrate the cognitive ability to form self-worth, reflecting early satisfaction or dissatisfaction with themselves as individuals (Cimpian, New York University). This early self-evaluation lays the groundwork for later self-esteem and identity development.

## Social Relationships as a Crucial Factor

Children's views are deeply influenced by social relationships, including interactions with parents, peers, and cultural contexts.

### Parental Influence

Warm, supportive parenting that shows interest and shares joy with the child fosters higher self-esteem and a positive self-concept. Conversely, excessive or inflated praise can lead to lower self-esteem and even narcissistic tendencies, as children may develop unrealistic standards and fear failure (Brummelman, University of Amsterdam; Harris, University of California).

### Peer and Cultural Influences

As children grow, peers and cultural values increasingly shape their self-concept and moral views. Social comparisons and feedback from others contribute to individual differences in how children see themselves, including beliefs about their abilities and social standing.

## Developmental Stages of Moral and Social Understanding

Children's moral compass and views of right and wrong develop progressively, influenced by cognitive maturation and social learning.

| Age Range | Developmental Milestone | Description |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Birth to 2 years | Early empathy and habit formation | Infants begin to show empathy-based responses and form habits that underlie moral behavior (Batema, 2017). |
| 3 to 5 years (Preschool) | Distinction between moral issues and social conventions | Children start understanding rules as absolute and authority-based (Piaget's heteronomous morality), but moral reasoning is concrete and rule-focused (Kohlberg's preconventional stage). |
| 6 to 9 years (Middle Childhood) | More abstract moral reasoning | Children begin to consider fairness, motives, and reciprocal relationships, moving towards autonomous morality (Piaget) and ideal reciprocity (Kohlberg). |
| 10 to 12 years | Development of self-directed moral reasoning | Children understand flexible rules and negotiate moral decisions, considering others' perspectives and cultural variations. |

This progression shows that while moral behavior and some understanding begin in infancy, the formation of a nuanced moral compass and self-directed views typically emerge in middle childhood and early adolescence (Batema, 2017; Piaget; Kohlberg).

## Formation of Views: A Social-Developmental Perspective

The University of Amsterdam's research emphasizes that children construct their views based on:

- **Social relationships:** Warmth and feedback from parents and peers.
- **Feedback and praise:** Balanced encouragement fosters growth mindsets.
- **Social comparisons:** Understanding one's abilities relative to others.
- **Cultural values:** Endorsement of societal norms and expectations.

Children's self-concept is not static but evolves through ongoing social interactions and cognitive development. The development of a growth mindset, encouraged by praising effort rather than innate ability, helps children see their abilities as malleable and fosters resilience (Haimovitz & Dweck, Stanford University).

## When Do Children Normally Form Their Own Views?

### Early Childhood (2-5 years)

- Children begin to recognize themselves and form basic self-concepts.
- Moral understanding is concrete and rule-based.
- Views are heavily shaped by parental modeling and direct feedback.
- Children start to differentiate between self and others but have limited perspective-taking abilities.

### Middle Childhood (6-12 years)

- Self-concept becomes more realistic and differentiated.
- Children understand strengths and weaknesses.
- Moral reasoning becomes more abstract and flexible.
- Peer influence and social comparison become more significant.
- Children develop a more autonomous sense of morality and identity.

### Adolescence (13+ years)

- Views become more self-directed and abstract.
- Increased capacity for perspective-taking and critical thinking.
- Identity exploration intensifies, including cultural, gender, and moral identities.
- Social and cultural influences continue but are integrated with personal beliefs.

### Summary Table: Developmental Timeline of View Formation

| Developmental Period | Key Developments in View Formation | Influences |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Infancy to Toddler (0-2 yrs) | Self-recognition, basic self-concept, early empathy | Parental interaction, bodily awareness |
| Early Childhood (3-5 yrs) | Concrete self-concept, rule-based morality | Parental feedback, authority figures, initial peer interaction |
| Middle Childhood (6-12 yrs) | Realistic self-concept, abstract moral reasoning, social comparison | Peers, culture, parental warmth, feedback style |
| Adolescence (13+ yrs) | Autonomous views, identity exploration, complex moral reasoning | Broader social context, personal reflection |

## Opinion and Interpretation

Based on the reviewed evidence, children start forming rudimentary views of themselves and the world in toddlerhood, but these views are simplistic and heavily dependent on immediate social context and parental input. The formation of more stable, realistic, and autonomous views occurs primarily during middle childhood (ages 6-12), when cognitive abilities mature to allow abstract thinking, perspective-taking, and self-reflection.

Importantly, the social environment plays a pivotal role throughout this process. Warm, supportive relationships foster healthy self-esteem and realistic self-concepts, while excessive or inflated praise can hinder authentic self-view development. Furthermore, fostering a growth mindset through effort-based encouragement during these formative years can positively influence children's views about their abilities and potential.

Therefore, while children begin to form their own views early, the critical period for the development of stable and autonomous views is middle childhood, supported by ongoing social interactions and cognitive growth.

## Practical Implications

- **For Parents:** Provide warm, genuine support and praise effort rather than innate ability to foster healthy self-esteem and growth mindset.
- **For Educators:** Offer constructive feedback that helps children understand their strengths and areas for improvement, promoting realistic self-concepts.
- **For Caregivers:** Model moral behavior consistently and engage children in discussions about moral decisions to support moral development.
- **For Policy Makers:** Support programs that encourage positive parent-child interactions and social-emotional learning in schools.

## Conclusion

Children's formation of their own views is a gradual, socially embedded process beginning in infancy and extending through adolescence. Early self-recognition and basic self-concept emerge by toddlerhood, but the development of realistic, autonomous views occurs mainly during middle childhood, influenced by social relationships, feedback, cultural values, and cognitive maturation. Understanding this timeline can guide caregivers and educators in supporting children's healthy development of self and moral understanding.
