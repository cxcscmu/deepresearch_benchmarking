## Introduction

Simone Biles, widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time, has faced extraordinary pressures stemming from her athletic success and global fame. Her journey, especially highlighted during and after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has brought mental health challenges into the spotlight, illustrating the complex relationship between elite performance, public scrutiny, and personal well-being. This report examines how Simone Biles has coped with the pressures of fame by analyzing her mental health strategies, public disclosures, and the tools she employs to maintain balance in her life. The analysis draws from multiple reliable sources, focusing on Biles' candid discussions, therapeutic approaches, and the influence of self-help philosophies on her mindset.

## The Context of Pressure and Fame

Simone Biles’ fame is rooted in her unparalleled achievements: a four-time Olympic gold medalist with multiple world championship titles. Such success brings immense public expectations and scrutiny. During the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Biles withdrew from several events citing mental health concerns, a decision that sparked widespread discussion about the pressures faced by elite athletes. She described feeling "like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders at times," revealing the intense emotional burden fame can impose ([Scipioni, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/simone-biles-reveals-the-book-that-changed-her-life.html)).

## Mental Health Challenges and Public Response

Biles’ withdrawal from the team gymnastics finals and individual events due to a mental health condition known as the "twisties"—a disorienting loss of air awareness—highlighted the physical and psychological risks athletes face under pressure. She openly acknowledged experiencing anxiety and the difficulty of managing emotions in high-stress environments, especially at the Olympics ([Stieg, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/simone-biles-withdrew-from-olympics-to-focus-on-mental-health.html)).

Her decision was met with both support and criticism, but Biles remained unfazed by detractors, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing mental well-being over external approval. She stated, "I have to do what's right for me and focus on my mental health and not jeopardize my health and well-being" ([Stieg, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/simone-biles-withdrew-from-olympics-to-focus-on-mental-health.html)).

## Strategies Simone Biles Uses to Cope with Fame and Pressure

### 1. Embracing a New Mindset: The Influence of "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"

One of the pivotal influences on Biles' approach to handling criticism and pressure is the 2016 self-help book *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck* by Mark Manson. The book advocates focusing only on what aligns with personal values and goals, dismissing trivial concerns. Biles credits this philosophy with helping her reclaim energy and set boundaries, even at the cost of some stardom.

| Author                        | Mark Manson                                                                                      |
| Core Philosophy               | Care only about things aligned with personal values; reject excessive positivity                  |
| Impact on Biles               | Helped her disregard unwanted criticism and perfectionism; focus on mental well-being first      |
| Public Reaction               | Teammates laughed at her nonchalance; Biles encouraged them to read the book                     |

Biles explained, "It does mean sacrificing some of that stardom, but at the end of the day, you can't have it all. And if you take care of your mental well-being first, the rest will fall into place" ([Scipioni, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/simone-biles-reveals-the-book-that-changed-her-life.html)).

### 2. Therapy and Professional Mental Health Support

Biles has been open about her use of talk therapy and medication to manage anxiety. Initially resistant to therapy, she grew to appreciate its benefits, crediting her therapist with helping her develop coping mechanisms and emotional processing skills.

A key tool recommended by her therapist is the "worry journal," where Biles writes down her worries and designates a specific time (12 to 1 p.m.) to address them. This practice helps compartmentalize anxiety and reduces its impact throughout the day.

| Coping Tool       | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Talk Therapy      | Regular sessions with a therapist to discuss and manage mental health                               |
| Worry Journal    | Writing worries down and scheduling time to focus on them, limiting anxiety's intrusion             |
| Medication       | Use of anxiety medication as needed, especially during periods of heightened stress                  |

Biles emphasized, "I do keep close contact with my therapist, I love that. And it's super exciting so hopefully more people are open to going to therapy and knowing that they’re there for you and not to harm you" ([Weg, 2021](https://people.com/sports/simone-biles-shares-the-one-tool-she-uses-to-help-manage-her-anxiety/)).

### 3. Setting Boundaries and Prioritizing Mental Health

Biles has acknowledged the necessity of setting boundaries to protect her mental health, even if it means sacrificing some aspects of fame. She recognizes that the spotlight can be overwhelming and that self-care must come first.

Leah Lagos, a sport and performance psychologist, supports this approach, noting that recognizing personal signs of stress and having a "toolkit" for managing on-demand stress is vital. Biles’ decision to withdraw from competition was an example of this self-awareness and boundary-setting.

### 4. Social Support and Team Dynamics

Biles credits her teammates and support network for respecting her decisions and providing emotional support. She highlighted the importance of having "the correct people around me" who took her withdrawal seriously and supported her mental health needs.

According to Lagos, social support is critical for athletes to navigate pressure and stress, and Biles’ experience exemplifies this principle.

### 5. Advocating for Mental Health Awareness

Beyond personal coping, Biles has used her platform to advocate for mental health awareness, hoping to be "a voice for the voiceless." She encourages others to seek help and normalizes therapy, aiming to reduce stigma.

Her acceptance of the Child Mind Institute’s inaugural Trailblazer Award underscores her role as a mental health advocate and highlights her influence in encouraging open conversations about mental well-being ([Weg, 2021](https://people.com/sports/simone-biles-shares-the-one-tool-she-uses-to-help-manage-her-anxiety/)).

## Impact and Broader Significance

Simone Biles’ candidness about mental health challenges and her proactive coping strategies have had a significant impact on public discourse around athlete well-being. Her approach challenges traditional notions of toughness in sports and underscores the importance of mental health as integral to overall performance and life satisfaction.

Her story also illustrates the complexity of fame: while it brings opportunities and recognition, it also imposes unique psychological burdens. Biles’ strategies—embracing selective caring, therapy, boundary-setting, social support, and advocacy—offer a comprehensive model for managing these pressures.
