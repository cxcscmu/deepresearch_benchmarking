This report examines how Biles has coped with the multifaceted pressures of fame, drawing on her public statements, interviews, and expert commentary from 2021.

## Introduction

Simone Biles’ rise to global stardom brought immense expectations, both from the public and herself. Her unprecedented success—seven Olympic medals and multiple world championships—placed her under intense scrutiny. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics marked a turning point when Biles withdrew from several events citing mental health concerns, a decision that sparked worldwide conversations about athlete well-being and the pressures of fame.

## The Pressures of Fame and Mental Health Challenges

Biles has openly discussed the heavy burden she felt, describing it as "the weight of the world on my shoulders" during the Tokyo Olympics ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021668310/mental-health-simone-biles-olympics)). The pressure to perform flawlessly, compounded by the global spotlight and the pandemic’s impact on sports, contributed to her experiencing the "twisties"—a dangerous mental block affecting gymnasts' spatial awareness during aerial maneuvers. This condition not only jeopardized her physical safety but also her mental well-being.

The stigma around mental health initially made Biles reluctant to seek help. She recounted her first therapy session where she was silent, feeling she was "not crazy" and did not need therapy ([Prevention, 2021](https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a36753461/simone-biles-therapy-mental-health/)). This highlights the internal conflict many face when confronting mental health issues, especially in high-performance environments.

## Coping Mechanisms and Therapeutic Tools

### Therapy and Mental Health Support

Biles credits therapy as a cornerstone of her coping strategy. Despite initial resistance, she now embraces therapy as a "safe space" to process emotions and challenges, including trauma from past sexual abuse by USA Gymnastics personnel ([Prevention, 2021](https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a36753461/simone-biles-therapy-mental-health/)). Her therapist has helped her develop personalized tools to manage anxiety and maintain mental health.

### The Worry Journal Technique

One specific tool Biles uses, recommended by her therapist, is a "worry journal." She dedicates a set time daily (12 to 1 p.m.) to write down her worries and consciously confines her anxiety to that period. This practice allows her to compartmentalize stress and reduces its impact throughout the day, often leading to forgetting the worries by the end of the hour ([People, 2021](https://people.com/sports/simone-biles-tool-she-uses-to-help-combat-anxiety/)).

### Support Systems

Biles emphasizes the importance of a robust support network, including family, coaches, and her boyfriend. She advocates for using every available outlet and support system, underscoring that humans often resist asking for help but sometimes cannot manage alone ([Olympics.com, 2021](https://olympics.com/en/news/simone-biles-exclusive-mental-health-advice-future)).

## Public Advocacy and Impact

Biles’ decision to prioritize her mental health at the Tokyo Olympics was groundbreaking. It challenged the prevailing culture in elite sports that often valorizes pushing through pain and mental distress. Her openness has made her a mental health advocate, inspiring others to speak up and seek help.

### Trailblazer Award and Advocacy

In 2021, Biles received the inaugural Trailblazer Award from the Child Mind Institute, recognizing her courage in using her platform to promote mental health awareness. She expressed hope to be "a voice for the voiceless" and to encourage young athletes and others to prioritize mental well-being ([People, 2021](https://people.com/sports/simone-biles-tool-she-uses-to-help-combat-anxiety/)).

### Changing the Narrative Around Mental Health in Sports

Biles’ actions have contributed to a broader acceptance of mental health struggles among athletes. Her candidness has helped normalize therapy and mental health care, reducing stigma and encouraging others to seek support without shame ([Prevention, 2021](https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a38291758/simone-biles-shares-tool-to-manage-anxiety/)).

---

## Personal Growth and Outlook

Biles describes her mental health journey as transformative. She has shifted from compartmentalizing trauma and stress to actively processing emotions with professional help. This shift has allowed her to redefine happiness as "just waking up and having a positive outlook on life," appreciating the blessing of each new day ([People, 2021](https://people.com/sports/simone-biles-tool-she-uses-to-help-combat-anxiety/)).

She acknowledges that mental health is an ongoing process and that different methods work for different people. Her approach is grounded in self-compassion and realistic expectations, which contrasts with the perfectionism often demanded in elite sports ([Olympics.com, 2021](https://olympics.com/en/news/simone-biles-exclusive-mental-health-advice-future)).

## The Broader Context: Mental Health Awareness in Elite Athletics

Biles’ experience is part of a larger movement among high-profile athletes, including tennis star Naomi Osaka, who have publicly prioritized mental health. Their actions highlight the unique stresses athletes face and the necessity of systemic support for mental well-being in sports ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/28/1021668310/mental-health-simone-biles-olympics)).

Experts emphasize that recognizing personal signs of distress—such as panic attacks, sleep disturbances, and difficulty concentrating—is crucial. Biles’ awareness of her body and mind allowed her to take a necessary break, setting an example for others to follow ([CNBC, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/simone-biles-focusing-on-mental-health-how-to-tell-if-you-need-a-break.html)).

## Conclusion

Simone Biles’ approach to coping with the pressures of fame is multifaceted and deeply personal. Her journey from silent resistance to therapy to becoming a vocal mental health advocate illustrates a significant evolution in how elite athletes can manage psychological stress. By embracing therapy, developing practical tools like the worry journal, and leaning on her support system, Biles has not only safeguarded her own mental health but also paved the way for broader cultural change.

Her courage in prioritizing mental health over competition at the Tokyo Olympics challenged traditional norms in sports and sparked a global conversation about athlete well-being. Biles’ story underscores the importance of individualized mental health care, the power of vulnerability, and the need for systemic support in high-pressure environments.

In my assessment, Simone Biles exemplifies a modern athlete who balances excellence with self-care, demonstrating that true strength includes acknowledging and addressing mental health challenges. Her example is instructive for athletes, coaches, and society at large in fostering environments where mental health is valued equally with physical performance.
