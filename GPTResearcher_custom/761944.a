# Detailed Report on How Corruption is Shown in *Animal Farm*

## Introduction

George Orwell’s *Animal Farm* is a seminal allegorical novella that critiques the corrupting influence of power, particularly in the context of revolutionary movements. Written as a satirical reflection of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent rise of totalitarianism under Joseph Stalin, the novella explores how initially idealistic visions of equality and justice can deteriorate into oppressive regimes marked by corruption and betrayal. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how corruption is depicted in *Animal Farm*, drawing on expert interpretations, thematic analyses, and symbolic elements presented in the text and supported by scholarly commentary.

## Overview of Corruption in *Animal Farm*

Corruption in *Animal Farm* is primarily portrayed through the gradual transformation of the pigs, who assume leadership roles after the animals overthrow their human owner, Mr. Jones. Initially, the revolution is motivated by ideals of equality and shared prosperity, encapsulated in the Seven Commandments of Animalism. However, as the pigs consolidate power, they begin to manipulate these principles to serve their own interests, ultimately becoming indistinguishable from the humans they replaced.

## Detailed Analysis of Corruption in *Animal Farm*

### 1. Corruption Through Physical Intimidation and Suppression

One of the earliest signs of corruption is Napoleon’s use of force to eliminate opposition. The expulsion of Snowball, a pig who initially shared leadership, is executed through Napoleon’s trained dogs, representing a brutal suppression of dissent. This act symbolizes the violent purging of political rivals seen in totalitarian regimes, particularly Stalin’s purges in Soviet Russia.

Napoleon’s dogs also serve as enforcers of his rule, instilling fear among the animals to prevent rebellion or questioning of authority. This physical intimidation is a direct manifestation of how power can corrupt by fostering an environment where fear replaces freedom.

### 2. Psychological Manipulation and Propaganda

The pigs, particularly Squealer, use sophisticated rhetoric and propaganda to manipulate the other animals. Despite the pigs’ clear self-interest in consuming the farm’s milk and apples, Squealer convinces the animals that these privileges are necessary for the pigs’ health as the “brains” of the farm. This manipulation exploits the animals’ lack of education and critical thinking skills.

Moreover, the pigs frequently revise facts and history to maintain control. For example, the animals’ memories of the original Seven Commandments are altered to justify the pigs’ increasingly privileged lifestyle. This manipulation of truth is a hallmark of corrupt regimes, where controlling information is essential to maintaining power.

### 3. Ideological Corruption: The Erosion of Animalism

The initial revolutionary ideology, Animalism, is based on principles of equality and collective welfare. However, as the pigs gain power, they systematically alter these principles to legitimize their dominance.

The Seven Commandments, originally designed to ensure equality, are progressively rewritten:

| Original Commandment                          | Altered Commandment                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| No animal shall sleep in a bed                | No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets              |
| No animal shall drink alcohol                 | No animal shall drink alcohol to excess                 |
| No animal shall kill any other animal         | No animal shall kill any other animal without cause     |
| All animals are equal                          | All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others |

These changes reflect the pigs’ abandonment of revolutionary ideals in favor of self-serving policies, illustrating how corruption can distort ideology to maintain hierarchical power structures.

### 4. The Pigs’ Increasing Resemblance to Humans

The pigs’ transformation into the very oppressors they once overthrew is a powerful symbol of corruption. They begin adopting human habits such as wearing clothes, drinking alcohol, and engaging in trade with neighboring farms. By the novella’s end, the animals can no longer distinguish between pigs and humans, underscoring the complete moral decay of the leadership.

This metamorphosis highlights Orwell’s message that power, when unchecked, inevitably leads to corruption and tyranny, regardless of the initial intentions.

## Symbolism and Historical Parallels

Orwell’s *Animal Farm* serves as an allegory for the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism. The pigs represent the Bolshevik leaders, with Napoleon symbolizing Stalin. The corruption depicted in the novella mirrors the historical corruption of communist ideals in the Soviet Union.

| Character/Element | Symbolic Representation                      | Historical Parallel                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Napoleon          | Joseph Stalin                               | Stalin’s dictatorship and purges                    |
| Snowball          | Leon Trotsky                                | Trotsky’s exile and opposition to Stalin            |
| Squealer          | Soviet propaganda machine                   | State-controlled media and misinformation           |
| Seven Commandments | Communist Manifesto ideals                  | Soviet constitution and laws corrupted over time   |
| Pigs’ transformation | Corruption of revolutionary leaders       | Soviet leadership adopting oppressive, bourgeois traits |

This allegorical framework deepens the understanding of corruption in *Animal Farm* as not merely a fictional theme but a critique of real-world political dynamics.

## Impact of Corruption on the Farm’s Inhabitants

The corruption of leadership has severe consequences for the other animals. While the pigs enjoy privileges, the majority of the animals suffer from overwork, hunger, and repression. The loyal horse Boxer epitomizes this tragedy; his blind faith in the leadership leads to his exploitation and eventual betrayal when he is sold to the knacker’s for slaughter.

The animals’ inability to recognize or challenge the corruption is facilitated by their limited education and the pigs’ control over information. This dynamic illustrates how corruption is sustained not only by the corrupt rulers but also by the systemic suppression of dissent and critical awareness.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Corruption in *Animal Farm* is portrayed as an inevitable consequence of power when concentrated in the hands of a few without accountability. Orwell meticulously demonstrates through physical intimidation, psychological manipulation, ideological distortion, and symbolic transformation how the pigs betray the revolution’s founding principles.

The novella serves as a timeless warning about the dangers of absolute power and the fragility of idealistic movements in the face of human nature’s propensity for self-interest and greed. The detailed depiction of corruption in *Animal Farm* is not only a critique of the Soviet Union but also a universal commentary on political power and its potential to corrupt.

In my assessment, Orwell’s portrayal is both profound and prescient. It emphasizes the necessity of vigilance, transparency, and education in any society to prevent the corruption of power. The novella’s enduring relevance underscores the importance of these lessons in contemporary political discourse.
