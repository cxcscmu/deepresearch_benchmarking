# Corruption in George Orwell's *Animal Farm*: A Detailed Analysis

George Orwell's *Animal Farm* is a seminal allegorical novella that explores the theme of corruption through the lens of a farm animal rebellion that parallels the Russian Revolution of 1917. The narrative vividly depicts how power, initially sought for liberation and equality, gradually becomes a tool for oppression and deceit. This report presents an in-depth analysis of how corruption is portrayed in *Animal Farm*, drawing on multiple scholarly sources and critical interpretations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, manifestations, and consequences of corruption within the story.

## Introduction

*Animal Farm* serves as a critique of totalitarian regimes, particularly Stalinist Russia, illustrating how revolutionary ideals can be subverted by those who seek power for personal gain. Corruption in the novel is multifaceted, encompassing the betrayal of ideological principles, manipulation of language and truth, and the transformation of leadership into tyranny. This report examines these dimensions in detail, supported by evidence from the text and scholarly commentary.

## The Central Theme of Corruption

### Corruption of Ideals

At the heart of *Animal Farm* lies the corruption of revolutionary ideals. Old Major’s vision of Animalism embodies principles of equality, justice, and collective welfare. Initially, the animals unite under these ideals to overthrow Mr. Jones, the oppressive human farmer. However, as the pigs—particularly Napoleon—assume leadership, these ideals are systematically eroded.

Old Major’s original commandments, which advocate for equality and fairness, are progressively altered to justify the pigs’ increasing privileges and authoritarian control. The famous maxim "All animals are equal" is cynically revised to "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others," symbolizing the complete betrayal of the revolution’s foundational principles ([eNotes Editorial Team, n.d.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-are-power-and-corruption-shown-in-animal-farm-354194)).

### Corruption of Power and Leadership

The narrative demonstrates the adage, "Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely," through the pigs’ transformation from revolutionary leaders to despotic rulers. Napoleon’s rise to power is marked by the use of physical intimidation (e.g., employing dogs to exile Snowball and suppress dissent) and psychological manipulation (e.g., spreading fear of Mr. Jones’s return).

Napoleon and his inner circle exploit their intellectual superiority and control over information to consolidate power. They claim privileges such as better food and living conditions, which starkly contrast with the hardships endured by the other animals. This disparity highlights the emergence of a new ruling class, mirroring the human oppressors they initially overthrew ([Adam Worcester, Certified Educator, n.d.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-are-power-and-corruption-shown-in-animal-farm-354194)).

## Mechanisms of Corruption

### Manipulation of Language and Propaganda

One of the most insidious forms of corruption in *Animal Farm* is the manipulation of language. Squealer, the pigs’ Minister of Propaganda, exemplifies this through his rhetorical skills, which he uses to distort truth and justify the pigs’ actions.

Squealer’s speeches often employ euphemisms and false logic to placate the animals and suppress dissent. For example, he convinces the animals that Napoleon’s accumulation of privileges is necessary for their collective good, despite clear evidence to the contrary. This manipulation extends to the revision of the Seven Commandments, which are altered to legitimize the pigs’ increasingly human-like behaviors, such as drinking alcohol and engaging in trade with humans ([eNotes Editorial Team, n.d.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-is-the-main-theme-in-animal-farm-by-george-187317)).

### Revision of History and Facts

The pigs’ control over information enables them to rewrite history and facts to suit their agenda. Snowball, once a prominent leader, is demonized as a traitor and scapegoat for all problems on the farm. This rewriting of history serves to consolidate Napoleon’s authority and eliminate opposition.

The gradual alteration of the Seven Commandments on the barn wall symbolizes this manipulation. Initially, these commandments represent the revolution’s ethical code, but by the end, they are reduced to a single, contradictory statement that justifies inequality and oppression ([Alec Cranford, Certified Educator, n.d.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-are-power-and-corruption-shown-in-animal-farm-354194)).

## Manifestations of Corruption

### Emergence of a New Tyranny

The pigs’ corruption culminates in their complete transformation into the very oppressors they replaced. By the novella’s end, the pigs walk on two legs, wear clothes, and engage in trade with humans, blurring the line between oppressor and oppressed.

This transformation is emblematic of the cyclical nature of power and corruption. The animals’ initial hope for a society free of human exploitation is replaced by a regime arguably more ruthless than Mr. Jones’s. The final scene, where pigs and humans dine together, underscores the futility of the revolution and the pervasiveness of corruption ([mwestwood, M.A., Certified Educator, n.d.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-is-leadership-shown-throughout-the-story-579710)).

### Psychological and Physical Intimidation

Napoleon’s use of force and fear to maintain control exemplifies corruption’s coercive dimension. The dogs, trained as enforcers, intimidate and eliminate opposition, including the exile of Snowball and the execution of dissenting animals.

This use of violence reflects the darker side of power, where corruption is maintained not only through deception but also through terror. The animals’ fear inhibits resistance and enables the pigs to entrench their authority ([Adam Worcester, Certified Educator, n.d.](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-are-power-and-corruption-shown-in-animal-farm-354194)).

## Impact and Consequences of Corruption

### Betrayal of the Working Class

The hardworking animals, especially Boxer the horse, symbolize the exploited proletariat. Boxer’s blind loyalty and tireless labor are ultimately betrayed when he is sold to the knacker for slaughter once he is no longer useful.

This betrayal highlights the human cost of corruption and the exploitation inherent in totalitarian regimes. The animals’ suffering contrasts sharply with the pigs’ indulgence, illustrating the deep social inequalities that arise from corrupt leadership ([Internet Public Library, n.d.](https://www.ipl.org/essay/Theme-Of-Corruption-In-Animal-Farm-P348QJNNPCED6)).

### Erosion of Social and Moral Order

Corruption in *Animal Farm* leads to the erosion of social cohesion and moral values. The original commandments, which provided a moral framework, are subverted, and the animals become disillusioned and confused.

The slogan "Four legs good, two legs bad" is replaced by "Four legs good, two legs better," reflecting the collapse of the revolution’s ethical foundation. This moral decay is a direct consequence of the pigs’ manipulation and abuse of power ([Litcharts, n.d.](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/animal-farm/themes/revolution-and-corruption)).

## Conclusion

Corruption in *Animal Farm* is portrayed as an inevitable consequence of the consolidation of power, especially when unchecked by accountability or moral constraints. Orwell’s novella powerfully illustrates how noble ideals can be subverted through manipulation, deceit, and coercion, leading to the emergence of a new oppressive regime indistinguishable from the one it replaced.

The detailed mechanisms of corruption—ranging from propaganda and language manipulation to physical intimidation and revision of history—demonstrate the multifaceted nature of power’s corrupting influence. The consequences are dire: betrayal of the working class, erosion of social and moral order, and the perpetuation of tyranny.

This analysis underscores Orwell’s warning about the dangers of totalitarianism and the importance of vigilance in safeguarding democratic and egalitarian principles.
