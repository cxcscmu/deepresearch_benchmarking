This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based explanation of how global warming occurs, integrating scientific principles, chemical reactions, and the role of anthropogenic and natural factors. The report also highlights the significance of deforestation and fossil fuel combustion in contributing to global warming, supported by quantitative data and authoritative sources.

## The Greenhouse Effect: The Fundamental Mechanism

The greenhouse effect is the primary physical mechanism behind global warming. It involves the trapping of heat in Earth’s atmosphere by greenhouse gases (GHGs), which absorb and re-radiate infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. Without this natural process, Earth’s average temperature would be approximately -18°C (0°F), making it inhospitable for most life forms. However, human activities have intensified this effect, leading to a rise in global temperatures.

### How the Greenhouse Effect Works

Solar radiation reaches Earth, with about 30% reflected back into space by clouds, dust, and atmospheric particles. The remaining 70% is absorbed by the Earth's surface, warming it. The Earth then emits this energy as infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), water vapor, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) absorb much of this infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space. This trapped energy is reradiated in all directions, warming the atmosphere and surface (U.S. Forest Service, 2024; National Geographic Society, 2024).

## Key Greenhouse Gases and Their Sources

### Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)

CO₂ is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. It is released through natural processes like respiration and volcanic eruptions, but human activities have dramatically increased its concentration. Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO₂ levels have risen by more than 35%, primarily due to burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and deforestation (Simple Wikipedia, 2024; Bartleby, 2024).

### Methane (CH₄) and Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)

Methane and nitrous oxide are potent greenhouse gases with higher heat-trapping capabilities per molecule than CO₂. They are emitted from agriculture, waste management, and industrial activities (Time for Change, 2024).

## Human Activities Driving Global Warming

### Fossil Fuel Combustion

The burning of fossil fuels for energy production is the largest anthropogenic source of CO₂ emissions. Combustion reactions release CO₂ as a byproduct:

\[
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy}
\]

This chemical reaction illustrates how organic carbon (e.g., glucose) reacts with oxygen during combustion, releasing carbon dioxide and energy (Prezi, 2024).

### Deforestation

Trees and vegetation act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO₂ during photosynthesis. Deforestation reduces this capacity and releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere when trees are burned or decay. Tropical deforestation accounts for approximately 10% of global heat-trapping emissions, releasing around 3.0 billion tons of CO₂ annually (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2013). For example, in 1987, the Amazon rainforest lost an area the size of Britain, releasing 500 million tonnes of CO₂ (YPTE, 2018).

## Quantitative Impact of Deforestation on Global Warming

| Factor                         | Data/Estimate                              | Source                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Annual CO₂ emissions from deforestation | ~3.0 billion tons (3.0 Gt) CO₂/year        | Union of Concerned Scientists (2013)    |
| Percentage of global CO₂ emissions from deforestation | ~10% (recent estimate)                    | Union of Concerned Scientists (2013)    |
| Amazon deforestation rate (2017-2018) | 7,900 km² (3,050 sq miles)                | YPTE (2018)                             |
| CO₂ released from 1987 Amazon fires | 500 million tonnes                         | YPTE (2018)                             |

These figures underscore deforestation as a major contributor to greenhouse gas accumulation and global warming.

## Natural Factors Influencing Global Warming

While human activities dominate recent warming trends, natural factors also influence Earth’s climate. These include volcanic eruptions, solar variability, continental drift, and changes in Earth's orbit. However, scientific consensus indicates that natural factors alone cannot explain the rapid temperature increases observed over the past 120 years (U.S. Forest Service, 2024; Hillsdale College, 2024).

## The Role of Photosynthesis and Respiration in Carbon Cycling

Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary processes in the carbon cycle. Plants absorb CO₂ and release oxygen during photosynthesis, while respiration by plants, animals, and microbes consumes oxygen and releases CO₂. Deforestation disrupts this balance by reducing photosynthetic capacity, resulting in a net increase in atmospheric CO₂ (Socratic, 2017).

## Evidence of Global Warming

Empirical data from ice core samples, satellite observations, and atmospheric measurements demonstrate a strong correlation between increased greenhouse gas concentrations and rising global temperatures. For instance, CO₂ levels measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii have reached 50% higher than preindustrial levels (Yahoo News, 2021).

---

## Consequences of Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

The intensified greenhouse effect leads to:

- Increased global average temperatures (currently about 1.2°C higher than preindustrial times)
- Melting glaciers and ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise
- Changes in weather patterns, including more frequent heatwaves, storms, and droughts
- Disruption of ecosystems and biodiversity loss due to habitat destruction and climate stress (Bartleby, 2024; Time for Change, 2024).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of scientific evidence and data, global warming is primarily caused by human activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation are the two leading contributors to this phenomenon. While natural factors do influence climate variability, they cannot account for the rapid warming observed since the Industrial Revolution.

The role of deforestation is particularly significant, as it not only releases large amounts of CO₂ but also diminishes the planet’s capacity to absorb this greenhouse gas. Addressing global warming requires urgent measures to reduce fossil fuel emissions and halt deforestation. These actions are critical for mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and ensuring a sustainable environment for future generations.
