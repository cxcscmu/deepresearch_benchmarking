# Why Are Crude Oil Prices Rising? An In-Depth Analysis

Crude oil prices have experienced significant fluctuations over the past decade, influenced by a complex interplay of supply, demand, geopolitical events, and regulatory changes. Since the early 2020s, crude oil prices have shown a marked upward trajectory, reaching multi-year highs by late 2021 and beyond. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the key factors driving the rise in crude oil prices, drawing on reliable and recent sources to present an objective view.

## 1. Supply Constraints and OPEC+ Production Policies

One of the primary drivers behind rising crude oil prices has been the deliberate supply restraint exercised by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+. In response to the sharp price collapse in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated demand shocks, OPEC+ implemented coordinated production cuts starting in late 2020. These cuts were designed to stabilize the market and support prices ([Ajot, 2021](https://ajot.com/news/crude-oil-prices-increased-in-2021-as-global-crude-oil-demand-outpaced-supply)).

### OPEC Production Cuts and Impact

- OPEC reduced production from approximately 35 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2019 to an expected 32.8 million b/d by 2024, reflecting a long-term strategy to balance the market amid uncertain demand growth ([Capital.com, 2019](https://capital.com/crude-oil-price-forecast)).
- In 2021, OPEC+ maintained output cuts and planned only gradual increases, with modest production rises of 400,000 b/d in December 2021 and further incremental increases in subsequent months ([Invezz, 2021](https://invezz.com/news/2021/11/12/crude-oil-price-prediction-twist-demand-outlook/)).
- Saudi Arabia’s voluntary additional cuts of 1 million b/d between February and April 2021 further tightened supply, with only partial restoration in the following months ([Indian Express, 2021](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-oil-prices-are-rising-and-how-it-will-impact-india-7341460/)).

These supply constraints have directly contributed to upward price pressure by limiting the availability of crude oil in the global market, especially as demand began to recover.

## 2. Demand Recovery Post-COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented collapse in global oil demand in early 2020, with consumption dropping by nearly 30 million b/d in mid-April 2020 ([Capital.com, 2020](https://capital.com/oil-price-analysis-in-may-2020)). However, as vaccination campaigns progressed and economies reopened, demand rebounded strongly:

- By mid-2021, global petroleum demand had outpaced supply growth, contributing to price increases ([Ajot, 2021](https://ajot.com/news/crude-oil-prices-increased-in-2021-as-global-crude-oil-demand-outpaced-supply)).
- Economic recovery in major markets, including the US, Europe, and Asia, has led to increased industrial activity and transportation fuel consumption ([Livemint, 2021](https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/five-reasons-why-global-oil-prices-have-jumped-to-3-year-high-11633953731294.html)).
- The surge in demand has been further amplified by substitute effects, where rising prices of natural gas and coal have pushed consumers, especially in Asia, to increase oil consumption for power generation ([Marca, 2021](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2021/10/24/617520d222601d10078b45ab.html)).

## 3. Geopolitical and Regulatory Factors

### Geopolitical Tensions

Geopolitical risks have historically influenced oil prices by threatening supply stability. Recent years have seen:

- Sanctions on Iran limiting its oil exports and raising concerns about supply disruptions in the Persian Gulf ([CaixaBank Research, 2018](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices)).
- Production challenges in Libya and Venezuela due to political instability and sanctions, reducing global supply capacity ([Capital.com, 2019](https://capital.com/crude-oil-price-forecast)).

### IMO 2020 Regulation

The International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation banning high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) for marine bunker fuel has reshaped the oil products market:

- This regulation forced a shift to low sulfur fuels, altering demand patterns for different crude oil grades and refinery outputs ([Capital.com, 2019](https://capital.com/crude-oil-price-forecast)).
- Compliance challenges and infrastructure adjustments have contributed to market uncertainty and price volatility.

---

## 4. Market Dynamics: Inventories, Infrastructure, and Substitution Effects

### Inventory Levels

Inventory buffers play a critical role in moderating price volatility:

- In early 2017, significant crude oil stockpiles had accumulated, providing a buffer that stabilized prices around $55 per barrel ([CaixaBank Research, 2018](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices)).
- However, as OPEC+ cuts and demand recovery depleted these buffers, markets became more sensitive to supply-demand imbalances, contributing to price increases ([Capital.com, 2019](https://capital.com/crude-oil-price-forecast)).

### Infrastructure Constraints

- US shale oil production, which had been expected to surge and cap prices between $50 and $60 per barrel, has faced bottlenecks and infrastructure constraints, limiting its ability to offset OPEC cuts ([CaixaBank Research, 2018](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices)).
- Weather events such as hurricanes Ida and Nicholas damaged US Gulf of Mexico oil infrastructure, temporarily reducing supply and supporting higher prices ([Marca, 2021](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2021/10/24/617520d222601d10078b45ab.html)).

### Substitution Effects

- Rising prices of natural gas and coal have increased oil demand as a substitute for power generation, particularly in Asia, further tightening the oil market ([Marca, 2021](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2021/10/24/617520d222601d10078b45ab.html)).

---

## 5. Macroeconomic Factors and Currency Effects

### Global Economic Growth

- Stronger-than-expected global GDP growth forecasts have supported higher oil demand projections, underpinning price increases ([CaixaBank Research, 2018](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices)).
- Conversely, periods of economic nationalism and trade tensions have previously dampened demand growth and contributed to price stagnation ([Capital.com, 2019](https://capital.com/crude-oil-price-forecast)).

### US Dollar Strength

- The value of the US dollar inversely affects oil prices, as oil is priced in dollars globally. A weaker dollar tends to support higher oil prices by making oil cheaper for holders of other currencies ([Investopedia, 2022](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102215/4-reasons-why-price-crude-oil-dropped.asp)).

## 7. Conclusion

The rise in crude oil prices since the early 2020s is the result of a multifaceted set of factors, with supply constraints imposed by OPEC+ and allied producers playing a central role. This supply discipline, combined with a robust recovery in global demand following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, has created a market environment characterized by tight supply-demand balances.

Geopolitical tensions and regulatory changes, such as the IMO 2020 fuel standards, have further complicated the supply landscape, while infrastructure limitations and substitution effects have added to upward price pressures. Macroeconomic factors, including global economic growth and currency fluctuations, have also influenced price dynamics.

Overall, the convergence of these factors has led to sustained increases in crude oil prices, reaching levels not seen since the mid-2010s. While some volatility remains due to ongoing uncertainties, the fundamental market drivers suggest that prices are likely to remain elevated in the near to medium term, barring significant geopolitical disruptions or demand shocks.
