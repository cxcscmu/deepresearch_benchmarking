# To What Extent Do Conservatives Agree on Society? — A Comprehensive Analysis

Conservatism, as a political ideology, is characterized by a commitment to tradition, social order, and skepticism towards radical change. However, the extent to which conservatives agree on their view of society is a complex question, given the diversity of strands within conservatism. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based analysis of the unity and divisions among conservatives regarding their conception of society. Drawing on multiple academic and educational sources, the report explores key themes such as hierarchy, organic society, individualism, social change, and the role of the state, with a focus on the distinctions between Traditional Conservatism, One Nation Conservatism, and the New Right.

## Introduction: Diversity Within Conservatism

It is important to recognize at the outset that conservatism is not monolithic. There are several strands, including Traditional or Paternalistic Conservatism, One Nation Conservatism, and the New Right (which itself includes neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism). These strands differ significantly in their views on society, making complete unity unlikely. Most conservatives share a belief in tradition, community, and the prevention of drastic social change, but they diverge on issues such as hierarchy, the nature of society, and the role of the individual ([Simran Gill, 2022](https://qwivy.com/blog/a-conservatism-essay-to-what-extent-are-conservatives-united-in-their-view-of-society)).

## Core Areas of Agreement and Disagreement

### 1. The Concept of Society: Organic vs. Atomistic

**Traditional and One Nation Conservatives** generally adopt an **organic view of society**, seeing it as a living organism where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They emphasize social bonds, community, and the interdependence of individuals within society. This view holds that society has evolved gradually and should be preserved, respecting accumulated traditions and institutions ([Bartleby, n.d.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Traditional-Conservatism-and-New-Right-PK6ZMFJCMHA)).

In contrast, the **New Right**, particularly the neo-liberal strand, rejects the idea of an organic society. Neo-liberals view individuals as **atomistic**, autonomous agents primarily responsible for their own success or failure. They emphasize negative freedom and individualism, downplaying social bonds and hierarchical structures unless they serve economic efficiency or individual wealth accumulation ([Quizlet, 2023](https://quizlet.com/gb/558142461/to-what-extent-are-the-conservatives-united-on-their-view-of-society-flash-cards)).

| Aspect                  | Traditional/One Nation Conservatives                | New Right (Neo-liberalism)                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| View of Society         | Organic, interdependent, hierarchical              | Atomistic, individualistic, non-hierarchical    |
| Social Bonds            | Emphasized as essential for stability              | De-emphasized, individuals are self-reliant     |
| Hierarchy               | Natural and necessary                               | Not necessary unless economically justified     |
| Role of Tradition       | Vital, accumulated wisdom of the past              | Less important, focus on market and individual  |

### 2. Hierarchy and Noblesse Oblige

Most conservatives agree that **hierarchy** is a natural and stabilizing feature of society, rooted in the imperfect nature of humans. Traditional conservatives emphasize a **natural aristocracy** where the educated and wealthy have a responsibility (noblesse oblige) to care for those below them, thereby maintaining social order ([Tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/tradition-conservatism)).

One Nation conservatives share this belief but are more cautious about the dangers of class conflict and capitalism’s corrosive effects on social cohesion. They support a welfare state as a safety net to prevent social unrest and revolution, acknowledging a role for the state in maintaining order ([Quizlet, 2023](https://quizlet.com/gb/558142461/to-what-extent-are-the-conservatives-united-on-their-view-of-society-flash-cards)).

The New Right, however, tends to reject paternalistic welfare policies and emphasizes meritocracy, where social position results from individual talent and effort rather than inherited status. They argue that hierarchy should be based on merit and market success, not traditional social roles ([Quizlet, 2023](https://quizlet.com/gb/589543639/to-what-extent-are-conservatives-united-in-their-view-on-society-flash-cards)).

### 3. Tradition and Social Change

Conservatives broadly agree on the importance of **tradition** and the **gradual evolution** of society rather than radical change. Edmund Burke’s idea of “change in order to conserve” is central to this perspective, advocating cautious reform that respects the accumulated wisdom of the past ([Simran Gill, 2022](https://qwivy.com/blog/a-conservatism-essay-to-what-extent-are-conservatives-united-in-their-view-of-society)).

Traditional and One Nation conservatives emphasize the dangers of rapid or radical change, which can disrupt social cohesion and traditions that provide individuals with a sense of belonging ([Quizlet, 2023](https://quizlet.com/gb/589543639/to-what-extent-are-conservatives-united-in-their-view-on-society-flash-cards)).

The New Right, particularly neo-conservatives, advocate reversing social changes from the 1960s onwards, promoting a return to “traditional values” and social order. Neo-liberals, on the other hand, support radical economic reforms to enhance free markets and individual freedom, though they remain conservative on social issues ([Bartleby, n.d.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Traditional-Conservatism-and-New-Right-PK6ZMFJCMHA)).

## Summary of Agreements and Divisions

| Theme                     | Agreement Level                | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Analytical Discussion

The evidence suggests that conservatives are **mostly united in broad principles** such as respect for tradition, community, and skepticism towards radical social change. These shared values provide a common foundation for conservative thought on society. However, **significant divisions exist** regarding the nature of society itself, the role of hierarchy, and the balance between individual freedom and social responsibility.

The **most profound division** is between the **Traditional/One Nation conservatives** and the **New Right**, especially its neo-liberal wing. Traditionalists view society as an organic whole with natural hierarchies and emphasize social bonds and collective responsibility. In contrast, New Right neo-liberals emphasize atomistic individuals, free markets, and meritocracy, rejecting many traditional social structures and welfare provisions.

This division reflects deeper philosophical differences about human nature, social order, and the role of the state. Traditional conservatives see human nature as imperfect and social order as fragile, requiring paternalistic intervention. New Right conservatives, drawing from classical liberalism, emphasize individual rationality and self-interest, advocating minimal state interference in the economy and society.

Despite these differences, there is **some convergence** within the New Right itself, where neo-conservatives emphasize social authoritarianism and traditional values, aligning more closely with traditional conservatives on social issues, even as neo-liberals push for economic liberalism.

## Conclusion

Conservatives are **partially united** in their view of society. They broadly agree on the importance of tradition, community, and cautious social change. However, the unity is **limited by significant ideological divisions**, especially between Traditional/One Nation conservatives and the New Right neo-liberals.

The **extent of unity** depends on which strands of conservatism are considered. Excluding the New Right neo-liberals, conservatives are mostly united on society. Including them reveals deep disagreements on the nature of society, hierarchy, individualism, and the role of the state.

In sum, conservatives share a **common core of values** but differ markedly in their interpretation and application of these values to societal structure and policy. This diversity reflects conservatism’s pragmatic nature and its adaptation to changing social and economic contexts.
