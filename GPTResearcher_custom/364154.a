# To What Extent Do Conservatives Agree on Society?  
## A Comprehensive Analysis  

---

### Introduction  

Conservatism, as a political ideology, is characterized by a commitment to tradition, social order, and skepticism towards rapid or radical change. However, conservatism is not monolithic; it encompasses various strands including Traditional Conservatism, One-Nation Conservatism, and the New Right (comprising Neo-liberalism and Neo-conservatism). This diversity leads to varying perspectives on society among conservatives. This report aims to analyze the extent to which conservatives agree on their view of society, examining key themes such as hierarchy, community, social change, and the role of the state. Drawing on a wide range of academic and educational sources, this report provides an in-depth, structured, and objective assessment of conservative unity and division regarding societal views.

### Overview of Conservative Views on Society  

Most conservatives fundamentally believe in the importance of **tradition**, **community**, and the **prevention of drastic social change**. The concept of an **organic society**—where society is viewed as a living organism with interdependent parts—is central to many conservative perspectives, especially Traditional and One-Nation Conservatism. However, more contemporary conservatives, particularly those aligned with the New Right, often reject the archaic idea of a natural hierarchy and emphasize individualism and negative freedom ([Austin Rumball, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

### Key Areas of Agreement and Disagreement  

| Theme                  | Traditional & One-Nation Conservatism                        | New Right (Neo-liberalism & Neo-conservatism)                 | Level of Agreement          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Hierarchy**          | Society is hierarchical; natural aristocracy governs best; noblesse oblige obligates elites to care for lower classes (Burke, Disraeli). | Meritocracy in free market; social position based on talent and effort (Nozick, Rand); reject natural hierarchy. | Low to moderate             |
| **Community**          | Society is more than individuals; importance of "little platoons" and social bonds (Burke). | Individuals are atomistic; owe no duty beyond contracts (Rand, Thatcher). | Moderate                   |
| **Social Change**      | Change is dangerous; only "change to conserve" (Burke, Oakeshott). | Radical change essential for self-fulfillment and free markets (Rand). | Low                        |
| **Role of State**      | State has role in preventing chaos; welfare state as safety net (One-Nation). | Minimal state; only enforce contracts and protect property (Nozick). | Low                        |

### Hierarchy and Social Order  

Hierarchy is a foundational concept in conservatism, especially for Traditional and One-Nation Conservatives. Edmund Burke argued that society naturally stratifies into classes, with the educated and wealthy best suited to govern due to their accumulated wisdom and disinterested governance. This hierarchy is seen as essential for social stability and order. The concept of **noblesse oblige**—the responsibility of the elite to care for those less capable—is integral to this view ([tutor2u, 2020](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/hierarchy-conservatism)).

In contrast, the New Right, particularly Neo-liberals like Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand, reject the idea of a natural hierarchy. They argue for a meritocratic society where social position is earned through individual effort and ability. Rand’s objectivism promotes rational self-interest and dismisses altruism as charity, advocating a laissez-faire society with minimal state intervention. Nozick’s libertarianism supports a minimal state to avoid fostering dependency and to protect individual freedom ([Quizlet, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

This fundamental disagreement over hierarchy marks a significant division within conservatism, with Traditionalists emphasizing social obligation and the New Right emphasizing individual merit and freedom.

### Community vs Atomism  

Traditional conservatives emphasize the importance of **community** and social bonds. Burke’s notion of "little platoons"—small, localized communities such as families and churches—provides individuals with identity, purpose, and integration into wider society. The Church of England is often cited as a key community institution that upholds social cohesion ([Austin Rumball, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

One-Nation Conservatives and Christian Democrats extend this by stressing the dangers of individualism and social division, warning that neglect of duty leads to societal fragmentation and unrest (Disraeli’s "two nations" concept). They advocate for elites to connect with lower classes to maintain social harmony.

Conversely, libertarian conservatives and the New Right adopt an **atomistic** view of society. They see individuals as independent actors pursuing self-interest, with no inherent duty to others beyond voluntary contracts. Margaret Thatcher’s famous assertion, "There is no such thing as society," encapsulates this perspective ([Austin Rumball, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

While there is some agreement on the importance of community among Traditional and One-Nation Conservatives, libertarians fundamentally disagree, leading to a medium level of consensus overall.

### Social Change and Tradition  

Conservatives generally agree that **radical social change is dangerous** and should be avoided. Oakeshott’s metaphor of society as a "boundless and bottomless sea" suggests that stability is preferable to disruptive reform. Burke’s principle of "change to conserve" advocates gradual, pragmatic evolution that respects tradition and preserves social fabrics ([MyTutor, 2025](https://www.mytutor.co.uk)).

However, libertarian conservatives argue that radical change, particularly economic liberalization, is necessary for individual self-fulfillment and moral purpose. Ayn Rand’s objectivism supports radical free-market reforms, rejecting traditional constraints as impediments to progress.

Neo-conservatives, a strand of the New Right, also seek to reverse social changes from the 1960s, promoting Victorian values and policies such as Thatcher’s Section 28, which aimed to curb permissiveness ([Austin Rumball, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

Thus, while there is broad agreement on cautious change among Traditional and One-Nation Conservatives, the New Right’s libertarian wing diverges sharply.

### Role of the State  

Traditional and One-Nation Conservatives recognize a role for the state in **maintaining order** and **preventing social chaos**. They support welfare provisions as a safety net to mitigate capitalism’s excesses and prevent revolutionary upheaval. Disraeli’s reforms and later acceptance of Keynesian economics exemplify this pragmatic approach ([poppymoore5, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

In contrast, libertarians advocate for a **minimal state**, limited to enforcing contracts and protecting property rights. Nozick’s minimal state theory argues that paternalistic welfare fosters dependency and undermines self-reliance ([Quizlet, 2025](https://quizlet.com)).

This divergence reflects differing views on social responsibility and the balance between individual freedom and collective stability.

### Overall Assessment  

Conservatives are **partially united** in their view of society but significant divisions exist, especially between Traditional/One-Nation Conservatives and the New Right.  

- **Unity exists** around the importance of tradition, community, and skepticism of radical change, especially among Traditional and One-Nation Conservatives. They emphasize social hierarchy, noblesse oblige, and the state's role in maintaining order.  
- **Division arises** primarily due to the New Right’s libertarian wing, which rejects natural hierarchy and organic society concepts, promotes atomistic individualism, and advocates minimal state intervention.  
- The **degree of consensus** varies by theme: high on tradition and social order among some conservatives, medium on community, and low on hierarchy, social change, and state role.  

This fragmentation reflects the evolving nature of conservatism in response to modern social and economic challenges. While conservatives share foundational principles, their application and interpretation diverge, leading to a spectrum rather than a unified doctrine.

### Conclusion  

In conclusion, conservatives are **not fully united** in their view of society. The core conservative values of tradition, community, and cautious change provide some common ground, particularly among Traditional and One-Nation Conservatives. However, the rise of the New Right and libertarian conservatism introduces significant ideological splits, especially regarding hierarchy, individualism, and the role of the state. Therefore, conservatives exhibit a **conditional unity** that is strong in some respects but increasingly challenged by internal diversity and differing priorities in a changing world.
