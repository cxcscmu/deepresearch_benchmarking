### Introduction

The relationship between Christianity and the LGBT community has historically been complex and often contentious. However, evolving theological interpretations, societal changes, and increased awareness of human dignity have opened pathways for Christians to support LGBT individuals meaningfully. This report explores how Christians can support LGBT people, drawing on scriptural interpretations, ethical considerations, and contemporary religious practices. It aims to provide an in-depth, balanced, and comprehensive analysis grounded in recent scholarship and religious discourse.

### 1. Reconciling Biblical Faith and Compassion

A central tension in Christian support for LGBT individuals arises from perceived conflicts between biblical texts and compassion. Many Christians feel compelled to adhere to traditional interpretations of scripture that condemn homosexual acts, while others emphasize the overarching biblical principles of love, justice, and inclusion.

#### 1.1 The False Dichotomy Between Scripture and Compassion

John Shore (2012) argues that framing the debate as a choice between faithfulness to the Bible and compassion is a false dichotomy. He emphasizes that the Bible rarely mentions homosexuality explicitly (only 6-7 verses out of over 31,000) and that these "clobber passages" have been historically misinterpreted or taken out of context. Shore advocates for reading these passages with the same care as any other scripture and highlights that God calls Christians to love their neighbors unconditionally, including LGBT persons ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

#### 1.2 Contextual and Historical Interpretation

The Bible was written in cultural contexts vastly different from today. For example, Paul’s condemnations of same-sex acts were directed at exploitative, coercive relationships common in Roman society, such as those involving slaves and youths, rather than consensual, loving same-sex relationships. The concept of sexual orientation as understood today did not exist at the time ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

#### 1.3 Emphasizing Love as the Greatest Commandment

Scriptural passages such as 1 Corinthians 13:8-13 emphasize love as the greatest virtue. Christians are called to prioritize love, compassion, and justice over rigid legalism. This perspective encourages inclusion and support for LGBT individuals as expressions of living faith ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

### 2. Addressing Harm and Promoting Justice

#### 2.1 Recognizing the Harm Caused by Exclusion

Historically, Christian communities have contributed to the marginalization and suffering of LGBT persons through exclusion from church participation, denial of marriage rights, and social ostracism. This has led to significant spiritual, emotional, and social harm ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

#### 2.2 Moral Obligation to Justice

The New Testament commands Christians to act justly and love their neighbors (Matthew 22:39, Romans 13:8-10). Given the severity of harm experienced by LGBT individuals, Christians have a biblically mandated obligation to advocate for justice, equality, and inclusion ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

### 3. Practical Ways Christians Can Support LGBT Individuals

#### 3.1 Cultivating Inclusive Church Communities

- **Welcoming but Not Affirming vs. Affirming**: Many churches adopt a "welcoming but not affirming" stance, allowing LGBT individuals to attend but restricting leadership roles. Moving toward full affirmation involves recognizing LGBT people as equal members capable of leadership and ministry ([myGwork, 2025](https://www.mygwork.com)).

- **Creating Safe Spaces**: Churches can become safe, inclusive environments where LGBT individuals feel valued and spiritually nurtured, countering the silence and rejection many experience ([myGwork, 2025](https://www.mygwork.com)).

#### 3.2 Education and Dialogue

- **Faith Role Models Programs**: Initiatives like Stonewall’s Faith Role Models bring together LGBT people from various faiths to challenge stereotypes and foster dialogue within religious communities ([myGwork, 2025](https://www.mygwork.com)).

- **Theological Education**: Encouraging clergy and laity to engage with contemporary biblical scholarship that contextualizes traditional passages can reduce misunderstandings and promote empathy ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

#### 3.3 Advocacy for Legal and Social Equality

- **Supporting Marriage Equality**: Recognizing that the Bible does not explicitly address same-sex marriage, Christians can support marriage equality as a matter of justice and love, preventing the unfair compulsion of sin through exclusion ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).

- **Opposing Discrimination**: Christians can oppose discriminatory practices in foster care, employment, and public services that harm LGBT individuals, advocating for policies that reflect compassion and justice ([myGwork, 2025](https://www.mygwork.com)).

#### 3.4 Personal Relationships and Support

- **Loving Neighbors**: Christians are called to love and support LGBT individuals in their personal lives, offering friendship, acceptance, and spiritual support without judgment ([Gushee, 2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com)).

- **Rejecting Hypocrisy**: Recognizing that all humans are sinners, Christians should avoid applying absolute moral standards selectively, especially when condemning sins they themselves may commit ([Shore, 2012](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-case-for-the-bible-not-condemning-homosexuality_b_1409083)).
