# Report: Origins and Causes of Racial Discrimination

## Introduction

Racial discrimination, the practice of treating individuals or groups differently based on perceived racial differences, has been a persistent and complex phenomenon throughout human history. Understanding why racial discrimination started requires an exploration of historical, economic, social, and scientific factors that contributed to the emergence and institutionalization of racial hierarchies and prejudices. This report synthesizes extensive historical and scholarly information to provide a comprehensive analysis of the origins of racial discrimination, emphasizing its multifaceted causes and evolution.

## Historical Emergence of Racial Discrimination

### Pre-Modern Context: Absence of Race as a Biological Concept

In ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, distinctions were primarily cultural or religious rather than racial in the modern sense. The Greeks differentiated between the "civilized" and "barbarous," but these categories were not hereditary or biologically fixed. Similarly, early Christians emphasized spiritual equality, and there was no evidence that skin color or physical traits were bases for social hierarchy ([Fredrickson, 2003](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv4q)).

### Medieval Period: Religious and Ethnic Prejudices

The roots of racial discrimination began to take a more defined shape in medieval Europe, particularly through anti-Judaism, which evolved into antisemitism. Jews were increasingly demonized, accused of crimes such as deicide and ritual murder, and subjected to massacres and expulsions. This period saw the emergence of myths that dehumanized Jews, associating them with the Devil and evil forces, thus laying a foundation for racialized thinking that transcended mere religious difference ([Fredrickson, 2003](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv4q)).

At the same time, ethnic discrimination against groups like the Irish and Slavs foreshadowed the later racial hierarchies of imperial expansion. However, these were often based on cultural or religious grounds rather than biological determinism.

### The Role of European Expansionism and Colonization

The Age of Exploration and subsequent European colonization of the Americas, Africa, and Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries marked a turning point. Europeans encountered diverse peoples and cultures, and to justify conquest, enslavement, and exploitation, they increasingly resorted to racial ideologies that posited European superiority and the inferiority of colonized peoples.

The trans-Atlantic slave trade, beginning in the 1400s and lasting approximately 400 years, was a critical driver of racial discrimination. Africans were forcibly captured, transported, and enslaved primarily to work on plantations in the Americas. This system was justified by beliefs in the inherent inferiority of Africans, which were codified in laws and social practices that dehumanized them and denied basic rights ([IvyPanda, 2018](https://ivypanda.com/essays/slavery-racism-and-the-trans-atlantic-slave-trade/)).

## Economic and Social Factors

### Capitalism and the Demand for Labor

The rise of capitalism in Europe and the Americas created a demand for cheap labor to fuel plantation economies, mining, and other enterprises. Slavery became economically profitable, and racial discrimination served to rationalize the exploitation of African laborers as property rather than persons.

The economic utility of racial discrimination was evident in the way freed African Americans were relegated to second-class status as wage laborers and sharecroppers after the abolition of slavery in the United States. Similarly, Mexican-Americans and other immigrant groups were confined to low-wage, labor-intensive jobs, reflecting a pattern of economic marginalization tied to racial and ethnic identity ([IvyPanda, 2018](https://ivypanda.com/essays/slavery-racism-and-the-trans-atlantic-slave-trade/)).

### Social Identity and Positive Distinctiveness

Psychological factors such as self-esteem and group identity also contributed to racial discrimination. Groups often establish positive distinctiveness by emphasizing their superiority over others to enhance their social status and cohesion. In colonial America, white settlers adopted a doctrine of white superiority, which justified the dispossession and subjugation of Native Americans and Africans ([Study.com](https://study.com/academy/lesson/causes-of-racial-discrimination-in-america.html)).

## Scientific Racism: Pseudoscience and Justification of Inequality

### Emergence of Scientific Racism

From the 17th century onward, scientific racism emerged as an attempt to use the authority of science to justify racial hierarchies. Early proponents like Louis Agassiz supported polygenism, the theory that human races were distinct species. Pseudoscientific methods such as craniometry and phrenology were used to claim biological differences in intelligence and temperament between races, often portraying Africans and other non-white peoples as inferior ([Harvard Library](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=310271&p=2079387)).

### Social Darwinism and Eugenics

The misapplication of Darwin’s theory of evolution led to social Darwinism, which justified competition, inequality, and imperialism as natural and beneficial. Eugenics further institutionalized these ideas by advocating for the control of human reproduction to "improve" the genetic quality of populations, often targeting minorities and the poor for sterilization and exclusion ([Marks, 1995](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/scientific-racism)).

### Impact on Policy and Society

Scientific racism influenced immigration laws, segregation, and discriminatory policies in the United States and Europe. For example, the Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and Asia, while exempting Mexicans who were still subjected to discrimination in labor and housing ([IvyPanda, 2018](https://ivypanda.com/essays/slavery-racism-and-the-trans-atlantic-slave-trade/)).

| Religious Prejudice        | Early ethnic and religious hostility, especially antisemitism                               | Medieval Europe’s anti-Jewish violence       |
| Colonial Expansion         | Justification for conquest and exploitation through racial ideologies                        | European colonization of Americas and Africa |
| Economic Exploitation      | Demand for cheap labor driving racialized slavery and labor segregation                      | Trans-Atlantic slave trade, sharecropping    |
| Social Identity           | Group self-esteem and positive distinctiveness fostering in-group superiority                | White supremacy in colonial America           |
| Scientific Racism          | Use of pseudoscience to legitimize racial hierarchies and discrimination                     | Phrenology, eugenics, social Darwinism       |
| Legal and Political Systems| Institutionalization of racial discrimination through laws and policies                      | Jim Crow laws, Immigration Acts               |

## Conclusion

Racial discrimination originated from a confluence of religious, economic, social, and pseudo-scientific factors. While early prejudices were largely cultural or religious, the rise of European imperialism and capitalism transformed these into rigid racial hierarchies justified by emerging scientific racism. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and colonialism institutionalized racial discrimination as a means to exploit labor and maintain social control.

Scientific racism provided a veneer of legitimacy to these practices, embedding racial discrimination deeply into laws, policies, and social norms. Understanding these origins is crucial for addressing the persistent legacy of racism in contemporary society.
