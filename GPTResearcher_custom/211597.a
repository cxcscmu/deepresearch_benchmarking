# Report on Reverend Parris’s Abuse of Power in Arthur Miller’s *The Crucible*

Arthur Miller’s *The Crucible* presents Reverend Samuel Parris as a complex character whose actions significantly contribute to the Salem witch trials’ hysteria and tragedy. This report examines how Reverend Parris abuses his power throughout the play, drawing on a variety of critical analyses and interpretations to provide a comprehensive understanding of his motivations, behaviors, and the consequences of his actions.

## Introduction

Reverend Parris holds a pivotal role in Salem as the parish priest, a position that grants him both spiritual authority and social influence. However, rather than embodying the moral and spiritual leadership expected of his office, Parris is portrayed as a man driven primarily by self-interest, fear of losing status, and a desperate need to maintain control. His abuse of power manifests in various ways, including manipulation, intimidation, exploitation of religious authority, and fostering the witch trials for personal gain.

## Self-Interest and Obsession with Reputation

A defining characteristic of Reverend Parris is his obsessive concern with his reputation and social standing. From the outset, Parris is portrayed as a man who fears losing his position in the community more than he cares about the spiritual welfare of his parishioners or even his own family. His paranoia is evident in his reaction to the illness of his daughter Betty and the suspicious behavior of his niece Abigail. Instead of seeking genuine solutions, he focuses on controlling the narrative to protect his name.

For example, Parris instructs others to suppress information that might tarnish his reputation, showing a willingness to deceive and manipulate to safeguard his position ([Barnhouse, 2021](https://study.com/academy/lesson/reverend-parris-in-the-crucible.html)). His fixation on status is further illustrated by his complaints about his salary and firewood allowance, revealing a man who equates material gain and respect with his worth and authority ([phdessay.com, 2022](https://phdessay.com/reverend-parris-character-analysis-practice-what-you-preach/)).

## Exploitation of Religious Authority and Power Hunger

Parris’s abuse of power is closely tied to his exploitation of his religious office. He is described as a man who believes he is “the Lord’s man in the parish” and uses this belief to justify his authoritarian behavior ([study.com, 2021](https://study.com/academy/lesson/reverend-parris-in-the-crucible.html)). However, his religious devotion lacks humility and moral insight, making it a tool for control rather than genuine spiritual guidance.

One notable example is his demand for golden candlesticks in the church, a symbol of vanity and greed rather than piety. John Proctor’s criticism of Parris’s preaching about the candlesticks until he obtained them highlights Parris’s prioritization of material wealth and status over spiritual leadership ([phdessay.com, 2022](https://phdessay.com/reverend-parris-character-analysis-practice-what-you-preach/)).

## Manipulation and Instigation of the Witch Trials

Parris’s role in the Salem witch trials is central to his abuse of power. Initially, he does not believe in witchcraft, but he quickly realizes that the hysteria can be manipulated to his advantage. Encouraged by Thomas Putnam, who advises him to “take hold of it here” and claim credit for rooting out evil, Parris embraces the witch trials as a means to consolidate his authority ([eNotes, 2023](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/analyze-reverend-parris-from-the-crucible-what-74617)).

By supporting the girls’ accusations and aligning himself with the court, Parris uses the trials to deflect criticism from himself and to suppress dissent. His encouragement of the court’s harsh measures and his fear-driven insistence on rooting out supposed witches reveal a man who prioritizes power over justice and truth ([ipl.org, 2023](https://www.ipl.org/essay/The-Crucible-Parris-Character-Analysis-PC3MTFGZT)).

## Intimidation and Suppression of Opposition

Parris’s abuse of power also includes intimidation of those who oppose him or threaten his status. He is quick to silence or discredit voices of reason, such as Rebecca Nurse, who suggests that Betty’s illness is a mere phase and not witchcraft. Parris’s refusal to listen to such counsel and his eagerness to brand dissenters as enemies of the church demonstrate his authoritarian tendencies ([phdessay.com, 2022](https://phdessay.com/reverend-parris-character-analysis-practice-what-you-preach/)).

Moreover, his paranoia about enemies and conspiracies leads him to act defensively and aggressively, further exacerbating the community’s fear and division. His reaction to the dagger found at his door symbolizes his fear of losing control and the lengths he will go to maintain his power ([ipl.org, 2023](https://www.ipl.org/essay/The-Crucible-Parris-Character-Analysis-PC3MTFGZT)).

## Conclusion

His actions are motivated by a desire to maintain authority, protect his reputation, and secure material benefits, often at the expense of truth, justice, and the well-being of his community. Rather than serving as a moral compass, Parris becomes a catalyst for the hysteria and tragedy that engulf Salem.

This analysis reveals that Parris’s abuse of power is not merely a product of individual flaws but also a commentary on how religious and social authority can be corrupted when wielded by those more concerned with self-preservation than ethical leadership. His character serves as a cautionary example of the dangers inherent in unchecked power and the devastating consequences it can have on society.
