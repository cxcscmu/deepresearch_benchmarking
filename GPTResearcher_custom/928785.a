# Report on Whether Capital Punishment Should Be Legalised

## Introduction

Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, remains one of the most contentious issues in criminal justice and ethics worldwide. It involves the state-sanctioned execution of individuals convicted of certain serious crimes, typically murder or treason. The debate over its legality encompasses moral, constitutional, deterrence, racial, and practical considerations. This report aims to provide a detailed, comprehensive, and objective analysis of whether capital punishment should be legalised, drawing on a wide range of scholarly sources, empirical data, and legal precedents. The report concludes with a reasoned opinion based on the evidence presented.

## Historical and Legal Context

Historically, capital punishment has been used extensively across civilizations, with methods evolving from public executions to more "humane" methods such as lethal injection ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/)). In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled on the constitutionality of the death penalty multiple times, affirming that it is not inherently "cruel and unusual" under the Eighth Amendment but highlighting concerns about its arbitrary application ([Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)).

## Arguments For Legalising Capital Punishment

### 1. Moral Justification and Retribution

Proponents argue that capital punishment is morally justified as a form of retribution â€” the principle of "an eye for an eye." It is seen as a way to uphold justice by ensuring that those who take a life forfeit their own ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)). Bruce Fein posits that the death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a moral agent responsible for their actions ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/)).

### 2. Deterrence of Serious Crimes

Some scholars and policymakers believe that the death penalty serves as a stronger deterrent against capital crimes than life imprisonment. The fear of death is argued to be a more effective preventive measure for potential offenders ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)). Ernest Van Den Haag argues that executing murderers protects citizens from subsequent murders.

### 3. Incapacitation and Public Safety

Capital punishment permanently removes dangerous criminals from society, eliminating any possibility of reoffending or escape. This is particularly relevant in cases where life imprisonment might fail to prevent further crimes within or outside prison ([JSTOR Daily, 2015](https://daily.jstor.org/sociologists-test-six-arguments-for-and-against-capital-punishment/)).

### 4. Cost Considerations

Some proponents claim that executing criminals can be less costly than housing them for life in prison. They argue that long-term incarceration imposes a significant financial burden on taxpayers ([Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)).

### 5. Justice for Victims and Society

Capital punishment is seen as a means to provide closure and justice for victims' families and society at large. It reinforces societal condemnation of heinous crimes and restores a sense of moral order ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/)).

## Arguments Against Legalising Capital Punishment

### 1. Moral and Human Rights Concerns

Opponents argue that capital punishment violates the fundamental human right to life and is inherently inhumane. The practice is seen as state-sanctioned killing, which contradicts the principles of dignity and respect for human life ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)).

### 2. Lack of Deterrent Effect

Extensive research, including a comprehensive report by the National Research Council, concludes that there is no credible evidence that the death penalty effectively deters homicide more than life imprisonment ([National Research Council, 2012](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty)). States with capital punishment do not consistently show lower crime rates than those without it ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)).

### 3. Risk of Irrevocable Mistakes

The possibility of executing innocent people is a critical concern. Numerous cases have emerged where death row inmates were later exonerated through DNA evidence or new information ([JSTOR Daily, 2015](https://daily.jstor.org/sociologists-test-six-arguments-for-and-against-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)). The irreversible nature of capital punishment means miscarriages of justice cannot be remedied.

### 4. Racial and Socioeconomic Bias

Capital punishment has been shown to be applied disproportionately against racial minorities and the poor. For instance, black Americans constitute about 13% of the U.S. population but represent nearly 50% of those on federal death row ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)). This bias undermines the fairness and legitimacy of the justice system.

### 5. High Costs and Protracted Legal Process

Contrary to some claims, death penalty cases are often more expensive than non-capital cases due to lengthy trials, appeals, and incarceration on death row ([JSTOR Daily, 2015](https://daily.jstor.org/sociologists-test-six-arguments-for-and-against-capital-punishment/); [Paperroni, 2021](https://paperroni.com/capital-punishment-arguments-for-and-against/)). These costs burden the judicial system and taxpayers.

### 6. Ethical Issues with Retribution

Retribution is criticized as a form of revenge rather than justice. It perpetuates a cycle of violence and does not contribute to societal healing or rehabilitation ([Bomb Essays, 2022](https://bombessays.com/pros-and-cons-of-capital-punishment/)).

| **Incapacitation**       | Permanently removes dangerous offenders                     | Life imprisonment can also incapacitate                      |
| **Risk of Error**        | Due process minimizes errors                                | Irrevocable mistakes possible; innocent executions occur     |
| **Racial Bias**          | Claims of proportionality based on crime rates             | Disproportionate application against minorities              |
| **Cost**                 | Potentially less costly than life imprisonment              | Death penalty cases more expensive due to legal complexities |
| **Justice for Victims**  | Provides closure and moral balance                          | May not provide true closure; seen as revenge                |
| **Ethical Concerns**     | Upholds societal moral order                                | Perpetuates cycle of violence; ethical objections            |

## Analysis and Opinion

The evidence suggests that while capital punishment may fulfill certain societal desires for retribution and incapacitation, it falls short in several critical areas. The lack of conclusive deterrent effect undermines one of the primary utilitarian justifications for its use. Furthermore, the risk of executing innocent individuals, coupled with documented racial and socioeconomic biases, raises serious concerns about the fairness and justice of capital punishment.

The high financial costs and prolonged legal processes associated with death penalty cases strain public resources and judicial efficiency. Ethical considerations also weigh heavily against the practice, as it involves the deliberate taking of human life by the state, which conflicts with evolving human rights standards.

Given these factors, capital punishment appears to be an outdated and problematic form of punishment. Alternatives such as life imprisonment without parole can achieve incapacitation and provide a measure of justice without the irreversible consequences and moral dilemmas posed by the death penalty.

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of moral, empirical, legal, and practical considerations, capital punishment should **not** be legalised. The risks, costs, and ethical issues outweigh the purported benefits. Society should focus on improving the criminal justice system to ensure fairness, prevent wrongful convictions, and provide effective rehabilitation and protection without resorting to the death penalty.
