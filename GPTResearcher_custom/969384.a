# Why Should Abortions Be Legal? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

The legality of abortion remains one of the most contentious public policy issues worldwide, intersecting ethics, health, human rights, and socio-economic factors. This report presents a detailed, evidence-based analysis of why abortions should be legal, emphasizing public health, safety, human rights, and socio-economic benefits. Drawing on extensive scientific research, public health data, and policy analyses, this report aims to provide an objective and comprehensive understanding of the critical reasons supporting legal abortion access.

## 1. Public Health and Safety Benefits of Legal Abortion

### 1.1 Reduction in Maternal Mortality and Morbidity

Before abortion was legalized in the United States, an estimated 200,000 to 1,200,000 illegal abortions were performed annually, mostly in unsafe conditions by unskilled practitioners ([Tyrer, 1992](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12340404/)). These illegal abortions were associated with high complication rates, including sepsis caused by *Clostridium perfringens*, which led to gas gangrene and significant mortality. Annually, over 100 women died from abortion complications prior to legalization, with actual numbers likely higher due to underreporting.

After the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, legal abortion procedures increased dramatically, reaching over 1.3 million annually by 1983, with a marked decrease in abortion-related deaths from 90 in 1972 to 16 in 1980 ([Cates, Grimes, & Schulz, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1363/3502503)). Legal abortions carry an especially low risk of death, particularly when performed in the first trimester, with mortality rates approximately seven times lower than childbirth ([Tyrer, 1992](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12340404/)).

| Indicator                      | Illegal Abortion (Pre-1970) | Legal Abortion (Post-1973) | Childbirth (1970s)       |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Estimated Annual Procedures    | ~1,000,000+                 | ~1,300,000                 | N/A                     |
| Annual Deaths                  | >100                        | <20                        | Higher than abortion     |
| Mortality Rate (per 100,000)   | Up to 30 times higher risk  | 1.9                       | 7 times higher than abortion |

### 1.2 Decline in Complications and Hospitalizations

Legal abortion has led to a significant reduction in septic abortion complications treated in emergency rooms and hospitals. The availability of safe, regulated procedures has virtually eliminated many of the severe infections and injuries previously common in illegal abortions ([Cates et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1363/3502503)).

## 2. Human Rights and Legal Considerations

### 2.1 Women's Health and Autonomy

Unsafe abortion accounts for approximately 13% of maternal deaths globally, predominantly in countries with restrictive abortion laws ([WHO, 2003](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/42794)). International human rights bodies advocate for the decriminalization of abortion and ensuring access to safe services to protect women's right to life, health, and freedom from inhuman treatment ([WHO, 2012](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548434)).

Legal restrictions do not reduce abortion incidence but increase unsafe abortions, leading to higher morbidity and mortality. Conversely, liberal laws facilitate access to safe abortion without increasing abortion rates ([WHO, 2012](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548434)).

### 2.2 Barriers to Access and Their Impact

Legal and policy barriers such as mandatory waiting periods, third-party authorizations, lack of information, and provider conscientious objection impede access to safe abortion services. These barriers disproportionately affect marginalized groups, including adolescents, low-income women, and survivors of sexual violence, exacerbating health inequities ([WHO, 2012](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548434)).

## 3. Socio-Economic Benefits of Abortion Access

### 3.1 Educational Attainment and Labor Market Participation

Access to abortion allows women to better control fertility and invest in human capital. Studies show abortion legalization in the 1970s reduced teen fertility and increased college attainment, especially among Black women, who experienced a 1.3% increase in high school graduation and a 9.6% increase in college graduation rates in states with early abortion access ([Angrist & Evans, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0147-9121(00)80004-4)).

Labor force participation also increased, with a nearly 2 percentage point rise overall and a 6.9 percentage point increase among Black women ([Kalist, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12122-004-1010-9)).

### 3.2 Intergenerational Effects

Children born to women with abortion access have better socio-economic outcomes, including lower poverty rates, higher college graduation rates, and reduced reliance on public assistance ([Gruber, Levine, & Staiger, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1162/003355399556007); [Ananat et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1162/rest.91.1.124)).

### 3.3 Economic Security and Poverty Reduction

Financial reasons are among the most common for seeking abortion, with 40-50% of women citing economic hardship ([Biggs, Gould, & Foster, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6874-13-29)). Restrictions on abortion access disproportionately harm low-income women, exacerbating poverty and economic insecurity ([IWPR, 2019](https://iwpr.org/publications/economic-effects-abortion-access-review/)).

## 4. Consequences of Restricting Abortion Access

### 4.1 Increase in Unsafe Abortions and Mortality

If abortion were made illegal again in the US, illegal abortions could increase from fewer than 20,000 to over 1,000,000 annually, with a potential 30-fold increase in death risk compared to legal abortion ([Tyrer, 1992](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12340404/)).

### 4.2 Impact on Teen Birth Rates and Education

Parental involvement laws and Medicaid funding restrictions have been shown to reduce abortion rates but increase teen birth rates, with associated negative impacts on educational attainment, particularly among Black women ([Myers & Ladd, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.08.009); [Borelli, 2011](http://search.proquest.com/docview/904572422)).

### 4.3 Disproportionate Impact on Marginalized Communities

Restrictions disproportionately affect Black women and economically disadvantaged groups due to structural barriers in healthcare access and increased criminalization risks for self-managed abortion ([IWPR, 2019](https://iwpr.org/publications/economic-effects-abortion-access-review/)).

## 5. Ethical and Social Considerations

### 5.1 Respecting Women's Autonomy and Rights

Legal abortion respects women's autonomy over their bodies and reproductive choices, a fundamental human right recognized by international treaties ([WHO, 2012](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241548434)).

### 5.2 Reducing Social Harms

Legal abortion reduces the social harms associated with unwanted pregnancies, including child neglect, abuse, and economic strain on families and social systems ([Cedeno, 2010](https://www.knowswhy.com/why-should-abortion-be-legal/)).

## Conclusion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the legalization of abortion as a critical public health measure that saves lives, reduces maternal morbidity and mortality, and promotes social and economic well-being. Legal abortion protects women's human rights and autonomy, reduces unsafe abortion practices, and yields significant socio-economic benefits across generations. Conversely, restricting abortion access leads to increased unsafe procedures, higher mortality, and exacerbates social inequities. Therefore, maintaining and expanding legal access to abortion is essential for safeguarding women's health, rights, and socio-economic stability.
