# Does Religion Cause War? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The question of whether religion causes war has been a subject of intense debate among scholars, policymakers, and the public alike. Popular narratives often depict religion as a primary driver of conflict, citing historical and contemporary examples such as the Crusades, sectarian violence in the Middle East, and the so-called "War on Terror." However, recent scholarly research challenges this simplistic view, emphasizing the complexity of the relationship between religion and violence. This report aims to provide a detailed, evidence-based analysis of the role religion plays in causing war, drawing on a wide range of academic studies, historical data, and contemporary research findings.

## Historical Overview of Religion and War

Historically, warfare has been a constant feature of human society, predating organized religion. According to Phillips and Axelrod (2004), a comprehensive compilation of 1,763 recorded wars reveals that only 123 (approximately 7%) involved religious conflict. This statistic challenges the common perception that most wars are religiously motivated ([Deem, 2013](http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/war_and_religion.html)).

Interestingly, of these religious wars, more than half (66) involved Islam, a religion that emerged only after 3,000 years of recorded human warfare. This highlights that religious wars are a relatively recent phenomenon in the broader scope of human history. Moreover, the United States, one of the most religious nations over the past two centuries, has participated in 17 wars, with only one—the ongoing "War on Terror"—having a religious component. The annual death toll from religious wars in the U.S. is reportedly lower than deaths caused by dog bites, illustrating the limited scale of religiously motivated violence in even highly religious societies ([Deem, 2013](http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/war_and_religion.html)).

## Scholarly Perspectives on Religion and Violence

### The Complexity of Religion’s Role

Recent academic literature emphasizes that the relationship between religion and violence is neither straightforward nor unique. Wright and Khoo (2018) conducted a comprehensive literature review and concluded that there is little evidence to suggest that religious ideologies inherently cause violence. Instead, they argue that violence linked to religion often stems from broader social psychological processes related to group identity and perceived threats, which are not exclusive to religious groups ([Singal, 2019](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/10/does-religion-really-cause-violence/)).

For example, research shows that individuals who perceive attacks on their sacred values are more likely to endorse violent responses. However, religiosity can also correlate with reduced aggression and vengeance in some contexts. One study found that frequent church attendance was associated with less self-reported vengeance, while consistent charitable donations correlated with greater vengeance, illustrating the nuanced and sometimes contradictory effects of religiosity on behavior ([Singal, 2019](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/10/does-religion-really-cause-violence/)).

### Religion as a Social Identity

Wright and Khoo (2018) highlight that hostility and violence often arise from group-based threat perceptions, a phenomenon common to both religious and secular identities. This suggests that religion itself is not uniquely prone to causing violence; rather, it can be one of many identity markers around which conflict may crystallize. For instance, strong in-group identification, whether religious, nationalistic, or cultural, can lead to hostility toward out-groups. The apparent link between religious attendance and hostility might reflect this broader social dynamic rather than a direct causal role of religion ([Singal, 2019](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/10/does-religion-really-cause-violence/)).

### The Missing Dimension of Supernatural Belief

A critical gap in the literature identified by Wright and Khoo (2018) is the lack of direct study on supernatural beliefs, which are central to religious identity. Without examining how belief in the supernatural influences behavior, research may provide an incomplete picture of religion's unique role in violence or peace. This omission suggests that current conclusions should be viewed with caution, as they may not fully capture the complexities of religious motivation ([Singal, 2019](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/10/does-religion-really-cause-violence/)).

## Religion’s Dual Role in Conflict and Peacebuilding

The role of religion in conflict is multifaceted. While religion can be implicated in violence, it also plays a significant role in peacebuilding and conflict resolution. Silvestri and Mayall (2015) emphasize that religion is a fluid system influenced by context and history, and it can both escalate and mitigate conflicts. Their analysis of case studies such as Israel-Palestine, Mali, and Bosnia-Herzegovina shows that religion's impact depends on how it is mobilized by actors and interpreted within specific socio-political environments ([Silvestri & Mayall, 2015](https://gsdrc.org/publications/the-role-of-religion-in-conflict-and-peacebuilding/)).

Key findings from their report include:

- No particular religious tradition is inherently more prone to violence or peace than others.
- Political manipulation of religion often matters more than religious doctrine in driving conflict.
- Engaging faith actors in peace processes can facilitate reconciliation by leveraging familiar cultural frameworks.
- Addressing religion in conflict requires inclusive approaches that consider diverse societal segments and everyday religious influences.

| Role of Religion          | Description                                                                                   | Examples/Notes                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Driver of conflict       | Can escalate tensions when politicized or manipulated                                        | Israel-Palestine, Mali, Bosnia        |
| Driver of peace          | Facilitates reconciliation and community engagement                                         | Faith-based peace initiatives          |
| Neutral/Context-dependent | Impact varies based on historical, cultural, and political contexts                          | No religion inherently violent or peaceful |

## Case Studies and Contemporary Conflicts

### Global Conflicts with Religious Dimensions

Several modern conflicts exhibit religious dimensions, but these are often intertwined with ethnic, political, and economic factors. Examples include:

- Palestine (Jews vs. Muslims)
- Balkans (Orthodox Serbians vs. Catholic Croatians; Orthodox Serbians vs. Bosnian and Albanian Muslims)
- Northern Ireland (Protestants vs. Catholics)
- Kashmir (Muslims vs. Hindus)
- Sudan (Muslims vs. Christians and animists)
- Nigeria (Muslims vs. Christians)

These conflicts illustrate that religion can be a marker of identity and a mobilizing factor but rarely acts as the sole cause of violence ([Deem, 2013](http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/war_and_religion.html)).

### The First World War and Religion

Research into the First World War reveals that religion influenced both the war's conduct and its aftermath, affecting religious beliefs and institutions globally. However, the war challenged all religions, prompting adaptive responses that drew on both universal religious phenomena and specific traditions. This complexity underscores that religion's role in conflict is dynamic and multifaceted ([Oxford Great War Project, 2014-2019](http://greatwar.history.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=2244)).

## Conclusion: Does Religion Cause War?

Based on the evidence reviewed, religion does not inherently cause war. While religion can be implicated in conflicts, it is rarely the sole or primary cause. Instead, religion often intersects with ethnic, political, economic, and social factors that collectively drive violence. The perception that religion causes most wars is not supported by historical data, which shows that less than 7% of recorded wars have religious causes. Moreover, the role of religion in conflict is complex, context-dependent, and often shaped by political manipulation rather than doctrinal imperatives.

Religion also plays a vital role in peacebuilding and conflict resolution, offering frameworks for reconciliation and community engagement. The dual nature of religion—as both a potential source of conflict and a resource for peace—highlights the need for nuanced understanding and context-specific approaches.

Future research should address the current gap concerning supernatural beliefs to provide a more complete understanding of religion's unique influence on violence and peace. Policymakers and practitioners should avoid simplistic attributions of violence to religion and instead consider the broader social, political, and psychological dynamics at play.
