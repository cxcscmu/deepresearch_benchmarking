# Should College Be Less Expensive? An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The rising cost of college education has become a critical concern worldwide, especially in developed countries where higher education participation has expanded significantly over recent decades. This report examines whether college should be less expensive, analyzing the economic, social, and policy dimensions of higher education financing. It synthesizes empirical evidence and theoretical insights from trusted academic sources and recent studies, focusing on the implications of college affordability for equity, efficiency, and societal welfare.

## The Economics of Financing Higher Education

### Current Financing Modes and Trends

Higher education financing in OECD countries is a mixture of public and private funding. Public spending on tertiary education varies widely, from 0.6% of GDP in Italy to 2.4% in the United States, with public shares ranging from 32% in Korea to over 90% in Nordic countries ([Diris & Ooghe, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiy003)). Tuition fees have increased in many countries, shifting costs and risks toward students and their families. Despite this, tax-financed subsidies to institutions and grants to families remain dominant.

### Private Returns and Social Returns

The private internal rate of return (IRR) on higher education is high across OECD countries, exceeding 4% in all cases and often much higher ([Diris & Ooghe, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiy003)). This suggests strong private incentives to invest in higher education. However, economic theory emphasizes that policy should be guided by the marginal social return, which includes equity and efficiency considerations beyond private gains.

## Arguments for Reducing College Costs

### Equity and Access

High college costs can create financial barriers, especially for low-income and disadvantaged students, potentially exacerbating inequality and limiting social mobility. Empirical evidence shows that credit constraints affect participation, particularly where tuition fees are high ([Diris & Ooghe, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiy003)). However, income-contingent loans (ICLs) and graduate taxes (GRTs) have been effective in mitigating these constraints without reducing participation rates, as observed in Australia and the UK.

### Economic Efficiency and Social Benefits

Reducing college costs could increase enrollment and completion rates, enhancing human capital accumulation and economic growth. College graduates tend to earn substantially more over their lifetimes, contributing more in taxes and social benefits ([Baker, 2011](https://ourvaluesproject.org/)). Moreover, higher education is associated with positive externalities such as better health, lower crime rates, and increased civic participation, although these externalities are difficult to quantify precisely.

### Impact on Student Debt and Economic Participation

High tuition fees often lead to significant student debt, which can suppress graduates' economic participation and delay milestones such as homeownership and family formation. Lowering college costs or providing more public funding can reduce debt burdens, enabling graduates to contribute more effectively to the economy ([Morgan, 2016](https://schoolconnects.com/)).

## Arguments Against Simply Reducing College Costs

### Fiscal Sustainability and Tax Burden

Funding free or cheaper college through general taxation may increase the tax burden on society, potentially leading to economic distortions and inefficiencies. Public funds are limited, and expanding subsidies without careful design can strain budgets and reduce resources available for other public goods ([Diris & Ooghe, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiy003)).

### Quality and Resource Constraints

Lower tuition without corresponding increases in funding may force colleges to cut costs, potentially reducing educational quality through larger class sizes, fewer full-time faculty, and diminished academic support ([Morgan, 2016](https://schoolconnects.com/)). Maintaining quality while expanding access requires careful balancing of funding and cost structures.

### Behavioral and Market Failures

Evidence suggests that simply lowering tuition fees may not substantially increase participation among all groups due to behavioral factors such as misprediction of costs and benefits, complexity of financial aid, and loan aversion ([Diris & Ooghe, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiy003)). Income-contingent financing mechanisms can better address these issues by aligning repayments with future earnings and smoothing consumption.

## Comparative Effectiveness of Financing Modes

| Financing Mode           | Who Pays            | Cost Containment | Equity Impact          | Efficiency Considerations                         | Risk and Moral Hazard                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Tax-Financed Subsidies  | All taxpayers       | No cap           | Often regressive      | May not target credit constraints or behavioral failures | High insurance, but high moral hazard during studies and work |
| Classical Loans         | Students            | Capped           | Less regressive       | Limited insurance, can exacerbate credit constraints | Low insurance, low moral hazard                   |
| Income-Contingent Loans | Students            | Capped, income-based | Less regressive       | Addresses credit constraints and misprediction  | Moderate insurance, moderate moral hazard         |
| Graduate Taxes          | Graduates            | No cap, income-based | Less regressive       | High insurance, consumption smoothing            | High insurance, potential moral hazard during work |

Income-contingent loans and graduate taxes offer a balanced approach, providing insurance against income risk and addressing credit constraints and behavioral biases without excessive regressivity. They also postpone costs to the future, which can be more manageable for students and align payments with ability to pay.

## Recent Empirical Evidence on College Cost Policies

A 2019 study by economists at Dartmouth, Harvard, and the College Board found that increasing taxpayer spending on public colleges and eliminating tuition for families earning under $60,000 is the most cost-effective way to raise college graduation rates in the U.S. Free community college programs, while popular, may reduce four-year degree attainment by diverting students to two-year institutions with lower completion rates ([Barshay, 2019](https://hechingerreport.org/economists-find-free-community-college-can-backfire/)).

This suggests that targeted subsidies at four-year institutions may be more effective than blanket tuition elimination at community colleges for increasing bachelor's degree attainment.

## Political Economy Considerations

Despite the economic arguments favoring income-contingent financing and targeted subsidies, political resistance remains a significant barrier to reform. Coalitions of middle- and high-income families may oppose increased subsidies if they perceive they are subsidizing others disproportionately ([Diris & Ooghe, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiy003)). Additionally, concerns about enrollment declines and access for disadvantaged students often fuel opposition to shifting costs toward students, even when evidence suggests otherwise.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive evidence, college should be made less expensive for students at the point of use, but this does not necessarily mean eliminating all tuition or shifting costs entirely to taxpayers. Instead, financing systems should:

- Utilize income-contingent loans or graduate taxes to align repayments with future earnings, providing insurance and smoothing consumption.
- Maintain targeted grants for low-income and talented students to alleviate short-term credit constraints.
- Avoid regressive tax-financed subsidies that disproportionately burden poorer non-students.
- Invest in early-life interventions to address long-run credit constraints and improve educational attainment.

This balanced approach addresses equity and efficiency concerns, reduces financial barriers, and mitigates behavioral biases without compromising fiscal sustainability or educational quality.

Therefore, **college should be less expensive at the time of enrollment through innovative financing mechanisms rather than through blanket tuition elimination funded by general taxation**. This approach optimizes participation, completion, and social welfare while managing costs and risks effectively.
