# Why Steroids Should Not Be Allowed in Sports: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

The use of steroids, particularly anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), in sports has been a contentious issue for decades. While steroids can enhance physical performance and muscle mass, their use raises significant ethical, health, and fairness concerns. This report examines why steroids should not be allowed in sports, drawing on a wide range of scientific studies, statistics, and expert opinions. The analysis is grounded in the latest and most reliable data available up to 2025, emphasizing the adverse effects on athletes' health, the integrity of sports, and societal implications.

## 1. Health Risks Associated with Steroid Use

### 1.1 Physical Health Consequences

Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone designed to promote muscle growth and enhance athletic performance. However, their misuse is linked to severe health risks:

| Health Issue                  | Description                                                                                   | Prevalence/Severity                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Liver Damage and Cancer       | Steroids can cause liver toxicity, leading to liver disease and even cancer.                   | Up to 3% risk of prostate carcinoma (Kentic, 2022) |
| Cardiovascular Problems       | Includes high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes, and enlargement of the left heart ventricle. | Steroid users have 3x higher premature death rate (Kentic, 2022) |
| Hormonal Imbalances           | Testicular atrophy, infertility, and abnormal hormone levels in men; menstrual irregularities in women. | Common among long-term users (Markkula Center, 2004) |
| Musculoskeletal Injuries      | Tendon ruptures and osteoarthritis due to disproportionate muscle growth versus tendon strength. | Frequent in athletes abusing steroids (Livestrong) |
| Mental Health Disorders       | Mood swings, depression, aggression ("steroid rage"), and addiction.                           | 25% of AAS users develop addiction (Kentic, 2022) |

The above health risks are compounded by the fact that many steroid users self-administer these drugs without medical supervision, increasing the likelihood of misuse and complications (NCBI, 2022).

### 1.2 Addiction and Withdrawal

Contrary to popular belief, anabolic steroids are addictive. Withdrawal symptoms include mood swings, cravings, restlessness, and depression, similar to other substance dependencies (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2022). Approximately 25% of AAS users develop addiction, yet over half never seek treatment due to stigma or lack of awareness (Kentic, 2022).

## 2. Ethical and Fairness Concerns in Sports

### 2.1 Steroids as Cheating

Steroid use violates the implicit social contract in sports that competitions should be fair and based on natural talent and hard work. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits anabolic steroids in all sports worldwide, reflecting a global consensus that steroid use constitutes cheating (WADA, 2022).

Athletes who use steroids gain an unnatural advantage, undermining the principle of equal opportunity. This unfairness is particularly damaging in youth sports, where 1 in 5 high school athletes believe steroids are necessary to succeed professionally (NFHS, 2022).

### 2.2 Impact on Sports Integrity and Role Models

Steroid use damages the credibility of sports and tarnishes athletes' reputations. High-profile cases such as Lance Armstrong and Maria Sharapova illustrate how doping scandals lead to loss of titles, sponsorships, and public trust (CNN, 2016).

Moreover, athletes serve as role models for younger generations. Steroid use by professionals may encourage teens to misuse steroids, risking their health and perpetuating a cycle of doping (Kentic, 2022).

## 3. Prevalence and Enforcement Challenges

### 3.1 Widespread Use Despite Prohibitions

Despite strict bans, steroid use remains prevalent:

| Statistic                                   | Data                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nearly 50% of professional athletes use some form of performance-enhancing drugs (Kentic, 2022). | 2% positive tests among elite athletes, but anonymous surveys suggest up to 57% usage (Kentic, 2022). |
| 44% of teens report steroids are easy to obtain without prescription (HRF, 2022). | 11% of high school boys have tried steroids at least once (HRF, 2022). |
| NFL players have paid up to $4 million in fines for PED use (Sportac, 2020). | NBA suspensions for steroids are rising despite official low positive test numbers (SBNation, 2020). |

### 3.2 Limitations of Testing and Penalties

Testing methods cannot detect all steroids or usage patterns, leading to underreporting. Penalties vary and may not be sufficient deterrents. For example, some leagues impose suspensions but lack lifetime bans or comprehensive rehabilitation programs (Markkula Center, 2004).

## 4. Psychological and Social Implications

Steroid use affects mental health and social relationships:

- Users experience increased aggression and irritability (56% more likely) (HRF, 2022).
- Women perceive steroid-using men as 50% less suitable for long-term relationships (Journal of Substance Use, 2022).
- Steroid addiction can lead to social isolation and stigma (NCBI, 2022).

## 5. Arguments Against Legalizing Steroids in Sports

Some argue for legalization to regulate and reduce harm. However, evidence suggests legalization would increase usage, especially among youth, and exacerbate health risks (HRF, 2022). The ethical issues of fairness and integrity remain unresolved by legalization.

---

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive evidence, steroids should not be allowed in sports for the following reasons:

1. **Severe Health Risks:** Steroid use causes significant physical and mental health problems, including increased risk of premature death.
2. **Unfair Competitive Advantage:** Steroids undermine the fairness and integrity of sports competitions.
3. **Negative Societal Impact:** Steroid use by professional athletes encourages youth misuse and damages sports' role-model function.
4. **Enforcement Challenges:** Despite bans, steroid use remains widespread, and legalization would likely worsen the problem.

Therefore, maintaining strict prohibitions, improving testing, increasing education on health risks, and providing addiction treatment are essential to protect athletes and preserve the integrity of sports.
