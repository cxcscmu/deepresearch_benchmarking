## 1. Historical Background: Colonial Legacy and Nationalist Struggle

### 1.1 French Colonial Rule and Vietnamese Nationalism

Vietnam was part of French Indochina from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. The French colonial administration exploited the region economically and politically, which fostered widespread resentment and nationalist movements among the Vietnamese population. The most prominent of these was the Viet Minh, founded in 1941 by Ho Chi Minh, a communist nationalist leader inspired by Lenin’s Bolshevik Revolution. The Viet Minh aimed to resist both Japanese occupation during World War II and French colonial rule thereafter ([Peace, Marciano, & Kuzmarov, 2017](http://peacehistory-usfp.org/vietnam-war)).

### 1.2 World War II and the Power Vacuum

During World War II, Japan occupied Vietnam, displacing French authority. After Japan’s defeat in 1945, Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnamese independence, modeling his declaration on the American Declaration of Independence. However, the French sought to reassert control, leading to the First Indochina War (1946–1954) between French forces and the Viet Minh. The French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 marked the end of French colonial rule in Vietnam ([Hickman, 2019](https://www.britannica.com/event/Vietnam-War)).

## 2. The Cold War Context and Ideological Conflict

### 2.1 Emergence of the Cold War and Containment Policy

Following World War II, the global geopolitical landscape was dominated by the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. adopted a policy of containment aimed at preventing the spread of communism worldwide, articulated in the Truman Doctrine (1947). This policy viewed communist movements, including those in Vietnam, as extensions of Soviet expansionism, regardless of their nationalist motivations ([Peace, Marciano, & Kuzmarov, 2017](http://peacehistory-usfp.org/vietnam-war)).

### 2.2 Domino Theory and U.S. Strategic Interests

The Domino Theory, popularized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, posited that the fall of one country to communism would lead to the sequential fall of neighboring countries. This theory was a key rationale for U.S. involvement in Vietnam, as policymakers feared that a communist Vietnam would precipitate the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia, threatening U.S. allies and economic interests in the region ([Rohn, 2012](https://thevietnamwar.info/why-did-the-vietnam-war-start)).

## 3. Political Developments in Vietnam Post-1954

### 3.1 Geneva Accords and Division of Vietnam

The 1954 Geneva Accords temporarily divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel, with the communist-led Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in the North under Ho Chi Minh and a non-communist State of Vietnam in the South, initially led by Emperor Bao Dai. National elections were scheduled for 1956 to unify the country, but these elections never took place as the U.S. and South Vietnamese authorities, fearing a communist victory, refused to participate ([Peace, Marciano, & Kuzmarov, 2017](http://peacehistory-usfp.org/vietnam-war); [Hickman, 2019](https://www.britannica.com/event/Vietnam-War)).

### 3.2 Rise and Fall of Ngo Dinh Diem’s Regime

Ngo Dinh Diem, a Catholic nationalist, was installed as Prime Minister and later President of South Vietnam with U.S. support. His regime was authoritarian, repressive, and unpopular, especially among the Buddhist majority. Diem’s persecution of Buddhists and failure to address political dissent led to internal instability and the rise of the National Liberation Front (NLF), or Viet Cong, in the South, which was supported by North Vietnam ([Peace, Marciano, & Kuzmarov, 2017](http://peacehistory-usfp.org/vietnam-war)).

### 3.3 U.S. Military Advisors and Escalation

The U.S. initially provided military advisors and financial aid to support the Diem government and train the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN). Under Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, the number of U.S. advisors increased significantly, reaching 16,000 by 1963. After Diem’s assassination in a U.S.-supported coup in 1963, political instability in South Vietnam intensified, prompting further U.S. involvement ([Peace, Marciano, & Kuzmarov, 2017](http://peacehistory-usfp.org/vietnam-war)).

## 4. The Gulf of Tonkin Incident and U.S. Entry into Open War

In August 1964, the U.S.S. Maddox was allegedly attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. While the first attack on August 2nd was confirmed, the second attack on August 4th was later understood to be a false radar reading. Nevertheless, these incidents were used by President Lyndon B. Johnson to secure congressional approval for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted the president broad authority to escalate U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. This marked the formal entry of the U.S. into open warfare in Vietnam ([Peace, Marciano, & Kuzmarov, 2017](http://peacehistory-usfp.org/vietnam-war); [Rohn, 2012](https://thevietnamwar.info/why-did-the-vietnam-war-start)).

## 6. Critical Analysis and Opinion

The Vietnam War was not a simple civil war or a straightforward conflict between communism and democracy. Rather, it was deeply rooted in Vietnam’s struggle for national independence from colonial rule, complicated by Cold War geopolitics and U.S. strategic interests. The U.S. intervention was largely driven by ideological fears of communism’s spread, often overlooking the nationalist and anti-colonial motivations of Vietnamese actors.

The failure to hold national elections as stipulated in the Geneva Accords was a pivotal moment that entrenched division and conflict. The U.S. support for an authoritarian regime in South Vietnam, despite its lack of popular legitimacy, further alienated the Vietnamese population and contributed to the rise of the Viet Cong insurgency.

The Gulf of Tonkin Incident, while pivotal in escalating U.S. involvement, was based on questionable evidence and was used to justify a war that many Americans and international observers later regarded as unnecessary and unjust. The war’s origins thus reflect a combination of historical grievances, Cold War paranoia, and strategic miscalculations.

In conclusion, the Vietnam War started due to a confluence of colonial history, Cold War ideology, political division, internal repression, and U.S. military escalation. Understanding these causes in their full complexity challenges simplistic narratives and underscores the tragic consequences of misinterpreted national aspirations and geopolitical fears.
