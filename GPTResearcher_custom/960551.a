## Background: Anwar Sadat’s Presidency and Policies

Sadat assumed the presidency in 1970 after the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser. His presidency was marked by several bold and controversial decisions that reshaped Egypt’s domestic and foreign policies. Notably, Sadat:

- Re-instituted a multi-party political system, breaking away from Nasser’s single-party rule.
- Launched the Infitah economic policy, encouraging private investment and opening Egypt’s economy.
- Shifted Egypt’s international alignment from the Soviet Union to the United States.
- Initiated and pursued peace negotiations with Israel, culminating in the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.
- Oversaw the return of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt following the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

These policies, while transformative, generated significant opposition both within Egypt and across the Arab world ([Miller, 2017](https://historycollection.com/27-photos-events-surrounding-anwar-sadat-assassination/); [Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

## The Peace Treaty with Israel: A Catalyst for Opposition

The most contentious of Sadat’s policies was his peace treaty with Israel. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Jerusalem, becoming the first Arab leader to officially recognize Israel since its establishment in 1948. This led to the Camp David Accords in 1978 and the signing of the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979, brokered with the help of U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

### Impact of the Peace Treaty:

| Aspect                          | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recognition of Israel**        | Sadat officially recognized Israel, breaking the Arab consensus of non-recognition.               |
| **Return of Sinai**              | Israel agreed to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, returning it to Egypt in phases by 1982.      |
| **Nobel Peace Prize**            | Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.|
| **Arab World Reaction**          | Egypt was expelled from the Arab League; the League moved its headquarters from Cairo to Tunis.    |
| **Domestic Reaction**            | Mixed; generally favorable among Egyptian citizens but strongly opposed by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. |

The treaty was seen by many Arab states and Islamist groups as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause and Arab unity. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Arab leaders condemned the treaty, with PLO leader Yasser Arafat famously stating, “False peace will not last” ([Miller, 2017](https://historycollection.com/27-photos-events-surrounding-anwar-sadat-assassination/); [Rare Historical Photos, 2024](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/the-assassination-of-anwar-sadat-1981/)).

## Internal Opposition and Political Climate in Egypt

Sadat’s domestic policies also stirred unrest. His economic liberalization (Infitah) led to increased inequality and dissatisfaction among many Egyptians. Furthermore, Sadat’s crackdown on political dissent intensified in the months leading to his assassination.

### Key Internal Factors:

- **Crackdown on Opposition:** Following a failed military coup attempt in June 1981, Sadat arrested approximately 1,500 opposition figures, including members of Islamist groups, intellectuals, and Coptic Christian clergy. He also banned non-governmental press outlets ([Miller, 2017](https://historycollection.com/27-photos-events-surrounding-anwar-sadat-assassination/)).
- **Religious Opposition:** Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, vehemently opposed Sadat’s peace with Israel and his failure to implement Sharia law. They viewed his policies as a betrayal of Islamic principles and Arab solidarity.
- **Economic Discontent:** The Infitah policy, while opening the economy, failed to deliver widespread prosperity, leading to public disillusionment.
- **Perception of Corruption:** Allegations of corruption within Sadat’s regime and family further eroded his support ([New World Encyclopedia, 2024](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Anwar_Sadat)).

## The Assassination: Execution and Perpetrators

On October 6, 1981, during the annual military parade celebrating the crossing of the Suez Canal (Operation Badr), a group of fundamentalist army officers led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli attacked the reviewing stand. They opened fire indiscriminately, killing Sadat and ten others.

### Details of the Assassination:

| Detail                          | Information                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Date and Location**           | October 6, 1981, Cairo, Egypt, during the Victory Parade commemorating the 1973 Yom Kippur War. |
| **Perpetrators**               | Khalid Islambouli and Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj, members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad.           |
| **Casualties**                 | 11 deaths including Anwar Sadat.                                                               |
| **Method**                    | Attackers jumped from a military truck and fired assault rifles at the presidential reviewing stand.|
| **Delay in Response**          | Gunfire was not returned for approximately 45 seconds despite the military presence.             |
| **Aftermath**                 | Islambouli and co-conspirators were tried, sentenced to death, and executed in April 1982.       |

A fatwa authorizing the assassination was reportedly obtained from Omar Abdel-Rahman, a radical cleric later convicted in the U.S. for involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing ([History.com, 2024](https://www.history.com/topics/1970s/assassination-of-egyptian-president-sadat-video); [Miller, 2017](https://historycollection.com/27-photos-events-surrounding-anwar-sadat-assassination/)).

## Motivations Behind the Assassination

The assassination was driven by a confluence of ideological, political, and regional factors:

### 1. **Opposition to Peace with Israel**

Sadat’s peace treaty was the primary motive cited by the assassins and their supporters. The treaty was perceived as a betrayal of the Arab cause and the Palestinian struggle. Islamist militants viewed Sadat’s recognition of Israel as a violation of Islamic and Arab solidarity, warranting violent opposition ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

### 2. **Religious and Ideological Opposition**

The assassins were members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a militant Islamist group that sought to overthrow the secular Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic theocracy. Sadat’s failure to implement Sharia law and his alliance with Western powers, especially the United States, further alienated Islamist factions ([Miller, 2017](https://historycollection.com/27-photos-events-surrounding-anwar-sadat-assassination/)).

### 3. **Political Repression and Internal Unrest**

Sadat’s crackdown on opposition groups, including Islamists, leftist intellectuals, and religious minorities, created an atmosphere of resentment and radicalization. The arrests and suppression of dissent contributed to the radicalization of some military officers who participated in the assassination ([Miller, 2017](https://historycollection.com/27-photos-events-surrounding-anwar-sadat-assassination/)).

### 4. **Regional and International Dynamics**

Sadat suspected that the Soviet Union was involved in fomenting internal unrest by supporting regional allies like Libya and Syria to destabilize his regime. Although this remains debated, it reflects the Cold War context in which Sadat’s policies were enacted ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat)).

## Consequences and Legacy

Sadat’s assassination had profound consequences:

- **Succession:** Vice President Hosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat and ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years.
- **Arab World:** Egypt remained isolated from the Arab League until 1989.
- **Peace Process:** The peace treaty with Israel remained in place, though tensions persisted.
- **Islamist Militancy:** The assassination underscored the rising threat of Islamist militancy in Egypt and the region.

## Conclusion: A Complex Confluence of Factors

Anwar Sadat was assassinated primarily because of his unprecedented peace treaty with Israel, which alienated powerful Islamist groups and many Arab states. This act was compounded by his domestic policies, including political repression and economic liberalization, which fueled internal dissent and radicalization. The assassination was carried out by members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, who viewed Sadat as a traitor to Islam and Arab nationalism.

Sadat’s assassination was not merely an isolated act of violence but the outcome of deep ideological, political, and regional conflicts. It reflected the challenges faced by a leader attempting to navigate between modernization, peace, and traditionalist opposition in a turbulent era.
