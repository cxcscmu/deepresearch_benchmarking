# Report: Why Was Anwar Sadat Assassinated?

## Introduction

Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat, the third President of Egypt, served from 1970 until his assassination on October 6, 1981. His presidency was marked by significant political and economic reforms, a dramatic shift in foreign policy, and a bold peace initiative with Israel that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. However, these same actions also alienated many domestic and regional actors, culminating in his assassination during a military parade in Cairo. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted reasons behind Sadat's assassination, drawing from a wide range of historical, political, and social sources.

## Background: Sadat’s Presidency and Policies

Sadat’s presidency began after the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1970. Initially perceived as a weak leader, he quickly consolidated power through the "Corrective Revolution," purging opponents and steering Egypt away from Soviet influence toward closer relations with the United States. His major policy initiatives included:

- **Re-institution of the multi-party system**: Ending Nasser’s single-party rule to allow limited political pluralism.
- **Economic reforms (Infitah)**: Opening Egypt’s economy to private investment and foreign capital.
- **Realignment of foreign policy**: Breaking ties with the USSR and fostering a strategic partnership with the U.S.
- **Peace process with Israel**: Initiated by the 1977 visit to Jerusalem and culminating in the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.

These moves were revolutionary but controversial, both domestically and across the Arab world.

## The Peace Treaty with Israel: A Catalyst for Opposition

Sadat’s peace treaty with Israel was unprecedented. It marked the first official recognition of Israel by an Arab country and ended decades of hostility. The treaty’s main features included:

| Feature                        | Description                                               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mutual recognition            | Egypt and Israel recognized each other's sovereignty.     |
| Cessation of hostilities      | Ended the state of war since 1948.                         |
| Israeli withdrawal            | Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula in phases.       |
| Diplomatic relations          | Established full diplomatic ties.                          |
| Passage rights                | Guaranteed Israeli ships passage through the Suez Canal.  |

While the treaty was generally popular among many Egyptians, it was vehemently opposed by:

- **The Muslim Brotherhood and Egyptian Islamists**: Viewed Sadat as a traitor who abandoned the Palestinian cause and Islamic solidarity.
- **The Arab League and other Arab states**: Egypt was suspended from the Arab League, and the peace treaty was seen as a betrayal of Arab unity.
- **Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)**: Opposed the treaty for bypassing Arab consensus and compromising Palestinian aspirations.

PLO leader Yasser Arafat famously dismissed the treaty as "false peace" that would not last ([Miller, 2017](https://www.israeladvocacy.org)).

## Domestic Political Repression and Unrest

The last years of Sadat’s rule were marked by increasing internal dissent and political repression:

- **Crackdown on opposition**: In February 1981, Sadat ordered the arrest of approximately 1,500 political opponents, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, intellectuals, activists, and Coptic Christian clergy.
- **Press censorship**: All non-government press was banned.
- **Suppression of dissent**: The crackdown extended across ideological lines, targeting communists, feminists, and other opposition groups.
- **Economic difficulties**: The Infitah economic policies led to inflation and social inequality, fueling public discontent.

These measures alienated many Egyptians and failed to quell the growing opposition, particularly among Islamist groups.

## The Role of Egyptian Islamic Jihad and Militants

The Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), a radical Islamist group, played a central role in Sadat’s assassination. Initially, some Islamists had supported Sadat’s early policies, but his peace treaty with Israel and alignment with the U.S. led to their alienation. Key points include:

- **Recruitment and planning**: EIJ recruited military officers and stockpiled weapons, aiming for a complete overthrow of the secular government.
- **Fatwa approval**: A religious edict (fatwa) authorizing the assassination was obtained from Omar Abdel-Rahman, later convicted in the U.S. for involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
- **Missed intelligence**: Despite a large-scale crackdown, a jihadist cell led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli within the military remained undetected.

The assassination was part of a broader strategy to topple the government and establish an Islamic theocracy ([Wright, 2006](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com)).

## The Assassination Event

On October 6, 1981, during the annual victory parade commemorating the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Sadat was assassinated by members of the military-led EIJ cell:

- **Security lapses**: Despite four layers of security and ammunition restrictions, the assassination squad infiltrated the parade in a military truck.
- **Attack details**: Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli forced the truck to stop near Sadat’s reviewing stand, threw grenades (only one exploded but fell short), and fired assault rifles indiscriminately.
- **Casualties**: Sadat and ten others were killed, including the Cuban ambassador and a Coptic Orthodox bishop. Twenty-eight were wounded, including Vice President Hosni Mubarak.
- **Aftermath**: The assassins were captured, tried, and executed in April 1982.

The attack lasted approximately two minutes, and Sadat died from internal bleeding and shock ([History.com Editors, 2021](https://www.history.com)).

## Broader Context: Political and Ideological Motivations

Several intertwined factors motivated the assassination:

| Factor                       | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Opposition to peace with Israel | Seen as betrayal of the Palestinian cause and Arab unity.                                     |
| Rejection of secular government | Islamists sought to replace the regime with an Islamic theocracy.                            |
| Reaction to repression        | Crackdowns on political and religious opposition fueled resentment and radicalization.       |
| Foreign policy realignment    | Sadat’s alliance with the U.S. and break with the USSR antagonized leftists and Islamists.    |
| Symbolic timing              | The assassination during the victory parade was a dramatic statement against Sadat’s legacy.   |

The assassination was both an act of vengeance and part of a failed coup attempt intended to ignite a broader Islamic revolution in Egypt ([Kamel, 2021](https://www.theafricareport.com)).

## Aftermath and Legacy

- **Political transition**: Vice President Hosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat and ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years.
- **Arab League**: Egypt was suspended from the Arab League until 1989.
- **Islamist movements**: The assassination intensified government crackdowns on Islamist groups.
- **Regional impact**: The peace treaty endured but remained a source of tension in the Arab world.

Sadat’s assassination remains a pivotal moment in Middle Eastern history, illustrating the complex interplay between peace efforts, domestic politics, and radical opposition.

## Conclusion

Anwar Sadat was assassinated primarily due to his groundbreaking peace treaty with Israel, which alienated powerful Islamist factions and Arab states, combined with his repressive domestic policies that intensified opposition. The Egyptian Islamic Jihad, motivated by ideological opposition to Sadat’s secular and pro-Western policies, executed the assassination as part of a broader plan to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state. The assassination was not merely an act of vengeance but a calculated political move embedded in the turbulent context of Egyptian and Middle Eastern politics of the time.
