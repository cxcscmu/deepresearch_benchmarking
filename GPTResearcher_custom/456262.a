# Are Gun Owners More Likely to Be Shot? An In-Depth Analysis

The question of whether gun owners are statistically more likely to be shot and killed is complex and multifaceted. It involves considerations of suicide rates, homicide statistics, social and demographic factors, and the context of gun ownership itself. This report synthesizes data and analyses from multiple reputable sources to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based answer to this question.

## Overview of Gun Ownership and Risk Factors

Gun ownership in the United States is widespread, with approximately 30% of adults reporting owning a gun and an additional 11% living in households with guns (Pew Research Center, 2021). The reasons for owning guns vary, including personal protection, hunting, and recreational shooting. Notably, crime protection has become the dominant reason for ownership in recent years (Gallup, 2021).

However, owning a gun does not occur in a vacuum; the context of ownership—such as the owner's environment, profession, and personal risk factors—plays a crucial role in the likelihood of being shot.

## Suicide and Gun Ownership

One of the most significant factors linking gun ownership to increased risk of death is suicide. Approximately two-thirds of all gun deaths in the U.S. are suicides, and most gun suicides are committed by gun owners themselves (Wacker, 2015). The availability of a firearm increases the lethality of suicide attempts, as firearms have a higher fatality rate compared to other methods.

Chris Everett (2016) highlights that gun owners who commit suicide are more likely to use guns, which increases the risk of fatality. This is a critical consideration because suicide is a leading cause of death among gun owners, skewing statistics on gun-related fatalities.

## Homicide and Gun Ownership

### Relationship Between Gun Ownership and Homicide Rates

Studies indicate that higher rates of gun ownership correlate with higher rates of violent crime, including homicide. A 2015 study found that states with the highest rates of gun possession have nearly three times the rate of gun murders compared to states with the fewest guns (Hughes & DeFilippis, 2015). This study controlled for demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors and found that increased gun ownership is associated with higher rates of firearm-related assault, robbery, and homicide.

Moreover, research by Kivisto et al. (2019) found that firearm ownership correlates strongly with domestic firearm homicides, particularly intimate partner homicides, which disproportionately affect women. States with the highest firearm ownership had a 65% higher incidence rate of domestic firearm homicide compared to states with lower ownership rates.

### Non-Domestic Homicides

Interestingly, Kivisto's study found no significant association between gun ownership rates and non-domestic firearm homicides (e.g., those involving friends, acquaintances, or strangers). This suggests that the increased risk associated with gun ownership is more pronounced within domestic and intimate partner contexts rather than in public or stranger-related violence.

## The Role of Criminality and Illegal Gun Possession

A critical nuance in interpreting statistics on gun-related deaths is the distinction between legal gun owners and those who possess firearms illegally. Michael Fröman (2023) argues that 80–90% of firearm homicide victims have criminal arrest records, while less than 1% of legal gun owners have ever been arrested for any crime. This suggests that a small subset of gun owners involved in criminal activity disproportionately accounts for gun-related homicides.

Paul Odenwelder (2019) further emphasizes that illegal carriers, often involved in criminal activities, are much more likely to be killed by guns and are responsible for the majority of gun crimes. Therefore, lumping all gun owners together without distinguishing legal, law-abiding owners from illegal carriers can skew the perception of risk.

## Selection Bias and Contextual Factors

People who perceive themselves at higher risk of violence are more likely to purchase guns for protection. This creates a selection bias in the data, where gun owners may already be at increased risk due to their environment or occupation (e.g., police officers, prosecutors, jewelry salespeople) (Deserio, 2023; Quora User, 2016). This complicates causal interpretations because gun ownership may be a response to risk rather than the cause of increased risk.

## Perceptions of Safety Among Gun Owners

Despite statistical associations between gun ownership and certain risks, gun owners often report feeling safer in their homes than non-owners. A survey by SafeHome.org (2020) found that gun owners are twice as likely to feel their home is "extremely safe" compared to non-owners (43% vs. 18%). This perception persists regardless of whether the home has a security system.

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, **gun owners in the United States are statistically more likely to be shot and killed**, but this increased risk is nuanced and context-dependent.

- **Suicide is the leading cause of gun-related deaths among gun owners**, significantly elevating their risk of fatal gunshot incidents.
- **Domestic firearm homicides are more common in states with higher gun ownership**, disproportionately affecting women and intimate partners.
- **There is no clear statistical association between gun ownership and non-domestic firearm homicides**, suggesting that gun owners are not necessarily at higher risk from strangers or acquaintances.
- **Illegal gun carriers and individuals involved in criminal activities account for a disproportionate share of gun homicides**, complicating the interpretation of risk among legal gun owners.
- **Selection bias exists**, as individuals in higher-risk environments are more likely to own guns, which may inflate the apparent risk associated with ownership.
- Despite these risks, **gun owners often perceive their homes as safer**, reflecting the complex interplay between objective risk and subjective safety.

Therefore, while owning a gun does correlate with a higher likelihood of being shot or killed statistically, this relationship is mediated by factors such as suicide risk, domestic violence, criminal involvement, and environmental context. It is not simply the act of owning a gun that increases risk but the broader circumstances surrounding ownership.

This report aims to provide an objective, data-driven perspective on the statistical risks faced by gun owners regarding being shot or killed. The evidence suggests a nuanced reality where gun ownership is associated with increased risk primarily due to suicide and domestic violence contexts, rather than a direct causal effect of ownership alone.
