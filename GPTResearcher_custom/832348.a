# How the Coronavirus Could Trigger a Backslide on Freedom Around the World

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented global health crisis, has had profound effects beyond public health, notably impacting democratic governance, civil liberties, and human rights worldwide. While some restrictions on freedoms were necessary to curb the virus's spread, the pandemic has also provided governments—both authoritarian and democratic—with opportunities to expand their powers, often at the expense of fundamental freedoms. This report examines how the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a backslide on freedom globally, analyzing the mechanisms through which this erosion has occurred, the scale and nature of the impact, and the implications for the future of democracy and human rights.

## Overview of Freedom Decline During the Pandemic

Freedom House's report "Democracy under Lockdown" highlights that since the outbreak began, the condition of democracy and human rights has deteriorated in 80 countries, with particularly severe effects in struggling democracies and authoritarian states ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)). The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IIDEA) similarly reports that the world is becoming more authoritarian, with COVID-19 accelerating democratic backsliding trends that predated the pandemic ([Boehm, 2021](https://reason.com/2021/11/23/covid-19-made-democracies-more-authoritarian-and-authoritarian-regimes-even-worse/)).

The Human Freedom Index (HFI) published by the Cato Institute and Fraser Institute shows that 83% of the global population has experienced a decline in liberty since 2008, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 ([Washington Times Editorial Board, 2021](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/dec/22/editorial-omicron-and-the-fall-of-human-freedom/)).

## Mechanisms of Freedom Erosion Triggered by COVID-19

### 1. Abuse of Emergency Powers and Executive Overreach

Governments worldwide have invoked emergency powers to impose lockdowns, curfews, and movement restrictions. While some measures were necessary for public health, many governments have used these powers disproportionately, indefinitely, or without adequate oversight, undermining democratic checks and balances.

- **Violence and Arbitrary Detentions:** Freedom House found police violence against civilians in at least 59 countries and increased detentions in 66 countries during the pandemic ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Legislative and Judicial Undermining:** Parliaments have been sidelined or manipulated, with emergency laws passed that curtail freedoms under the guise of pandemic control. For example, Hungary granted its prime minister indefinite decree powers, and Singapore passed laws curbing freedoms ostensibly to fight COVID-19 ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Silencing Opposition and Critics:** Several governments have arrested activists, journalists, and political opponents, using pandemic restrictions as a pretext. In Cambodia, Turkey, and Egypt, political repression intensified during the crisis ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

### 2. Disproportionate Impact on Marginalized Groups

The pandemic response has often exacerbated existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting minorities and vulnerable populations.

- **Discriminatory Restrictions:** In Kuwait, noncitizen neighborhoods faced stricter lockdowns than citizen areas; in Bulgaria, Romany communities were subject to harsher movement controls ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Scapegoating and Hate Speech:** Muslims in India and Sri Lanka were labeled "superspreaders," fueling xenophobia and hate crimes. Similar stigmatization occurred against migrants in Serbia and LGBTQ+ individuals in Turkey ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Barriers to Healthcare and Protection:** Refugees, migrants, and marginalized groups often faced restricted access to testing, treatment, and quarantine facilities, sometimes living in overcrowded camps with inadequate sanitation ([Human Rights Watch, 2020](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/covid-19-human-rights-checklist)).

### 3. Decline in Government Transparency and Rise in Corruption

Transparency in pandemic data and government actions has been lacking, leading to mistrust and enabling corruption.

- **Misinformation and Denialism:** Governments in Nicaragua and Turkmenistan denied the virus's existence; Brazil and Tanzania promoted unverified treatments ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Distrust in Official Information:** 62% of experts surveyed distrusted their national governments' pandemic information, rising to 77% in "Not Free" countries ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Corruption in Fund Distribution:** Rapid disbursement of emergency funds without oversight has led to embezzlement and misuse, such as in Mauritania and Bosnia and Herzegovina ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

### 4. Restrictions on Media Freedom and Free Expression

Independent media have faced unprecedented constraints, limiting public access to accurate information and reducing government accountability.

- **Media Censorship and Harassment:** At least 91 countries imposed media restrictions; journalists were arrested, intimidated, or had their outlets shut down ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Legislation Against "Fake News":** New laws criminalizing misinformation have been used to suppress dissent and critical reporting, as seen in Bolivia and other countries ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Self-Censorship:** Fear of reprisals has led to journalists and activists exercising caution in criticizing government responses ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

### 5. Disruption and Manipulation of Elections

The pandemic has disrupted electoral processes, sometimes used as a tool to delay or manipulate elections.

- **Postponed or Delayed Elections:** National elections in nine countries were postponed, often without clear rescheduling plans, weakening democratic legitimacy ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Manipulated Electoral Processes:** In Sri Lanka, the dissolution of parliament and delayed elections enabled executive rule without legislative checks; in Belarus, elections were marred by repression and fraud ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

- **Challenges in Voting Access:** In the U.S., pandemic-related disruptions led to confusion and barriers in voting, especially in primary elections, raising concerns about preparedness for nationwide elections ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

### 6. Expansion of Digital Surveillance and Privacy Erosion

Governments have increasingly used digital technologies for contact tracing and quarantine enforcement, raising privacy and human rights concerns.

- **Mass Surveillance Technologies:** Use of GPS tracking, facial recognition, drones, and mobile apps has expanded, often without adequate legal safeguards or transparency ([Sekalala et al., 2020](https://www.hhrjournal.org/2020/12/analyzing-the-human-rights-impact-of-increased-digital-public-health-surveillance-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)).

- **Discriminatory Impacts:** Digital surveillance disproportionately affects marginalized groups, including migrants and LGBTQ+ populations, who may face coercion or exclusion due to mandatory app usage ([Sekalala et al., 2020](https://www.hhrjournal.org/2020/12/analyzing-the-human-rights-impact-of-increased-digital-public-health-surveillance-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)).

- **Risk of Permanent Surveillance:** There is concern that emergency surveillance measures will become normalized post-pandemic, eroding privacy and civil liberties long-term ([Human Rights Watch et al., 2020](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/02/governments-should-respect-rights-covid-19-surveillance)).

## Case Studies Illustrating Freedom Backslide

### Hungary: Executive Overreach

Hungary's government granted the prime minister the power to rule by decree indefinitely, criminalizing "false" information about COVID-19, effectively silencing dissent and consolidating authoritarian control ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

### India: Scapegoating Minorities and Mandatory Surveillance

Muslims were stigmatized as "superspreaders," fueling communal tensions. The Aarogya Setu contact tracing app became mandatory for all employees, raising concerns about privacy and coercion, especially among vulnerable migrant workers ([Sekalala et al., 2020](https://www.hhrjournal.org/2020/12/analyzing-the-human-rights-impact-of-increased-digital-public-health-surveillance-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)).

### United States: Misinformation and Election Challenges

The Trump administration's dissemination of misinformation undermined public health efforts. Primary elections faced logistical challenges due to the pandemic, with concerns about voter suppression and preparedness for the 2020 general election ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

### Belarus: Protest and Repression

Mass protests erupted following a fraudulent election amid a deadly COVID-19 outbreak, with security forces responding with brutality, illustrating the intersection of health crisis and political repression ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

## Long-Term Implications and Risks

The pandemic's impact on freedom is unlikely to be temporary. Emergency laws and surveillance measures risk becoming permanent fixtures, eroding democratic norms and human rights protections. The normalization of militarized enforcement and digital surveillance threatens privacy, freedom of expression, and assembly.

Moreover, the pandemic has exposed and intensified inequalities, risking the marginalization of vulnerable groups and undermining social cohesion. Without robust democratic institutions and civil society engagement, the backslide could deepen, threatening global democratic governance.

## Recommendations to Mitigate Freedom Backslide

Based on the findings, several measures are essential to protect freedoms during and after the pandemic:

1. **Transparency and Accountability:** Governments must provide clear, accurate information and be accountable for emergency measures.

2. **Time-Bound Emergency Powers:** Restrictions should be proportional, necessary, and include sunset clauses with legislative oversight.

3. **Protection of Vulnerable Groups:** Policies must ensure non-discrimination and equitable access to healthcare and services.

4. **Safeguards for Media Freedom:** Independent journalism should be protected to ensure public access to information.

5. **Democratic Electoral Processes:** Elections should be held with appropriate health measures, ensuring inclusivity and fairness.

6. **Privacy Protections in Surveillance:** Digital tools must comply with human rights standards of legality, necessity, and proportionality, with independent oversight.

7. **Support for Civil Society:** Funding and operational support for human rights defenders and activists should be maintained.

## Conclusion

The coronavirus pandemic has acted as both a magnifier and accelerator of pre-existing trends toward authoritarianism and democratic erosion worldwide. While some restrictions on freedoms were necessary for public health, the pandemic has been exploited by many governments to expand powers, suppress dissent, and undermine democratic institutions. The disproportionate impact on marginalized groups and the rise of intrusive surveillance pose additional threats to human rights.

To prevent a permanent backslide on freedom, it is imperative that governments, civil society, and the international community uphold democratic principles, ensure transparency, protect vulnerable populations, and safeguard fundamental rights. The pandemic's legacy need not be one of diminished freedom but can serve as a catalyst for renewed commitment to democratic governance and human rights.
