# How the Coronavirus Could Trigger a Backslide on Freedom Around the World

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019, has not only posed an unprecedented global public health emergency but has also precipitated a profound crisis for democracy and human rights worldwide. While governments have been compelled to adopt emergency measures to curb the spread of the virus, these actions have frequently resulted in significant restrictions on civil liberties, democratic governance, and human rights. This report examines how the coronavirus pandemic has triggered a backslide on freedom globally, analyzing the mechanisms through which authoritarian tendencies have been exacerbated, the erosion of democratic institutions, and the long-term implications for political rights and civil liberties.

## The Preexisting Decline in Global Freedom and the Pandemic’s Exacerbation

Freedom House's research documents a 15-year consecutive decline in global freedom, with 2020 marking the 15th consecutive year of deterioration ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown)). The pandemic has accelerated this negative trend, with 80 countries experiencing a worsening in the condition of democracy and human rights since the outbreak began ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)). Notably, the decline is particularly acute in struggling democracies and highly repressive states, where weak institutional safeguards have allowed governments to exploit the crisis to consolidate power and suppress dissent.

Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House, emphasizes that "governments in every part of the world have abused their powers in the name of public health, seizing the opportunity to undermine democracy and human rights" ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)). This exploitation of the pandemic has manifested in various forms, including the imposition of excessive emergency powers, suppression of free expression, and undermining of electoral processes.

## Mechanisms of Democratic Backsliding During the Pandemic

### 1. Abuse of Emergency Powers and Authoritarian Governance

Governments worldwide have invoked emergency powers to implement public health measures such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and surveillance. While some restrictions were necessary to combat the virus, many states adopted excessive and disproportionate measures that extended beyond public health needs, threatening fundamental rights and freedoms ([Hathaway & Stevens, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/7/1/lsaa064/5912724)).

These emergency powers have often been used to bypass or suspend democratic controls, centralize decision-making, and curtail civil liberties. The pandemic has thus served as a catalyst for authoritarianization, even in well-established liberal democracies, as governments enacted rule by decree, expanded surveillance, and detained individuals without due process ([Hathaway & Stevens, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/7/1/lsaa064/5912724)).

### 2. Suppression of Free Speech and Media

Restrictions on freedom of expression have intensified during the pandemic. Governments in at least 91 countries imposed limitations on the news media, including new legislation against "fake news" related to COVID-19, suspension of newspaper printing, blocking of websites, and limiting independent questioning during press briefings ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)).

Such measures have been used not only to control misinformation but also to silence critics and cover up governmental mismanagement of the crisis. This suppression undermines transparency and accountability, essential pillars of democratic governance ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/spotlight-freedom-impact-coronavirus-basic-freedoms)).

### 3. Erosion of Electoral Integrity and Political Rights

The pandemic disrupted electoral processes worldwide, with many elections postponed, modified, or conducted under restrictive conditions that compromised their credibility. Delays and changes to voting procedures have raised concerns about the fairness and inclusiveness of elections, further weakening political rights ([Just Security, 2020](https://www.justsecurity.org/73520/covid-19-and-international-law-series-human-rights-law-civil-and-political-rights/)).

Moreover, some governments exploited the crisis to suppress opposition parties and restrict political assembly, undermining democratic competition and pluralism ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown)).

### 4. Increased Surveillance and Privacy Intrusions

To track and contain the virus, many states implemented intrusive surveillance measures, including contact tracing apps and monitoring of individuals' movements. While these tools can be effective in public health responses, their deployment without adequate safeguards has led to violations of privacy and potential misuse for political purposes ([Just Security, 2020](https://www.justsecurity.org/73520/covid-19-and-international-law-series-human-rights-law-civil-and-political-rights/)).

The normalization of such surveillance risks entrenching authoritarian control beyond the pandemic, as governments may retain or expand these powers ([Hathaway & Stevens, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/7/1/lsaa064/5912724)).

### 5. Disproportionate Impact on Vulnerable Populations

The pandemic response has often neglected the protection of vulnerable groups, exacerbating existing inequalities and human rights violations. Restrictions have disproportionately affected marginalized communities, including ethnic minorities, refugees, and economically disadvantaged populations, limiting their access to healthcare, justice, and social services ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown)).

This neglect undermines the principle of equality before the law and the state's duty to protect all citizens' rights.

## Quantitative Evidence of Democratic Decline

The Freedom House survey of 398 experts across 105 countries revealed that more than 60% of respondents predicted the pandemic’s impact on political rights and civil liberties would be mostly negative for the next three to five years ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)). Additionally, of the 79 countries and territories that experienced a net decline in freedom in 2020, nearly 45% of these declines were directly related to the pandemic ([Slipowitz, 2021](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/devastating-impact-covid-19-democracy)).

| Indicator                         | Number of Countries Affected | Percentage of Total Declines |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Decline in democracy since 2020  | 79                           | 100%                        |
| Declines related to COVID-19      | 35                           | ~45%                        |
| Countries with worsened democracy | 80                           | N/A                         |
| Countries restricting media       | 91                           | N/A                         |

## Case Examples of Authoritarian Exploitation

Several countries illustrate how COVID-19 has been used as a pretext for authoritarian measures:

- **Cambodia:** The government reportedly used the pandemic as an opportunity to "demolish democratic space," intensifying repression ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/democracy-under-lockdown)).

- **Turkey:** Authorities exploited the crisis to implement pre-planned oppressive actions, using coronavirus restrictions as justification ([USGLC, 2020](https://www.usglc.org/coronavirus/democracy/)).

- **China:** The government intensified control over thought and movement, leading to a significant decline in freedom rankings ([Washington Times, 2021](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/dec/22/editorial-omicron-and-the-fall-of-human-freedom/)).

- **Argentina:** A state of emergency restricted constitutional rights, militarized public spaces, and limited access to justice ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_issues_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic)).

These examples highlight the global nature of the democratic backslide, transcending geographic and political boundaries.

## The Balancing Act: Public Health vs. Human Rights

The pandemic has forced governments to navigate a "wicked" balancing act between protecting public health and safeguarding human rights ([Joseph, 2020](https://theconversation.com/covid-19-risk-and-rights-the-wicked-balancing-act-for-governments-146014)). While restrictions such as lockdowns and travel bans are necessary to prevent virus spread, they inherently interfere with economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights.

The challenge lies in ensuring that emergency measures are:

- **Necessary and proportionate:** Restrictions should be strictly limited to what is essential for public health.

- **Time-bound:** Emergency powers must have clear expiration dates.

- **Transparent and accountable:** Governments should provide accurate information and allow for oversight.

Failure to adhere to these principles risks normalizing authoritarian governance and eroding democratic norms.

## The Risk of a Lasting Backslide

Experts warn that the new COVID-era laws and practices will be difficult to reverse, with harm to fundamental human rights persisting long after the pandemic ends ([Freedom House, 2020](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-democracy-under-lockdown-impact-covid-19-global-freedom)). The erosion of trust in institutions, suppression of dissent, and weakening of democratic checks and balances may entrench authoritarianism.

Moreover, the politicization of the pandemic, including unequal vaccine distribution and the emergence of new variants, threatens to prolong the health crisis and exacerbate democratic decline ([Slipowitz, 2021](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/devastating-impact-covid-19-democracy)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst accelerating a global backslide on freedom, democracy, and human rights. Governments across the spectrum—from authoritarian regimes to liberal democracies—have adopted emergency measures that, while sometimes necessary, have often been excessive, disproportionate, and exploited for political gain. The suppression of free speech, erosion of electoral integrity, increased surveillance, and neglect of vulnerable populations collectively signal a troubling regression in global democratic governance.

To mitigate this backslide, it is imperative that:

- Emergency powers be strictly limited in scope and duration.

- Independent media and civil society be protected to ensure transparency and accountability.

- Electoral processes be safeguarded to maintain political rights.

- Surveillance measures include robust privacy protections.

- International bodies monitor and hold governments accountable for human rights violations.

Failure to act risks entrenching authoritarianism and undermining the resilience of democracies in the face of future crises.
