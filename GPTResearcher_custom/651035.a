# Why Did *Criminal Minds* End? An In-Depth Analysis

*Criminal Minds*, a CBS crime procedural drama, concluded its 15-season run in February 2020 after more than 300 episodes. The series, which debuted in 2005, followed the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) as they profiled and apprehended dangerous criminals, or "unsubs." Despite its long-standing popularity and dedicated fan base, the show was ultimately canceled. This report aims to provide a comprehensive and well-structured analysis of the multifaceted reasons behind the end of *Criminal Minds*, drawing on a variety of reliable sources and data.

## Declining Ratings and Viewership

One of the most significant factors contributing to the cancellation of *Criminal Minds* was its declining ratings over the years. Television networks primarily rely on ratings to attract advertisers and generate revenue. A show with high viewership can command premium advertising rates, ensuring profitability and longevity. Conversely, declining ratings often signal diminishing returns, prompting networks to reconsider renewals.

- During the 2008-09 season, *Criminal Minds* ranked as the 11th-most-watched show on broadcast TV.
- By the 2018-19 season, the show had dropped just outside the top 40, averaging 8.22 million viewers ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/144397/the-real-reason-criminal-minds-is-being-canceled/)).
- The 15th season averaged a 0.71 rating in the 18-49 demographic and 4.71 million viewers, representing a 7% decline in the key demographic compared to season 14, though viewership was up slightly by 1% ([TV Series Finale, 2020](https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/criminal-minds-season-16-has-the-cbs-series-been-cancelled-renewed/)).

The steady decline in ratings indicated that *Criminal Minds* was no longer a top-tier performer for CBS, making it less attractive from a business perspective.

## Network Programming Strategy and Aging Lineup

CBS was at a crossroads during the late 2010s, facing the end of its highest-rated comedy, *The Big Bang Theory*, in 2019. Additionally, many of its flagship primetime shows, including *Blue Bloods*, *Big Brother*, *Survivor*, *NCIS*, and *NCIS: Los Angeles*, had all been on air for over ten seasons. This aging lineup suggested a need for fresh programming to attract new viewers and advertisers.

- The network ordered seven new shows for the 2019-2020 season, signaling a strategic pivot towards new content ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/144397/the-real-reason-criminal-minds-is-being-canceled/)).
- The final season of *Criminal Minds* was shortened to just 10 episodes, compared to the standard 22-episode order, indicating reduced network investment and interest ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/144397/the-real-reason-criminal-minds-is-being-canceled/)).

This shift reflected CBS’s intention to rejuvenate its primetime slate, making room for new shows that could potentially perform better in ratings and appeal to evolving audience tastes.

## Financial Considerations: Cast Salaries and Production Costs

Financial factors also played a crucial role in the decision to end *Criminal Minds*. In 2017, original cast members Kirsten Vangsness and A.J. Cook signed new contracts that included substantial raises, bringing their salaries on par with well-paid co-star Matthew Gray Gubler. These increased salaries added to the overall production costs of the show.

- Despite the declining ratings, the show maintained a relatively high salary structure for its main cast, which likely strained the budget ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/144397/the-real-reason-criminal-minds-is-being-canceled/)).
- With lower viewership, the cost-to-benefit ratio for CBS became less favorable, making cancellation a financially prudent choice.

---

## Creative Exhaustion and Series Longevity

*Criminal Minds* had an exceptionally long run, spanning 15 seasons and over 300 episodes, placing it among the most enduring network dramas in television history. However, such longevity also brings challenges:

- The show’s premise—profiling and capturing serial killers and other dangerous criminals—had been explored extensively, leading to a natural creative plateau.
- The series began to feel dated, as the pool of plausible and compelling "unsubs" diminished over time ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/144397/the-real-reason-criminal-minds-is-being-canceled/)).
- The show experienced a high turnover rate among cast members, which may have affected viewer attachment and narrative consistency.

These factors contributed to a sense that the series had run its natural course, making it an appropriate time to conclude the story.

---

## Timing and Network Decision-Making Process

The timing of renewals and episode orders also reflected CBS’s ambivalence about the show’s future:

- The renewal for season 14 came "down to the wire," indicating hesitation from the network ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/144397/the-real-reason-criminal-minds-is-being-canceled/)).
- The shortened episode orders for seasons 14 and 15 suggested a winding down rather than a full commitment to the series.
- The final season aired over just 10 weeks, after which CBS cleared the schedule for new programming to develop and attract advertising revenue.

This cautious approach signaled that CBS was preparing to move on from *Criminal Minds*.

## The Series Finale and Legacy

Despite the cancellation, the show’s creators and network made efforts to provide a satisfying conclusion for fans and cast alike:

- The 15th season was announced as the final season well in advance, allowing writers to craft a justified and emotionally resonant ending for all characters ([Republic World, 2020](https://www.republicworld.com/entertainment-news/television-news/criminal-minds-ending-explained-heres-how-the-cast-bid-adieu.html)).
- The finale featured a retrospective tone, revisiting past characters and storylines, and emphasizing the family dynamic of the BAU team ([Looper, 2020](https://www.looper.com/190481/the-ending-of-criminal-minds-explained/)).
- Fan and critical reception to the finale was overwhelmingly positive, with many praising the respectful and heartfelt send-off ([Country Living, 2020](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a31018774/criminal-minds-series-finale-reactions/)).

## Conclusion

The cancellation of *Criminal Minds* was the result of a confluence of factors rather than a single cause. While the show remained popular and had a dedicated fan base, its declining ratings and viewership made it less profitable for CBS. Financial considerations, including rising cast salaries, further strained the show's viability. Additionally, the network's strategic pivot toward new programming and the natural creative exhaustion of a long-running series contributed to the decision.

Importantly, CBS and the show's creators handled the conclusion with respect and care, providing fans with a meaningful farewell that honored the series' legacy. The end of *Criminal Minds* marks not just the conclusion of a beloved show but also a transition point for CBS as it seeks to refresh its primetime lineup for a new era.
