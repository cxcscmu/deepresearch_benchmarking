# Report: Social Factors Influencing the Development of Correctional Philosophies

## Introduction

Correctional philosophies have evolved significantly over time, reflecting the changing social fabric of society. These philosophies guide how societies punish, rehabilitate, and manage offenders. Understanding the underlying social factors that have influenced these developments is crucial for comprehending current correctional policies and anticipating future trends. This report explores specific social factors that have shaped correctional philosophies, drawing on historical and contemporary evidence, and analyzes their impact on penal systems and correctional models.

## Overview of Correctional Philosophies and Models

Correctional philosophies generally revolve around four main goals: incapacitation, deterrence, rehabilitation, and retribution. These goals have manifested in various correctional models, including:

- **Reform Movement:** Emphasizes rehabilitation and moral reform.
- **Medical Model:** Views criminal behavior as a disease to be treated.
- **Community Model:** Focuses on reintegration and community-based corrections.
- **Crime Control Model:** Prioritizes punishment and public safety through strict law enforcement.

Each model corresponds to specific social contexts and prevailing societal attitudes toward crime and offenders ([Rubin & Phelps, 2017](https://www.phenomenalresource.com)).

## Specific Underlying Social Factors Influencing Correctional Philosophies

The development of correctional philosophies has been influenced by several interrelated social factors, including:

### 1. Social Perceptions of Crime and Offenders

Historically, society's view of offenders has shifted from seeing them as morally corrupt individuals deserving harsh punishment to recognizing the potential for reform and rehabilitation. Early penal systems, such as the Pennsylvania model, were based on the belief that isolation and reflection could lead to remorse and change, reflecting a social trend toward humanizing offenders and promoting individual rights ([Crump, 2006](https://www.phenomenalresource.com)).

However, during periods of social unrest or perceived crime waves, such as the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s, public fear and demand for safety led to a "get tough on crime" approach. This social environment fostered political pressure for harsher sentencing, particularly for drug offenses, resulting in policies that increased incarceration rates dramatically ([Schimmel, eNotes, 2020](https://www.enotes.com)).

### 2. Economic Conditions and Labor Market Changes

Economic factors have played a significant role in shaping correctional philosophies. Economic downturns and the loss of low-skilled jobs due to globalization and outsourcing have increased unemployment among vulnerable populations, which correlates with higher crime rates and incarceration ([Schimmel, eNotes, 2020](https://www.enotes.com)).

Moreover, the rise of the prison-industrial complex, where private companies profit from building and operating prisons, has created economic incentives to maintain or increase incarceration rates. This has influenced correctional policies toward longer sentences and expanded prison populations, reflecting economic interests intertwined with social control ([Koren, eNotes, 2020](https://www.enotes.com)).

### 3. Political Climate and Policy Responses

Political attitudes and policies are deeply influenced by social perceptions and economic realities. The war on drugs exemplifies how social fears about drug use translated into political action, leading to stringent drug laws and mandatory minimum sentences. The abolition of federal parole in 1987 further entrenched these punitive approaches ([Koren, eNotes, 2020](https://www.enotes.com)).

Conversely, economic constraints in recent years have prompted political debates about reducing incarceration rates and investing in alternative correctional programs. This shift reflects a social trend toward recognizing the unsustainability of mass incarceration and the need for cost-effective, rehabilitative approaches ([Schimmel, eNotes, 2020](https://www.enotes.com)).

### 4. Social Movements and Human Rights Awareness

The rise of social movements advocating for civil rights, prisoners' rights, and criminal justice reform has influenced correctional philosophies by emphasizing rehabilitation, dignity, and social reintegration. These movements have challenged punitive models and promoted community-based corrections and restorative justice approaches ([Rubin & Phelps, 2017](https://www.phenomenalresource.com)).

### 5. Scientific and Medical Advances

Advances in psychology, sociology, and criminology have shifted social understanding of criminal behavior from moral failing to complex interactions of biological, psychological, and social factors. This has led to the adoption of the medical model, focusing on treatment and rehabilitation rather than solely punishment ([Durre Zahid, Academia.edu, 2020](https://www.academia.edu)).

## Relationship Between Social Views and Penal Systems

The evolution of penal systems illustrates how social factors shape correctional philosophies:

| Penal System       | Social View of Offenders                         | Major Attributes                            | Influence of Social Trends                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Pennsylvania Model  | Offenders as reformable individuals needing isolation for reflection | Solitary confinement, human welfare focus, labor | Reflects Enlightenment ideals of individual rights and moral reform ([Crump, 2006](https://www.phenomenalresource.com)) |
| Auburn Model       | Offenders as capable of reform through discipline and labor | Congregate labor system, strict discipline | Response to social need for order and productivity in early industrial society |
| Southern Model     | Offenders as needing control and labor exploitation | Harsh conditions, racial segregation | Reflects social hierarchies and economic exploitation in the South |
| Western Model      | Offenders as threats requiring containment | Emphasis on security and punishment | Reflects frontier social conditions and lawlessness |

These systems evolved as society's views on crime and punishment shifted, influenced by economic needs, social values, and political pressures ([Rubin & Phelps, 2017](https://www.phenomenalresource.com)).

## Impact of Social Trends on Correctional Models

- **Reform Movement:** Emerged from social optimism and belief in human perfectibility during the Enlightenment, promoting rehabilitation and humane treatment.
- **Medical Model:** Developed alongside advances in psychology and medicine, reflecting social trends toward scientific understanding of behavior.
- **Community Model:** Influenced by social movements emphasizing reintegration and restorative justice.
- **Crime Control Model:** A reaction to social anxieties about rising crime, emphasizing punishment and incapacitation.

These models demonstrate how social trends directly influence correctional philosophies and practices ([Rubin & Phelps, 2017](https://www.phenomenalresource.com)).

## Conclusion

Specific underlying social factors have profoundly influenced the development of correctional philosophies. Social perceptions of crime and offenders, economic conditions, political climates, social movements, and scientific advances have all played pivotal roles. These factors have shaped the evolution of penal systems and correctional models, reflecting society's changing values and priorities.

Understanding these influences is essential for developing effective, just, and sustainable correctional policies that respond to contemporary social realities while respecting human rights and promoting public safety.
