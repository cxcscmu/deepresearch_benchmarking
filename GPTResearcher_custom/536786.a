## Introduction

Public opinion refers to the collective attitudes and beliefs held by the American people about various issues, including their confidence and trust in institutions such as the government, military, media, and educational systems. Measuring this opinion accurately is essential for understanding societal dynamics and the legitimacy of institutions. This report examines the evolution, methodologies, and current practices in measuring public opinion about American institutions, supported by recent data and scholarly insights.

## Historical Context and Evolution of Measurement Techniques

The systematic measurement of public opinion in the United States began in the early 20th century, with pioneers like George Gallup and Elmo Roper developing statistical polling techniques in the 1930s. Gallup’s methods, for example, were refined after notable prediction errors such as the 1948 presidential election, highlighting the importance of representative sampling and methodological rigor ([CliffsNotes, n.d.](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/american-government/public-opinion/public-opinion-and-how-its-measured)).

Initially, surveys were conducted primarily via telephone interviews with live interviewers randomly selecting respondents. However, with technological advances and the rise of the internet, online surveys have become dominant, offering faster data collection and broader reach while introducing new challenges related to sampling and response biases ([Pew Research Center, n.d.](https://www.pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/)).

## Core Methodologies in Measuring Public Opinion

### Sampling Techniques

Accurate measurement hinges on representative sampling. Pollsters use random sampling methods to select participants that reflect the demographic and geographic diversity of the U.S. population. This includes stratified sampling to ensure subgroups (e.g., age, race, region) are proportionally represented. Adjustments such as weighting are applied to correct for nonresponse and sampling errors ([CliffsNotes, n.d.](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/american-government/public-opinion/public-opinion-and-how-its-measured)).

### Survey Modes

- **Telephone Surveys:** Traditional method using live interviewers; still used but declining.
- **Online Surveys:** Increasingly prevalent due to cost-effectiveness and speed; often use panels like Pew’s American Trends Panel.
- **Mixed-Mode Surveys:** Combine telephone and online to balance coverage and response rates ([Pew Research Center, n.d.](https://www.pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/)).

### Question Design and Wording

Question wording critically influences responses. Pollsters carefully craft questions to avoid bias and ensure clarity. For example, Gallup distinguishes between "confidence" and "trust," though in practice, these concepts often overlap in public perception ([Ethics Alarms, 2021](https://ethicsalarms.com/2021/07/18/gallups-institutional-trust-poll/)).

### Measurement Scales

Confidence and trust are typically measured on Likert-type scales, such as:

- "A great deal"
- "Quite a lot"
- "Some"
- "Very little"
- "None at all"

Aggregating responses of “a great deal” and “quite a lot” often defines the proportion expressing significant confidence or trust in an institution ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/352316/americans-confidence-major-institutions-dips.aspx)).

## Key Institutions and Metrics Tracked

Gallup has tracked public confidence in 14 core U.S. institutions since 1993, with data extending back to 1973 for some. These include:

- Small business
- Military
- Police
- Medical system
- Public schools
- Congress
- Television news
- Big business
- Criminal justice system
- Newspapers
- Organized labor
- The presidency
- The church and organized religion

Morning Consult expands this list to 18 institutions, including local and state governments, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the electoral system ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/352316/americans-confidence-major-institutions-dips.aspx); [Morning Consult, 2022](https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trust-in-institutions/)).

## Trends in Public Confidence and Trust

### Overall Confidence Levels

- Average confidence in the 14 institutions tracked by Gallup has remained relatively low over the past 15 years, never exceeding 36% on average, compared to more common averages above 40% before 2006.
- In 2021, the average confidence was 33%, down from 36% in 2020, reflecting a post-pandemic decline after a temporary increase during early COVID-19 months ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/352316/americans-confidence-major-institutions-dips.aspx)).

### Institutions with Highest and Lowest Confidence

| Institution       | Confidence Level (%) | Notes                              |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Military          | ~74 (2018)           | Most trusted institution          |
| Small Business    | ~67 (2018)           | Widely trusted for community role |
| Police            | ~54 (2018); increased trust in 2021 | Only institution with rising trust in 2021 |
| Medical System    | ~44 (2021)           | Moderate confidence               |
| Organized Labor   | ~28 (2021)           | Lower confidence                  |
| Congress          | ~11-12 (2019-2021)   | Consistently lowest confidence    |
| Television News   | ~20 (2018)           | Low confidence                   |
| Big Business      | ≤21 (2021)           | Low confidence                   |

### Political Polarization

Confidence in many institutions is politically polarized, with differing levels of trust between partisan groups, complicating interpretation and measurement ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/352316/americans-confidence-major-institutions-dips.aspx)).

## Challenges and Considerations in Measuring Public Opinion

### Sampling Bias and Representation

Ensuring representative samples is increasingly challenging due to declining response rates and demographic shifts. Online surveys may exclude populations with limited internet access, requiring weighting adjustments ([Pew Research Center, n.d.](https://www.pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/)).

### Question Interpretation

Respondents may interpret "confidence" and "trust" differently, although these terms are often used interchangeably in polling. This semantic nuance can affect results and their comparability across surveys ([Ethics Alarms, 2021](https://ethicsalarms.com/2021/07/18/gallups-institutional-trust-poll/)).

### Temporal Fluctuations

Public opinion can be volatile, influenced by current events such as crises or scandals. For instance, presidential approval ratings spike during crises (e.g., post-9/11) but may decline during prolonged controversies (e.g., Iraq War opposition) ([CliffsNotes, n.d.](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/american-government/public-opinion/public-opinion-and-how-its-measured)).

### Longitudinal Comparisons

Gallup’s long-term tracking since 1973 allows for trend analysis, but changes in survey methods and societal context must be considered when comparing data across decades ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/352316/americans-confidence-major-institutions-dips.aspx)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Measuring public opinion about American institutions is a complex but essential endeavor that relies on rigorous sampling, careful question design, and methodological transparency. The evolution from telephone to online surveys has increased efficiency but introduced new challenges in representativeness.

Data from Gallup and other reputable sources reveal persistently low confidence in many institutions, with only a few such as the military, small business, and police maintaining majority trust. The political polarization of confidence further complicates interpretation.

Given these factors, it is clear that while current measurement techniques provide valuable insights, continuous methodological refinement and transparency are necessary to capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of public opinion accurately. Moreover, pollsters and policymakers must recognize the implications of declining institutional trust as a potential existential threat to democratic governance, as highlighted by experts ([Ethics Alarms, 2021](https://ethicsalarms.com/2021/07/18/gallups-institutional-trust-poll/)).

Therefore, public opinion measurement must not only be about data collection but also about fostering dialogue and institutional accountability to rebuild trust where it has eroded.
