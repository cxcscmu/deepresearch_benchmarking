# Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other: An In-Depth Analysis

The phrase "We expect more from technology and less from each other" encapsulates a profound shift in human behavior and societal norms in the digital age. This phenomenon, extensively explored by MIT professor Sherry Turkle in her seminal work *Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other* (2011), highlights how technology has become deeply intertwined with our emotional lives, social interactions, and expectations. This report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of why this shift has occurred, the psychological and social mechanisms behind it, and its implications for human relationships.

## The Core Premise: Technology as a Surrogate for Human Connection

Sherry Turkle argues that as technology advances, particularly in communication and artificial intelligence, people increasingly turn to it for companionship and emotional support. This reliance is not merely utilitarian but emotional, driven by a desire for connection that is perceived as less demanding and more controllable than human relationships (Turkle, 2011). The illusion of companionship offered by technology can feel safer than the vulnerabilities inherent in interpersonal intimacy.

This shift is underpinned by several key factors:

- **Loneliness and Vulnerability**: Humans are inherently social but often experience loneliness and fear of intimacy. Technology offers a way to mitigate these feelings without the risks associated with real human interaction (Lawrence, 2014).
- **Control and Predictability**: Unlike human beings, technology is expected to perform reliably and predictably, which appeals to our desire for control in an uncertain social world (Nieves, 2024).
- **Psychological Comfort**: Devices provide the fantasy of constant attention and presence without the emotional labor of friendship, allowing users to feel heard and connected on their terms (Lawrence, 2014).

## Why Do We Expect More from Technology?

### 1. **Reliability and Performance Expectations**

Technology is engineered to perform specific tasks consistently. Users expect flawless operation from devices and software, and frustration arises when technology fails. This expectation contrasts with human interactions, which are inherently complex, unpredictable, and emotionally nuanced. As a result, people often hold technology to higher standards of reliability than they do other people (Nieves, 2024).

### 2. **Emotional Safety and Reduced Vulnerability**

Human relationships require emotional investment, vulnerability, and the risk of rejection or conflict. Technology interactions, especially through social media or AI-driven interfaces, provide a buffer against these risks. Users can curate their interactions, avoid difficult conversations, and control the pace and depth of engagement (Lawrence, 2014).

### 3. **Convenience and Accessibility**

Technology enables instant communication across distances and time zones, often with minimal effort. This convenience makes technology a preferred medium for interaction, especially in fast-paced modern life where time and energy for face-to-face relationships may be limited (Kramer, 2024).

### 4. **Social and Cultural Shifts**

The proliferation of social media platforms and digital communication tools has normalized mediated interactions. People increasingly define themselves through online personas, sharing thoughts and feelings in ways that substitute for deeper, face-to-face connection (Turkle, 2011). This cultural shift reinforces the expectation that technology can fulfill social and emotional needs.

## Why Do We Expect Less from Each Other?

### 1. **Disillusionment and Distrust**

Repeated negative experiences in human relationships—such as betrayal, manipulation, or emotional pain—can lead to lowered expectations of others. Unlike technology, which is perceived as neutral and predictable, people may be viewed as unreliable or harmful (Fantastic Learning, 2022).

### 2. **Emotional Labor and Effort**

Being present for someone else requires giving a part of oneself, including time, empathy, and emotional energy. Many individuals may be unwilling or unable to meet these demands consistently, leading to a preference for less demanding technological interactions (Chatzigeorgaki, 2023).

### 3. **Fear of Intimacy and Social Anxiety**

Modern society exhibits increasing rates of loneliness and social anxiety. People may avoid deep interpersonal connections due to fear of rejection or discomfort, turning instead to technology, which offers controlled and less intimidating interactions (Lawrence, 2014).

### 4. **Changing Social Norms**

The rise of digital communication has altered social norms around interaction. The preference for texting, social media, and other mediated forms of communication can reduce face-to-face encounters, weakening social skills and expectations of interpersonal engagement (Turkle, 2011).

## Psychological and Social Implications

### The Illusion of Companionship

Turkle describes how technology offers "the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship," fulfilling a psychological need for connection while avoiding its complexities (Lawrence, 2014). This illusion can lead to increased feelings of isolation despite being constantly "connected."

### Anxiety Around Solitude

The pervasive use of devices to fill moments of solitude indicates a discomfort with being alone. People often reach for their phones to avoid the anxiety and panic associated with even brief periods of solitude, suggesting a shift in how solitude is perceived—from a natural state to a problem needing resolution (Lawrence, 2014).

### Impact on Emotional Lives

As technology use increases, there is evidence that emotional lives "ramp down." People may experience diminished capacity for empathy, reflection, and deep emotional engagement, as mediated interactions replace face-to-face communication (Turkle, 2011).

## Balancing Technology and Human Interaction: A Critical Perspective

While technology offers undeniable benefits in connectivity, convenience, and access to information, the growing expectation that it will fulfill social and emotional needs raises concerns. The evidence suggests that technology can supplement but not replace the depth and quality of human relationships.

A balanced approach involves:

- Recognizing the limitations of technology in providing genuine emotional connection.
- Cultivating skills for face-to-face communication and emotional intimacy.
- Using technology mindfully to enhance, rather than substitute, human relationships.
- Addressing societal factors such as loneliness and social anxiety that drive overreliance on technology.

## Conclusion

The expectation of more from technology and less from each other is a complex phenomenon rooted in human vulnerability, social change, and the psychological appeal of control and predictability. Technology meets certain emotional needs with convenience and safety but often at the cost of deeper human connection and emotional richness. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the challenges of the digital age and fostering healthier relationships with both technology and each other.
