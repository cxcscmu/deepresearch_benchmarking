## Overview of the Chicken Wing Shortage

Chicken wings have become a highly sought-after food item in the U.S., especially during events like the Super Bowl, where consumption reaches approximately 1.42 billion wings annually ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)). Despite the overall steady production of chickens, the demand for wings has surged, creating a supply imbalance that has led to shortages and significant price increases.

## Key Factors Contributing to the Shortage

### 1. Increased Demand During the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered consumer behavior and food consumption patterns. Chicken wings, being a popular comfort food and well-suited for takeout and delivery, saw a sharp rise in demand. Restaurants that traditionally offered wings and pizza capitalized on delivery services, which skyrocketed during lockdowns. The National Chicken Council (NCC) noted that servings of chicken wings in restaurants increased by 7% in 2020 compared to 2019, despite an 11% decline in restaurant visits overall. Additionally, retail sales of wings rose by over 10%, with frozen wing sales increasing by 37.2% ([Newsweek, 2021](https://www.newsweek.com/chicken-wing-shortage-us-1585923)).

Chicken was dubbed “The Nation’s #1 Quarantine Protein” by the NCC, reflecting its central role in pandemic diets ([BlackDoctor.org, 2021](https://blackdoctor.org/chicken-wing-shortage-2021/)).

### 2. Supply Chain Disruptions and Labor Shortages

Although chicken production remained relatively steady, the processing and supply chains faced significant challenges. Large meat-processing plants, operated by companies such as Perdue and Tyson, experienced labor shortages due to COVID-19 infections and lockdown restrictions. Some facilities were forced to close temporarily, reducing output and slowing processing capacity ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

The omicron variant further exacerbated labor shortages, straining an already tight labor market and causing delays in processing and distribution.

### 3. Weather-Related Impacts: Texas Power Crisis and Harsh Winters

In February 2021, a severe winter storm and power crisis in Texas led to the loss of millions of chickens. Approximately 200 of the state's 1,900 broiler houses lost power, causing significant mortality among the chicken population. This event coincided with the Super Bowl, traditionally the peak demand period for wings, intensifying the shortage ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/); [BlackDoctor.org, 2021](https://blackdoctor.org/chicken-wing-shortage-2021/)).

Harsh winter conditions in the southcentral U.S. further impacted chicken farms, reducing supply availability ([Streets of New York, 2021](https://www.streetsofnewyork.com/posts/the-chicken-wing-shortage-of-2021)).

### 4. Export Adjustments and Domestic Prioritization

To meet rising domestic demand, the U.S. decreased exports of chicken wings, particularly to Mexico, which historically has been a significant importer of U.S. poultry. This shift prioritized domestic supply but also reflected the tightness in available wing stocks ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

### 5. Product-Specific Demand and Supply Dynamics

Chicken wings are a unique product in that each chicken only yields two wings, limiting the supply inherently. Producers do not raise chickens solely for wings; they must sell all parts of the bird, which complicates supply adjustments ([BlackDoctor.org, 2021](https://blackdoctor.org/chicken-wing-shortage-2021/)).

The demand for wings is relatively inelastic compared to other chicken parts. While consumers may reduce consumption of breast meat if prices rise, wings remain highly desired, sustaining high demand even as prices increase ([KCEN-TV, 2021](https://www.kcentv.com/article/money/chicken-shortage-price-hike-pluckers/500-aa755fb8-a13f-47f1-9a56-71229cf423b1)).

## Price Trends and Market Impact

Chicken wing prices have seen dramatic increases. For example:

| Time Period       | Price per Pound (USD) | Notes                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| April 2020        | $2.80                | Lowest since 2016                       |
| End of 2020       | ~$3.30               | Prices began rising                     |
| February 2021     | $2.65 - $2.71        | Record high prices for wings            |
| 2021 (general)    | +$1.00 over previous year | Tripled purchase price for restaurants |

Restaurant owners have reported that their purchase price for wings nearly tripled since the end of 2020. Some establishments have resorted to pricing wings as "market price," reflecting volatility and scarcity ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/); [KCEN-TV, 2021](https://www.kcentv.com/article/money/chicken-shortage-price-hike-pluckers/500-aa755fb8-a13f-47f1-9a56-71229cf423b1)).

## Industry Responses and Adaptations

Restaurants and suppliers have taken various measures to cope with the shortage:

- **Menu Adjustments:** Some restaurants have removed wings or wing specials from menus or increased prices to offset higher procurement costs ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

- **Alternative Products:** To maintain customer satisfaction, establishments have experimented with other chicken parts, such as thighs, or offered boneless wings made from breast meat ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

- **Quality vs. Quantity Decisions:** Some chains, like Wing Barn in Texas, faced tough choices between sourcing lower-quality wings from alternative vendors or risking running out of wings altogether ([Newsweek, 2021](https://www.newsweek.com/chicken-wing-shortage-us-1585923)).

- **Pricing Strategies:** Some restaurants have adopted dynamic pricing for wings, similar to seafood market pricing, to manage fluctuating costs ([KCEN-TV, 2021](https://www.kcentv.com/article/money/chicken-shortage-price-hike-pluckers/500-aa755fb8-a13f-47f1-9a56-71229cf423b1)).

## Supply Data and Production Trends

The USDA estimated that U.S. broiler production increased by only 0.3% year-over-year in 2021, the slowest growth since 2012 when production actually declined by 0.4%. This minimal growth contrasts with the surge in wing demand, exacerbating the supply deficit ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

Furthermore, 17.1% of total chicken production was exported in 2021, the highest export percentage since 2014. However, despite this increase, domestic per capita chicken consumption fell, likely due to shortages of popular products like wings ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/)).

## When Will the Shortage End?

Chicken producers have indicated that production has been increasing in recent weeks (as of 2021), suggesting that the shortage may ease over time. However, due to the complex nature of supply chains, labor market pressures, and unpredictable weather events, the timeline for full recovery remains uncertain. Prices may continue to fluctuate, and temporary substitutions like boneless wings or alternative chicken parts may persist in menus ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-chicken-wings/); [KCEN-TV, 2021](https://www.kcentv.com/article/money/chicken-shortage-price-hike-pluckers/500-aa755fb8-a13f-47f1-9a56-71229cf423b1)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The chicken wing shortage in the U.S. is a multifaceted issue primarily driven by a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, compounded by supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and severe weather events. While chicken production as a whole has remained relatively stable, the specific demand for wings has outpaced supply, creating a market imbalance.

The shortage is not due to a fundamental lack of chickens but rather the interplay of increased consumer appetite for wings, processing bottlenecks, and external shocks like the Texas power crisis. The inelastic nature of wing demand further intensifies the shortage's impact on prices and availability.

Given these factors, the shortage is best understood as a demand-driven supply constraint exacerbated by temporary but severe external disruptions. Recovery is plausible as production and labor conditions improve, but the market may continue to experience volatility in the near term.

Restaurants and suppliers must adapt by diversifying offerings and managing pricing strategies to navigate this period. Consumers may also need to adjust expectations regarding availability and cost.
