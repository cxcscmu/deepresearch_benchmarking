# Report on the Chicken Wing Shortage in the U.S.

## Introduction

The United States has experienced a notable shortage of chicken wings, particularly pronounced during and after the COVID-19 pandemic period. This shortage has impacted restaurants, suppliers, and consumers, leading to increased prices and menu adjustments. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the causes, consequences, and outlook of the chicken wing shortage in the U.S., drawing on multiple reliable sources and data from the poultry industry and government agencies.

## Overview of the Chicken Wing Shortage

Chicken wings are among the most popular poultry products in the U.S., especially favored as a snack during events like the Super Bowl. Despite the overall steady production of chickens, wings have become scarce due to a combination of demand surges and supply chain disruptions. The shortage is not indicative of a nationwide chicken shortage but rather a specific imbalance in the supply of wings relative to other parts of the chicken.

## Causes of the Chicken Wing Shortage

### 1. Increased Demand During the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered consumer behavior and restaurant operations. With lockdowns and social distancing measures, takeout and delivery services surged, and chicken wings, known for their suitability for delivery and as comfort food, saw a significant increase in demand.

- According to the National Chicken Council, servings of chicken wings in restaurants increased by 7% in 2020 compared to 2019, despite an 11% decline in overall restaurant visits.
- Retail sales of chicken wings rose by 10.3%, with in-store frozen wing sales increasing by 37.2% during the pandemic ([Morris, 2021](https://www.newsweek.com)).

This heightened demand was not matched by a corresponding increase in production, creating a supply-demand imbalance.

### 2. Supply Chain Disruptions and Production Challenges

Several factors disrupted the supply side of chicken wings:

#### a. Texas Power Crisis (2021)

A severe winter storm in Texas in early 2021 caused widespread power outages, affecting approximately 200 of the state's 1,900 broiler houses. The lack of power led to the death of millions of chickens, directly reducing the available supply of poultry, including wings ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com)).

#### b. Labor Shortages in Processing Plants

Large poultry processors such as Perdue and Tyson faced labor shortages exacerbated by COVID-19 outbreaks, including the Omicron variant wave. These labor constraints led to reduced processing capacity and temporary shutdowns, further limiting the supply of processed chicken wings ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com)).

#### c. Export Dynamics

The U.S. decreased its exports of chicken wings to Mexico to prioritize domestic demand, but exports still rose overall in 2021, with 17.1% of total production exportedâ€”the highest since 2014. This export activity further tightened domestic supply ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com)).

### 3. Structural Factors in Chicken Production

- Each chicken has only two wings, and producers do not raise chickens solely for wings; all parts must be sold. This limits the ability to increase wing supply independently.
- The rise in popularity of chicken sandwiches and other chicken products has shifted some production priorities, affecting wing availability ([Super, 2020](https://www.webmd.com)).

### 4. Price Increases and Market Competition

The shortage has driven prices upward:

| Product           | Price in 2019 (per pound) | Price in 2020 (per pound) | Price in 2021 (per pound) | Price Increase (2020-2021) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Whole Chicken     | $1.51 - $1.59             | $2.80 (April 2020)        | ~$3.30                    | Approx. $0.50              |
| Chicken Wings     | $1.81 (Feb 2020)          | $2.27 (Jan 2021)          | $2.65 - $3.27 (Feb 2021)  | Approx. $1.00              |

Restaurant owners report that the purchase price for wings has nearly tripled since late 2020, forcing some to raise menu prices or remove wings from menus to manage costs ([Haegele, 2021](https://www.gobankingrates.com)).

## Impact on the Industry and Consumers

- **Restaurants:** Many have had to remove wings from menus or increase prices, affecting customer satisfaction and profit margins. Some have introduced alternatives such as chicken thighs or boneless wings.
- **Consumers:** Face higher prices and occasional unavailability of wings, especially during peak demand periods like the Super Bowl, when an estimated 1.42 billion wings are consumed ([National Chicken Council, 2022](https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org)).
- **Suppliers:** Struggle with balancing quality and quantity, as seen in cases like Wing Barn in Texas, which faces tough decisions between sourcing lower-quality wings or risking stockouts ([Wing Barn, 2021](https://www.wingbarn.com)).

## Industry Responses and Alternatives

To mitigate the shortage and meet consumer demand, the industry has adopted several strategies:

- **Alternative Chicken Parts:** Promoting chicken thighs as a substitute, exemplified by Wingstop's launch of "Thighstop," an online-only brand delivering chicken thighs nationwide ([Wingstop, 2021](https://www.wingstop.com)).
- **Menu Innovation:** Restaurants experimenting with other chicken recipes, including chicken breasts and plant-based alternatives.
- **Supply Chain Adjustments:** Efforts to increase broiler production and improve processing efficiency, though constrained by labor and environmental factors.

## Outlook and Conclusion

The chicken wing shortage in the U.S. is primarily a result of a perfect storm of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, significant supply chain disruptions including weather-related losses and labor shortages, and structural constraints in poultry production. Prices have risen sharply, affecting all stakeholders from suppliers to consumers.

The USDA estimated only a 0.3% year-over-year increase in broiler production in 2021, the slowest since 2012, indicating limited capacity to rapidly expand supply ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com)). However, the shortage is expected to subside by the end of 2022 as supply chains stabilize and production recovers.

In my assessment, while the pandemic accelerated demand for wings and exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain, the shortage also highlights the need for greater flexibility in poultry production and diversification of consumer preferences. The industry's pivot to alternative chicken parts and plant-based options suggests a potential long-term shift in the market.

Sustained investment in processing capacity, labor force stabilization, and supply chain resilience will be critical to preventing similar shortages in the future. Meanwhile, consumers and restaurants may continue to adapt to a broader array of poultry products beyond wings.
