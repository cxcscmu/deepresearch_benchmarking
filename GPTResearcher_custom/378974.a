# The United States Response to the Holocaust: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The Holocaust, the systematic genocide of approximately six million Jews and millions of other victims by Nazi Germany during World War II, remains one of the most horrific episodes in human history. The United States, as a major Allied power, played a significant role in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany. However, the U.S. response to the Holocaust itself—particularly in terms of refugee policy, public awareness, and rescue efforts—has been the subject of extensive historical scrutiny and debate. This report provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of the U.S. government's and American people's response to the Holocaust, analyzing immigration policies, public opinion, government actions, and rescue efforts, including the establishment and activities of the War Refugee Board. The report also offers a critical assessment of the effectiveness and limitations of these responses.

## 1. Background: Early Awareness and Immigration Policies

### 1.1 Early Awareness of Nazi Persecution

From the moment Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, reports of persecution against Jews and other minorities began to reach the United States. American Jewish communities were aware of the escalating oppression, and some public protests, such as marches in Chicago, took place as early as 1933 ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

### 1.2 Immigration Restrictions and Quotas

Despite awareness of Nazi persecution, U.S. immigration policy was highly restrictive during the 1930s and 1940s. The Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 established national origin quotas that severely limited immigration, especially from southern and eastern Europe, where most Jews lived. For example, the annual quota for German immigrants was only 25,957, and for Germans and Austrians combined, it was 27,370 in 1939 ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

The Great Depression intensified economic fears, leading to widespread public opposition to increased immigration. Polls from the 1930s revealed that 60% of Americans thought Jews had "objectionable qualities," and 82% opposed admitting large numbers of Jewish refugees ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

### 1.3 The Evian Conference and International Response

In July 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened the Evian Conference to address the growing refugee crisis. Thirty-two nations attended, but no country was willing to significantly alter immigration policies. Only Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic agreed to accept Jewish refugees, and even then, only for financial compensation ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

## 2. American Public Opinion and Government Actions

### 2.1 Public Opinion and Anti-Semitism

Anti-Semitism in the United States, while not as virulent as in Nazi Germany, was nonetheless significant. Influential figures like Father Charles E. Coughlin and William Dudley Pelley promoted anti-Semitic views. The general public favored isolationism and neutrality, especially after the trauma of World War I, and feared that refugees would compete for scarce jobs and strain social services ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

### 2.2 The St. Louis Incident

In 1939, the German ocean liner *St. Louis* carried nearly 1,000 Jewish refugees to Cuba, many of whom had U.S. visas. However, Cuba refused entry, and the U.S. Coast Guard prevented refugees from disembarking on the U.S. coast. The ship was forced to return to Europe, where many passengers later perished in the Holocaust ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

### 2.3 The Wagner-Rogers Bill and Other Legislative Efforts

Efforts to admit Jewish refugee children outside of quotas, such as the Wagner-Rogers Bill in 1938, failed to pass Congress amid widespread opposition and political inertia ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

## 3. Awareness of the Holocaust and Government Response During the War

### 3.1 Confirmation of the "Final Solution"

In August 1942, Gerhart Riegner, representative of the World Jewish Congress, sent a telegram to the U.S. State Department detailing the Nazi plan for the extermination of Jews. The State Department initially suppressed the information, delaying its dissemination to American Jewish leaders and the public until November 1942 ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

### 3.2 Public and Government Reaction

Following confirmation of the Holocaust, the U.S. and Allied governments issued a "Declaration on Atrocities" condemning Nazi crimes but made no concrete commitments to rescue efforts. The Bermuda Conference in 1943, convened to discuss refugee rescue, produced no practical plans, as both the U.S. and Britain refused to alter immigration quotas or policies regarding Palestine ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

### 3.3 Internal Government Conflicts and Obstruction

The U.S. Treasury Department uncovered evidence that the State Department, under Assistant Secretary Breckinridge Long, actively obstructed rescue efforts and delayed approval of relief funds for Jews in Europe. This obstructionism was documented in the "Report to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of This Government in the Murder of the Jews," authored by Treasury lawyer Josiah E. DuBois Jr. ([War Refugee Board, Wikipedia, 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Refugee_Board)).

## 4. The War Refugee Board: Creation and Activities

### 4.1 Establishment

Under pressure from Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. and his staff, President Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board (WRB) on January 22, 1944, via Executive Order 9417. The WRB was tasked with rescuing victims of Nazi oppression and was composed of the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and War, with John Pehle as its first executive director ([War Refugee Board, Wikipedia, 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Refugee_Board); [Berenbaum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

### 4.2 Activities and Impact

Despite limited funding (approximately $1 million in federal funds, supplemented by private donations) and ongoing resistance from the State and War Departments, the WRB coordinated several rescue operations:

- **Raoul Wallenberg's Mission:** The WRB supported Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg's efforts in Budapest, issuing protective passports and establishing safe houses, saving an estimated 20,000 Hungarian Jews ([War Refugee Board, Wikipedia, 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Refugee_Board)).

- **Food Parcels and Relief:** The WRB sent approximately 300,000 food parcels to concentration camps disguised as Red Cross packages.

- **Refugee Shelter in Oswego, New York:** The WRB brought 982 Jewish refugees from Italy to the U.S. outside immigration quotas but without permanent status ([War Refugee Board, Wikipedia, 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Refugee_Board)).

- **Advocacy for Bombing Auschwitz:** The WRB and Jewish leaders requested bombing of Auschwitz's gas chambers and railroads, but the War Department refused, citing military priorities ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

### 4.3 Limitations and Criticism

The WRB's efforts began late in the war, after millions had already perished. Internal government conflicts, underfunding, and limited military support constrained its effectiveness. Estimates credit the WRB with saving tens of thousands to possibly 200,000 lives, but the scale of the Holocaust dwarfed these efforts ([Berenbaum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust); [War Refugee Board, Wikipedia, 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Refugee_Board)).

## 5. Military and Media Responses

### 5.1 Military Liberation of Concentration Camps

American forces liberated several concentration camps in Western Germany in 1945, including Buchenwald and Dachau. However, the U.S. military did not prioritize liberation of extermination camps in Eastern Europe, which were liberated by Soviet forces ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

### 5.2 Media Coverage

American newspapers, including *The New York Times*, generally relegated Holocaust news to less prominent pages, partly due to skepticism from false atrocity reports during World War I and the complexities of wartime reporting ([History.com Editors, 2018](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/american-response-to-the-holocaust)).

---

## 6. Post-War Actions and Legacy

### 6.1 Displaced Persons and Immigration

After the war, millions of displaced persons (DPs), including 250,000 Jewish survivors, were housed in camps. The U.S. established separate camps for Jewish DPs and, in 1948, passed the Displaced Persons Act, allowing 200,000 DPs to immigrate, though without special provisions for Jews ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

### 6.2 War Crimes Trials

The United States played a major role in the Nuremberg Trials, prosecuting Nazi leaders and war criminals, emphasizing justice and accountability ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

### 6.3 Holocaust Memory in America

Holocaust awareness increased significantly in the 1970s, with the establishment of memorials, museums, and educational programs. A 2020 Pew Research Center report found that 84% of American adults could accurately describe the Holocaust ([United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/united-states-and-the-holocaust)).

## 8. Critical Assessment and Conclusion

The United States response to the Holocaust was marked by a complex interplay of humanitarian concern, political calculation, economic fear, and institutional obstruction. While the U.S. admitted more Jewish refugees than any other country during the 1930s and 1940s, the restrictive immigration quotas, combined with widespread anti-Semitism and isolationism, severely limited the number of refugees who could find sanctuary.

Government agencies, particularly the State Department, actively obstructed rescue efforts, delaying relief and suppressing information about the Holocaust. It was only after persistent pressure from Treasury officials and Jewish organizations that President Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board in 1944, which, despite its late start and limited resources, managed to save tens of thousands of lives.

The refusal to bomb Auschwitz and the rail lines leading to it remains one of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. response. While military priorities and technical limitations were cited, many historians argue that more could have been done to disrupt the machinery of genocide.

In conclusion, the U.S. response was a mixture of humanitarian efforts constrained by political, social, and economic factors. The delayed and limited nature of official rescue efforts, combined with restrictive immigration policies, contributed to the tragic loss of millions of lives. This history serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of indifference and bureaucratic inertia in the face of genocide.
