## Energy Use and Resource Consumption

Manufacturing operations are significant consumers of energy and natural resources globally. The sector accounts for approximately 19% of direct global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with an additional 11% attributed to the power used in manufacturing processes ([Huntington, 2020](https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2020/01/is-climate-change-having-an-impact-on-manufacturing/32543)). This substantial energy demand often relies on fossil fuels, contributing to carbon emissions and climate change.

Resource consumption extends beyond energy to include water, raw materials, and chemicals. For example, the textile industry alone consumed 79 billion cubic meters of water and produced 1,715 million tons of CO2 emissions in 2015 ([Sandin & Peters, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719346807)). Manufacturing processes frequently involve the extraction and processing of non-renewable resources, which can lead to resource depletion and ecosystem degradation.

## Air Pollution

Air pollution is a major environmental consequence of manufacturing. Factories emit a range of hazardous substances, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals, and greenhouse gases. Plastic manufacturing, for instance, releases hazardous chemicals from chimneys that contribute to air contamination and ozone layer depletion ([Intrepid Sourcing, n.d.](https://intrepidsourcing.com/environmental-impact-of-plastic-manufacturing/)).

Similarly, the textile industry contributes significantly to air pollution through the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are persistent environmental pollutants ([Thangavel & Duraisamy, 2014](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Environmental-and-social-impact-of-textile-manufacturing-processes_fig1_281104248)). The accumulation of fine particulate matter in the air poses health risks to humans and animals, including respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems ([Field, n.d.](http://www.field.org.uk/how-can-factories-affect-the-environment/)).

---

## Water Pollution

Water contamination is another critical issue linked to manufacturing. Factories often discharge untreated or inadequately treated wastewater containing heavy metals, toxic chemicals, and microplastics into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Plastic manufacturing releases substances such as cadmium, bromine, cobalt, mercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which persist in aquatic environments and bioaccumulate in the food chain, threatening fisheries and human health ([Intrepid Sourcing, n.d.](https://intrepidsourcing.com/environmental-impact-of-plastic-manufacturing/)).

The textile industry is a notable contributor to water pollution, with industrial sewage accounting for approximately 20% of global water pollution ([Oceansafe, n.d.](https://www.oceansafe.co/detail/textile-industry-environment)). The use of dyes, detergents, and other chemicals in textile processing leads to the release of toxic substances into freshwater ecosystems, adversely affecting biodiversity and water quality ([Sandin & Peters, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719346807)).

## Soil and Surface Contamination

Manufacturing activities also contribute to soil contamination through the deposition of hazardous chemicals and heavy metals. Improper disposal of industrial waste and accidental spills can lead to the accumulation of toxic substances in the soil, affecting agricultural productivity and ecosystem health ([Intrepid Sourcing, n.d.](https://intrepidsourcing.com/environmental-impact-of-plastic-manufacturing/); [Field, n.d.](http://www.field.org.uk/how-can-factories-affect-the-environment/)).

## Waste Generation and Microplastics

The generation of solid waste, including non-biodegradable plastics and textile fibers, poses significant environmental challenges. The textile industry produces over 100 billion pieces of textiles annually, with production expected to double by 2030 due to fast fashion trends ([Oceansafe, n.d.](https://www.oceansafe.co/detail/textile-industry-environment)). Approximately 80% of used textiles are incinerated, landfilled, or discarded into nature, with only 1% recycled into new garments, exacerbating waste management issues ([Oceansafe, n.d.](https://www.oceansafe.co/detail/textile-industry-environment)).

Microplastics, largely derived from synthetic textile fibers, constitute more than 30% of microplastics found in the world's oceans, contributing to marine pollution and posing risks to aquatic life ([Oceansafe, n.d.](https://www.oceansafe.co/detail/textile-industry-environment)).

## Climate Change and Manufacturing

Manufacturing is both a contributor to and a victim of climate change. The sector's carbon emissions accelerate global warming, while climate change impacts manufacturing productivity and operations. For example, rising temperatures can reduce worker productivity and disrupt supply chains due to extreme weather events ([Huntington, 2020](https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2020/01/is-climate-change-having-an-impact-on-manufacturing/32543)).
