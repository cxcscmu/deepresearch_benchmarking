# The Role of Women in the Struggle Against Apartheid in South Africa

The struggle against apartheid in South Africa was a multifaceted resistance movement that involved various sectors of society. Women played a pivotal and indispensable role in this struggle, often acting as catalysts for protests, organizers of grassroots movements, and leaders in political and social campaigns. This report provides an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the role women played in the anti-apartheid movement, drawing on a wide range of historical sources and scholarly analyses.

## Early Involvement and Organizational Foundations

Women’s political activism in South Africa predates the formal apartheid era but gained significant momentum during the 1940s and 1950s with the establishment of key organizations such as the African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) and the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW).

- The **ANC Women’s League**, established in 1948, was crucial in mobilizing women within the broader African National Congress (ANC) framework. Prior to 1943, women were not full members of the ANC, which limited their participation in political struggle. The creation of the ANCWL marked a turning point, enabling women to engage more actively in resistance politics ([Knapp, n.d.](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/anc-womens-league-struggle-womens-rights-south-africa-meghan-knapp)).

- The **Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW)** was launched in 1954 as the first broad-based, multiracial women’s organization. It united approximately 230,000 women from diverse racial and social backgrounds, including trade unionists, teachers, nurses, and members of the small African professional class. FEDSAW aimed to work for majority rule, end apartheid, and promote women’s rights and freedoms ([South African History Online, n.d.](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/federation-south-african-women-fedsaw)).

These organizations provided a platform for women to organize protests, educate communities, and participate in national campaigns against apartheid legislation.

## Key Campaigns and Protests Led by Women

Women were at the forefront of several major campaigns against apartheid laws, particularly those targeting the oppressive pass laws and other discriminatory policies.

### The Anti-Pass Campaign and the 1956 Women’s March

One of the most iconic moments in the women’s struggle was the **1956 Women’s March** to the Union Buildings in Pretoria. On August 9, 1956, over 20,000 women from all racial backgrounds marched in protest against the extension of pass laws to black women. The march was a multiracial demonstration that symbolized unity and resistance across racial and cultural lines.

- The march was organized by FEDSAW and supported by the ANC Women’s League, with leaders such as Lillian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Annie Silinga, and Frances Baard playing prominent roles.

- Women carried petitions and sang freedom songs, demonstrating their determination to resist apartheid’s restrictions on their movement and freedoms.

- Despite the refusal of Prime Minister J.G. Strijdom to meet with the protestors and the subsequent enactment of the pass laws, the march became a powerful symbol of women’s resistance and political agency ([South African History Online, n.d.](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/1956-womens-march-pretoria)).

### The Defiance Campaign of 1952

Women participated actively in the **Defiance Campaign** against apartheid laws, which involved deliberately breaking unjust laws and courting arrest to overwhelm the apartheid legal system. Women engaged in acts such as using "white-only" facilities and burning passes, demonstrating their willingness to face imprisonment for the cause ([South African History Online, n.d.](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Trade Union and Grassroots Organizing

Women’s involvement in trade unions was significant in fostering leadership skills and political consciousness. Female factory workers, particularly in the clothing, textile, and food industries, learned organizing techniques and embraced non-racial worker solidarity, which translated into broader political activism ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid-15-july-1980)).

## Leadership and Repression

Women leaders were central figures in the anti-apartheid movement but faced severe repression from the apartheid regime.

- Leaders such as **Frances Baard**, **Lillian Ngoyi**, **Helen Joseph**, and **Annie Silinga** were detained, banned, or imprisoned for their activism. For example, Frances Baard was charged with treason following the 1956 Women’s March and later imprisoned for five years ([Facing History, n.d.](https://www.facinghistory.org/confronting-apartheid/chapter-2/women-rise-against-apartheid-and-change-movement)).

- The government’s strategy of detaining and banning women leaders aimed to dismantle organizations like FEDSAW, but women’s activism persisted underground and in exile, continuing to challenge apartheid policies ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid-15-july-1980)).

## Intersectionality of Oppression and Resistance

Black South African women faced a triple burden of oppression: racial, social, and gender-based. Apartheid policies sought to control not only political and economic life but also personal and family life, with women often targeted as the bearers of family and community structures.

- Women resisted the apartheid regime’s attempts to restructure families and communities, organizing as mothers and community leaders to demand better living conditions and rights for future generations ([Oxford Research Encyclopedia, 2020](https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-184)).

- Their activism was often framed within the discourse of motherhood and family, which allowed them to mobilize support across racial and class lines but also sometimes limited the recognition of women’s broader political goals ([Oxford Research Encyclopedia, 2020](https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-184)).

## Post-Apartheid Legacy and Continuing Struggles

After the unbanning of the ANC in 1990, the ANC Women’s League worked to rebuild its organizational structure and continue advocating for women’s rights and participation in government.

- The ANC Women’s League has since become a political force pushing for gender equality, increased women’s participation in government, and addressing issues such as economic disparities and education ([Knapp, n.d.](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/anc-womens-league-struggle-womens-rights-south-africa-meghan-knapp)).

- Despite progress, challenges remain in achieving full gender equality, and women activists continue to address ongoing issues of gender-based oppression within South Africa ([Knapp, n.d.](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/anc-womens-league-struggle-womens-rights-south-africa-meghan-knapp)).

## Conclusion

Women were central to the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, playing diverse and critical roles that ranged from grassroots organizing to national leadership. Their activism challenged not only racial oppression but also gender and social inequalities imposed by apartheid. Women’s contributions were characterized by resilience, unity across racial lines, and strategic use of family and community roles to mobilize resistance. Despite facing severe repression, women’s activism persisted and laid the foundation for ongoing struggles for gender equality in post-apartheid South Africa. The legacy of women’s resistance remains a vital and inspiring chapter in the history of South Africa’s liberation.
