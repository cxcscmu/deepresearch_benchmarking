# The Role of Women in the Struggle Against Apartheid: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

The struggle against apartheid in South Africa was a multifaceted resistance movement involving diverse actors, with women playing a pivotal and often under-recognized role. From the early 20th century to the dismantling of apartheid in the 1990s, women were central catalysts in protests, organizers of mass movements, and leaders in various political, social, and labor organizations. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the roles women played in the anti-apartheid struggle, highlighting their activism, leadership, and sacrifices. It draws on historical records, organizational accounts, and personal testimonies to present a detailed and comprehensive view of women's contributions.

## Early Resistance and Organizing (1910s–1940s)

### Anti-Pass Campaigns and Political Exclusion

The roots of women's resistance to racial oppression trace back to the early 20th century. In 1913, women in the Free State, led by Charlotte Maxeke, organized protests against the imposition of passes on black women—a system that restricted movement and employment opportunities ([South African History Online, 2019](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

Despite their activism, women were initially excluded from formal political participation; the African National Congress (ANC) did not allow women as members until 1943, and the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) was only established in 1948. This exclusion delayed women's full political engagement but did not deter their activism.

### Economic Changes and Union Involvement

The 1920s and 1930s saw increased urbanization and industrialization, which brought women into the labor market, particularly in industries such as laundry, clothing, and baking. Women became involved in trade unions, which served as a training ground for political leadership and activism. The Non-European Trade Union Federation, formed in 1928, was a key organization that survived restrictive labor laws and provided a platform for women organizers ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

Women trade unionists opposed racial divisions within unions and advocated for free compulsory education, the end of job reservations by race, and equal training opportunities. These efforts politicized women and prepared them for broader resistance activities.

## The 1950s: Defiance and Mass Mobilization

### The Defiance Campaign and Formation of FSAW

The 1950s marked a period of intensified resistance, with women playing leading roles in the Defiance Campaign of 1952, which involved deliberately breaking apartheid laws and inviting arrest to overwhelm the justice system. Women participated in acts such as using "white-only" facilities and were frequently imprisoned for their activism ([South African History Online, 2019](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

In 1954, the Federation of South African Women (FSAW) was founded, uniting approximately 230,000 women from various racial backgrounds under the Congress Alliance. FSAW aimed to end apartheid and promote women's rights, emphasizing that women's liberation was part of the broader national liberation movement ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### The 1956 Women's March

One of the most iconic events was the 1956 Women's March to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where over 20,000 women protested the extension of pass laws to women. This mass mobilization was a powerful demonstration of women's political agency and unity across racial lines. The marchers presented petitions with over 100,000 signatures and sang the anthem "Wathint' Abafazi, Wathint' Imbokodo" ("You strike a woman, you strike a rock"), symbolizing resilience ([South African History Online, 2019](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Anti-Pass Campaign and Continued Resistance

Women continued to resist pass laws through protests, strikes, and civil disobedience. Despite government repression—including arrests, baton charges, and shootings—women organized boycotts and mass demonstrations. Between 1956 and 1960, thousands of women were arrested for burning passes or protesting registration efforts. However, by 1960, coercion forced about 75% of adult women to carry passes, illustrating both the limits of resistance under repression and the extraordinary courage of women who opposed the laws ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

## The 1960s and 1970s: Repression and New Movements

### Sharpeville Massacre and Aftermath

The Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, where police killed 67 unarmed protesters (including women and children), marked a turning point. The government declared a state of emergency, banned the ANC and PAC, and intensified repression. Many women leaders were detained or banned, and mass organizing became difficult ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Black Consciousness and New Women's Organizations

In response to repression, new movements emerged, including the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) in the late 1960s and 1970s, which emphasized black pride and self-reliance. Women like Winnie Mandela and Mamphela Ramphele were active in BCM and the ANC underground. The Black Women's Federation (BWF), formed in 1975, sought to empower black women through literacy, health education, and economic initiatives but was banned by the government in 1977 ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Soweto Uprising and Women's Role

The 1976 Soweto Uprising, sparked by protests against Bantu education, saw youth risking their lives, with women supporting students and leading subsequent strikes and protests. The uprising galvanized broader resistance and highlighted women's roles in community mobilization and sustaining the struggle ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Crossroads Squatter Camp Resistance

In 1977, women in the Crossroads squatter camp near Cape Town organized resistance against forced removals, asserting "we are not moving." Despite police violence and arrests, their sustained protests, supported internationally, forced the government to relent in 1978 ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

## The 1980s: Escalation and International Solidarity

### United Democratic Front and Women's Organizations

The 1980s saw the rise of the United Democratic Front (UDF), a broad coalition opposing apartheid. Women's organizations such as the United Women's Congress (UWCO), Natal Organisation of Women (NOW), and Federation of Transvaal Women (FEDTRAW) became active in campaigns against rent increases, pass laws, and police brutality. Women also played key roles in trade unions, with leaders like Emma Mashinini advocating for workers' rights ([South African History Online, 1980](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/role-women-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### International Anti-Apartheid Movement and Women's Campaigns

Women outside South Africa, particularly in the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), highlighted the dual oppression of black women under apartheid and sexism. They campaigned for the release of women political prisoners, organized boycotts of South African goods, and exposed abuses such as the forced use of contraceptives like Depo-Provera. The AAM Women’s Committee worked closely with ANC and SWAPO women’s groups in exile, raising awareness and funds ([South African History Online, 2019](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

## The Transition to Democracy and Beyond (1990s–Present)

### Unbanning of Political Organizations and Women's Political Participation

The unbanning of the ANC and other organizations in 1990 marked a new phase. Women activists returned from exile and took up leadership roles in the ANC and government. The Women's National Coalition (WNC), formed in 1991, drafted the Women's Charter, which influenced the Bill of Rights and the new constitution, ensuring legal protections for women ([South African History Online, 2019](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Representation in Government

Since the first democratic elections in 1994, women have increasingly participated in political leadership. As of 2005, women held 33% of cabinet positions, a significant increase from the apartheid era when women like Helen Suzman were lone voices in parliament. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka became South Africa's first female Deputy President in 2005, symbolizing progress in women's political empowerment ([South African History Online, 2019](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid)).

### Ongoing Challenges

Despite legal advances, South African women continue to face challenges such as domestic violence, HIV/AIDS, poverty, and underrepresentation in top managerial roles. However, their historical resilience and activism provide a strong foundation for ongoing advocacy and societal transformation.

## Conclusion

Women were indispensable to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, serving as organizers, leaders, and frontline activists across decades of resistance. Their activism was rooted in the defense of family and community, evolving into a broader fight for national liberation and gender equality. Despite systemic oppression and repression, women mobilized mass protests, led trade unions, formed influential organizations, and maintained international solidarity networks that sustained the anti-apartheid movement.

While men often dominated overt leadership roles, women controlled informal and grassroots segments of society that were crucial to mass mobilizations. Their resistance to pass laws, participation in boycotts, and leadership in uprisings such as the Soweto protests and Crossroads movement exemplify their courage and strategic importance.

The legacy of women's activism is evident in post-apartheid South Africa's legal frameworks and political representation, although challenges remain. Recognizing and understanding the multifaceted role women played is essential to appreciating the full history of South Africa's liberation and the ongoing quest for gender equality.
