# How Today's Christians Could Impact Western Culture to Draw Others to Christ

The contemporary Western world is characterized by a significant cultural shift often described as "post-Christian." This term refers to societies that, while historically rooted in Christian values and traditions, have largely moved away from Christian authority and worldview in public and private life. The challenge for Christians today is to find effective ways to engage this culture, which is increasingly hostile or indifferent to Christianity, in order to draw others to Christ. This report explores how Christians can impact Western culture today, drawing on recent scholarship, theological reflections, and sociological insights.

## Understanding the Post-Christian Context

A post-Christian society no longer assumes Christianity as the foundation of its ethics, laws, or cultural norms. While it may retain some values originally derived from Christianity—such as charity or equality—it often rejects the Christian worldview that undergirds these values ([GotQuestions.org, n.d.](https://www.gotquestions.org/post-Christian.html)). This leads to a culture that can be hostile or incomprehensible to Christian beliefs, especially regarding God, sin, truth, and the afterlife ([Keller, 2020](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/how-to-reach-the-west-again/)).

The erosion of Christian influence is not merely about declining church attendance or belief but involves a deeper cultural transformation where Christian language and concepts become superficial or irrelevant. This environment challenges Christians to rethink their methods of evangelism and cultural engagement.

## Historical Influence of Christianity on Western Culture

Christianity has profoundly shaped Western civilization, contributing to education, political freedom, science, medicine, the arts, and social welfare ([Kennedy & Newcombe, as cited in TIFWE, 2012](https://tifwe.org/can-christians-today-really-impact-culture/); [PhDessay, 2022](https://phdessay.com/the-impact-of-christianity-on-western-civilization/)). The early church’s rapid growth in the first three centuries AD was largely due to Christians’ deep involvement in their culture, offering a new way of life amid urban chaos and brutality ([Stark, as cited in TIFWE, 2012](https://tifwe.org/can-christians-today-really-impact-culture/)).

However, over the last century, Christian influence in Western culture has waned, partly because Christians have been absent from key cultural arenas where influence is greatest ([Hunter, as cited in TIFWE, 2012](https://tifwe.org/can-christians-today-really-impact-culture/)).

## Challenges for Christians in the West

1. **Cultural Hostility and Incomprehensibility**: Christianity is no longer socially beneficial; it often carries a social cost. Many people find Christian concepts offensive or incomprehensible ([Keller, 2020](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/how-to-reach-the-west-again/)).

2. **Loss of Cultural Capital**: Christians have been largely absent from influential cultural sectors, reducing their leverage to shape society ([Hunter, as cited in TIFWE, 2012](https://tifwe.org/can-christians-today-really-impact-culture/)).

3. **Postmodern and Relativistic Worldviews**: Modern culture intensifies problems such as unchecked individualism, relativism, and a fragmented sense of self, which complicate traditional evangelistic approaches ([Keller, 2020](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/how-to-reach-the-west-again/); [Christian Courier, n.d.](https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/1589-the-influence-of-modern-trends-on-the-church)).

4. **Cultural Syncretism and Superficial Conversion**: Converts may adopt Christian forms superficially while retaining pre-Christian cultural meanings, leading to compartmentalized faith ([Lausanne World Pulse, 2008](https://lausanneworldpulse.com/perspectives-php/924/04-2008)).

## Strategies for Impacting Western Culture

### 1. Embrace a Missionary Encounter Model

Tim Keller advocates for a "missionary encounter" approach that neither withdraws from culture nor assimilates into it but connects, confronts, and converts ([Keller, 2020](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/how-to-reach-the-west-again/)). This approach balances maintaining Christian distinctiveness with affirming and serving neighbors, calling for repentance and change without political coercion.

Key elements include:

| Element              | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Christian High Theory** | Explaining culture through the lens of the gospel before explaining the gospel itself.       |
| **Intentionality**       | Purposeful engagement with culture rather than passive presence or retreat.                   |
| **Post-Christendom Evangelism** | Developing evangelistic methods suited to a culture that no longer shares basic Christian concepts. |

This model requires Christians to understand the cultural context deeply and to articulate the gospel in ways that resonate with contemporary experiences and challenges.

### 2. Engage in Cultural Capital and Leverage

Christians need to be present and active in areas where cultural influence is greatest—such as education, media, politics, arts, and business ([Hunter, as cited in TIFWE, 2012](https://tifwe.org/can-christians-today-really-impact-culture/)). Absence from these spheres has diminished Christian cultural impact.

### 3. Foster Deep Theological and Cultural Understanding

Before evangelism, Christians must develop a robust "Christian High Theory" to interpret and critique culture biblically ([Keller, 2020](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/how-to-reach-the-west-again/)). This includes addressing the problems of individualism, relativism, and the modern self.

### 4. Promote Authentic Conversion and Worldview Transformation

Conversion should involve a transformation of worldview, not just superficial cultural conformity ([Lausanne World Pulse, 2008](https://lausanneworldpulse.com/perspectives-php/924/04-2008)). Missionaries and church leaders must distinguish between cultural customs and biblical truths to avoid imposing unnecessary cultural barriers.

### 5. Maintain Distinctiveness While Serving Society

Christianity's "strangeness" in secular culture is a source of power for influence ([Mayer Community Church, 2016](https://www.mayercommunitychurch.com/how-should-christians-interact-with-our-current-culture/)). Christians should not seek to blend in but to live faithfully and prophetically, addressing social and political issues with the gospel's truth.

### 6. Leverage Global Christianity and Reverse Mission

The explosive growth of Christianity outside the West, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, offers new opportunities for revitalization in Western contexts through "reverse mission" ([The Gospel Coalition, 2020](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/how-to-reach-the-west-again/); [Wikipedia, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mission)). Immigrant Christian communities bring vibrant faith expressions that can renew Western churches.

### 7. Address Cultural Issues with Biblical Convictions

Christians should engage cultural issues such as human rights, education, and social justice from a biblical perspective, influencing culture positively without compromising gospel truths ([TIFWE, 2012](https://tifwe.org/can-christians-today-really-impact-culture/)).

### 8. Avoid Both Isolationism and Assimilation

Three broad options for Christian cultural engagement include isolation, assimilation, and engagement. Engagement—speaking prophetically and lovingly to culture—is the most effective for influence ([Mayer Community Church, 2016](https://www.mayercommunitychurch.com/how-should-christians-interact-with-our-current-culture/)).

## Practical Recommendations for Christians Today

| **Maintain Gospel Distinctiveness**      | Resist cultural assimilation that dilutes Christian identity and message.                      | Uphold biblical ethics and gospel-centered worship       |
| **Serve Society Practically**             | Demonstrate Christian love through social services and community engagement.                   | Support charities, advocate for justice                  |

## Conclusion

Today's Christians face a complex cultural landscape marked by post-Christianity, relativism, and cultural hostility. However, history shows that Christianity's deep involvement in culture can lead to profound transformation. To impact Western culture effectively and draw others to Christ, Christians must adopt a missionary encounter model that connects and confronts culture with the gospel, engage intentionally in cultural capital, foster authentic conversion, and maintain gospel distinctiveness while serving society.

The growth of global Christianity and the presence of immigrant Christians in the West offer renewed hope for revitalization. By combining theological depth, cultural understanding, and practical engagement, Christians can reclaim influence and witness meaningfully to a culture in need of the gospel.
