# Factors Influencing Police Discretion: A Comprehensive Analysis

Police discretion is a fundamental aspect of law enforcement, allowing officers to make decisions based on their judgment in various situations. This report provides an in-depth examination of the factors that influence police discretion, drawing on a wide range of scholarly and practical sources. The analysis highlights the complexity of discretion, the internal and external controls that shape it, and the implications for policing practices.

## Understanding Police Discretion

Discretion in policing refers to the authority and decision-making power granted to officers to choose how to act in situations where the law or departmental policies allow flexibility. This can include decisions such as whether to stop an individual, make an arrest, use force, issue citations, or let someone go with a warning (Treebold, 2018). Discretion is exercised daily and is influenced by numerous factors ranging from legal constraints to personal biases.

## Categories of Factors Influencing Police Discretion

The factors influencing police discretion can be broadly categorized into **legal factors**, **organizational factors**, **situational factors**, **officer-related factors**, and **external controls**. Each category plays a significant role in shaping how discretion is applied in practice.

### 1. Legal Factors

Legal factors impose formal constraints on police discretion. These include laws, statutes, and judicial rulings that mandate or limit certain police actions. For example, mandatory arrest laws in domestic violence cases require officers to arrest suspects when probable cause exists, reducing discretion in such scenarios (Hirschel, 2004). Similarly, court decisions and administrative policies can restrict or guide officers’ choices.

### 2. Organizational Factors

The police department’s structure, culture, and policies significantly influence discretion. Departments may adopt different policing styles:

| Policing Style     | Description                                                                 | Impact on Discretion                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Legalistic Style   | Emphasizes strict adherence to laws and administrative rules                | Limits individual officer discretion          |
| Service Style     | Focuses on community service and officer independence                       | Grants more discretion to officers            |
| Watchman Style    | Prioritizes order maintenance, often informal and flexible                  | Discretion varies based on officer judgment   |

Officers in departments with a legalistic style are more likely to follow strict rules, while those in service-oriented departments enjoy greater latitude in decision-making (Nowacki, 2011). Organizational culture also plays a role; a culture fostering an “us versus them” mentality may increase suspicion and reduce leniency (Mastrofski, 2004).

### 3. Situational Factors

Situational elements are immediate circumstances that affect an officer’s discretion in a given encounter. The most critical situational factor is the behavior of the suspect. An uncooperative or disrespectful suspect is more likely to face arrest or stricter enforcement, whereas cooperative individuals may receive warnings or leniency (Holmgren, 2017). Other situational factors include the seriousness of the offense, presence of witnesses, and environmental context.

### 4. Officer-Related Factors

Individual characteristics and experiences of officers influence their discretionary decisions. These include:

- **Background and Socialization:** Officers’ family values, education, and prior experiences shape their attitudes and biases. Prejudice against certain ethnic groups or social classes can affect decisions (CustomWritings, n.d.).
- **Perceptions of the Suspect:** Demeanor, appearance, style of dress, and grooming can influence treatment. For instance, poorly groomed suspects or those with unconventional attire may face harsher treatment (CustomWritings, n.d.).
- **Experience and Training:** More experienced officers may exercise discretion differently compared to novices, often balancing enforcement with community relations.
- **Emotional State and Stress:** High-stress situations can impact judgment, sometimes leading to more aggressive or conservative decisions.

### 5. External Controls

External controls include oversight mechanisms and legal mandates that regulate discretion:

- **Legislation:** Laws at local, state, and federal levels can mandate specific actions, such as mandatory arrests or reporting requirements.
- **Community Expectations:** Public opinion and community relations can pressure officers to act in certain ways.
- **Judicial and Prosecutorial Policies:** Decisions by prosecutors and courts influence how police apply discretion, particularly regarding charges and plea bargains.
- **Supervision and Accountability:** Internal affairs, body cameras, and performance reviews serve as external checks on discretion (CourseHero, n.d.).

## Internal vs. External Controls of Police Discretion

Police discretion is moderated by both internal and external control mechanisms that ensure decisions align with legal and ethical standards.

| Control Type     | Description                                                                                     | Examples                                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal Controls | Policies, operational guidelines, supervision, and departmental culture influencing officer behavior | Stop and Frisk policies, supervisory oversight       |
| External Controls | Laws, judicial rulings, community expectations, and external oversight bodies                    | Mandatory arrest laws, civilian review boards        |

Internal controls are embedded within the police organization and can either restrict or guide discretion. For example, the New York Police Department’s Stop and Frisk policy required officers to make arrests for minor offenses in high-crime areas, reducing discretionary leniency (LaVigne et al., 2014). External controls, such as legislative mandates, can compel officers to take specific actions regardless of personal judgment.

## Impact of Police Discretion

Police discretion has both positive and negative consequences:

- **Positive:** It allows officers to tailor responses to individual circumstances, reduce unnecessary arrests, and engage constructively with vulnerable populations (Ultius, n.d.).
- **Negative:** Discretion can lead to inconsistency, bias, and abuse of power, undermining public trust and fairness in law enforcement (Beckett, 2016).

Therefore, balancing discretion with appropriate controls is essential for ethical and effective policing.

## Synthesis and Opinion

Based on the reviewed literature, police discretion is influenced by a complex interplay of legal, organizational, situational, personal, and external factors. The degree of discretion varies widely depending on departmental culture, legal mandates, and the specific context of each encounter.

In my assessment, **organizational culture and situational factors are the most influential in shaping discretion**. While legal factors set boundaries, the culture within a department and the immediate circumstances of an incident largely determine how discretion is exercised. For example, two officers facing the same legal framework may act differently if one works in a service-oriented department and the other in a legalistic one. Similarly, an officer’s response to a cooperative versus an uncooperative suspect will differ significantly.

Furthermore, **internal controls such as supervision and policies are crucial in guiding discretion to prevent abuse**, but they must be balanced to avoid overly rigid enforcement that undermines officer judgment. External controls, including community oversight and legislative mandates, provide necessary accountability but should allow flexibility to adapt to complex social realities.

In conclusion, effective management of police discretion requires a nuanced understanding of these factors and a commitment to training, oversight, and community engagement to ensure discretion serves justice and public safety.
