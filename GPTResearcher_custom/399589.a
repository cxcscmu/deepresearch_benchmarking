# Report on the Expansion of the College Football Playoff (CFP)

## Introduction

The College Football Playoff (CFP) system, inaugurated in 2014, currently features a four-team postseason format to determine the national champion in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Since its inception, the CFP has been the subject of intense debate regarding its size and structure. Proposals to expand the playoff field to 12 teams have gained momentum, promising increased inclusivity, revenue, and competitive balance. However, expansion also raises concerns about player welfare, the sanctity of the regular season, and the impact on traditional bowl games.

This report provides a comprehensive, objective analysis of the arguments for and against expanding the CFP, supported by recent data and expert opinions. It concludes with a reasoned position on whether the CFP should expand, based on the synthesis of available evidence and stakeholder perspectives.

## Background and Current Landscape

### Current CFP Structure and Performance

- The CFP currently invites four teams annually, selected by a committee based on rankings and other criteria.
- Since 2014, only 11 universities have appeared in the playoff, with Alabama and Clemson dominating six appearances each.
- The CFP generates approximately $475 million annually in revenue, distributed among conferences and schools.
- Ratings for the CFP National Championship have declined by over 25% since 2014, indicating waning viewer engagement ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com)).

### Proposed Expansion Model

- The leading proposal suggests expanding to a 12-team playoff, including the six highest-ranked conference champions and six at-large teams.
- The top four conference champions would receive first-round byes; seeds 5-12 would compete in first-round games hosted on campus.
- Quarterfinals and semifinals would be played in bowl games, with the championship game rotating annually among host cities.
- Expansion could potentially triple the playoff field and increase annual revenue to $1 billion or more, possibly exceeding $2 billion when including ticketing and sponsorships ([Blinder, 2021](https://www.nytimes.com)).

## Arguments in Favor of CFP Expansion

### 1. Increased Revenue and Financial Stability

- Expansion is projected to generate two to five times the current revenue, potentially exceeding $1 billion annually.
- This influx would bolster athletic department budgets, which have faced deficits exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Additional revenue could fund enhanced medical coverage and potentially provide direct financial benefits to players, addressing compensation issues raised by recent legal decisions ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com)).

### 2. Greater Competitive Inclusivity and Fairness

- A 12-team format guarantees at least one Group of Five conference champion a playoff berth, addressing historic exclusion.
- Expansion would increase the number of teams with a legitimate chance to compete late into the season, enhancing fan engagement and the meaningfulness of regular-season games.
- The current four-team format is criticized as "broken," favoring a small group of elite programs and limiting diversity in championship contenders ([Blinder, 2021](https://www.nytimes.com)).

### 3. Enhanced Fan Engagement and Reduced Opt-Outs

- More playoff games mean fewer players opting out of bowl games, as postseason contests would carry greater significance.
- The expanded format could replicate the excitement and unpredictability of tournaments like March Madness, with Cinderella teams having a chance to compete on a national stage ([Gibbons, 2022](https://killfrogssports.com)).

### 4. Alignment with Other NCAA Sports and Professional Models

- Other NCAA sports feature larger postseason tournaments (e.g., Division III football has a 32-team playoff).
- The NFL's playoff structure involves multiple rounds and teams, providing a model for managing extended postseason play without compromising player safety excessively.
- Expansion reflects evolving media landscapes, with potential for multi-network or streaming platform deals, increasing exposure and revenue ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com)).

## Arguments Against CFP Expansion

### 1. Player Health and Safety Concerns

- Expansion could increase the maximum number of games for some teams to 17, matching the NFL regular season length.
- Football has a high incidence of injuries and fatalities, with over 30 player deaths in two decades, mostly from heat exertion during practice.
- The physical toll of additional games raises ethical and logistical challenges, including the need for expanded medical support and possible compensation for athletes ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com)).

### 2. Potential Erosion of Bowl Game Significance

- Traditional bowl games, especially the Rose Bowl, may lose their unique identities and traditional conference matchups.
- The Rose Bowl could be relegated to hosting quarterfinal games on or near New Year's Day, losing its historic prestige.
- Lower-tier bowls risk losing access to top teams, diminishing their relevance and financial viability ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com)).

### 3. Risk of More Lopsided Matchups and Consolidation of Power

- Critics argue expansion may lead to more blowouts, as lower-seeded or Group of Five teams face dominant Power Five programs.
- Financial and competitive advantages may consolidate further among wealthy, well-funded programs, potentially marginalizing smaller schools.
- Analysis of hypothetical expanded brackets suggests that while more teams participate, the ultimate champion is unlikely to differ significantly from the current format ([Gibbons, 2022](https://killfrogssports.com)).

### 4. Logistical and Contractual Challenges

- The current ESPN contract for CFP media rights runs through 2025, with renegotiations pending.
- Expansion requires unanimous agreement among commissioners and university presidents, a process complicated by conference realignment and differing interests.
- Scheduling must consider NFL playoff dates and academic calendars, adding complexity to implementation ([Dinich, 2021](https://www.espn.com)).

## Stakeholder Perspectives

- **Commissioners and Athletic Directors:** Generally favor expansion but differ on format details and timing. Some Power Five conferences seek to protect their interests, while Group of Five commissioners advocate for guaranteed access ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com); [Dinich, 2021](https://www.espn.com)).

- **Coaches:** Mixed views. Nick Saban expressed skepticism that expansion would reduce blowouts or improve competitiveness ([Sallee, 2022](https://www.cbssports.com)).

- **Players:** Likely to benefit from more meaningful games and potential compensation but face increased physical demands.

- **Fans:** Desire more inclusive and exciting playoffs but concerned about preserving tradition and competitive integrity.

- **Media and Rights Holders:** Stand to gain from increased content and viewership opportunities; ESPN and others may compete for rights, driving up value ([Dodd, 2021](https://www.cbssports.com)).

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the available evidence, the College Football Playoff **should expand** to a 12-team format, with careful consideration and mitigation of associated challenges.

### Justification

1. **Revenue and Financial Sustainability:** The projected increase in revenue is substantial and necessary to support athletic programs, especially in the post-pandemic landscape. This financial boost can also address player welfare concerns through enhanced medical care and compensation mechanisms.

2. **Competitive Fairness and Inclusivity:** Expansion addresses long-standing inequities by guaranteeing access to Group of Five conference champions and increasing the number of teams with a legitimate chance at the title, thus enhancing the sport's competitive integrity.

3. **Fan Engagement and Growth:** More playoff games create sustained excitement throughout the season, reducing opt-outs and increasing national interest, which is vital for the sport's growth and media appeal.

4. **Tradition vs. Progress:** While expansion challenges traditional bowl structures, the evolution of college football necessitates adaptation. Preserving bowl games as hosts for playoff rounds maintains some historical continuity while embracing modernization.

5. **Player Welfare:** Concerns about increased physical strain are valid but can be addressed through scheduling adjustments, roster expansions, and financial support for athletes, including potential direct benefits tied to name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Unanimous Agreement:** Stakeholders must continue dialogue to reach consensus on format, automatic bids, and scheduling.

- **Player Safety Protocols:** Establish enhanced medical and welfare standards to mitigate risks.

- **Bowl Game Integration:** Negotiate roles for traditional bowls to retain relevance and financial viability.

- **Media Rights Strategy:** Leverage competitive bidding and multi-platform distribution to maximize revenue.
