# Should the Central Bank Aim for Zero Inflation?

Inflation targeting is a fundamental aspect of modern monetary policy, with central banks worldwide typically setting explicit inflation targets to guide their policy decisions. A critical debate in macroeconomic policy is whether central banks should aim for zero inflation or maintain a positive inflation target, commonly around 2%. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the arguments for and against a zero-inflation target, weighing the economic costs and benefits, and ultimately offers a reasoned conclusion based on the latest and most reliable evidence.

## Understanding Inflation Targeting and Zero Inflation

Inflation targeting refers to the practice where central banks set a specific inflation rate as the goal of monetary policy, using tools such as interest rates and open market operations to achieve it. Most developed economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Eurozone, have adopted inflation targets typically ranging from 1% to 3% (Bernanke et al., 2003; Pettinger, 2017).

Zero inflation implies a price stability regime where the general price level remains constant over time, eliminating inflationary increases in prices. Advocates argue that zero inflation represents true price stability and eliminates the costs associated with inflation, while opponents caution about the potential economic risks and costs of achieving and maintaining such a target.

## Arguments in Favor of Zero Inflation

### 1. Price Stability and Elimination of Inflation Costs

One of the primary advantages of zero inflation is that it provides a clear and natural focal point for policymakers. Unlike arbitrary positive targets (e.g., 2% or 3%), zero inflation is the only rate at which the central bank can claim to have fully achieved price stability and eliminated inflation's costs (R. Hayden, 2022). Inflation imposes several real costs on society, including:

- Erosion of purchasing power, especially harmful to those on fixed incomes such as pensioners.
- Distortion of price signals, which can lead to inefficient resource allocation.
- Redistribution effects, such as reducing the real value of loans repaid in inflated currency.
- Menu costs associated with frequent price changes.
- Uncertainty affecting investment and saving decisions.

Reducing inflation to zero would theoretically eliminate these costs, thereby improving economic efficiency and welfare.

### 2. Credibility and Expectations Management

If the central bank credibly commits to zero inflation, it can influence inflation expectations directly. This expectation adjustment can improve the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment, potentially lowering the cost of disinflation (R. Hayden, 2022). Credibility is crucial; if the public believes the central bank will maintain zero inflation, inflation expectations will adjust downward, reducing the need for aggressive monetary tightening.

### 3. Avoiding Arbitrary Inflation Targets

Setting a positive inflation target like 2% or 3% is somewhat arbitrary. For example, if the Federal Reserve targets 3% inflation but inflation rises to 4% or 5%, there is no inherent reason not to revise the target upward. Zero inflation provides a more stable and defensible anchor for monetary policy (R. Hayden, 2022).

## Arguments Against Zero Inflation

### 1. Costs of Disinflation and Economic Trade-offs

Reducing inflation to zero is not costless. Disinflation typically requires contractionary monetary policy that can lead to higher unemployment and lower output in the short run, as illustrated by the Phillips curve (R. Hayden, 2022). This "disinflationary recession" can be politically and socially costly.

Moreover, some economists suggest that inflation rates close to zero may increase the long-run level of unemployment (Akerlof et al., 1996). The zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates also restricts the central bank's ability to stimulate the economy during recessions if inflation is too low, as nominal rates cannot be pushed below zero easily (Meyer, 2001).

### 2. Risk of Deflation

Zero inflation targets increase the risk of deflation, which can have severe economic consequences. Deflation increases the real burden of debt, discourages spending and investment, and can lead to prolonged economic stagnation (FRBSF, 2007). The experience of Japan in the 1990s exemplifies the dangers of deflationary pressures.

### 3. Practical Challenges and Policy Flexibility

Strict adherence to zero inflation may limit the central bank's flexibility to respond to financial crises or supply shocks. Inflation targeting regimes that are too rigid can lead to poor outcomes in employment, exchange rates, and other macroeconomic variables (Bernanke et al., 2003). Public support for strict zero inflation policies may also be lacking if the associated costs are perceived as too high.

### 4. Theoretical Critiques: Price Stability vs. Spending Stability

Some economists argue that the zero inflation ideal is based on unrealistic assumptions of a stationary economy with no productivity growth (Selgin, 1995). Instead, a more desirable monetary policy would stabilize total dollar spending (nominal GDP or money GNP), allowing for price level changes that reflect real economic growth or contraction without harmful side effects.

Under stable spending, productivity improvements would lead to falling prices (benign deflation), while economic downturns would cause inflationary price rises, but without the adverse effects linked to excessive money supply growth or contraction (Selgin, 1995).

## Empirical Evidence and Current Practices

Most developed economies have settled on positive inflation targets around 2%, balancing the costs and benefits of inflation control. For example:

| Country          | Inflation Target (%) | Notes                                         |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| United States    | 2                   | Federal Reserve aims for 2% inflation          |
| United Kingdom   | 2 (+/-1)            | Bank of England considers output and unemployment |
| Eurozone        | Below, but close to 2| European Central Bank target                    |
| Japan           | 2                   | Adopted to combat deflationary pressures       |

These targets reflect a consensus that zero inflation may be too restrictive and risky, especially considering the zero lower bound and deflation risks (Bernanke et al., 2003; Pettinger, 2017).

## Balancing the Costs and Benefits: A Reasoned Conclusion

The evidence suggests that while zero inflation has theoretical appeal due to its clarity and elimination of inflation costs, the practical and economic costs of achieving and maintaining zero inflation are significant. These include higher short-term unemployment, increased risk of deflation, and reduced policy flexibility.

However, the costs of reducing inflation need not be as large as sometimes feared if the central bank establishes a credible commitment to price stability. This credibility can lower inflation expectations and improve the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment (R. Hayden, 2022).

Given these considerations, a central bank should not rigidly aim for zero inflation but rather target a low and stable positive inflation rate, typically around 2%. This target balances the goal of price stability with the need for economic flexibility and the avoidance of deflation. Moreover, focusing on stabilizing nominal GDP or total spending, rather than the price level alone, may provide a more effective framework for monetary policy in a dynamic economy (Selgin, 1995).

### Policy Recommendations

- **Maintain a low positive inflation target (around 2%)** to provide a buffer against deflation and allow monetary policy flexibility.
- **Enhance central bank credibility** through clear communication and legislative support for price stability as a primary goal.
- **Consider nominal GDP targeting** as a complementary or alternative approach to inflation targeting to stabilize total spending.
- **Monitor economic conditions closely** to adjust policy in response to supply shocks and financial crises without rigid adherence to inflation targets.
