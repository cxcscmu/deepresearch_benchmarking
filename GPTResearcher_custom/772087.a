# How the Definitions of Communication and Culture Can Be Used to Foster Intercultural Literacy: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

In an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, intercultural literacy has become an essential competency. Intercultural literacy refers to the ability to understand, respect, and effectively interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. It encompasses knowledge, attitudes, and skills that enable individuals to navigate cultural differences and communicate appropriately across cultures. Central to fostering intercultural literacy are the foundational concepts of **communication** and **culture**. This report explores how the definitions of communication and culture can be strategically employed to enhance intercultural literacy, drawing on academic insights and practical examples.

## Defining Communication and Culture

### Communication

Communication is broadly defined as the process of sharing and understanding meaning between individuals or groups through verbal and nonverbal symbols. It involves encoding, transmitting, and decoding messages in a way that is mutually comprehensible. As Pearson and Nelson (2000) describe, communication means “sharing and understanding meaning” or “making common” ([Samovar et al., 2017](https://www.coursehero.com/file/17090094/COM-263-DQdocx/)).

Communication is symbolic, learned, dynamic, and contextual. Symbols—words, gestures, images—do not inherently carry meaning but are assigned meaning through social conventions within cultural contexts. Effective communication requires not only linguistic competence but also an understanding of the cultural norms that shape how messages are sent and received.

### Culture

Culture is a complex and multifaceted concept, often defined as a learned set of shared interpretations of beliefs, values, norms, and social practices that influence the behaviors of a group of people. Lustig and Koester (2005) define culture as “a learned set of shared interpretations of beliefs, values, norms, and social practices” ([Samovar et al., 2017](https://www.coursehero.com/file/17090094/COM-263-DQdocx/)).

Culture is transmitted from generation to generation through communication and socialization. It is dynamic, constantly negotiated, and heterogeneous, meaning that even within a cultural group, variations and subcultures exist. Culture encompasses language, religion, art, laws, customs, and social behaviors, all of which influence how individuals perceive the world and interact with others.

## The Interrelationship Between Communication and Culture

The phrase “culture is communication, and communication is culture” (E. T. Hall, 1959) encapsulates the inseparability of these two concepts. Culture provides the framework within which communication occurs, and communication is the vehicle through which culture is created, maintained, and transformed.

| Aspect                 | Communication                                  | Culture                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Nature                 | Process of sharing meaning                     | Learned patterns of beliefs, values, behaviors |
| Medium                 | Verbal and nonverbal symbols                   | Language, rituals, norms, customs               |
| Function               | Conveying messages                             | Guiding behavior and social interaction         |
| Relationship           | Symbolic and contextual                        | Dynamic and transmitted through communication   |

Understanding this interrelationship is critical to fostering intercultural literacy. Miscommunication often arises not from language barriers alone but from differing cultural contexts that shape the interpretation of messages.

## Fostering Intercultural Literacy Through Definitions of Communication and Culture

### 1. Enhancing Awareness of Cultural Differences in Communication

By defining communication as a symbolic and contextual process, learners become aware that the same words or gestures can have different meanings across cultures. For example, eye contact is considered respectful and attentive in some cultures but rude or confrontational in others. Recognizing these differences helps individuals avoid misinterpretations and adapt their communication styles accordingly.

Similarly, understanding culture as a dynamic system of shared beliefs and practices encourages learners to appreciate the diversity within and between cultures. This awareness reduces ethnocentrism—the tendency to view one’s own culture as superior—and fosters respect for cultural variations.

### 2. Developing Skills for Effective Intercultural Communication

The definitions highlight that communication competence involves not only linguistic skills but also cultural knowledge and sensitivity. Intercultural literacy requires:

- **Motivation** to engage with other cultures.
- **Knowledge** of cultural norms, values, and communication styles.
- **Skills** in adapting messages, interpreting nonverbal cues, and managing uncertainty.

For instance, Deardorff’s model of intercultural communication competence emphasizes motivation, knowledge, and skills as foundational to effective intercultural interaction ([Deardorff, 2004](https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/intercultural-communication-competencies-study-material.pdf)).

### 3. Using Language as a Tool for Cultural Representation and Interpretation

Language is a primary medium through which culture is expressed and transmitted. The way language is used to describe a culture shapes perceptions and understanding. The example of the Nacirema culture, a satirical portrayal of American culture, illustrates how language and framing influence cultural interpretation.

Horace Miner’s “Body Ritual Among the Nacirema” uses anthropological language to describe everyday American behaviors as exotic rituals, encouraging readers to reflect on their own cultural assumptions ([Miner, 1956](https://www.coursehero.com/file/17090094/COM-263-DQdocx/)). This approach fosters intercultural literacy by:

- Challenging stereotypes and ethnocentric views.
- Encouraging critical reflection on one’s own culture.
- Highlighting the role of language in shaping cultural narratives.

### 4. Reducing Uncertainty and Anxiety in Intercultural Encounters

Communication is inherently uncertain, especially across cultures. Defining communication as a process of shared meaning emphasizes the need to reduce uncertainty through knowledge acquisition and adaptation.

Uncertainty reduction theory suggests that gaining information about another culture helps predict behaviors and facilitates smoother interactions. Adaptation theory further proposes that immersion and cultural learning enhance communication effectiveness ([Samovar et al., 2017](https://www.coursehero.com/file/17090094/COM-263-DQdocx/)).

### 5. Promoting Ethical and Respectful Communication

Understanding culture and communication definitions fosters ethical communication by highlighting the importance of respect, empathy, and openness. Recognizing that communication is learned and context-dependent encourages individuals to avoid imposing their cultural norms on others and to seek mutual understanding.

For example, the Christian worldview, as discussed in course reflections, supports the motivation to learn and adapt to diverse cultures out of respect and love for others, aligning with principles of intercultural competence.

## Practical Applications and Examples

### Case Study: Nacirema Culture

- **Language Use:** Describes American cultural practices in anthropological terms.
- **Impact:** Encourages self-examination and challenges cultural biases.
- **Literacy Outcome:** Enhances awareness of how language frames cultural understanding.

### Communication Styles Across Cultures

- **Direct vs. Indirect Communication:** Cultures vary in preference for directness.
- **Example:** In some Asian cultures, indirect communication is preferred to maintain harmony, whereas Western cultures may value directness.
- **Application:** Understanding these differences helps avoid misinterpretation and offense.

### Nonverbal Communication

- **Silence:** Valued in Japanese culture as a moment for reflection, but often uncomfortable in American culture.
- **Body Language:** Gestures and eye contact vary widely.
- **Outcome:** Recognizing nonverbal cues as culturally bound aids in accurate interpretation.

## Challenges in Fostering Intercultural Literacy

- **Language Barriers:** Even shared languages have dialects, slang, and cultural nuances.
- **Ethnocentrism and Stereotyping:** Preconceived notions hinder open communication.
- **Power Dynamics:** Dominant cultures may expect others to adapt without reciprocation.
- **Complexity of Culture:** Culture is not monolithic; subcultures and individual differences exist.
