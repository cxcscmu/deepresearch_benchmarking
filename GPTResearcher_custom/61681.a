# Report on Current Events Affecting International Business

## Introduction

International business operates in a dynamic and complex environment influenced by political, economic, social, technological, and legal factors. As of 2025, several current events and trends significantly impact international business operations, strategies, and global economic relations. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of these events, drawing on recent research and expert analyses to understand their implications for international business.

## 1. Geopolitical Shifts and Global Order

### Post-Pandemic Geopolitical Scenarios

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated geopolitical shifts, creating two contrasting scenarios for the global order by 2025: **Global Cooperation** and **Fragmentation**.

- **Global Cooperation Scenario**: This scenario envisions strengthened multilateralism, with major powers like the US, China, and the EU engaging cooperatively to manage global challenges. The EU achieves greater cohesion post-Brexit, and global institutions are revitalized to address pandemics and economic shocks. This environment fosters competitive yet collaborative international business, with increased investment flows into regions like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa due to heightened US-China engagement ([Suckling et al., 2020](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/geopolitics-in-a-post-pandemic-world-scenarios-for-2025.html)).

- **Fragmentation Scenario**: Contrarily, this scenario predicts weakened global institutions, increased nationalism, and protectionism. The EU could splinter, and major economies focus inward, leading to supply chain reshoring and trade barriers. This fragmentation raises risks such as contract enforcement issues and tax inconsistencies, complicating international trade and investment ([Suckling et al., 2020](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/geopolitics-in-a-post-pandemic-world-scenarios-for-2025.html)).

**Implications for International Business**: Businesses must prepare for both cooperation and fragmentation, developing flexible strategies to navigate either scenario. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) may face increased regulatory scrutiny, supply chain disruptions, or opportunities for new market entry depending on the geopolitical climate.

## 2. Political Disruption and Nationalism

### US Political Uncertainty and Brexit

- The US political landscape remains uncertain, with election outcomes influencing trade policies and international relations. Companies experience decision-making delays due to unpredictability in US policy directions ([Lovick, 2020](https://businessbecause.com/news/emba/7025/5-biggest-trends-impacting-international-business-in-2020)).

- The UK's post-Brexit repositioning introduces legal and trade uncertainties. UK businesses and their international partners face challenges in planning and innovation due to ongoing negotiations and regulatory changes ([Lovick, 2020](https://businessbecause.com/news/emba/7025/5-biggest-trends-impacting-international-business-in-2020)).

### Rise of Populism and Economic Nationalism

Populism and nationalism have surged globally, influencing protectionist policies, trade barriers, and skepticism toward globalization. This trend challenges the previously dominant narrative of hyper-globalization and has led to trade wars and economic realignments, particularly between the US and China ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

**Implications**: Increased protectionism and nationalist policies can disrupt global supply chains, increase costs, and necessitate reshoring or diversification of operations. MNEs face greater liabilities of foreignness and must enhance legitimacy in host countries.

## 3. Globalization Trends and Supply Chain Dynamics

### Shifting Supply Chains

Trade conflicts, such as the US-China tariff war, and the pandemic have prompted companies to reconsider supply chain strategies:

- **Regionalization and Glocalization**: Firms are moving toward regional supply chains closer to customers to reduce risks from global disruptions. This approach allows customization to local markets and mitigates exposure to international conflicts ([Gupta, 2021](https://www.mhlnews.com/global-supply-chain/article/21145050/shifting-supply-chains-whats-ahead-for-international-trade)).

- **Trade Agreements and Conflicts**: New trade deals like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the EU-China agreement aim to facilitate trade, but renegotiations (e.g., USMCA replacing NAFTA) and digital tax disputes continue to create uncertainties ([Gupta, 2021](https://www.mhlnews.com/global-supply-chain/article/21145050/shifting-supply-chains-whats-ahead-for-international-trade)).

### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)

- Global FDI flows have been slower to recover post-pandemic compared to trade volumes, reflecting heightened uncertainty and protectionism ([Pisani, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

- Cross-border M&As are regaining momentum, particularly in developed economies, while greenfield investments have declined, especially in developing countries ([Pisani, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

**Implications**: Businesses need to adapt investment strategies, focusing on mergers and acquisitions in stable markets while being cautious with new greenfield projects in volatile regions.

## 4. Technological Innovation and Digital Globalization

### Digital Transformation and AI

- The adoption of digital technologies, including AI and big data analytics, has accelerated, particularly due to the pandemic. Digital platforms dominate markets, creating monopolistic advantages for firms like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

- AI enhances decision-making but raises ethical, privacy, and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with GDPR and data sovereignty laws ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

### Impact on Labor and Supply Chains

- Digitalization reduces demand for unskilled labor and reshapes global value chains (GVCs), with increased automation and regionalization ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

- The pandemic-induced shift to remote work and online commerce has permanently altered consumer behavior and business operations ([Lovick, 2020](https://businessbecause.com/news/emba/7025/5-biggest-trends-impacting-international-business-in-2020)).

**Implications**: MNEs must invest in digital capabilities, manage data responsibly, and navigate regulatory landscapes while addressing workforce transitions.

## 5. Sustainable Development and Climate Change

### Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and ESG Investing

- There is growing pressure on businesses to address environmental and social impacts, with CSR becoming a strategic priority ([Lovick, 2020](https://businessbecause.com/news/emba/7025/5-biggest-trends-impacting-international-business-in-2020)).

- Institutional investors increasingly favor ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria, influencing corporate strategies and capital flows ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

### Energy Transition and Regulatory Environment

- Policies promoting renewable energy and carbon reduction, such as the EU’s net-zero targets, impact industries heavily reliant on fossil fuels, including automotive and energy sectors ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

- Governments provide subsidies and incentives to facilitate transitions, but geopolitical considerations, such as China’s dominance in battery production, complicate outcomes ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

**Implications**: MNEs must integrate sustainability into business models, comply with evolving regulations, and manage stakeholder expectations to maintain competitiveness.

## 6. Changing Power Dynamics in International Business

### Market Power and Political Influence of MNEs

- MNEs possess significant market power due to intangible assets and global networks, influencing governments and regulatory frameworks ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

- Tax avoidance and profit-shifting practices by MNEs raise concerns and lead to increased governmental scrutiny and FDI screening ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

### Power Asymmetries in Global Value Chains

- Lead firms in GVCs often capture disproportionate value, while suppliers and labor face weakened bargaining power and increased competition ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

- The complexity of managing fragmented GVCs requires MNEs to adopt non-market strategies to maintain legitimacy and manage political risks ([Ghauri et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101794)).

**Implications**: Businesses must balance market power with social responsibility, engage in transparent governance, and navigate political environments skillfully.
