# Report on the Percentage of Women Who Identify as Pro-Choice in the United States

## Introduction

The issue of abortion remains one of the most polarizing and politically charged topics in the United States. Central to this debate is the distinction between "pro-choice" and "pro-life" positions, with the former advocating for a woman's right to choose whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy. Understanding the demographic breakdown, particularly the percentage of women who identify as pro-choice, is crucial for policymakers, healthcare providers, and social scientists. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the percentage of women in the U.S. who identify as pro-choice, drawing on multiple reputable sources including Gallup polls, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polls, and research from the Guttmacher Institute. The report also examines demographic variations and trends over time.

## Overview of Pro-Choice Identification Among Women

### National Polling Data

According to the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted in mid-2019, 60% of women identified as pro-choice, supporting abortion rights, compared to 54% of men ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449289-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll)). This poll surveyed 944 adults nationally and had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.

Gallup's Values and Beliefs poll, which annually surveys Americans on abortion attitudes, provides detailed gender-specific data. The 2021 Gallup poll found that 52% of women identified as pro-choice, while 43% identified as pro-life ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350018/americans-abortion-views-stable.aspx)). This represents a slight increase from 2020, where 53% of women were pro-choice and 41% pro-life. The 2019 Gallup poll showed a different trend, with 43% of women identifying as pro-choice and 51% as pro-life, indicating some fluctuation over recent years.

### Summary Table: Pro-Choice Identification Among Women (2018-2021)

| Year | Pro-Choice (%) | Pro-Life (%) | No Opinion (%) | Sample Size (Women) |
|-------|----------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 2018  | 48             | 47           | 4              | 472                 |
| 2019  | 43             | 51           | 6              | 480                 |
| 2020  | 53             | 41           | 6              | 491                 |
| 2021  | 52             | 43           | 4              | 471                 |

The data indicates that approximately half to slightly more than half of women identify as pro-choice, with some year-to-year variability.

## Demographic and Political Influences on Women's Pro-Choice Identification

### Political Affiliation

Political party affiliation is a strong predictor of abortion attitudes. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll (2019) found that 74% of Democrats supported abortion rights, while 64% of Republicans opposed it. Independents were more mixed, with 60% identifying as pro-choice. Women tend to lean Democratic more than men, which correlates with higher pro-choice identification among women ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449289-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll)).

Gallup data from 2021 supports this, showing 70% of Democratic women identifying as pro-choice compared to 22% of Republican women ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350018/americans-abortion-views-stable.aspx)).

### Age

Younger women are more likely to identify as pro-choice. Gallup's 2021 data shows 56% of women aged 18-29 identify as pro-choice, compared to only 39% of women aged 65 and older. This age gradient is consistent across multiple years.

### Education and Income

Higher educational attainment correlates with higher pro-choice identification. In 2021, 68% of women with postgraduate education identified as pro-choice, compared to 33% of women with no college education. Similarly, women in higher income brackets ($100,000+) are more likely to be pro-choice (61%) than those in lower income brackets ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350018/americans-abortion-views-stable.aspx)).

### Religious Attendance

Religious service attendance inversely correlates with pro-choice identification. Women who attend weekly services are less likely to be pro-choice (23%) compared to those who seldom or never attend (64%) ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350018/americans-abortion-views-stable.aspx)).

## Trends Over Time

The percentage of women identifying as pro-choice has fluctuated over the past decade but generally remains near or above 50%. For example, Gallup data shows:

- In 2015, 50% of women identified as pro-choice.
- In 2019, this dropped to 43%.
- In 2020 and 2021, it rebounded to around 52-53%.

This variability may reflect changing political climates, Supreme Court decisions, and public discourse around abortion rights.

## Comparison with Overall Population

Women are slightly more likely than men to identify as pro-choice. For instance, the 2019 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found 60% of women versus 54% of men identified as pro-choice ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449289-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll)).

## Additional Context: Abortion Experiences Among Women

Beyond self-identification, understanding the demographics of women who actually obtain abortions provides further insight into the pro-choice landscape.

- Approximately 35% of women in the U.S. will have had at least one abortion by age 45 ([HRF, 2022](https://humanrightsfoundation.org/20-remarkable-pro-choice-abortion-facts-and-statistics/)).
- The majority of women who have abortions are in their 20s, with 33.6% aged 20-24 and 26.5% aged 25-29 ([Ireland, 2018](https://givingcompass.org/article/the-demographic-breakdown-of-women-who-are-getting-abortions/)).
- Women of all races and ethnicities obtain abortions, with 38.7% white, 27.6% Black, and 24.8% Hispanic ([Ireland, 2018](https://givingcompass.org/article/the-demographic-breakdown-of-women-who-are-getting-abortions/)).

These statistics underscore that abortion is a common experience among women, which aligns with the pro-choice identification among a majority of women.

## Safety and Legal Context

The safety of abortion procedures and legal frameworks also influence public opinion:

- 88% of abortions occur in the first trimester, and only 2% after 21 weeks ([HRF, 2022](https://humanrightsfoundation.org/20-remarkable-pro-choice-abortion-facts-and-statistics/)).
- The risk of death from childbirth is approximately 10 to 14 times higher than from a safe abortion ([Ireland, 2018](https://givingcompass.org/article/the-demographic-breakdown-of-women-who-are-getting-abortions/)).
- Legal rulings such as Roe v. Wade (1973) established abortion rights but have faced ongoing challenges, affecting public attitudes and political mobilization ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449289-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll)).

## Opinion and Analysis

Based on the comprehensive data reviewed, it is evident that a significant majority of women in the United States identify as pro-choice, with percentages generally ranging from 50% to 60% in recent years. This trend is consistent across multiple reputable polling sources and reflects a stable majority position among women.

The demographic breakdown reveals that younger women, those with higher education and income, and those less religiously observant are more likely to identify as pro-choice. Political affiliation also plays a critical role, with Democratic women overwhelmingly pro-choice and Republican women predominantly pro-life.

Given that approximately one-third of women will have an abortion by age 45, the pro-choice identification among women aligns with lived experiences and the recognition of reproductive autonomy.

The data also suggests that despite political and legislative challenges, the pro-choice stance among women remains resilient and may even be increasing slightly in response to restrictive state laws and Supreme Court challenges.

In conclusion, the evidence supports the position that **a majority of women in the United States are pro-choice**, advocating for the right to make decisions about their own reproductive health. This majority is not only a reflection of political ideology but also of practical considerations related to health, economic circumstances, and personal autonomy.
