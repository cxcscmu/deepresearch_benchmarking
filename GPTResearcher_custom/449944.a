# Report on the Percentage of Women Who Are Pro-Choice in the United States

The issue of abortion remains one of the most polarizing and debated topics in the United States, with public opinion often divided along political, demographic, and ideological lines. Understanding the percentage of women who identify as pro-choice is crucial for grasping the social and political landscape surrounding reproductive rights. This report provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of women's pro-choice identification, drawing from multiple reputable sources, including Gallup, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polls, and other research organizations. The report also explores demographic variations, trends over time, and contextual factors influencing women's views on abortion.

## Overview of Women's Pro-Choice Identification

### National Polling Data

According to a 2019 NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, **60% of women** identified as supporting abortion rights, compared to 54% of men, indicating a slightly higher pro-choice identification among women ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/447398-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll)). This poll also found that 57% of Americans overall identified as pro-choice, with 35% opposing abortion rights.

Gallup's 2021 data presents a slightly different but consistent picture. In their May 2021 Values and Beliefs poll, **52% of women** identified as pro-choice, while 43% identified as pro-life. Among men, 45% were pro-choice and 50% pro-life ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)). This data suggests a modest majority of women support abortion rights, though the margin is narrower than in some other polls.

### Gender Gap in Abortion Attitudes

The gender gap in abortion attitudes is relatively small but consistent. For example, Gallup's 2018 poll showed 48% of women identified as pro-choice compared to 47% of men ([Gallup, 2018](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)). Similarly, a 2020 Gallup poll indicated that 52% of women were pro-choice versus 45% of men ([Gallup, 2020](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)).

Interestingly, some analyses suggest women might be slightly less likely to support abortion rights than men due to factors such as religiosity. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake noted in 2018 that women tend to be more religious and thus somewhat less likely to be pro-choice than men ([Lake, 2018](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/395816-dem-pollster-women-are-less-likely-to-be-pro-choice)).

## Demographic Variations Among Women

### Age

Younger women are more likely to identify as pro-choice. Gallup's 2021 data shows:

| Age Group | % Pro-Choice Women | % Pro-Life Women | % No Opinion |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 18-29     | 56%                | 39%              | 5%           |
| 30-49     | 50%                | 45%              | 5%           |
| 50-64     | 48%                | 46%              | 6%           |
| 65+       | 39%                | 58%              | 3%           |

This trend indicates that younger women are significantly more supportive of abortion rights than older women ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)).

### Education

Education level strongly correlates with pro-choice identification among women:

| Education Level     | % Pro-Choice Women | % Pro-Life Women | % No Opinion |
|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| No college          | 33%                | 62%              | 6%           |
| Some college        | 49%                | 45%              | 6%           |
| College graduate    | 62%                | 36%              | 3%           |
| Postgraduate degree | 68%                | 28%              | 4%           |

Women with higher education levels are more likely to identify as pro-choice, with nearly 7 out of 10 postgraduate women supporting abortion rights ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)).

### Political Affiliation and Ideology

Political party affiliation is a strong predictor of abortion attitudes:

| Party Affiliation | % Pro-Choice Women | % Pro-Life Women | % No Opinion |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Democratic        | 70%                | 26%              | 4%           |
| Independent       | 53%                | 41%              | 6%           |
| Republican        | 22%                | 74%              | 4%           |

Among women identifying as Democrats, a strong majority are pro-choice, whereas Republican women predominantly identify as pro-life ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)).

## Trends Over Time

Data from various sources indicate fluctuations in pro-choice identification among women over the past decade:

- In 2018, Gallup reported 48% of women were pro-choice ([Gallup, 2018](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)).
- By 2019, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polls indicated a rise to 60% of women supporting abortion rights ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/447398-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll)).
- Gallup's 2021 data shows a slight decline to 52% pro-choice women ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx)).

These fluctuations may be influenced by political events, legislative changes, and public debates, such as the focus on overturning Roe v. Wade and state-level abortion restrictions.

## Contextual Factors Influencing Women's Pro-Choice Identification

### Impact of Legislative Changes

Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, noted that efforts in various states to severely restrict abortion rights have made the public more reactive, with some shifts toward pro-life identification among younger women and Democrats ([Carvalho, 2021](https://uspoliticnews.wordpress.com/2021/09/13/what-percentage-of-republicans-are-pro-choice/)).

### Support for Limitations on Abortion

While many women identify as pro-choice, a majority also support some restrictions on abortion. For example, 61% favor a combination of limitations, and 66% support laws requiring a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion ([Bowden, 2019](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/447398-more-than-half-of-americans-identify-as-pro-choice-poll); [Well+Good, 2020](https://www.wellandgood.com/statistics-abortion-2020-election/)).

### Religious Influence

Religiosity plays a significant role in shaping abortion attitudes. Women tend to be more religious than men, which correlates with slightly lower pro-choice identification. For instance, among Catholics, 23% believe abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, while many Protestant denominations support pro-choice views ([Health Research Funding, 2020](https://healthresearchfunding.org/20-remarkable-pro-choice-abortion-facts-statistics/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive data reviewed, it is evident that **a majority of women in the United States identify as pro-choice**, with estimates ranging from approximately **52% to 60%**, depending on the poll and year. Younger women, those with higher education levels, and Democratic women are significantly more likely to identify as pro-choice. Conversely, older women, less educated women, and Republican women tend to identify as pro-life.

The gender gap in abortion attitudes is modest but consistent, with women generally more supportive of abortion rights than men. However, religiosity and political affiliation remain strong determinants of women's views on abortion.

It is important to note that identifying as pro-choice does not necessarily imply support for unrestricted abortion access. Many women who identify as pro-choice also support certain limitations and regulations on abortion services.

Given the evolving political landscape, including recent legislative restrictions and Supreme Court decisions, women's attitudes toward abortion may continue to shift. However, current data supports the conclusion that **a majority of women in the U.S. support abortion rights to some degree**, reflecting a nuanced and complex public opinion landscape.
