# Maintaining Informal Project Management During Corporate Growth: A Comprehensive Report

Corporate growth presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for organizations, especially in the domain of project management. While formal project management frameworks provide structure and rigor, informal project management—characterized by flexibility, adaptive communication, and less bureaucratic overhead—can be equally valuable, particularly during periods of rapid expansion. This report explores how companies can maintain informal project management during growth phases, balancing the need for control with agility, and ensuring that project management maturity evolves appropriately without stifling innovation or responsiveness.

## Introduction

Project management is essential for coordinating resources, managing risks, and ensuring successful delivery of organizational objectives. However, as companies grow, the complexity of projects and organizational structures increases, often prompting a shift toward more formalized project management methods. Despite this, informal project management remains relevant and beneficial, particularly in fast-growing or medium-sized companies where flexibility and rapid decision-making are critical.

This report synthesizes insights from multiple authoritative sources, including industry analyses, case studies, and academic research, to provide a detailed understanding of how informal project management can be preserved and leveraged during corporate growth.

## Understanding Informal Project Management

Informal project management does not imply the absence of processes or controls; rather, it emphasizes flexibility, adaptive communication, and selective application of formal procedures. According to the Association for Project Management (APM), informal project management involves informal communications and discussions outside formal procedures, with flexibility about which formal processes to apply, depending on project needs ([Naybour, 2016](https://www.apm.org.uk/blog/formal-vs-informal-project-management/)).

This approach is particularly useful in dynamic environments where rigid adherence to formal processes can hinder progress or responsiveness. The project manager's role includes discerning when flexibility enhances project outcomes and when formal controls are necessary.

## Challenges of Corporate Growth on Project Management

Growth introduces complexities such as:

- Increased communication complexity
- Greater risk exposure
- Need for specialized skills and leadership
- Infrastructure scaling challenges
- Cultural shifts and talent gaps

Medium-sized companies (around 50 employees) often face a "crisis of growth," where the transition from multitasking generalists to specialists necessitates relearning project management practices ([Turner et al., 2009](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/medium-enterprises-innovation-growth-management-6454)). Resistance to formal project management can emerge, especially for internal projects, creating a tension between the need for structure and the desire for flexibility.

## Maintaining Informal Project Management During Growth

### 1. **Adopt a Scale-Appropriate Project Delivery System**

A key strategy is implementing a project delivery system that is "scale-appropriate." This means applying sufficient project management rigor relative to project size and complexity. The TenStep philosophy advocates for scalable project management processes—lightweight for small projects and more rigorous for large ones ([TenStep, n.d.](https://www.tensteppm.com/open/A1.1Scalability.html)).

| Project Size       | Project Management Approach                     | Characteristics                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Small Projects     | Lightweight, flexible, minimal formal processes | Less risk, informal communication           |
| Medium Projects    | Balanced approach with selective formalization | Moderate risk, some formal controls          |
| Large Projects     | Formal, structured, rigorous                    | High risk, comprehensive documentation       |

This approach allows companies to maintain informal project management in smaller or less complex projects while scaling up formality as needed.

### 2. **Leverage Informal Communication Channels**

As organizations grow, communication complexity increases exponentially. Informal project management thrives on effective, flexible communication. Organizations should:

- Use simple tools and processes to aid communication.
- Encourage project managers to act as facilitators, especially where communication gaps exist.
- Promote informal discussions and knowledge sharing outside formal meetings to maintain agility ([Metal Toad, n.d.](https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/scaling-projects-and-scaling-organization)).

This ensures that communication remains fluid and adaptive, avoiding the bottlenecks of overly formalized channels.

### 3. **Balance Formal and Informal Governance**

Maintaining informal project management does not mean abandoning governance. Instead, companies should balance enterprise-level governance with department-level flexibility. The PMI’s scalable enterprise project management framework recommends balancing enterprise and departmental governance to retain flexibility without sacrificing control ([Moreci & England, 2012](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/scalable-enterprise-project-management-framework-5979)).

This balance allows individual teams to operate informally within a broader framework that ensures alignment with organizational goals.

### 4. **Encourage Leadership Flexibility and Cultural Fit**

Leadership plays a crucial role in sustaining informal project management. Rapid growth often exposes talent gaps in leadership and technical skills. Companies should:

- Assess leadership capabilities honestly.
- Train new managers on cultural fit and interviewing techniques.
- Emphasize cultural alignment when outsourcing or hiring to fill gaps ([Insperity, n.d.](https://www.insperity.com/blog/keeping-company-culture-intact-rapid-growth/)).

Leaders who understand when to apply formal processes and when to allow flexibility enable teams to maintain informal project management effectively.

### 5. **Implement Flexible and Adaptive Planning**

Flexible planning is essential to handle the uncertainties inherent in growth. Project managers and PMOs must:

- Keep constant oversight of projects.
- Make fast, efficient decisions.
- Accurately allocate resources.
- Analyze contingencies and adjust plans dynamically ([ProSymmetry, 2018](https://www.prosymmetry.com/resources/what-is-flexible-project-management-and-why-is-it-important/)).

This flexibility prevents rigid plans from becoming blockers and allows informal project management to adapt to changing circumstances.

### 6. **Promote a Project Management Mindset Without Over-Formalization**

Not every employee needs to be a certified project manager. Instead, companies should:

- Implement basic project management processes for most employees.
- Reserve complex project management tasks for experienced leaders.
- Focus on coordination, documentation, and follow-through without overburdening teams ([Forbes Coaches Council, 2017](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/07/14/how-project-management-provides-stability-in-an-unstable-business-world/)).

This approach supports informal project management by embedding project discipline without excessive bureaucracy.

## Case Studies and Practical Examples

### Agile Methodologies as a Model for Informal Project Management

Agile project management exemplifies informal project management principles, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and iterative delivery. Large companies like Ericsson and Philips have successfully adopted Agile to maintain responsiveness during growth ([Makeway Global, n.d.](https://makewayglobal.com/project-management-case-studies/); [Growth Acceleration Partners, n.d.](https://www.growthaccelerationpartners.com/blog/real-life-examples-of-agile-methodology)).

Key Agile principles supporting informal project management include:

- Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery.
- Acceptance of late changes.
- Cross-functional teamwork.
- Face-to-face communication.
- Sustainable work pace.

These principles foster an informal yet disciplined project environment that scales with organizational growth.

## Risks and Mitigation in Informal Project Management

While informal project management offers flexibility, risks include:

- Potential loss of control and oversight.
- Communication breakdowns.
- Resistance from specialists to project management practices.
- Difficulty in scaling informal processes as complexity grows.

Mitigation strategies include:

- Clear definition of roles and responsibilities.
- Facilitating communication, especially at leadership levels.
- Quantifying and managing risks aligned with growth speed.
- Training and engaging the project management community continuously ([Metal Toad, n.d.](https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/scaling-projects-and-scaling-organization); [Moreci & England, 2012](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/scalable-enterprise-project-management-framework-5979)).

## Conclusion

Maintaining informal project management during corporate growth is both feasible and beneficial when approached strategically. Companies should adopt scalable project management processes, foster flexible communication, balance governance, and cultivate leadership that values cultural fit and adaptability. Agile methodologies provide a practical framework for informal project management, emphasizing collaboration and responsiveness.

By embedding a project management mindset without over-formalizing, organizations can navigate the complexities of growth while preserving the agility and innovation that informal project management supports. This balanced approach ensures that project management maturity evolves in tandem with organizational size and complexity, avoiding the pitfalls of bureaucracy while maintaining control and alignment.
