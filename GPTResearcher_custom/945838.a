# Maintaining Informal Project Management During Corporate Growth: A Detailed Analysis

## Introduction

As companies grow, the complexity of managing projects typically increases, often prompting a shift from informal to formal project management methodologies. However, maintaining informal project management practices during periods of corporate growth can be beneficial, especially in preserving flexibility, fostering innovation, and supporting multi-tasking teams. This report explores how companies can sustain informal project management during growth phases, drawing on empirical research and case studies, with a focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and organizational scaling dynamics.

## Understanding Informal Project Management and Corporate Growth

Informal project management is characterized by flexible, people-focused approaches, minimal documentation, and adaptive communication styles. It contrasts with formal project management, which emphasizes structured processes, rigorous documentation, and standardized controls ([Copper Team, 2018](https://www.copper.com/blog/difference-between-informal-and-formal-project-management)).

Corporate growth often entails increased project complexity, specialization, and the need for formal governance. However, research indicates that informal project management remains relevant and valuable, particularly in SMEs and early-stage companies where agility and rapid decision-making are critical ([Turner, Ledwith, & Kelly, 2010](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-management-smes-tailoring-practices-6067)).

## Challenges of Maintaining Informal Project Management During Growth

Growth introduces several challenges to informal project management:

- **Increased Specialization:** Transition from multi-tasking generalists to specialists requires coordination mechanisms.
- **Complex Communication:** Larger teams and cross-functional projects demand more structured communication.
- **Process Formalization Pressure:** Stakeholders and regulatory requirements may push for formal controls.
- **Resistance to Change:** Employees accustomed to informal methods may resist formalization, and vice versa.

Understanding these challenges is essential to designing strategies that preserve the benefits of informal management while accommodating growth.

## Strategies for Maintaining Informal Project Management During Growth

### 1. Tailor Project Management Practices to Company and Project Size

Turner et al. (2010) emphasize the importance of tailoring project management practices to the size of the company and project. SMEs, especially micro and small companies, benefit from "micro-lite" project management approaches that are simple, quick to learn, and people-focused. These approaches facilitate multi-tasking and engage team members in plan development, maintaining informality and flexibility.

| Company Size | Project Management Approach | Characteristics                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Micro (<20 employees) | Micro-lite                  | Simple, people-focused, flexible |
| Small (<50 employees) | Micro-lite                  | Similar to micro, supports multi-tasking |
| Medium (50-250 employees) | Lite                       | More formal, coordinates specialists |
| Large (>250 employees) | Formal                     | Structured, process-heavy         |

This stratification supports maintaining informal practices in smaller units even as the organization grows ([Turner et al., 2010](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-management-smes-tailoring-practices-6067)).

### 2. Preserve Multi-Tasking and Generalist Roles Where Possible

Research indicates that multi-tasking generalists are more compatible with informal project management, while specialists necessitate formal coordination ([Turner et al., 2010](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-management-smes-tailoring-practices-6067)). Companies can maintain informal management by:

- Structuring small project teams with generalists.
- Using informal communication and decision-making within these teams.
- Applying formal methods only when specialist coordination is unavoidable.

This approach was supported by a large company’s project manager who noted that small projects with multiple specialists struggled, whereas generalists working informally were more effective ([Turner et al., 2010](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-management-smes-tailoring-practices-6067)).

### 3. Implement Scalable Project Management Frameworks

Moreci and England (2012) propose implementing scalable project delivery systems that adjust rigor based on project size and complexity. This allows small projects to be managed informally with light processes, while larger projects adopt more formal controls.

Key elements include:

- **Project Profile Matrix (PPM):** Categorizes projects by size and complexity.
- **Stage/Gate Models:** Aligns project phases with financial governance.
- **Governance Hierarchy:** Balances enterprise standards with department-specific flexibility.
- **Continuous Training:** Engages the project community to adapt practices as needed.

This strategy preserves informal management in small projects during organizational growth ([Moreci & England, 2012](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/scalable-enterprise-project-management-framework-6101)).

### 4. Foster a Culture that Values Flexibility and People-Focused Management

Ghobadian and Gallear (1997) highlight that SMEs prefer simple planning, informal reporting, and people-focused procedures. Maintaining this culture during growth involves:

- Encouraging open communication and team engagement.
- Avoiding over-bureaucratization that stifles innovation.
- Supporting leadership that understands and promotes informal practices where appropriate.

Turner et al. (2010) found that people-focused methods like team building, though less used in large organizations, are valued in SMEs and should be preserved during growth.

### 5. Leverage Technology to Support Informal Communication and Coordination

Modern collaboration tools can facilitate informal project management by enabling:

- Real-time communication.
- Flexible documentation.
- Easy sharing of updates and feedback.

Using such tools helps maintain informal interactions even as teams grow and become distributed ([Paul Naybour, 2016](https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/50420/Formal-vs-informal-project-management)).

### 6. Gradual Formalization with Soft Implementation and Continuous Improvement

The NCR case study (Gibson, 2000) illustrates successful implementation of project management procedures by:

- Developing a skills-based, adaptable manual.
- Introducing procedures gradually with soft implementation periods.
- Using web-based tools for continuous updates.
- Linking procedure adoption to performance appraisals.
- Incorporating feedback and adapting procedures continuously.

This approach balances the need for some formalization during growth while preserving flexibility and informality where beneficial.

## Benefits of Maintaining Informal Project Management During Growth

- **Enhanced Agility:** Faster decision-making and adaptability.
- **Employee Engagement:** Greater team commitment through involvement in planning.
- **Innovation Support:** Less bureaucratic barriers encourage creativity.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Avoids unnecessary overhead from formal processes.
- **Smooth Transition:** Facilitates scaling by matching process rigor to project needs.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation

- **Lack of Control:** Informality may lead to inconsistent outcomes; mitigated by clear core practices like requirements management.
- **Resistance to Change:** Employees may struggle with evolving practices; mitigated by training and leadership support.
- **Scaling Limits:** Informal methods may not suit very large or complex projects; mitigated by adopting scalable frameworks.

## Conclusion

Maintaining informal project management during corporate growth is achievable and beneficial when practices are tailored to company and project size, multi-tasking is preserved, scalable frameworks are implemented, and a culture valuing flexibility is fostered. Leveraging technology and adopting gradual formalization with continuous improvement further support this balance. Companies that manage this effectively can enjoy the agility and innovation of informal methods while accommodating the complexities of growth.
