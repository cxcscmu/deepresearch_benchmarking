# Report on Future Problems Resulting from Scarce Resources

## Introduction

The scarcity of natural resources is an escalating global concern with profound implications for economic development, environmental sustainability, and social stability. As the global population grows and consumption patterns intensify, the demand for finite resources such as water, energy, minerals, and arable land is increasing at unprecedented rates. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the future problems that are likely to arise from resource scarcity, drawing on recent scientific assessments, integrated scenario analyses, and policy evaluations. The report also offers an informed perspective on the interconnected challenges and potential consequences of resource depletion, emphasizing the urgency of coordinated global action.

## Overview of Resource Scarcity Trends

Since the 1970s, the global population has doubled, and the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has quadrupled, driving a more than threefold increase in natural resource use ([UNEP IRP, 2019](https://www.resourcepanel.org/reports/global-resources-outlook)). The consumption of food, energy, and water is projected to rise significantly by 2050 if current trends persist, with food and energy demand increasing by approximately 60% and water demand by 17% globally ([Van Vuuren et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0418-8)). This surge in demand places immense pressure on ecosystems and planetary boundaries, threatening biodiversity, climate stability, and human well-being.

## Key Future Problems Resulting from Scarce Resources

### 1. Environmental Degradation and Biodiversity Loss

The expansion of agricultural land to meet food demand is a major driver of habitat destruction and biodiversity loss. Even with projected yield improvements, agricultural land use is expected to increase by over 10% by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario ([Van Vuuren et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0418-8)). This expansion leads to deforestation, soil degradation, and disruption of ecosystems, undermining the resilience of natural systems that provide critical services such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration.

### 2. Climate Change Amplification

Resource scarcity is intricately linked with climate change. The combustion of fossil fuels for energy and land-use changes associated with agriculture contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Without mitigation, emissions are projected to rise alongside resource consumption, exacerbating global warming beyond the 2°C threshold considered critical for avoiding severe climate impacts ([UNEP IRP, 2019](https://www.resourcepanel.org/reports/global-resources-outlook)). Climate change, in turn, affects resource availability by altering precipitation patterns, reducing agricultural productivity, and increasing water stress ([Stoll, 2016](http://water.worldbank.org/topics/water-resources-management/water-and-climate-change)).

### 3. Food and Water Insecurity

The interplay between resource scarcity and climate change poses a direct threat to food and water security. Demand for food is expected to increase by 35% by 2030, driven by population growth and dietary shifts toward resource-intensive foods such as meat and dairy ([PwC Megatrends, 2016](https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/sustainability-climate-change/paris-2015.html)). However, climate change could reduce agricultural yields by up to one-third in vulnerable regions like Africa, while water scarcity is projected to affect up to 2.8 billion people by 2025 ([World Bank, 2016](http://water.worldbank.org/topics/water-resources-management/water-and-climate-change)).

### 4. Economic and Social Inequalities

Resource scarcity exacerbates inequalities both within and between countries. Wealthier populations tend to consume disproportionately more resources, while poorer communities face greater vulnerability to shortages. The uneven distribution of resource access can lead to social unrest, migration pressures, and conflicts over resource control ([Chatham House, 2012](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2012/12/resources-futures)). For example, competition for water in politically unstable regions such as the Middle East could intensify existing conflicts ([Stoll, 2016](http://water.worldbank.org/topics/water-resources-management/water-and-climate-change)).

### 5. Political Instability and Resource Conflicts

As resources become scarcer, geopolitical tensions are likely to rise. Countries may resort to hoarding, export restrictions, or even militarized responses to secure critical resources such as food, water, and minerals ([Chatham House, 2012](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2012/12/resources-futures)). The risk of resource-driven conflicts increases in regions with weak governance and high dependence on natural resources, threatening global peace and security.

### 6. Economic Disruptions and Market Volatility

Resource scarcity can lead to supply disruptions and volatile commodity prices, impacting global markets and economic stability. Price shocks in food, energy, and metals can trigger inflation, reduce investment, and slow economic growth, disproportionately affecting developing economies ([Chatham House, 2012](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2012/12/resources-futures)). The interconnectedness of resource markets means that shocks in one sector can cascade across others, amplifying economic risks.

### 7. Increased Waste and Inefficiency

Current resource use is characterized by significant inefficiencies and waste. Approximately one-third of global food production is lost or wasted, representing a substantial opportunity to reduce resource demand without compromising food security ([Van Vuuren et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0418-8)). Energy systems also experience considerable losses, especially in electricity generation and end-use. Addressing these inefficiencies is critical to alleviating resource pressures.

## Potential Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies

Integrated scenario analyses suggest that coordinated actions can mitigate many of the adverse impacts of resource scarcity:

- **Dietary Shifts:** Moving towards less meat-intensive diets can reduce land use by 30% and lower greenhouse gas emissions substantially ([Van Vuuren et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0418-8)).

- **Yield Improvements:** Closing yield gaps and enhancing feed efficiency can reduce agricultural land demand and emissions ([Van Vuuren et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0418-8)).

- **Reducing Food Waste:** Halving avoidable food waste could decrease food production needs by 8%, land use by 6%, and water use by 5% ([Van Vuuren et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0418-8)).

- **Climate Mitigation Policies:** Transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and implementing carbon pricing are essential to limit warming and reduce resource-related emissions.

- **Global Cooperation:** Establishing international coalitions to manage resource markets and improve transparency can reduce price volatility and conflict risks ([Chatham House, 2012](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2012/12/resources-futures)).

## Opinion and Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive evidence presented, it is clear that resource scarcity will pose multifaceted challenges in the coming decades, affecting environmental integrity, economic stability, and social cohesion. The interlinked nature of food, water, energy, and land systems requires integrated policy approaches that address efficiency, equity, and sustainability simultaneously.

Failure to act decisively will likely result in intensified environmental degradation, heightened geopolitical tensions, and exacerbated inequalities, undermining global development goals. However, the scientific consensus and scenario analyses provide a hopeful outlook that through coordinated action—embracing technological innovation, behavioral change, and international cooperation—these challenges can be managed.

The urgency of implementing these strategies cannot be overstated, especially given the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals timeline. Businesses, governments, and civil society must align efforts to transition towards sustainable resource use, thereby securing prosperity within planetary boundaries.
