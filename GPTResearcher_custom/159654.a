# Why Are People Taking Ivermectin for COVID-19? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug widely used in both humans and animals, gained unexpected attention during the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential treatment or preventive agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its established use for parasitic infections, ivermectin's role in COVID-19 has been highly controversial, marked by misinformation, political polarization, and conflicting scientific evidence. This report aims to provide a detailed, evidence-based analysis of why people have taken ivermectin for COVID-19, exploring the scientific, social, political, and economic factors that contributed to its widespread, albeit unsupported, use.

## Background on Ivermectin

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating parasitic worms, head lice, and rosacea in humans, and widely used in veterinary medicine for parasite control in animals ([Molyneux & Ward, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2015.10.008)). It functions by interfering with nerve and muscle functions of parasites. The drug was discovered in the 1970s and has been credited with significant public health impacts, including the eradication of river blindness in some regions.

## Emergence of Ivermectin as a COVID-19 Treatment Candidate

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory studies indicated that ivermectin might inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. For instance, Caly et al. (2020) demonstrated that ivermectin could reduce viral RNA in cell cultures by 5,000-fold after 48 hours ([Caly et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104787)). This sparked interest in repurposing ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment.

However, the effective concentrations observed in vitro required doses much higher than those approved or safely achievable in humans, raising concerns about toxicity ([Popp et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd015017.pub2)). The antiviral mechanism is thought to involve inhibition of nuclear transport by importin α/β1, a host cellular process, which is not virus-specific and may cause systemic toxicity at high doses ([Yang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104760)).

## Scientific Evidence and Clinical Trials

Numerous clinical trials and systematic reviews have been conducted to evaluate ivermectin's efficacy against COVID-19. The majority of high-quality studies and meta-analyses have found no significant benefit in treating or preventing COVID-19 with ivermectin. For example:

| Study/Review | Findings | Evidence Quality |
|--------------|----------|------------------|
| Popp et al. (2021) Cochrane Review | No evidence supporting ivermectin for COVID-19 prevention or treatment | High-quality systematic review |
| Reis et al. (2022) NEJM RCT | No significant effect on hospitalization or symptom resolution | Randomized controlled trial |
| NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines | Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against ivermectin | Expert panel consensus |

Several studies initially suggesting benefit were later retracted due to data falsification or ethical concerns ([Davey, 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/15/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns)). This has contributed to confusion and mistrust among the public.

## Why Are People Taking Ivermectin for COVID-19?

Despite the lack of robust evidence and warnings from health authorities, many individuals have taken ivermectin for COVID-19. The reasons are multifaceted:

### 1. Early Laboratory Findings and Hope for a "Miracle Cure"

The initial in vitro studies generated hope that ivermectin could be a cheap, widely available treatment. This hope was amplified by anecdotal reports and preprints suggesting efficacy, even though these were methodologically flawed or unverified ([Garegnani et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2021-111678)).

### 2. Misinformation and Social Media Advocacy

Social media platforms played a significant role in spreading misinformation about ivermectin. Influencers, podcasters (e.g., Joe Rogan), and anti-vaccine groups promoted ivermectin as a "miracle drug" or alternative to vaccines ([Huang, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/19/1038536150/how-ivermectin-became-the-new-focus-of-the-anti-vaccine-movement)). The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), led by Dr. Pierre Kory, aggressively advocated for ivermectin despite lack of conclusive evidence ([Wikipedia contributors, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic)).

### 3. Political Polarization and Distrust in Authorities

In the United States and elsewhere, ivermectin use became politicized. Republican-leaning areas showed higher prescription rates, correlating with skepticism toward vaccines and official health guidance ([Barnett et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.0200)). Distrust in government and pharmaceutical companies fueled beliefs that ivermectin was being suppressed for profit motives.

### 4. Accessibility and Off-Label Use

Some countries and local governments authorized or tolerated off-label ivermectin use for COVID-19, especially where vaccine access was limited ([Mega, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-02958-2)). This official endorsement, even if limited, legitimized its use in the eyes of the public.

### 5. Desperation and Lack of Alternatives

In regions with overwhelmed healthcare systems and limited treatment options, people turned to ivermectin as a last resort. The drug's availability and low cost made it an attractive option despite uncertain efficacy ([Molento, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100250)).

### 6. Use of Veterinary Preparations

Due to difficulties obtaining human formulations, some individuals resorted to veterinary ivermectin (e.g., horse dewormer), leading to poisonings and shortages for animal use. The FDA issued warnings such as "You are not a horse" to discourage this practice ([FDA, 2021](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1428878116951823363)).

### 7. Psychological and Social Factors

Belief in ivermectin often aligns with broader conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine sentiments. The desire for control, fear of COVID-19, and community reinforcement within social media echo chambers perpetuate its use ([Kolin et al., 2021](https://www.kpbs.org/news/2021/sep/19/how-ivermectin-became-new-focus-anti-vaccine-move/)).

## Risks and Consequences of Ivermectin Use for COVID-19

Ivermectin is generally safe at approved doses for parasitic infections but can cause serious side effects when misused or overdosed, including:

- Neurological symptoms: seizures, confusion, coma
- Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Cardiovascular effects: low blood pressure
- Toxicity from veterinary formulations due to higher potency and contaminants ([Miller, 2021](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ivermectin-horse-dewormer-covid-19)).

Increased ivermectin poisoning cases prompted CDC health alerts and FDA warnings ([CDC, 2021](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00449.asp)).

Moreover, reliance on ivermectin may delay or replace proven interventions such as vaccination and approved therapeutics, potentially leading to worse outcomes.

## Conclusion

People have taken ivermectin for COVID-19 due to a complex interplay of early scientific findings, misinformation, political and social factors, accessibility, and psychological motivations. While initial laboratory studies suggested antiviral potential, clinical evidence has consistently failed to demonstrate meaningful efficacy at safe doses. The drug's promotion by influential figures and groups, coupled with distrust in official guidance, has fueled its widespread off-label use, including dangerous self-medication with veterinary formulations.

The ivermectin phenomenon underscores the challenges of managing public health communication during a crisis, especially in the context of social media and political polarization. It also highlights the importance of rigorous scientific evaluation and clear, transparent communication to prevent harm from unproven treatments.

Vaccination remains the most effective and evidence-based method to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes. Health authorities worldwide continue to advise against the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 outside of clinical trials.
