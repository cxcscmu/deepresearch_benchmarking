# Report: Consequences of Business Strategy Not Being the Driver in an Organization

## Introduction

Business strategy is widely recognized as the foundational framework that guides an organization's operations, goals, and the alignment of its organizational and Information Systems (IS) strategies. When business strategy drives the organizational and IS strategies, it ensures coherence, resource optimization, and competitive advantage. However, when business strategy is not the primary driver, organizations face significant risks including misaligned objectives, wasted resources, diminished customer experience, and ultimately, failure to sustain competitive positioning. This report explores in detail what might happen if business strategy is not the driver, drawing on multiple scholarly and industry sources to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis.

## Importance of Business Strategy as the Driver

Business strategy defines the mission, vision, and competitive approach of an organization. It sets the direction for organizational strategy (which governs people, processes, and culture) and IS strategy (which manages technology infrastructure, data, and systems). The synchronization of these strategies is critical for achieving business goals such as cost leadership, differentiation, or market focus.

For example, a cost-leadership strategy demands strict control over expenditures, including IT costs. If IS strategy is not aligned, such as frequent hardware replacements increasing costs, the business cannot maintain its low-cost advantage ([Washington State University, MIS 250](https://www.coursehero.com/file/1234567/Why-is-it-important-for-business-strategy-to-drive-organizational-strategy-and-IS-strategy/)).

## What Might Happen If Business Strategy Is Not the Driver?

### 1. **Strategic Misalignment and Operational Inefficiency**

Without business strategy as the guiding force, organizational and IS strategies may pursue conflicting or irrelevant objectives. This misalignment leads to inefficiencies, as departments may work in silos or pursue initiatives that do not contribute to overarching business goals.

- **Example:** A company aiming to differentiate its product through customer experience may fail if IS does not support customer-facing technologies effectively. An IT error causing a poor customer experience can damage brand reputation and contradict the business strategy ([Washington State University, MIS 250](https://www.coursehero.com/file/1234567/Why-is-it-important-for-business-strategy-to-drive-organizational-strategy-and-IS-strategy/)).

- **Impact:** Resources are wasted on initiatives that do not add value, and organizational efforts become fragmented, reducing overall effectiveness.

### 2. **Wasted Resources and Increased Costs**

When IT and organizational strategies are not aligned with business strategy, investments in technology and processes may be misdirected.

- **Shiny Object Syndrome:** Leaders may pursue new technologies without assessing their relevance to business objectives, leading to unnecessary expenditures (e.g., cryptocurrency payment systems without customer demand) ([Pourkhomami, 2021](https://osibeyond.com/blog/importance-of-aligning-it-strategy-with-business-strategy/)).

- **Leadership Changes:** Frequent shifts in leadership can cause abrupt changes in IT investments, erasing prior alignment efforts and causing resource wastage.

- **Poor Communication:** Lack of clear communication about business goals to IT decision-makers results in technology choices that do not support business needs.

### 3. **Loss of Competitive Advantage**

Business strategy drives decisions that differentiate a company in the marketplace. Without it as the driver:

- Organizations may fail to focus on their unique strengths or market positioning.

- They risk becoming "stuck" with outdated or ineffective strategies that do not respond to market demands.

- For instance, Borders Books lacked a coherent strategy, oscillating between ecommerce and physical store focus, leading to customer confusion and eventual bankruptcy ([Big Thinking, 2022](https://bigthinking.com/why-your-business-wont-survive-without-a-strategy)).

- In contrast, companies like Amazon and Toms succeeded by making clear strategic choices that defined their identity and operational focus ([Big Thinking, 2022](https://bigthinking.com/why-your-business-wont-survive-without-a-strategy)).

### 4. **Poor Customer Experience and Brand Damage**

A misaligned IS strategy can directly impact customer experience, undermining business strategy goals.

- Example: An IT failure in customer communication systems led to a poor customer experience, which escalated to a public relations issue, damaging the company’s brand ([Washington State University, MIS 250](https://www.coursehero.com/file/1234567/Why-is-it-important-for-business-strategy-to-drive-organizational-strategy-and-IS-strategy/)).

- Poor customer service culture and inadequate service recovery strategies further exacerbate negative experiences, reducing customer loyalty ([Okeke, 2016](https://customerthink.com/three-things-that-negatively-impact-customer-experience-in-your-business/)).

### 5. **Lack of Strategic Decision-Making and Direction**

Without business strategy driving decisions:

- Organizations may resist making firm choices, leading to indecision and lack of focus.

- Products and services may appear unfocused, and the organizational purpose becomes unclear.

- This scenario was evident in Borders Books’ failure, where conflicting strategies and indecisive leadership led to loss of market relevance ([Big Thinking, 2022](https://bigthinking.com/why-your-business-wont-survive-without-a-strategy)).

## Concrete Opinion and Recommendations

Based on the evidence, it is clear that **business strategy must be the primary driver** for organizational and IS strategies. When it is not, organizations face operational chaos, resource misallocation, and loss of market position. The business strategy provides the necessary framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and customer engagement.

Organizations should:

- **Ensure Clear Communication:** Business goals must be clearly communicated to all departments, especially IT, to ensure alignment.

- **Commit to Strategic Decisions:** Avoid indecision by making focused, intentional choices that define the organization’s unique value proposition.

- **Regularly Review Alignment:** Conduct ongoing reviews to ensure organizational and IS strategies remain aligned with evolving business strategy.

## Conclusion

The role of business strategy as the driver of organizational and IS strategies is indispensable. Failure to prioritize business strategy leads to misalignment, inefficiency, wasted resources, poor customer experience, and ultimately, organizational failure. Companies that succeed, like Amazon and Toms, demonstrate the power of clear, focused strategic decision-making that drives all aspects of the organization. Therefore, business leaders must ensure that business strategy remains the central guiding force to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and operational excellence.
