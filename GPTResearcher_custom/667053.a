# The Consequences of Business Strategy Not Being the Driver in Organizational and IS Strategy

In contemporary organizational management, the business strategy is widely recognized as the foundational driver that shapes both organizational and Information Systems (IS) strategies. This alignment ensures that the entire enterprise operates cohesively towards common goals and objectives. However, when the business strategy fails to act as the primary driver, the repercussions can be profound, affecting operational efficiency, financial performance, organizational culture, and ultimately, the survival of the business. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of what might happen if business strategy is not the driver, supported by insights from multiple trusted sources.

## Importance of Business Strategy as the Driver

Business strategy defines the overarching goals, competitive positioning, and value propositions of an organization. It provides the backbone for organizational operations and the guidelines for IS strategy, including management of hardware, software, data, and other resources. The business strategy framework—whether cost leadership, differentiation, or focus—sets the parameters within which organizational and IS strategies must operate to ensure alignment and effectiveness ([Course Hero, 2022](https://www.coursehero.com/file/14608991/W2/)).

When business strategy drives organizational and IS strategies, leaders at all levels can deploy initiatives that support the company’s mission and objectives. This alignment facilitates coherent decision-making, resource allocation, and performance measurement, which are critical for achieving competitive advantage and sustainable growth ([Course Hero, 2022](https://www.coursehero.com/file/106847722/Why-is-it-important-for-business-strategy-to-drive-organizational-strategy-and-IS-strategydocx/)).

## Consequences of Business Strategy Not Being the Driver

### 1. Misalignment of Organizational and IS Strategies

When business strategy is not the driver, organizational and IS strategies may develop in silos or pursue conflicting objectives. For example, if a company adopts a cost-leadership business strategy but the IS strategy involves frequent replacement of hardware leading to increased expenditures, the company cannot maintain its low-cost product offering. Similarly, if organizational strategy fails to gather and analyze customer feedback metrics in support of differentiation efforts, the business strategy risks failure due to lack of market responsiveness ([Course Hero, 2022](https://www.coursehero.com/file/14608991/W2/)).

This misalignment can lead to inefficiencies, wasted resources, and missed opportunities, as the IS and organizational units may pursue initiatives that do not contribute to the overall business goals.

### 2. Operational Chaos and Reduced Effectiveness

Strategic misalignment introduces chaos into the business ecosystem, as internal and external functions become unsynchronized. According to Chaos Theory principles, small deviations in initial conditions can lead to widely diverging outcomes. When operational initiatives are not in sync with strategic goals, the organization experiences unpredictable and chaotic reactions, impairing decision-making and execution ([LinkedIn, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strategy-misalignment-symptoms-dangers-treatment-hatim-abukhames)).

This chaos manifests as delays in product or service rollouts, failed initiatives, and a general lack of coherence in operations, which can erode competitive positioning and market share.

### 3. Financial Performance Decline

The misalignment between business strategy and other organizational strategies often results in missed financial projections and decreased profitability. When strategic initiatives do not align with business goals, resources may be allocated inefficiently, and revenue-generating opportunities may be lost. For instance, delayed product launches due to unsuccessful operational initiatives directly impact revenue streams and profitability ([LinkedIn, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strategy-misalignment-symptoms-dangers-treatment-hatim-abukhames)).

Moreover, redundant initiatives and lack of governance exacerbate financial losses by duplicating efforts and increasing operational costs.

### 4. Erosion of Organizational Culture and Employee Morale

A strong alignment between culture and strategy creates a clear mission and fosters employee loyalty. When business strategy is not the driver, this alignment breaks down, leading to a loss of mission clarity and increased employee confusion. Mixed messages from leadership—such as preaching teamwork but rewarding individual performance—can result in disoriented employees who feel disconnected from organizational goals ([AMANET, n.d.](https://www.amanet.org/articles/misalignment-culture-strategy/)).

This cultural erosion contributes to higher turnover rates, reduced productivity, and difficulty attracting and retaining talent.

### 5. Strategic Drift and Loss of Competitive Advantage

Without a clear business strategy driving organizational efforts, companies risk strategic drift—where the organization’s actions gradually diverge from its intended strategic direction. This drift can cause the company to lose focus, confuse customers, and diminish its brand reputation. The case of Borders Books & Music illustrates this risk, where conflicting and frequently changing strategies led to disempowered managers, confused employees, and ultimately, bankruptcy ([Taragentile, n.d.](http://taragentile.com/strategic-decision/)).

Strategic drift undermines long-term sustainability and can cause irreversible damage to the company’s market position.

### 6. Poor Decision-Making and Lack of Accountability

When business strategy is not the driver, decision-making authority may become centralized or fragmented inappropriately. For example, if top executives retain all decision-making power without empowering middle managers and technical experts, the organization loses agility and responsiveness. Conversely, without clear strategic guidance, operational managers may pursue initiatives that do not align with business goals, leading to inefficiencies and accountability gaps ([LSA Global, n.d.](https://lsaglobal.com/how-to-overcome-the-top-strategy-execution-risks/)).

This lack of distributed leadership and governance hampers effective strategy execution.

### 7. Increased Risk Exposure and Failure to Mitigate Threats

Business strategy often incorporates risk management by identifying threats and allocating resources to mitigate them. If business strategy is not driving organizational actions, the company may fail to address critical risks such as security threats, regulatory changes, or market disruptions. This failure increases vulnerability and can lead to operational failures or reputational damage ([The ASP Team, n.d.](https://www.theaspteam.com/blog/understanding-strategic-business-drivers)).

## Concrete Examples of Misalignment

- **Cost-Leadership vs. IS Expenditure:** A company aiming for cost leadership but facing IS strategies that require frequent hardware replacements increases costs, undermining the low-cost advantage ([Course Hero, 2022](https://www.coursehero.com/file/14608991/W2/)).

- **Customer Experience Failure:** A technology-oriented company focused on unique customer experience suffered when an IT error caused a customer’s email platform to become unresponsive, negatively impacting the business strategy ([Course Hero, 2022](https://www.coursehero.com/file/14608991/W2/)).

- **Borders Books & Music:** Frequent shifts in strategic direction without firm decisions led to confused employees, disempowered managers, and eventual bankruptcy ([Taragentile, n.d.](http://taragentile.com/strategic-decision/)).

## Recommendations for Ensuring Business Strategy Drives Organizational and IS Strategies

1. **Develop a Clear, Actionable Business Strategy:** Ensure the strategy involves clear choices about what the firm will and will not do, avoiding vague goals ([Harvard Business Review, 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies)).

2. **Align Organizational and IS Strategies:** Regularly review and adjust organizational and IS strategies to support the business strategy, including cost structures and customer metrics ([Course Hero, 2022](https://www.coursehero.com/file/14608991/W2/)).

3. **Implement Bi-Directional Planning:** Facilitate communication and planning between strategic leadership and operational managers to ensure alignment and execution ([LinkedIn, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strategy-misalignment-symptoms-dangers-treatment-hatim-abukhames)).

4. **Establish Governance and Accountability:** Create governance frameworks to monitor alignment, resource allocation, and initiative redundancy ([LinkedIn, 2015](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strategy-misalignment-symptoms-dangers-treatment-hatim-abukhames)).

5. **Foster a Culture Aligned with Strategy:** Communicate strategy effectively to all employees and align incentives with strategic goals to maintain morale and loyalty ([AMANET, n.d.](https://www.amanet.org/articles/misalignment-culture-strategy/)).

6. **Empower Middle Management:** Distribute decision-making authority to those closest to execution to improve agility and responsiveness ([LSA Global, n.d.](https://lsaglobal.com/how-to-overcome-the-top-strategy-execution-risks/)).

## Conclusion

If business strategy is not the driver of organizational and IS strategies, the organization risks severe misalignment that can cascade into operational chaos, financial losses, cultural erosion, and strategic drift. The lack of a clear, guiding business strategy undermines decision-making, reduces competitive advantage, and increases vulnerability to risks. Concrete examples such as the failure of Borders Books & Music and IT missteps in technology companies illustrate the tangible consequences of this misalignment.

To mitigate these risks, organizations must ensure that business strategy is clearly defined, communicated, and integrated into all levels of planning and execution. Governance, culture alignment, and distributed leadership are critical enablers of this integration. Ultimately, the business strategy must remain the backbone and primary driver to secure organizational coherence, operational efficiency, and long-term success.
