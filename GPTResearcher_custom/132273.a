# The Impact of Pollution on the East China Sea: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The East China Sea (ECS), a marginal sea of the western North Pacific Ocean, is a vital marine ecosystem adjacent to the eastern coast of China. It supports significant economic activities, including fisheries, shipping, and coastal industries, and is influenced by major river systems such as the Yangtze River. However, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural intensification in the surrounding regions have led to increased pollution inputs, severely affecting the ECS’s environmental quality and ecosystem health. This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of how pollution affects the East China Sea, focusing on nutrient enrichment, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and other ecological consequences, supported by quantitative data and recent scientific findings.

## Sources and Types of Pollution Affecting the East China Sea

### Nutrient Inputs from Major Rivers

The primary source of pollution in the ECS is land-sourced nutrients, predominantly from the Yangtze River, which discharges approximately 8.3 × 10^11 m³ of freshwater annually into the sea. The river contributes about 66% of the nitrogen load (1.4–2.0 Tg/year) and 84% of the phosphorus load (0.12–0.24 Tg/year) entering China's coastal seas ([Tong et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.011)). Nutrient fluxes have undergone significant changes over the past decades, with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations increasing notably, especially from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. For example, DIN concentrations in the Yangtze River increased rapidly during this period and have since fluctuated at high levels ([Wang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.09.044)).

### Industrial and Agricultural Pollution

Industrial activities along the coast, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta, contribute substantial pollutant loads, including heavy metals, hazardous wastes, and chemical effluents. Industrial agglomerations in the Bohai Rim, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta regions discharge pollutants that threaten adjacent coastal wetlands and marine ecosystems ([Zhao et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128880)). Agricultural non-point source pollution, mainly from fertilizer runoff, is also a significant contributor to nutrient enrichment in the ECS ([Yao et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143260)).

### Other Pollution Sources

Additional pollution sources include untreated sewage discharge, shipping accidents, and land reclamation activities that alter coastal habitats and increase pollutant loads ([Inter Press Service, 2011](https://www.globalissues.org/news/2011/06/20/10157)).

## Ecological and Environmental Effects of Pollution in the East China Sea

### Coastal Eutrophication and Nutrient Imbalance

The increased nutrient inputs have led to severe coastal eutrophication in the ECS, characterized by elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in coastal waters. This eutrophication has caused significant changes in nutrient ratios, with the nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N/P) ratio increasing dramatically (e.g., from ~3 in the 1980s to over 25 in the 21st century in the Bohai Sea), and the silicate-to-nitrogen (Si/N) ratio decreasing, indicating nutrient imbalance that favors harmful algal species ([Wang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.09.044)).

### Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)

There has been a marked increase in the frequency and spatial extent of harmful algal blooms, including red tides dominated by dinoflagellates, brown tides, and green tides in the ECS and adjacent waters. The annual frequency of red tides increased from less than 10 events in the 1980s to several tens in the 1990s, peaking in the mid-2000s, before showing a recent decline in frequency but still affecting large areas ([Wang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.09.044)). HABs threaten fisheries, biodiversity, and human health.

### Oxygen Depletion and Hypoxia

Eutrophication-driven oxygen depletion in bottom waters has become a critical issue in the ECS. Hypoxic zones (DO < 2 mg/L) have been observed repeatedly in summer months, with areas reaching over 11,000 km² in 2013, comparable to other major hypoxic zones worldwide. Oxygen depletion results from organic matter decomposition fueled by nutrient enrichment, leading to habitat loss for benthic fauna and fishery declines ([Zhu et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.07.029)).

### Nutrient Regeneration and Feedbacks

Hypoxia contributes to nutrient regeneration in bottom waters, releasing bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus back into the water column, which can further fuel primary production and exacerbate eutrophication. Estimates suggest that nutrient regeneration during hypoxic events accounts for 3–5% of annual nitrogen and 5–23% of annual phosphorus loads from the Yangtze River, indicating a significant internal nutrient cycling component ([Zhu et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.07.029)).

### Changes in Phytoplankton and Zoobenthos Communities

Phytoplankton biomass has increased, with a shift from diatom dominance to dinoflagellates, which are often associated with HABs. Zoobenthos diversity and biomass have declined, with pollution-tolerant species replacing sensitive ones, indicating ecosystem degradation ([Wang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.09.044)).

### Other Ecological Impacts

Increased jellyfish blooms, loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, and bottom water acidification linked to hypoxia have been reported, further threatening ecosystem services and fisheries ([Wang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.09.044)).

## Water Quality and Trophic Status in the East China Sea Region

Studies in adjacent coastal bays such as Daya Bay indicate that despite pollution pressures, some areas maintain relatively high water quality and trophic status classified as “high” (low eutrophication), although localized pollution hotspots exist ([Wu et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.07.042)). Multivariate statistical analyses reveal that seasonal variations, influenced by monsoons and river discharge, strongly affect water quality parameters including nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations.

## Influence of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) on Phytoplankton Dynamics

Satellite data analyses show that SST exhibits seasonal cycles in the ECS, with warmer temperatures in summer and cooler in winter. SST influences phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations, with positive correlations in coastal regions influenced by river discharge and negative correlations offshore. The highest chlorophyll-a concentrations occur in spring (April-May), coinciding with moderate SST (~19°C), which may favor phytoplankton blooms and potentially HABs ([Ji et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.01.020)).

## Pollution Control Measures and Trends

China has implemented various control measures since the 2010s, including limiting industrial wastewater discharge, expanding sewage treatment infrastructure, and promoting green development concepts. These measures have curbed the worsening trend of nutrient inputs and eutrophication in recent years, although steady improvements are gradual due to ecosystem response lags and accumulated nutrient loads ([Wang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.09.044)).

## Conclusion

Pollution, primarily from land-based nutrient inputs via the Yangtze River and coastal industrial and agricultural activities, has profoundly impacted the East China Sea ecosystem. The increased nutrient loads have driven severe coastal eutrophication, leading to frequent harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and shifts in biological communities. These changes threaten biodiversity, fisheries, and the overall health of the marine environment. While recent control measures have begun to mitigate these impacts, the legacy of nutrient accumulation and ecosystem response lags mean that recovery will be gradual. Continued monitoring, integrated pollution management, and ecosystem-based approaches are essential to protect and restore the East China Sea’s environmental quality.
