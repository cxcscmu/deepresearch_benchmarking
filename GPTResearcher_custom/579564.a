# Why Confederate Statues Should Be Removed: A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

The presence of Confederate statues and monuments in public spaces across the United States has become a focal point of intense debate, particularly following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the ensuing nationwide protests against systemic racism and police violence. These statues, often erected during periods of racial tension such as the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights Movement, are widely viewed as symbols of white supremacy, racial oppression, and treason against the United States. This report presents a detailed, evidence-based analysis of why Confederate statues should be removed from public spaces, drawing on historical context, legal and moral considerations, and contemporary social implications.

## Historical Context of Confederate Statues

### Origins and Purpose

Confederate monuments were not erected immediately after the Civil War but predominantly between 1890 and 1915, coinciding with the rise of Jim Crow laws, disenfranchisement of Black voters, and a surge in racial violence, including lynchings ([Campbell, 2020](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/07/16/controversies-confederate-monuments-memorials/)). These monuments served as physical manifestations of the "Lost Cause" ideology, a revisionist narrative that sought to recast the Confederacy's cause as noble and heroic, minimizing or denying the central role of slavery.

The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), founded in 1894, played a pivotal role in commissioning and placing these statues, often in prominent public locations such as government buildings and courthouses. Their efforts extended beyond monuments to include textbooks promoting a pro-Confederate version of history ([Wiley, n.d.](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/ideas/confederate-statues.html)).

### Symbolism and Messaging

The timing and placement of these monuments were deliberate, intended to intimidate Black Americans and reinforce white supremacy. For example, many dedication ceremonies were "whites only," and the monuments often coincided with anniversaries of Confederate victories or civil rights gains by Black Americans ([Diaz-Griffith, 2020](https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/the-anti-racist-preservationists-guide-to-confederate-monuments)).

## Arguments for Removal of Confederate Statues

### 1. Symbols of Racism and White Supremacy

Confederate statues glorify individuals and a cause fundamentally rooted in the defense of slavery and white supremacy. The Confederacy explicitly fought to preserve the institution of slavery, as articulated by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, who stated that the Confederacy’s cornerstone rested on the belief in white racial superiority ([Carlton, 2021](https://weirdhistory.net/arguments-for-and-against-removing-confederate-statues/)).

The continued presence of these statues in public spaces sends a message to Black communities that their oppression is honored and normalized. This perpetuates systemic racism and social discord, undermining efforts toward racial justice and equality ([Gordon-Reed, 2020](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/legal-scholar-and-historian-puts-the-push-to-remove-confederate-statues-in-context/)).

### 2. Historical Revisionism and Intimidation

The monuments were erected during periods of racial tension to rewrite history and intimidate Black citizens. They were not neutral commemorations but tools to uphold segregation and disenfranchisement ([Campbell, 2020](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/07/16/controversies-confederate-monuments-memorials/)).

### 3. Honoring Traitors and Opponents of the United States

Confederate leaders took up arms against the United States, committing treason. Honoring them in public spaces dishonors the thousands of Black and white soldiers who fought and died to preserve the Union and end slavery ([Gordon-Reed, 2020](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/legal-scholar-and-historian-puts-the-push-to-remove-confederate-statues-in-context/)).

### 4. The Statues Do Not Erase History

Removing statues does not equate to erasing history. History will continue to be taught in schools and preserved in museums. The real threats to historical knowledge are defunding humanities and cutting history education ([Gordon-Reed, 2020](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/legal-scholar-and-historian-puts-the-push-to-remove-confederate-statues-in-context/)).

### 5. Public Spaces Should Reflect Inclusive Values

Public monuments represent the values a society chooses to honor. Confederate statues celebrate a legacy of racism and oppression, which is incompatible with contemporary values of equality and justice. Communities should instead celebrate figures who contributed positively to American history, including Black Americans and civil rights leaders ([VanWormer, 2021](https://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/ur/vol22/iss1/7)).

|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Statues represent heritage, not hate.                    | Heritage tied to white supremacy and oppression cannot be separated from hate; these statues were erected to intimidate Black people and uphold racial hierarchies ([Baker, 2017](https://www.theroot.com/why-all-confederate-statues-must-fall-1797180285)). |
| Removing statues erases history.                          | History is preserved through education and museums; statues glorify, not educate. Removal allows for more accurate and inclusive historical narratives ([Gordon-Reed, 2020](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/legal-scholar-and-historian-puts-the-push-to-remove-confederate-statues-in-context/)). |
| Slavery and racism were common in the past, including among Founding Fathers; removing Confederate statues is a slippery slope. | There is a critical difference between those who helped found the nation and those who sought to destroy it. Founders like Washington and Jefferson are candidates for contextualization, not removal, because their contributions were foundational ([Gordon-Reed, 2020](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/legal-scholar-and-historian-puts-the-push-to-remove-confederate-statues-in-context/)). |
| Statues should remain as reminders of a difficult past.  | Difficult history can be remembered in appropriate contexts such as museums and battlefields, not celebrated in public spaces that imply honor ([Campbell, 2020](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/07/16/controversies-confederate-monuments-memorials/)). |

## Legal and Social Challenges

### Monument Protection Laws

Several states have enacted laws to protect Confederate monuments, complicating removal efforts. For example, Alabama's Memorial Preservation Act imposes fines on local governments that remove such statues ([Elliott, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/30/1069310886/confederate-monuments-removed-americans-consider-how-to-remember-past)). However, public sentiment and legislative changes, such as Virginia’s repeal of its monument protection law, indicate shifting attitudes ([Elliott, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/30/1069310886/confederate-monuments-removed-americans-consider-how-to-remember-past)).

### Community Impact and Healing

Removing Confederate statues is part of a broader racial reckoning and healing process. It acknowledges the pain these symbols cause and affirms a commitment to racial justice. For example, renaming streets and schools previously honoring Confederate figures helps communities recognize and celebrate civil rights heroes ([Elliott, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/30/1069310886/confederate-monuments-removed-americans-consider-how-to-remember-past)).

## Alternatives to Removal

While removal is advocated by many, some propose alternatives such as:

- **Contextualization:** Adding plaques or information to provide historical context.
- **Relocation:** Moving statues to museums or private parks where they can be interpreted critically.
- **Reinterpretation:** Transforming statues into art that reflects contemporary values ([Diaz-Griffith, 2020](https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/the-anti-racist-preservationists-guide-to-confederate-monuments)).

However, experts caution that plaques may not suffice, and museums often lack capacity to house numerous monuments. Community input is essential in determining the best approach ([Gordon-Reed, 2020](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/legal-scholar-and-historian-puts-the-push-to-remove-confederate-statues-in-context/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the extensive historical evidence, social implications, and expert analyses, Confederate statues should be removed from public spaces. These monuments are not neutral artifacts but deliberate symbols of racial oppression and treason. Their presence in government buildings and other prominent public locations perpetuates white supremacy and dishonors the sacrifices made to preserve the United States and end slavery.

Removing these statues does not erase history but rather corrects the narrative about whom society chooses to honor. Public spaces should reflect inclusive values that promote equity, justice, and unity. Alternatives such as relocation to museums or contextualization may serve as transitional solutions but should not delay the removal of these monuments from places of honor.

The removal of Confederate statues is a necessary step toward confronting America's painful racial history and building a more just and equitable society.
