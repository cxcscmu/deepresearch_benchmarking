# Why Adult Children Become Estranged: An In-Depth Analysis

Parental estrangement, particularly between adult children and their parents, has emerged as a significant social phenomenon over the past decade. This report explores the multifaceted reasons why adult children become estranged from their parents, synthesizing findings from recent empirical studies, expert analyses, and firsthand accounts. It aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of the causes, dynamics, and implications of estrangement, drawing on data from large-scale surveys and scholarly research.

## Overview of Parental Estrangement

Estrangement refers to the severing or significant reduction of contact between family members, often without formal legal processes but with profound emotional consequences. Studies indicate that most estrangements between parents and adult children are initiated by the children themselves. For example, a 2015 survey involving over 800 participants found that adult children more frequently initiate estrangement than parents do ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/)).

Among mothers aged 65 to 75 with at least two adult children, about 11% reported estrangement from at least one child, and 62% had contact less than once a month with at least one child ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/)). This prevalence highlights the relevance of understanding the underlying causes.

## Primary Reasons for Estrangement

### 1. Emotional, Physical, or Sexual Abuse

One of the most consistently reported reasons by estranged adult children is past abuse during childhood. Emotional, physical, or sexual abuse by parents is a critical factor leading to estrangement. Adult children often cite these experiences as foundational to their decision to cut ties, as they associate continued contact with ongoing harm or trauma ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/)).

### 2. Toxic and Hurtful Behaviors

Beyond abuse, “toxic” parental behaviors such as disrespect, hurtfulness, neglect, or emotional unavailability contribute significantly to estrangement. Adult children report feeling unsupported or invalidated by their parents, which erodes the relationship over time ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/); [Neuroscience News, 2021](https://neurosciencenews.com/estrangement-parental-alienation-19427/)).

### 3. Clashes in Values and Expectations

Disagreements over core values—including politics, parenting styles, and lifestyle choices—are frequently cited. While fundamental issues like sexuality or religion are less commonly mentioned by mothers, “other” value conflicts such as political differences and parenting approaches are prevalent ([Ohio State University, 2021](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-adult-children-ties-parents.html); [Neuroscience News, 2021](https://neurosciencenews.com/estrangement-parental-alienation-19427/)).

### 4. Mental Health and Addiction Issues

Mothers who are estranged from their adult children often attribute the estrangement to the child’s mental health challenges or substance abuse problems. In a study of over 1,000 mothers, nearly 80% believed that an ex-husband or the child’s spouse influenced the child against them, and about 62% cited mental health or addiction issues as contributing factors ([Ohio State University, 2021](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-adult-children-ties-parents.html); [Neuroscience News, 2021](https://neurosciencenews.com/estrangement-parental-alienation-19427/)).

### 5. Parental Divorce and Family Dynamics

Parents often blame estrangement on their divorce or conflicts involving the child’s spouse. Divorce can create complex family dynamics, including divided loyalties and increased conflict, which may precipitate estrangement ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/); [Ohio State University, 2021](https://news.osu.edu/study-examines-what-makes-adult-children-cut-ties-with-parents/)).

### 6. Sibling Rivalry and Caregiving Conflicts

Estrangement is not limited to parent-child relationships; sibling estrangement often occurs, frequently due to disputes over caregiving responsibilities for aging parents or perceived parental favoritism. Siblings who feel treated worse by parents than their brothers or sisters may become estranged ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/)).

### 7. Lack of Communication and “Ghosting”

Some adult children end relationships abruptly without explanation, a behavior sometimes described as “ghosting.” This sudden withdrawal can be devastating for parents and is reflective of broader societal changes in communication and relationship norms ([Next Avenue, 2021](https://www.nextavenue.org/adult-children-parents-estrangement/)).

## Divergent Perspectives Between Parents and Children

A significant theme in the literature is the disconnect between parents’ and adult children’s views on why estrangement occurs. Mothers tend to externalize blame, often citing the influence of ex-spouses or in-laws, or the child’s mental health issues. Conversely, adult children emphasize parental behaviors such as abuse, disrespect, and failure to respect boundaries ([Ohio State University, 2021](https://news.osu.edu/study-examines-what-makes-adult-children-cut-ties-with-parents/); [Neuroscience News, 2021](https://neurosciencenews.com/estrangement-parental-alienation-19427/)).

This divergence complicates reconciliation efforts, as parents may not acknowledge their role in the estrangement, while children may feel invalidated or unheard. The differing narratives reflect broader societal shifts in expectations about family relationships, autonomy, and well-being ([Ohio State University, 2021](https://news.osu.edu/study-examines-what-makes-adult-children-cut-ties-with-parents/)).

## The Complexity of Estrangement: No One-Size-Fits-All

Experts emphasize that estrangement is not a monolithic phenomenon. Some adult children may make inappropriate choices in estranging themselves, while others make justified decisions based on objectively harmful circumstances. Similarly, some parents are victims of unjustified estrangement, while others have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship ([WeHaveKids, 2022](https://wehavekids.com/family-relationships/adult-child-estranged-reasons)).

Joshua Coleman, a psychologist specializing in estrangement, notes multiple pathways to estrangement, including the child’s need to blame someone for life outcomes, mental illness in the child, and tensions involving the child’s spouse ([Next Avenue, 2021](https://www.nextavenue.org/adult-children-parents-estrangement/)).

## Implications for Reconciliation

Because estrangement is often initiated by the adult child, parents are typically the ones who must take the first steps toward reconciliation. Successful reconnection is frequently attributed to parents’ efforts to:

- Take responsibility for past harms
- Show empathy for the child’s perspective and feelings
- Express willingness to change problematic behaviors
- Accept boundaries around privacy, contact frequency, and time with grandchildren

Avoiding debates about “right” and “wrong” and acknowledging at least some truth in the child’s perspective is crucial ([The Atlantic, 2021](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/why-parents-and-kids-get-estranged/617612/)).

## Conclusion

Adult children become estranged from their parents for a complex interplay of reasons, prominently including past abuse, toxic behaviors, value conflicts, mental health issues, and family dynamics such as divorce and caregiving disputes. The divergence in perspectives between parents and children about the causes of estrangement presents significant challenges for healing. Recognizing the multifactorial nature of estrangement and fostering empathy and accountability on both sides are essential for any hope of reconciliation.
