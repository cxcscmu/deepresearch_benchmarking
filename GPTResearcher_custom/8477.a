# Why Are There Competing Systems of Innovation Classification?  

Innovation systems have become a pivotal framework for understanding how innovation occurs within economies, regions, sectors, and technologies. However, the literature reveals a variety of competing classifications and conceptualizations of innovation systems. This report explores the underlying reasons for these competing classifications, drawing from authoritative academic sources and synthesizing key analytical and methodological issues. The report aims to provide a comprehensive, in-depth, and objective analysis of why multiple innovation system classifications exist, supported by relevant evidence and examples.

## 1. Introduction  

The concept of innovation systems emerged as a response to the need for frameworks that capture the complex, interactive processes of innovation involving multiple actors, institutions, and relationships. Since its introduction by Lundvall in 1985 and popularization by Freeman in the late 1980s, the innovation system concept has evolved into various forms, including national, regional, sectoral, and technological innovation systems ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation_system)). Despite widespread adoption, there is no consensus on a single definition or classification scheme. Instead, competing classifications coexist, each emphasizing different dimensions, components, and boundaries of innovation systems.

## 2. The Nature of Innovation Systems and Their Multidimensionality  

### 2.1 Diverse Purposes and Functions  

Innovation systems serve different purposes depending on the analytical focus. Carlsson et al. (2002) emphasize that systems are defined by their components, relationships, and attributes, but the function or purpose of each system is often not explicitly discussed in the literature ([Carlsson et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X)). The lack of consensus on system purpose leads to varying definitions and classifications. For example, some systems focus on knowledge creation and diffusion, while others emphasize economic growth or technological change.

### 2.2 Multiple Dimensions: Geographic, Sectoral, and Temporal  

Innovation systems can be viewed along several dimensions:

- **Geographical Dimension:** Systems may be national, regional, or local, with boundaries determined by the focus area (e.g., a country or a cluster) ([Carlsson et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X); [Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation_system)).  
- **Sectoral or Technological Dimension:** Systems may be defined by industry sectors or technological fields, reflecting different technological regimes and knowledge bases ([Breschi & Malerba, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X)).  
- **Temporal Dimension:** Innovation systems are dynamic, with configurations changing over time due to feedback mechanisms, making static classifications inadequate ([Carlsson et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X)).

These multiple dimensions necessitate different classification schemes tailored to the specific analytical or policy objectives.

## 3. Analytical and Methodological Issues Leading to Competing Classifications  

### 3.1 Appropriate Level of Analysis  

One of the most critical methodological challenges is selecting the appropriate level of analysis. Carlsson et al. (2002) highlight that innovation systems can be analyzed at various levels — from specific technologies or products to clusters of firms or entire national economies. The choice depends on the research question or policy goal, which naturally leads to different system boundaries and classifications ([Carlsson et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X); [ResearchGate, 2007](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222560405_Innovation_Systems_Analytical_And_Methodological_Issues)).

| Level of Analysis        | Description                                      | Implication for Classification               |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Technology/Product      | Focus on innovation in a specific technology or product group | Leads to technological or sectoral systems   |
| Cluster/Competence Bloc | Groups of related firms or activities in a region | Regional or cluster innovation systems       |
| National Economy        | Entire country’s innovation infrastructure      | National innovation systems                   |
| Global/International    | Cross-border innovation networks                 | Transnational or global innovation systems   |

### 3.2 System Boundaries and Components  

Defining system boundaries is inherently challenging due to the complex interrelations among actors and institutions. Porter (1998) notes that cluster boundaries are often a matter of degree and involve creative judgment based on linkages and spillovers ([Carlsson et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X)). Similarly, industrial classifications vary by product type, technology, or input type, adding ambiguity to system delineation.

### 3.3 Dynamic Nature and Performance Measurement  

Innovation systems are dynamic and evolve over time, which complicates their classification and performance assessment. Carlsson et al. (2002) argue that measuring system performance at a single point can be misleading, as the most critical impact is on long-term economic growth, assessable only retrospectively. This temporal fluidity encourages multiple snapshots and classifications depending on the time frame considered.

## 4. Historical and Institutional Influences  

### 4.1 Evolution of the Concept  

The innovation system concept has evolved historically from economic and institutional perspectives. Lundvall (1985) introduced the idea, drawing from Friedrich List’s 1841 "National System of Political Economy" ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation_system)). Freeman (1988) further developed the "National Innovation System" concept based on Japan’s economic success. This historical evolution reflects different emphases on institutions, policies, and economic structures, contributing to competing classifications.

### 4.2 Institutional and Policy Contexts  

Different countries and regions have distinct institutional frameworks and innovation policies, which shape their innovation systems. For example, Brazil’s innovation system is characterized by "active" and "passive" learning systems, reflecting different policy approaches to technology adaptation and innovation (Viotti, 1997; Freeman, 2002). Such contextual differences necessitate tailored classifications that capture unique institutional features.

## 5. Conceptual Variations and Emerging Terminology  

### 5.1 Innovation System vs. Innovation Ecosystem  

There is ongoing debate about the distinction between "innovation system" and "innovation ecosystem." Some scholars use the terms interchangeably, while others differentiate them based on intentionality and ecological complexity ([Granstrand & Holgersson, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2019.102098)). This conceptual variation adds to the plurality of classifications.

### 5.2 Narrow vs. Broad Definitions  

Lundvall (1992) distinguishes between narrow definitions focusing on institutions directly promoting knowledge acquisition and broad definitions encompassing wider socio-economic, political, and cultural factors ([Freeman, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733301001366)). This spectrum of definitions leads to different system boundaries and analytical focuses.

## 6. Practical Implications and Framework Diversity  

### 6.1 Purpose-Driven Framework Selection  

The choice of innovation system classification often depends on the practical purpose—whether for policy formulation, economic analysis, or technological forecasting. For example, sectoral innovation systems are useful for understanding industry-specific technological regimes and competitive dynamics, while national innovation systems better inform macroeconomic policy ([Breschi & Malerba, 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873330100138X)).

### 6.2 Innovation Types and Frameworks  

Beyond system classifications, innovation itself is categorized into various types (e.g., disruptive, product, process, business model) depending on frameworks like Doblin’s 10 Types of Innovation or Geoffrey Moore’s lifecycle approach ([Decision-Making Solutions, 2024](https://www.decision-making-solutions.com/types-of-innovation.html)). These frameworks intersect with innovation system classifications, further diversifying perspectives.

## 8. Conclusion  

Competing classifications of innovation systems arise from the inherent complexity and multidimensionality of innovation processes, the diversity of analytical purposes, and the evolving nature of the systems themselves. The absence of a universally accepted definition or boundary reflects the dynamic interplay of technological, institutional, geographic, and temporal factors. Furthermore, historical legacies and policy contexts shape how innovation systems are conceptualized in different settings. Rather than viewing competing classifications as a weakness, they represent complementary perspectives that enrich understanding and enable tailored approaches to studying and fostering innovation.

For researchers and policymakers, recognizing the reasons behind these competing classifications is crucial for selecting appropriate frameworks that align with specific objectives and contexts. Future work should focus on integrating these perspectives and developing flexible, multi-level frameworks that accommodate the dynamic and systemic nature of innovation.
