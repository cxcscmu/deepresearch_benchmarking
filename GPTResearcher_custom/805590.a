## Historical Background of French Colonial Rule in Algeria

France invaded and occupied Algeria in 1830, ending centuries of Ottoman rule and initiating a long period of colonial domination ([Algeria’s Struggle for Independence, 2016](https://adst.org/2016/10/algerias-struggle-independence/)). Unlike many other colonies, Algeria was integrated administratively as an integral part of France from 1848, divided into départements, and governed as if it were a French province. This policy was aimed at assimilating Algeria into the French state, under the motto *L’Algérie c’est la France* ("Algeria is France") ([Algeria’s Struggle for Independence, 2016](https://adst.org/2016/10/algerias-struggle-independence/)).

Despite this integration, the indigenous Muslim population was largely excluded from political rights and economic benefits. Only those Algerians who accepted French civil law and renounced Islamic Sharia law could vote or hold office, creating a privileged elite class of *évolués* who were culturally French but still politically marginalized ([Algeria’s Struggle for Independence, 2016](https://adst.org/2016/10/algerias-struggle-independence/)). This systemic inequality sowed the seeds of discontent and nationalist aspirations.

## Emergence of Algerian Nationalism and the FLN

Nationalist sentiments in Algeria grew notably after World War II, fueled by the participation of many Algerians in the French military during both world wars and their exposure to ideas of self-determination and anti-colonialism ([National Liberation Front (Algeria), n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria))). Early nationalist movements focused on reform and assimilation within the French system, led by figures such as Ferhat Abbas, who initially advocated for full French citizenship for Algerians ([The FLN’s Liberation Struggle, 2020](https://medium.com/@mab1472/the-flns-liberation-struggle-righteous-violence-and-third-world-diplomacy-9da496875a69)).

However, these efforts failed to achieve meaningful autonomy or equality. The repression of Algerian political parties and activists during and after World War II, including the banning of the Algerian Communist Party and the Algerian People's Party, intensified frustrations ([National Liberation Front (Algeria), n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria))). The Sétif massacre of 1945, where thousands of pro-independence demonstrators were killed by French forces, further radicalized Algerian nationalism ([When Did Algeria Gain Independence?, 2019](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/when-did-algeria-declare-independence-from-france.html)).

In 1954, the National Liberation Front (FLN) was founded as a revolutionary nationalist party committed to armed struggle for full independence, marking a decisive break from earlier reformist approaches ([Algerian Revolution, 1954](https://teachwar.wordpress.com/resources/war-justifications-archive/algerian-revolution-1954/)). The FLN’s armed wing, the National Liberation Army (ALN), engaged in guerrilla warfare against French forces and rival nationalist factions ([National Liberation Front (Algeria), n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria))).

## The Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962)

The war officially began on November 1, 1954, with coordinated guerrilla attacks by the FLN across Algeria ([Algerian Revolution, 1954](https://teachwar.wordpress.com/resources/war-justifications-archive/algerian-revolution-1954/)). The conflict was brutal and protracted, involving widespread violence, atrocities, and a "triangular" organizational structure designed to sustain the insurgency despite French countermeasures ([Algerian Independence War, n.d.](https://pressbooks.buffscreate.net/revolution/chapter/algerian-revolution/)).

French responses were equally harsh, employing counterinsurgency tactics that often targeted civilians and exacerbated tensions ([Algerian Independence War, n.d.](https://pressbooks.buffscreate.net/revolution/chapter/algerian-revolution/)). The war caused immense human suffering, with estimates of over 100,000 Muslim and 10,000 French soldiers killed, alongside thousands of civilian casualties ([French-Algerian Truce, n.d.](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/french-algerian-truce)).

The FLN combined military resistance with diplomatic efforts to internationalize the Algerian question. They sought support from other newly independent nations and neutral countries, understanding that outright military victory was unlikely without external pressure on France ([The FLN’s Liberation Struggle, 2020](https://medium.com/@mab1472/the-flns-liberation-struggle-righteous-violence-and-third-world-diplomacy-9da496875a69)).

## Political Developments in France and Negotiations

The war destabilized France politically, leading to the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the rise of Charles de Gaulle’s Fifth Republic in 1958 ([Algeria’s Struggle for Independence, 2016](https://adst.org/2016/10/algerias-struggle-independence/)). Initially, de Gaulle sought to maintain French Algeria but gradually shifted towards supporting Algerian self-determination, recognizing the untenability of continued colonial rule ([French-Algerian Truce, n.d.](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/french-algerian-truce)).

Peace negotiations began in earnest in 1961, despite ongoing violence and opposition from hardline European settlers (pieds-noirs) and right-wing groups such as the Organisation de l'Armée Secrète (OAS), which conducted bombings and assassination attempts ([Évian Accords, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89vian_Accords)). The talks were complex, focusing on issues such as citizenship rights, property protections, and control of natural resources, especially the Sahara’s oil and gas reserves ([Evian Accords, 1962](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/evian-accords-1962)).

## The Évian Accords and Algerian Independence

On March 18, 1962, the Évian Accords were signed between France and the FLN’s provisional government, marking a formal ceasefire and laying the groundwork for Algerian independence ([Évian Accords, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89vian_Accords)). Key provisions included:

| Provision                         | Details                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ceasefire                        | Immediate ceasefire from March 19, 1962                                                  |
| Sovereignty                     | Recognition of Algeria’s full sovereignty and right to self-determination                |
| Military Withdrawal             | French forces to withdraw over two years, except for the naval base at Mers El Kébir     |
| Citizenship and Property Rights | Protection for European settlers and indigenous Jews, with option for dual citizenship   |
| Economic Cooperation            | Continued French economic aid and access to Algerian resources, including oil and gas    |
| No Sanctions                   | Amnesty for acts committed before the ceasefire                                          |

The accords were overwhelmingly approved in referendums held in both France (April 8, 1962) and Algeria (July 1, 1962), with over 90% support in each ([Évian Accords, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89vian_Accords); [French-Algerian Truce, n.d.](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/french-algerian-truce)).

On July 3, 1962, Charles de Gaulle officially proclaimed Algeria an independent country, with the Provisional Executive declaring July 5 as Independence Day, symbolically marking the end of 132 years of French colonial rule ([Algerian National Liberation, n.d.](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/algeria.htm)).

## Post-Independence Challenges and Legacy

Following independence, Algeria faced significant challenges. The departure of over one million European settlers and many skilled French workers left the economy in disarray ([Algeria’s Struggle for Independence, 2016](https://adst.org/2016/10/algerias-struggle-independence/)). The FLN established a one-party state, outlawing political opposition and adopting a socialist economic model heavily influenced by the Soviet Union ([National Liberation Front (Algeria), n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria))).

The new government declared Algeria an Islamic state, reversing many of the French colonial-era secular policies ([Algeria’s Struggle for Independence, 2016](https://adst.org/2016/10/algerias-struggle-independence/)). Despite these upheavals, Algeria emerged as a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement and an inspiration for other African liberation movements ([Algeria.com, n.d.](https://www.algeria.com/culture/history/)).

## Conclusion

Algeria’s independence was the result of a long and arduous struggle that combined nationalist political activism, armed guerrilla warfare, and international diplomacy. The failure of French colonial policies to integrate and enfranchise the indigenous population, coupled with the radicalization of nationalist movements after World War II, set the stage for the violent conflict that erupted in 1954.

The Algerian War of Independence was characterized by brutal violence on both sides and significant human suffering. However, it also demonstrated the determination of the Algerian people to achieve self-determination. The political changes in France under Charles de Gaulle and the international context of decolonization facilitated the negotiation of the Évian Accords, which ultimately led to Algeria’s sovereignty in 1962.

This process highlights the complex interplay of colonial legacies, nationalist aspirations, and geopolitical realities in the mid-20th century decolonization era.
