## Understanding Medium- and Long-Term Forecasts in Operations Management

Medium-range forecasts typically cover a period from three months to three years and are used for sales planning, production planning, budgeting, and analyzing various operating plans. Long-range forecasts extend beyond three years and focus on new product planning, capital expenditures, facility location or expansion, and research and development (OM 300 Chapter 4, 2025).

These forecasts differ from short-term forecasts in that they:

- Deal with more comprehensive and strategic issues.
- Employ different methodologies, often more qualitative and scenario-based.
- Tend to be less accurate due to the longer time horizon but are crucial for strategic planning.

Amazon’s operations management department relies heavily on these forecasts to make informed decisions that affect the company’s supply chain, inventory management, workforce planning, and capital investments.
