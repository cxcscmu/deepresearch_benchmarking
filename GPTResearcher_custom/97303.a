# Report: How a Leader's Working Style Impacts Staff

## Introduction

Leadership style is a critical determinant of organizational success and employee outcomes. The way a leader interacts with staff, makes decisions, and manages processes profoundly influences employee morale, productivity, motivation, decision-making efficiency, and overall organizational culture. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how different leadership styles impact staff, drawing on recent empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and practical observations. It aims to offer an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms through which leadership styles affect employee behavior and organizational performance.

## Overview of Leadership Styles and Their Impact on Staff

Leadership styles can be broadly categorized into autocratic (authoritarian), democratic (participative), laissez-faire, transformational, transactional, and other nuanced styles such as coaching, affiliative, paternalistic, and visionary. Each style has distinct characteristics that influence staff differently.

### 1. Autocratic (Authoritarian) Leadership

Autocratic leaders make decisions unilaterally without seeking input from employees. This style establishes a clear hierarchy and control but often leads to low employee morale, increased absenteeism, and high turnover rates due to feelings of disempowerment and lack of trust ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

| Impact Area       | Effect on Staff                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Morale            | Generally low due to lack of participation           |
| Productivity      | May increase short-term, especially in crises        |
| Decision-making   | Fast but excludes employee input                      |
| Retention         | High turnover due to dissatisfaction                  |

While effective in crisis situations requiring quick decisions, the autocratic style is detrimental over the long term as it stifles creativity and reduces employee engagement ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

### 2. Democratic (Participative) Leadership

Democratic leaders involve employees in decision-making, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment. This style enhances employee morale, motivation, and job satisfaction by valuing their input and promoting teamwork ([Academy of Strategic Management Journal, 2017](https://www.abacademies.org/articles/the-effects-of-leadership-styles-on-team-motivation-6918.html)).

| Impact Area       | Effect on Staff                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Morale            | High due to involvement and respect                  |
| Productivity      | Generally high, driven by collaboration              |
| Decision-making   | Inclusive but slower                                  |
| Retention         | Improved due to job satisfaction                      |

However, the democratic style can be time-consuming and may lead to indecision if consensus is difficult to achieve ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

### 3. Laissez-Faire Leadership

Laissez-faire leaders delegate decision-making entirely to employees, providing minimal supervision. This style works well with highly skilled and motivated teams but can lead to chaos and low productivity if staff lack experience or direction ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

| Impact Area       | Effect on Staff                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Morale            | Mixed; can be high with self-motivated teams         |
| Productivity      | Risk of decline without adequate guidance            |
| Decision-making   | Fast if team is competent; chaotic otherwise         |
| Retention         | Variable; depends on team dynamics                    |

### 4. Transformational Leadership

Transformational leaders inspire and motivate employees by creating a shared vision and fostering personal development. This style positively influences staff engagement, creativity, and performance ([Asrar-ul-Haq & Kuchinke, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fbj.2016.03.001)).

| Impact Area       | Effect on Staff                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Morale            | High; employees feel valued and inspired             |
| Productivity      | Increased through motivation and empowerment         |
| Decision-making   | Collaborative and visionary                           |
| Retention         | High due to strong leader-follower relationships     |

### 5. Transactional Leadership

Transactional leaders focus on supervision, organization, and performance through rewards and punishments. This style clarifies expectations and can motivate employees to meet specific goals but may not foster creativity ([Bass & Avolio, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.207)).

| Impact Area       | Effect on Staff                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Morale            | Moderate; dependent on fairness of rewards           |
| Productivity      | Generally high due to clear expectations             |
| Decision-making   | Structured and rule-based                             |
| Retention         | Variable; can be low if overly punitive               |

### 6. Coaching Leadership

Coaching leaders focus on employee development and long-term growth, which enhances morale, retention, and job satisfaction ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

### 7. Affiliative Leadership

Affiliative leaders emphasize emotional bonds and harmony, praising employees and fostering a positive work environment. However, ignoring poor performance can be a downside ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

### 8. Paternalistic Leadership

Paternalistic leaders are protective and controlling, expecting obedience. While this can provide clear direction, it may lead to feelings of patronization and reduced autonomy ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

### 9. Commanding Leadership

Commanding leaders take full control and provide clear directions, effective in crisis but potentially demotivating in normal circumstances ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

## Impact on Employee Morale

Leadership style significantly affects employee morale. Autocratic and commanding styles often result in low morale due to lack of participation and perceived mistrust. Conversely, coaching, affiliative, and democratic styles promote higher morale by encouraging development, recognition, and involvement.

For example, coaching leadership makes employees feel safer and more encouraged to develop, increasing retention and satisfaction ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)). On the other hand, negative leadership that focuses on failures and punishment leads to demotivation and poor performance ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

## Impact on Productivity

Participative leadership styles have been linked to increased productivity through engagement in problem-solving and process improvements. Employees closest to operational issues provide valuable insights that reduce errors and waste, enhancing customer satisfaction ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

In contrast, laissez-faire leadership can lead to decreased productivity if employees lack the skills or motivation to self-manage. Autocratic leadership may yield short-term productivity gains but often at the cost of long-term sustainability due to low employee engagement ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

## Impact on Decision-Making

Democratic leadership encourages broad input, empowering employees but slowing decision-making processes. Laissez-faire leadership delegates decisions entirely to employees, effective only with experienced teams. Autocratic leadership enables rapid decisions but excludes employee perspectives, potentially reducing buy-in ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

## Impact on Organizational Metrics and Alignment

Effective leaders align employee objectives with organizational goals, focusing on metrics that drive long-term profitability and growth. Lack of clear priorities leads to conflicting departmental goals and dysfunctional outcomes ([Farooq, 2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-styles-their-impact-employees-organization-sana-farooq/)).

## Empirical Evidence and Statistical Findings

A study conducted in Port Harcourt involving 300 respondents found a statistically significant implication of leadership style on employee performance (χ² calculated = 21.87 > χ² critical = 9.49, p < 0.05), confirming that leadership style influences productivity and organizational success ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/leadership-styles-research-methodology-management-essay.php)).

| Affiliative         | High                | Moderate               | Supportive               | Moderate                  | Team harmony-focused environments          |
| Paternalistic       | Mixed (can be low)  | Moderate               | Directive                | Mixed                     | Cultures valuing hierarchy                 |
| Commanding          | Low                 | Short-term gain        | Fast, directive          | Low                       | Crisis, urgent decision-making             |

## Conclusion

A leader’s working style has profound and multifaceted impacts on staff. The choice of leadership style should be contingent on the organizational context, employee characteristics, and situational demands. While autocratic and commanding styles may deliver quick results in emergencies, they generally harm morale and retention in the long term. Democratic, coaching, and transformational leadership styles foster higher morale, motivation, and sustainable productivity by empowering employees and aligning their goals with organizational objectives.

Effective leadership requires adaptability and an understanding of the dynamic interplay between leadership style, organizational culture, and employee needs. Leaders who cultivate positive relationships, encourage participation, and provide clear direction aligned with strategic goals are more likely to enhance employee performance and organizational success.
