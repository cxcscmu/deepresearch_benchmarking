# Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices: An In-Depth Analysis

Ethical behavior in organizations is widely regarded as a cornerstone of sustainable success and trustworthiness. Yet, paradoxically, even individuals with strong ethical standards sometimes engage in unethical actions. This report explores why ethical people make unethical choices, drawing from a comprehensive review of behavioral ethics research, organizational studies, and empirical evidence. It synthesizes findings from recent authoritative sources to provide a nuanced understanding of the psychological, organizational, and situational factors that contribute to ethical lapses among otherwise ethical individuals.

## Understanding the Paradox: Ethical People and Unethical Choices

At first glance, it seems contradictory that ethical individuals—those who generally uphold moral principles—would engage in unethical behavior. However, research in behavioral ethics reveals that ethical decision-making is not solely a function of moral character but is deeply influenced by unconscious biases, organizational culture, situational pressures, and cognitive blind spots (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011; Ethics Unwrapped, n.d.).

### Behavioral Ethics Perspective

Behavioral ethics studies how people actually behave when faced with ethical dilemmas, as opposed to how they should behave according to normative ethical theories. It shows that ethical choices are often made intuitively and emotionally rather than through deliberate rational analysis. People are frequently unaware of the ethical implications of their decisions due to internal biases such as self-serving bias and external pressures like conformity (Ethics Unwrapped, n.d.).

## Key Factors Leading Ethical People to Make Unethical Choices

The decision to act unethically is rarely attributable to a single cause. Instead, it results from an interplay of individual, organizational, and opportunity factors, each contributing to ethical lapses in distinct ways.

### 1. Individual Factors

Individual factors include personal moral philosophies, cognitive biases, emotional states, and psychological needs.

- **Cognitive Blind Spots and Biases:** Individuals often fail to recognize the ethical dimensions of their actions due to systematic ethical blind spots. These include motivated blindness (overlooking unethical behavior when ignorance benefits oneself), indirect blindness (minimizing unethical acts by third parties), and the slippery slope effect (gradual desensitization to unethical behavior) (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011; Tenbrunsel & Bazerman, 2011).

- **Temporal Inconsistencies:** People tend to overestimate their future ethical behavior ("should self") but succumb to immediate gratification ("want self") when the moment of decision arrives, leading to unethical choices (Bazerman et al., 2015).

- **Psychological Needs:** Financial pressures, desire for power, or psychological needs such as status can motivate unethical behavior even among ethical individuals (Lighthouse Services, 2019).

- **Moral Disengagement:** After unethical behavior, individuals may rationalize or forget moral rules to reduce cognitive dissonance and maintain a positive self-image (Bazerman et al., 2015).

### 2. Organizational Factors

The environment and culture within an organization significantly influence ethical behavior.

- **Leadership and Tone at the Top:** Poor ethical leadership sets a negative example, signaling to employees that unethical behavior is tolerated or even rewarded (Lighthouse Services, 2019; EVERFI, n.d.).

- **Work Culture and Communication Gaps:** A culture that prioritizes results over ethics, lacks transparency, or has communication breakdowns fosters unethical conduct (IvyPanda, 2020; IPL, n.d.).

- **Pressure to Succeed:** Unrealistic performance targets, especially in sales or finance, create pressure that can drive employees to cut corners or falsify information (EVERFI, n.d.; Lighthouse Services, 2019).

- **Misguided Loyalty:** Employees may engage in unethical acts believing they are protecting the company or their colleagues, suppressing whistleblowing due to misplaced loyalty (Lighthouse Services, 2019).

- **Socialization and Peer Influence:** The behavior and attitudes of colleagues influence individual ethical decisions. Frequent exposure to unethical norms increases the likelihood of unethical behavior (IPL, n.d.; IvyPanda, 2020).

### 3. Opportunity Factors

Opportunity refers to the situational context that enables unethical behavior.

- **Lack of Controls and Oversight:** Weak enforcement of ethical codes, inadequate compliance programs, or ambiguous policies create opportunities for unethical actions (IPL, n.d.; Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011).

- **Organizational Incentives:** Incentive systems that reward results without ethical considerations encourage unethical shortcuts (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011).

- **Ambiguity in Ethical Standards:** When ethical guidelines are vague or inconsistently applied, employees may rationalize unethical decisions (Ethics Unwrapped, n.d.).

---

## Empirical Evidence and Statistics

- The National Business Ethics Survey reports that approximately **41% of employees witnessed unethical conduct** in the workplace within a 12-month period, indicating the prevalence of ethical lapses even among ostensibly ethical workforces (Lighthouse Services, 2019; EVERFI, n.d.).

- Studies show that **even well-intentioned executives may be unaware of their own or their employees' unethical behavior** due to cognitive biases and organizational blind spots (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011).

## Why Policies Alone Are Insufficient

Many organizations implement ethics and compliance policies, codes of conduct, and training programs. However, these measures alone do not guarantee ethical behavior. The Enron scandal exemplifies how formal policies can exist alongside widespread unethical conduct (Carucci, 2016).

Research indicates that ethical lapses often occur because:

- Employees may **fail to internalize ethical standards** due to lack of ongoing ethical dialogue.

- Organizations may **focus on compliance rather than cultivating an ethical culture**, leading to a checkbox mentality (Lighthouse Services, 2019).

- Ethical decision-making is often **intuitive and influenced by unconscious factors** that policies do not address (Ethics Unwrapped, n.d.).

## Strategies to Mitigate Unethical Behavior Among Ethical People

To reduce the incidence of unethical choices by ethical individuals, organizations should adopt a multifaceted approach:

### 1. Cultivate Ethical Leadership

Leaders must model ethical behavior consistently and set clear expectations, as their actions profoundly influence organizational culture (Lighthouse Services, 2019).

### 2. Foster an Ethical Culture

Embed ethics into everyday conversations, performance evaluations, and decision-making processes to reinforce ethical norms (IvyPanda, 2020).

### 3. Address Cognitive Biases

Training programs should include awareness of unconscious biases and ethical blind spots to help employees recognize and counteract them (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011).

### 4. Align Incentives with Ethics

Performance metrics and rewards should balance results with ethical conduct to discourage cutting corners (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel, 2011).

### 5. Enhance Transparency and Reporting

Encourage open communication and provide safe channels for reporting unethical behavior without fear of retaliation (Lighthouse Services, 2019).

### 6. Manage Pressure and Expectations

Set realistic goals and provide adequate resources to reduce the pressure that leads to unethical shortcuts (EVERFI, n.d.).

## Conclusion

Ethical people make unethical choices not primarily because they lack moral principles but because of a complex interplay of unconscious biases, organizational pressures, and situational opportunities. Behavioral ethics research reveals that ethical lapses often arise from cognitive blind spots, temporal inconsistencies, and social influences that distort moral judgment. Organizational culture, leadership, and incentive structures further shape the environment in which ethical decisions are made. Therefore, fostering ethical behavior requires more than compliance policies; it demands a holistic approach that addresses psychological, cultural, and systemic factors to support ethical decision-making at all levels.
