# Why Ethical People Make Unethical Choices: An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

Ethical lapses in organizations often puzzle observers, especially when seemingly ethical individuals engage in unethical behavior. Understanding why ethical people make unethical choices is critical for developing effective interventions to promote ethical conduct in workplaces. This report synthesizes insights from behavioral business ethics, psychological research, and organizational studies to provide a comprehensive explanation of this phenomenon. It highlights the complex interplay of individual, contextual, and cognitive factors that lead to unethical decisions by ethical individuals.

## Conceptual Foundations

### Behavioral Business Ethics Perspective

Behavioral business ethics focuses on actual behaviors and decisions rather than normative prescriptions of what should be done. It recognizes that even well-intentioned individuals can make questionable ethical decisions due to psychological and situational influences ([De Cremer et al., 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303866138_Understanding_Ethical_Behavior_and_Decision_Making_in_Management_A_Behavioural_Business_Ethics_Approach)).

### Ethical Blind Spots and Bounded Ethicality

Research shows that individuals often fail to recognize ethical dimensions of their decisions, a phenomenon termed "bounded ethicality" or ethical blind spots. These blind spots arise from implicit biases, temporal distance from ethical dilemmas, and decision biases that obscure recognition of unethical behavior, both in oneself and others ([Sezer, Gino, & Bazerman, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.03.030)).

## Key Factors Leading Ethical People to Unethical Choices

### 1. Implicit Biases and Self-Serving Justifications

- **Implicit Attitudes:** Unconscious preferences or prejudices can lead to unethical actions without conscious awareness. For example, implicit favoritism toward in-group members can result in discriminatory practices that the actor does not recognize as unethical.

- **Self-Serving Biases:** Individuals tend to view their own actions as more ethical than they are, often rationalizing unethical behavior to maintain a positive self-concept.

- **Rationalization:** Ethical individuals may justify unethical acts by minimizing their impact or framing them as necessary for a greater good, thus reducing cognitive dissonance ([Sezer et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.03.030)).

### 2. Temporal Distance and Moral Disengagement

- **Temporal Inconsistency:** People overestimate their future ethical behavior but succumb to unethical impulses in the moment due to the dominance of the "want self" over the "should self" ([Bazerman, Tenbrunsel, & Wade-Benzoni, 1998](https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.1998.533230)).

- **Ethical Fading:** The ethical aspects of decisions fade from attention during the decision-making process, leading to moral disengagement and motivated forgetting of past unethical behavior ([Tenbrunsel & Messick, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-004-0985-7)).

### 3. Organizational and Environmental Pressures

- **Unrealistic Performance Goals:** Excessive pressure to meet targets can create a "slippery slope" effect where minor unethical acts escalate as individuals seek to avoid failure ([Carucci, 2016](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices)).

- **Conflicting Goals and Perceived Unfairness:** When organizational goals conflict or individuals perceive unfair treatment, ethical standards may be compromised as a form of retaliation or self-protection ([Carucci, 2016](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices)).

- **Lack of Ethical Culture and Leadership:** Absence of clear ethical guidelines, poor role modeling by leaders, and fear of speaking up contribute to unethical behavior by otherwise ethical employees ([Carucci, 2016](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-ethical-people-make-unethical-choices)).

### 4. Cognitive Load and Emotional Ambivalence

- **Emotional Ambivalence:** Engaging in unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB) can induce simultaneous feelings of guilt and pride, creating emotional ambivalence that leads to anxiety and impaired decision-making ([Brown et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000601)).

- **Cognitive Depletion:** Self-regulatory resource depletion reduces the ability to resist unethical temptations, increasing the likelihood of unethical choices ([Mead et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.012)).

## Empirical Evidence

### Unethical Pro-Organizational Behavior (UPB)

Brown et al. (2021) demonstrated that employees engaging in UPB—unethical acts intended to benefit the organization—experience emotional ambivalence (guilt and pride) leading to anxiety and work-to-life conflict. This paradoxical behavior illustrates how ethical intentions can coexist with unethical actions, driven by organizational loyalty and pressure.

| Study | Population | Key Findings |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Brown et al., 2021 | Hairstylists, Accountants, General Employees | UPB triggers emotional ambivalence, leading to anxiety and increased work-to-life conflict. UPB differs from unethical pro-self behavior by inducing both guilt and pride. |
| Carucci, 2016 | Various Organizations | Unrealistic goals and conflicting objectives increase unethical behavior among otherwise ethical employees. |
| Sezer et al., 2015 | Experimental Studies | Implicit biases and ethical fading contribute to unintentional unethical behavior. |

### Impact of Incentives and Goals

Research shows that incentive pay structures combined with specific goals can increase dishonesty. Managers paid bonuses for hitting targets were more likely to engage in dishonest reporting, especially after crossing an initial threshold of unethical behavior ("slippery step" effect) ([Study on managerial dishonesty, 2018](https://www.ajobthing.com/blog/how-incentives-can-lead-to-unethical-behaviour-in-the-workplace)).

### Ethical Blind Spots and Decision-Making

Bazerman and colleagues highlight that ethical blind spots arise because individuals process information through cognitive shortcuts (System 1 thinking), which is fast but prone to biases. Interventions that promote deliberate, reflective thinking (System 2) can reduce unethical behavior but are challenging to implement consistently ([Sezer et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.03.030)).

## Strategies to Mitigate Unethical Choices by Ethical Individuals

| Strategy | Description | Considerations |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Promote Ethical Awareness | Training to recognize ethical issues and biases | Must be ongoing and integrated into daily work |
| Align Goals with Ethics | Set realistic, clear goals that do not incentivize unethical shortcuts | Avoid excessive pressure and conflicting objectives |
| Foster Ethical Leadership | Leaders model ethical behavior and encourage speaking up | Leaders held accountable for ethical standards |
| Reduce Cognitive Load | Provide resources to manage stress and decision fatigue | Support self-regulation and reflection |
| Institutional Design | Implement codes of ethics, accountability mechanisms, and transparent reporting | Must be consistent and avoid unintended consequences |

## Conclusion

Ethical people make unethical choices due to a confluence of psychological biases, temporal inconsistencies, organizational pressures, and emotional conflicts. These factors often operate unconsciously, leading to ethical blind spots and rationalizations that obscure the moral implications of decisions. Recognizing the paradoxical nature of behaviors such as UPB and addressing systemic and individual factors through comprehensive strategies are essential to fostering ethical workplaces.
