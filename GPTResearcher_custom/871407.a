## Identification of the Flaw: Improper Authentication

The flaw that predominantly leads to the exposure of resources or functionality to unintended actors is **Improper Authentication**. This vulnerability arises when an application or system fails to correctly verify the identity of a user or actor attempting to access resources or functionalities, thereby allowing unauthorized individuals to gain access ([suskumari135, 2019](https://brainly.in/question/14103228); [ImmuniWeb, 2020](https://www.immuniweb.com/vulnerability/improper-authentication.html)).

### Definition and Explanation

Improper Authentication occurs when the software inadequately or incorrectly validates user credentials or identity claims. This can happen due to flawed implementation, misconfiguration, or the presence of other vulnerabilities that facilitate bypassing authentication controls. The authentication process is a fundamental part of the AAA security model (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting), where authentication proves the identity of an actor, authorization controls access to resources, and accounting tracks activities ([ImmuniWeb, 2020](https://www.immuniweb.com/vulnerability/improper-authentication.html); [MITRE CWE-287](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)).

### How Improper Authentication Leads to Exposure

When authentication is broken or improperly implemented, attackers can:

- Gain unauthorized access to restricted areas of an application.
- Perform actions reserved for privileged users.
- Disclose sensitive information.
- Execute arbitrary code or commands.

For example, if an application uses a parameter such as `group` in an HTTP GET request to assign privileges (e.g., `group=user` for viewing and `group=admin` for editing), an attacker altering this parameter to `admin` without proper verification can modify sensitive content ([ImmuniWeb, 2020](https://www.immuniweb.com/vulnerability/improper-authentication.html)).

## Related Flaws: Improper Access Control and Exposure of Sensitive Information

While Improper Authentication is the primary flaw, it often intersects with or leads to other related weaknesses:
