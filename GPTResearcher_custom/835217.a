## Introduction

Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is altering Earth's climate systems, leading to rising global temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These changes are not abstract or distant phenomena; they are already reshaping human lives across the globe, affecting health, security, and economic stability. This report synthesizes current knowledge to answer the question: **Can global climate change change people's lives?** The evidence unequivocally affirms that it does, with complex and far-reaching consequences.

## 1. Climate Change and Human Health

### 1.1 Direct and Indirect Health Impacts

Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health, including clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food, and secure shelter. Between 2030 and 2050, it is projected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths annually from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress ([World Health Organization, 2022](https://internationalgbc.org/)).

Health impacts manifest both directly—through heatwaves, storms, and floods—and indirectly via disrupted food systems, increased zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, and mental health challenges. Vulnerable groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, migrants, older adults, and those with pre-existing conditions bear the brunt of these risks.

### 1.2 Air Quality and Respiratory Health

Fossil fuel combustion contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, which kills an estimated 7 million people worldwide annually. Warmer temperatures exacerbate air quality issues by increasing ground-level ozone and particulate matter, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases ([Climate Reality, 2019](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/how-climate-change-affecting-our-lives)).

### 1.3 Mental Health and Heat Stress

Rising temperatures correlate with a 2% increase in mental health disorders, including stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Heat stress also reduces physical labor capacity, diminishing income, especially among deprived populations ([World Health Organization, 2022](https://internationalgbc.org/)).

## 2. Environmental and Socioeconomic Impacts

### 2.1 Sea-Level Rise and Housing Security

Global sea levels have risen approximately 7-8 inches since 1900, with 3 inches since 1993, threatening coastal communities through inundation and increased flooding. This phenomenon leads to displacement and “climate gentrification,” where lower-income residents are displaced by wealthier populations moving inland ([Climate Reality, 2019](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/how-climate-change-affecting-our-lives)).

### 2.2 Food Security and Nutrition

Elevated CO2 levels alter plant physiology, increasing sugar content but reducing essential nutrients such as calcium, protein, zinc, and vitamins in fruits and vegetables. By mid-century, this could result in 175 million additional people with zinc deficiency and 122 million with protein deficiency globally ([Climate Reality, 2019](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/how-climate-change-affecting-our-lives)).

### 2.3 Economic Vulnerability and Poverty

Climate change exacerbates poverty by increasing health-related expenditures and pushing approximately 100 million people into poverty annually due to health shocks. Poor populations, often uninsured, face compounded barriers to accessing healthcare, threatening progress toward universal health coverage ([World Health Organization, 2022](https://internationalgbc.org/)).

## 3. Climate Change and Human Mobility

### 3.1 Migration, Displacement, and Planned Relocation

Climate change influences human movement through sudden-onset disasters (storms, floods) and slow-onset phenomena (drought, sea-level rise). Movements include displacement (forced), migration (voluntary), and planned relocation (state-led resettlement). Most movements occur within countries, but cross-border migration is increasing, especially from vulnerable regions ([Weerasinghe, 2021](https://cmsny.org/what-we-know-about-climate-change-and-migration-final/)).

### 3.2 Vulnerable and Trapped Populations

Some populations are "trapped" due to lack of resources or legal barriers, unable to move away from hazardous areas. Others choose to remain despite risks. Effective policies must address these diverse circumstances, ensuring protection and support ([Weerasinghe, 2021](https://cmsny.org/what-we-know-about-climate-change-and-migration-final/)).

### 3.3 Policy and Legal Frameworks

International frameworks such as the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda and the Global Compact for Migration recognize the need to address climate-related mobility, though gaps remain in legal protections for climate migrants. Human rights law offers limited but evolving avenues for protection ([Weerasinghe, 2021](https://cmsny.org/what-we-know-about-climate-change-and-migration-final/)).

## 4. Trends in Vulnerability and Adaptation

### 4.1 Declining Vulnerability Despite Rising Hazards

Empirical evidence shows a significant decline in human and economic vulnerability to climate-related hazards over recent decades. From 1980–1989 to 2007–2016, mortality rates dropped more than sixfold and economic loss rates nearly fivefold globally. This decline is attributed to improved disaster risk management, early warning systems, and infrastructure ([Formetta & Feyen, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.05.004)).

### 4.2 Persistent Inequalities

Despite overall improvements, low- and middle-income countries remain disproportionately vulnerable, with mortality rates 4.4 times higher and economic loss rates nearly four times higher than in wealthier countries. Vulnerability gaps are especially pronounced for coastal floods and wind-related hazards ([Formetta & Feyen, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.05.004)).

### 4.3 Wealth as a Protective Factor

There is a clear negative correlation between wealth (GDP per capita) and vulnerability to climate hazards. Investments in protection measures, health infrastructure, and social safety nets reduce mortality and economic losses ([Formetta & Feyen, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.05.004)).

## 5. Case Study: Australia’s Climate and Health Challenges

Australia exemplifies the multifaceted impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events, disease spread, food and water insecurity, job disruptions, and social security threats. Vulnerable groups include the sick, elderly, young, poor, pregnant women, and socially isolated individuals. Recommendations emphasize identifying vulnerable populations, coordinated research, improved communication, and emission reductions ([Australian Academy of Science, 2015](https://www.science.org.au/files/userfiles/support/reports-and-plans/2015/climate-change-challenges-health.pdf)).

## 6. Opportunities and Co-Benefits

Mitigation strategies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions can yield immediate health benefits, such as improved air quality and increased physical activity through better urban planning. Transitioning to clean energy and sustainable food systems can simultaneously address climate change and public health ([Haines, 2021](https://www.sei.org/events/climate-change-and-health-developing-evidence-for-action/)).

## Conclusion

Global climate change is unequivocally transforming people's lives across multiple dimensions—health, environment, economic stability, and mobility. While technological and policy advances have reduced vulnerability in many regions, significant disparities persist, disproportionately affecting the world's poorest and most marginalized populations. The evidence underscores the urgency of integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies that prioritize equity and resilience. Addressing climate change is not only an environmental imperative but a critical public health and human security challenge with profound implications for current and future generations.
