# Credibility Analysis of Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)

## Introduction

Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) is an independent website founded in 2015 by Dave Van Zandt that aims to rate the bias, factual accuracy, and credibility of media sources. It has become a widely referenced resource in media literacy, fact-checking, and academic research. This report provides a detailed, objective, and comprehensive analysis of MBFC’s credibility based on available information, including its methodology, funding, team, reception, and usage by other institutions. The goal is to assess whether MBFC can be considered a credible source for evaluating media bias and factual reporting.

## Methodology and Evaluation Process

### Bias and Factual Reporting Ratings

MBFC determines media bias and factual reporting levels through a combination of:

- **Objective measures**: Quantifiable data such as sourcing, factual accuracy, and story selection.
- **Subjective analysis**: Human evaluation of language, tone, and political affiliation.

The methodology involves rating sources on categories such as:

| Category                  | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Biased Wording/Headlines  | Use of loaded words or emotionally charged language to sway readers.                            |
| Factual/Sourcing          | Accuracy of reporting and backing claims with credible evidence.                               |
| Story Choices             | Whether the source reports news from multiple perspectives or favors one side.                 |
| Political Affiliation     | Degree to which the source endorses a particular political ideology or extreme views.          |

Each category is rated on a 0-10 scale, with 0 indicating no bias and 10 indicating maximum bias. Scores are averaged to determine overall bias ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/)).

### Transparency and Subjectivity

- MBFC openly acknowledges that their methodology is **not scientifically proven** and involves subjective judgment.
- Different reviewers may arrive at slightly different scores, but field tests show close correlation regardless of political affiliation.
- The methodology is publicly available, allowing users to apply it independently.
- MBFC uses a team approach to mitigate individual bias.
- Wikipedia and other fact-checking sites like PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org are used as background resources but not for rating decisions ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frequently-asked-questions/)).

### Updating Ratings

- MBFC reviews top sources annually or more frequently.
- Other sources are reviewed every 1-2 years depending on staff availability.
- Ratings can be updated if new evidence emerges or if a source shifts its editorial stance ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frequently-asked-questions/)).

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Subjectivity of Ratings

- MBFC’s methodology relies on human judgment, which inherently involves some subjectivity.
- Critics argue that the 0-10 scale for bias lacks objective markers, making ratings potentially inconsistent.
- For example, PolitiFact Bias (a critical blog) highlighted that MBFC’s rating of PolitiFact as “Least Biased” was subjective and not backed by quantifiable data ([White, 2017](https://politifactbias.com/2017/10/17/can-you-trust-what-media-bias-fact-check-says-about-politifact/)).

### Non-Professional Journalists

- MBFC team members are not professional journalists but media consumers with college education.
- While this can be an advantage in terms of perspective, it may limit professional rigor compared to established journalistic fact-checkers ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frequently-asked-questions/)).

### Proprietary Data

- MBFC does not publicly share its numerical ratings or raw data, citing misuse by third parties.
- This limits external validation and reproducibility of their ratings ([Media Bias/Fact Check, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frequently-asked-questions/)).

### Criticism from Other Fact-Checkers and Analysts

- Some fact-checking sites and media analysts have questioned MBFC’s methodology and ratings, citing lack of scientific rigor.
- However, many criticisms stem from disagreements over ratings rather than methodological flaws.
- MBFC has addressed some criticisms by updating ratings and improving transparency over time.

## Comparative Context

| Fact-Checking Site       | Bias Rating Approach                      | Transparency | Professional Staff | Academic Use | Credibility Rating (External) |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Media Bias/Fact Check** | Human-reviewed rubric; subjective scale | High         | Non-professional    | Yes          | Newsguard 100/100             |
| **FactCheck.org**         | Non-partisan fact-checking with sourcing | High         | Professional        | Yes          | High (MBFC rating: Least Biased, Very High factual) |
| **Snopes.com**            | Editorial review; varied methods          | Moderate     | Professional        | Yes          | Generally reliable             |
| **PolitiFact**            | Truth-O-Meter scale; editorial review     | High         | Professional        | Yes          | Mixed views on bias           |

MBFC is unique in combining bias and factual reporting ratings and openly publishing its methodology, although it lacks the professional journalist staff of some other fact-checkers. Its acceptance by academic institutions and media outlets supports its credibility despite limitations.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive information reviewed, **Media Bias/Fact Check is a credible and valuable resource for assessing media bias and factual accuracy**, with some important caveats:

- **Strengths**: MBFC’s transparency, independence, academic and media recognition, and commitment to updating ratings support its credibility. Its methodology, while subjective, is openly published and tested for consistency.

- **Limitations**: The subjective nature of bias ratings, lack of professional journalism staff, and proprietary data restrict its scientific rigor and external validation. Criticisms from other fact-checkers highlight areas for improvement but do not fundamentally undermine MBFC’s utility.

- **Practical Use**: MBFC should be used as one of multiple tools for media evaluation, complemented by other fact-checking sites and critical thinking. Its ratings provide a useful starting point for understanding media bias and credibility but should not be the sole determinant.

In summary, MBFC stands as a **trusted authority in the media literacy ecosystem**, particularly for general audiences and researchers seeking a broad overview of media source bias and factual reporting. Its credibility is reinforced by external validations and widespread usage, although users should remain aware of its methodological subjectivity.
