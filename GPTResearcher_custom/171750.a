# Credibility Assessment of Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)

Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) is an American fact-checking and media bias rating website founded in 2015 by Dave M. Van Zandt. It aims to provide an independent evaluation of media sources by rating their bias and factual accuracy. Given the proliferation of misinformation and the increasing importance of media literacy, the credibility of such platforms is critical. This report provides a comprehensive and objective analysis of MBFC’s credibility based on available information, including its methodology, reception, usage, and critiques.

## Overview of Media Bias/Fact Check

MBFC operates from Greensboro, North Carolina, and is owned solely by Dave M. Van Zandt. The site uses a 0-10 scale to rate media outlets on two main dimensions: bias and factual accuracy. The ratings consider factors such as biased wording, headlines, sourcing, story choices, and political affiliation. MBFC also categorizes sources ideologically into Left, Left-Center, Least Biased, Right-Center, and Right ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias/Fact_Check)).

MBFC’s mission is to educate the public on media bias and deceptive news practices. The site is maintained by Van Zandt, assisted by volunteers and paid contractors, none of whom are professional journalists but are college-educated individuals with an interest in media accountability ([MBFC About, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/about/)).

## Methodology and Approach

MBFC’s methodology involves both objective and subjective analysis. It evaluates media sources based on:

- Biased wording and headlines
- Factual accuracy, including failed fact checks
- Sourcing quality and transparency
- Political affiliation and story selection

The site openly acknowledges that its methodology is **not scientifically proven** and that results may vary depending on the evaluator performing the rating. However, MBFC claims that field tests show a close correlation in ratings regardless of the political bias of the evaluators ([MBFC FAQ, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frequently-asked-questions/)).

This combination of objective criteria and subjective human judgment is common in media bias evaluation but introduces potential for inconsistency and personal bias. The site publishes its methodology and research transparently on each page, which allows users to review the basis for each rating.

## Reception and Criticism

### Positive Reception and Usage

MBFC is widely cited and used in academic research and media literacy efforts. For example, researchers at the University of Michigan have used MBFC data to develop tools like the "Iffy Quotient," which tracks the prevalence of fake news and questionable sources on social media ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Bias/Fact_Check)).

Several university libraries and educational institutions recommend MBFC as a resource for media bias identification, including MIT and the University of Michigan. It is also used to train AI fact-checking bots and is considered by some users to align well with other media bias charts such as Ad Fontes Media ([Skeptics Meta Stack Exchange, 2024](https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4589/is-media-bias-fact-check-a-reliable-site)).

MBFC is often listed alongside other fact-checking organizations like FactCheck.org, which it rates as a “Least Biased” and “Very High” factual reporting source, demonstrating MBFC’s integration with established fact-checkers ([MBFC FactCheck, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/factcheck/)).

### Criticism and Limitations

Despite its popularity, MBFC has faced criticism from media experts and journalism reviews:

- **Non-scientific methodology**: Daniel Funke and Alexios Mantzarlis of the Poynter Institute note that MBFC’s method is "in no way scientific," despite its widespread citation ([Funke & Mantzarlis, 2018](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2018/heres-what-to-expect-from-fact-checking-in-2019/)).

- **Subjectivity and amateurism**: The Columbia Journalism Review described MBFC as an “amateur attempt” with subjective assessments that allow for human biases and inconsistencies ([Wilner, 2018](https://www.cjr.org/innovations/measure-media-bias-partisan.php)).

- **Lack of professional journalism credentials**: MBFC’s team does not include professional journalists, which some see as a disadvantage. However, MBFC argues this is an advantage, as their team represents media consumers rather than insiders ([MBFC FAQ, 2022](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/frequently-asked-questions/)).

- **Potential for bias in ratings**: Some critiques highlight that MBFC’s ratings may reflect the biases of evaluators or the site’s owner, Dave Van Zandt, who has a communications background but no formal journalism qualifications ([PolitiFactBias, 2017](https://www.politifactbias.com/2017/10/can-you-trust-what-media-biasfact-check.html)).

## Reliability and Accuracy

MBFC does not fact-check every article from each media source it rates but provides general bias and factual accuracy ratings based on sampling and research. This approach is practical given resource constraints but means that ratings may not capture all nuances or recent changes in source behavior ([Skeptics Meta Stack Exchange, 2024](https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4589/is-media-bias-fact-check-a-reliable-site)).

The site’s transparency in methodology and willingness to update ratings when errors are identified is a positive factor supporting reliability. Users have noted that MBFC generally aligns with other reputable fact-checking and media bias rating organizations, suggesting a reasonable degree of accuracy ([Skeptics Meta Stack Exchange, 2024](https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4589/is-media-bias-fact-check-a-reliable-site)).

This table illustrates that MBFC is a relatively new and less formal operation compared to established fact-checkers and media analysis institutions. While it provides valuable data and is widely used, it lacks the professional journalism credentials and scientific rigor of some peers.

## Summary and Conclusion

**Is Media Bias/Fact Check credible?**

Based on the evidence, MBFC is a **generally credible and useful resource** for identifying media bias and evaluating factual accuracy, but with important caveats:

- It is **not a scientific or professionally journalistic operation**; its methodology relies on subjective human judgment combined with some objective criteria.

- MBFC is **transparent about its limitations** and openly publishes its methodology and research, which enhances trustworthiness.

- The site is **widely used and cited** in academic research, media literacy education, and by other fact-checking entities, indicating a level of acceptance and utility.

- Criticisms regarding **subjectivity and amateurism** are valid and should be considered when using MBFC ratings. Users should not treat MBFC as infallible but as one tool among many.

- MBFC’s ratings generally **align with other reputable fact-checking and media bias resources**, supporting its reliability.

In conclusion, Media Bias/Fact Check is a **valuable but imperfect tool** for assessing media bias and factual accuracy. It should be used in conjunction with other fact-checking sites and critical media literacy practices. Users should be aware of its limitations and the potential for human bias but can reasonably trust MBFC as a starting point for evaluating media sources.
