# Report on the Frequency of Defensive Gun Use in the United States

The frequency with which guns are used for self-defense in the United States is a subject of extensive research, debate, and controversy. Estimates vary widely, ranging from tens of thousands to several million defensive gun uses (DGUs) annually. This report synthesizes findings from multiple studies, surveys, and analyses to provide a comprehensive, data-driven overview of how often people use guns for self-defense, highlighting methodological differences, potential biases, and the implications of these findings.

## Overview of Defensive Gun Use Estimates

### High-End Estimates

Several large-scale surveys and studies suggest that defensive gun use in the U.S. occurs between **1.67 million and 3 million times per year**. The 2021 National Firearms Survey (NFS), which utilized advanced digital and internet-based methodologies, estimated DGUs at approximately 1.67 to 2.8 million annually. This estimate aligns reasonably well with earlier smaller surveys and private studies conducted over the past few decades ([Weingarten, 2021](https://www.ammoland.com/2021/09/survey-validates-estimates-of-private-guns-and-defensive-uses/)).

Similarly, criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, through their 1993 National Self-Defense Survey, estimated over **2.2 million defensive gun uses annually** in the 1990s, a figure that remains influential in the debate ([Capital Research Center, 2018](https://capitalresearch.org/article/why-is-the-cdc-hiding-its-defensive-gun-use-statistics/)).

### Low-End Estimates

Contrasting sharply with the high-end figures, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a large government survey designed primarily to measure victimization rather than defensive gun use, estimates DGUs at around **108,000 to 150,000 per year**. This figure is often cited by gun control advocates and some researchers as more reliable due to the NCVS's rigorous methodology and large sample size ([Cook & Ludwig, 1996](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263)).

The NCVS's lower estimates have been criticized for methodological limitations, such as excluding defensive uses not associated with reported crimes and underreporting due to the survey design ([Weingarten, 2021](https://www.ammoland.com/2021/09/survey-validates-estimates-of-private-guns-and-defensive-uses/)).

### Mid-Range and Alternative Estimates

Other studies and meta-analyses offer intermediate estimates, typically ranging from **250,000 to 500,000 DGUs annually**. These figures attempt to balance the potential overestimation biases of self-reported surveys and the underestimation biases of victimization surveys ([Hemenway et al., 2015](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/)).

## Methodological Differences and Their Impact on Estimates

The wide range of estimates primarily stems from differences in survey design, question framing, and data collection methods:

| Aspect                          | High Estimates (1.67M - 3M)                          | Low Estimates (~100K - 150K)                        |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Survey Type**                 | Self-report surveys with broad questions on DGU    | National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)         |
| **Sample Size**                 | Large internet-based samples (e.g., 54,000+ people) | Large, nationally representative household surveys |
| **Question Framing**            | Direct questions about any defensive gun use        | Questions limited to reported victimization events |
| **Inclusion Criteria**          | Includes all DGUs, even without reported crimes     | Only includes DGUs tied to reported crimes         |
| **Potential Biases**            | Social desirability bias, false positives            | Underreporting due to narrow scope, telescoping    |
| **Data Collection Method**     | Internet and telephone surveys                        | Repeated household interviews                       |

The **“false positive” problem** in surveys of rare events, as highlighted by Hemenway (1997), explains how even a small percentage of inaccurate responses can dramatically inflate estimates of DGUs ([Harvard Injury Control Research Center, 2017](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use-2/)).

Conversely, the NCVS's design, which excludes incidents not reported as crimes and uses bounding techniques to reduce telescoping (misreporting of event timing), likely leads to underestimation of DGUs ([Injury Prevention, 2000](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263)).

## Characteristics and Context of Defensive Gun Uses

### Prevalence Among Gun Owners

A 2021 survey extrapolated from a large internet poll found that **31.1% of gun owners reported using a firearm in self-defense at least once in their lifetime**, which translates to roughly **25.3 million adults** in the U.S. having used a gun defensively at some point ([American Gun Facts, 2021](https://americangunfacts.com/guns-used-in-self-defense-stats/)).

### Frequency of Use

Among those who reported defensive use, many indicated multiple incidents:

| Number of Defensive Uses Reported | Percentage of Respondents |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 Time                           | 44.1%                     |
| 2 Times                         | 32.7%                     |
| 3 Times                         | 12.6%                     |
| 4 Times                         | 2.8%                      |
| 5 or More                      | 7.8%                      |

This suggests that a subset of gun owners are repeat users of firearms for self-defense ([American Gun Facts, 2021](https://americangunfacts.com/guns-used-in-self-defense-stats/)).

### Situational Context

- **Location**: Approximately 79.1% of defensive gun uses occur inside the owner’s home or on their property.
- **Multiple Attackers**: In over half (51.2%) of defensive incidents, gun owners faced multiple assailants.
- **Type of Firearm**: Handguns are the most commonly used firearm in self-defense (65.9%), followed by shotguns (21%) and rifles (13.1%) ([American Gun Facts, 2021](https://americangunfacts.com/guns-used-in-self-defense-stats/)).

## Legal and Social Considerations

Studies analyzing the legality and social acceptability of self-reported DGUs reveal complexities:

- A Harvard study involving criminal court judges found that **at least half of self-defense gun uses reported in surveys were probably illegal**, even assuming the respondents had permits and were truthful ([Injury Prevention, 2000](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263)).
- Some reported DGUs may be aggressive or socially undesirable uses of firearms, including uses in escalating arguments rather than clear-cut self-defense.
- The presence of a small number of respondents accounting for a large share of reported DGUs raises concerns about exaggeration or misclassification ([Injury Prevention, 2000](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263)).

---

## Reporting and Media Coverage

- Many DGUs do not result in police reports or media coverage, leading to undercounting in official statistics and public awareness.
- The Gun Violence Archive, which tracks verified incidents reported by law enforcement and media, recorded fewer than 2,100 DGUs annually in 2016 and 2017, highlighting the discrepancy between survey estimates and documented cases ([Wikipedia, 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use)).

## Summary and Opinion

The question "How often do people use guns for self-defense?" does not have a single definitive answer due to methodological challenges and divergent data sources. However, based on the most recent and comprehensive surveys, including the 2021 National Firearms Survey and corroborating earlier studies by Kleck and Gertz, it is reasonable to conclude that:

- Defensive gun uses in the United States likely occur **in the range of 1.5 to 3 million times annually**.
- This range is supported by multiple independent surveys and is consistent with the lived experience of millions of gun owners.
- Lower estimates from the NCVS and similar victimization surveys are valuable for their methodological rigor but likely underestimate the true frequency due to their narrower scope and design limitations.
- A significant portion of DGUs occurs without police involvement or media reporting, which explains the discrepancy between survey-based estimates and official statistics.
- The social and legal context of DGUs is complex, with a notable fraction of uses potentially falling outside legal self-defense parameters.

Given these points, the higher estimates should be considered plausible and reflective of real-world defensive gun use, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in measuring such a rare and sensitive phenomenon.
