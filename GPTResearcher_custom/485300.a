# Report on the Frequency of Defensive Gun Use in the United States

## Introduction

The use of firearms for self-defense, commonly referred to as Defensive Gun Use (DGU), is a highly debated and contentious issue in the United States. Estimates of how often guns are used in self-defense vary widely, ranging from tens of thousands to several million incidents annually. This report provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the frequency of defensive gun use, drawing from a variety of sources including academic studies, government surveys, and recent research. The goal is to present an objective, data-driven perspective on how often people use guns for self-defense, highlighting the methodological challenges and discrepancies in existing research.

## Overview of Defensive Gun Use Estimates

### Wide Range of Estimates

Estimates of the annual number of defensive gun uses in the U.S. vary dramatically depending on the source and methodology:

| Source/Study                      | Estimated Annual DGUs          | Methodology/Notes                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kleck & Gertz (1995)              | 2.2 to 2.5 million            | National random-digit-dial telephone survey; criticized for potential overestimation                 |
| National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) | ~100,000 to 235,000            | Victim interviews; considered more conservative and reliable by some experts                         |
| Cook & Ludwig (1997)              | 1.46 to 4.7 million           | Analysis of NSPOF survey; questioned credibility of higher estimates                                |
| Harvard Injury Control Research Center (Hemenway, 2016) | ~0.9% of crimes involve DGU (~100,000) | Analysis of NCVS data from 2007-2011; emphasizes rarity of DGU                                      |
| 2021 National Firearms Survey     | 1.67 million (potentially up to 2.8 million) | Large internet survey of gun owners; extrapolated to national population                            |
| Violence Policy Center (2013)     | ~67,740                       | FBI data analysis; lower estimate based on verified incidents                                      |
| Gun Violence Archive (2016-2017) | ~2,000 incidents              | Media and law enforcement reports; undercounts non-reported DGUs                                   |

## Methodological Challenges in Measuring Defensive Gun Use

### Self-Reporting Bias and Survey Limitations

- **Self-Reporting Bias:** Many DGU estimates rely on surveys where respondents self-report incidents. This can lead to overreporting due to social desirability bias or false positives, where respondents may exaggerate or misinterpret events ([Hemenway, 1997](https://doi.org/10.2307/1144020)).

- **Rare Event Problem:** Defensive gun use is a relatively rare event, making it difficult to obtain statistically reliable estimates from surveys. Small errors or false reports can significantly skew results ([Cook & Ludwig, 1997](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/175056.pdf)).

- **Underreporting in Official Data:** Many defensive gun uses do not result in police reports or hospital visits, especially when no shots are fired or injuries occur. This leads to undercounting in official crime and medical records ([Kleck, 1995](https://doi.org/10.2307/1144004)).

- **Definition Ambiguity:** There is no consensus on what constitutes a defensive gun use. Some incidents may involve illegal possession or may not be clearly defensive, complicating data collection and interpretation ([RAND Corporation, 2018](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2088.html)).

### Differences Between Survey Types

- **National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS):** Focuses on victims of reported crimes, potentially missing DGUs where no crime was perceived or reported. It tends to produce lower estimates (~100,000 per year) ([Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2013](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf)).

- **Random-Digit-Dial Surveys (e.g., Kleck & Gertz):** Ask broader questions about gun use, including non-reported incidents, resulting in higher estimates (2+ million per year) but criticized for overestimation ([Kleck & Gertz, 1995](https://doi.org/10.2307/1144004)).

- **Internet Surveys (e.g., 2021 National Firearms Survey):** Large sample sizes but subject to self-selection bias; estimate 1.67 million DGUs annually, possibly conservative ([English et al., 2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145)).

## Detailed Findings from Key Studies and Surveys

### Kleck and Gertz (1995)

- Estimated 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs annually based on a telephone survey of 5,000 people.

- Found that 31.1% of gun owners reported at least one DGU in their lifetime.

- Criticized for implausible numbers of assailants shot compared to hospital and police records.

- Kleck argues many DGUs go unreported to police or hospitals due to fear of legal complications ([Kleck & Gertz, 1995](https://doi.org/10.2307/1144004)).

### National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)

- Estimates around 100,000 to 235,000 DGUs per year.

- Uses victim reports of crimes; only asks about DGU if the respondent reports being a crime victim.

- Likely undercounts DGUs because many defensive incidents do not involve recognized crimes or are not reported ([Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2013](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf)).

### Harvard Injury Control Research Center (Hemenway)

- Analysis of NCVS data from 2007-2011 found DGU in 0.9% of crimes.

- Argues risks of gun ownership outweigh benefits due to rarity of DGU and potential for misuse.

- Notes that running away or calling police often leads to better outcomes than using a gun defensively ([Hemenway & Solnick, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.029)).

### 2021 National Firearms Survey

- Surveyed 54,000 Americans, including 16,000 gun owners.

- Estimated 1.67 million DGUs annually, possibly up to 2.8 million.

- Found that in 81.9% of DGUs, no shots were fired; showing or verbally indicating a gun was often sufficient.

- Majority of DGUs occurred on the gun owner’s property (79.1%).

- Multiple assailants were involved in over half of the incidents ([English et al., 2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145)).

### Gun Violence Archive and Media Reports

- Reported fewer than 2,100 verified defensive gun use incidents annually (2016-2017).

- Likely underestimates due to reliance on reported and verified incidents only ([Gun Violence Archive, 2018](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org)).

---

## Effectiveness and Outcomes of Defensive Gun Use

- Studies suggest that DGUs are often effective in deterring crime, especially when guns are displayed rather than fired ([Lott, 1998](https://www.amazon.com/More-Guns-Less-Crime-Understanding/dp/0226254690)).

- However, some research indicates that using a gun in self-defense does not necessarily reduce injury risk compared to other responses like fleeing or calling police ([Hemenway & Solnick, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.029)).

- Defensive gun use is more common in home or property defense, with handguns being the most frequently used firearm ([English et al., 2021](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145)).

## Critical Analysis and Opinion

Given the wide range of estimates and methodological challenges, the true frequency of defensive gun use likely lies between the conservative NCVS estimates (~100,000 per year) and the higher self-report survey estimates (1.5 to 2.5 million per year). The 2021 National Firearms Survey’s estimate of approximately 1.67 million DGUs annually represents a robust and recent attempt to quantify this phenomenon with a large sample size and detailed questioning, though it remains subject to the limitations of self-reporting and internet survey biases.

The lower NCVS estimates are limited by their design, which excludes many defensive incidents that do not involve recognized crimes or police reports. Conversely, higher estimates may be inflated by false positives and social desirability bias. Nonetheless, the consistent finding across studies is that many defensive gun uses involve displaying or brandishing a firearm without firing, which often suffices to deter an attacker.

From a public health and policy perspective, the rarity of DGUs relative to the number of guns owned and crimes committed with firearms suggests that while guns are used defensively, these instances are not as frequent as popularly believed by some gun rights advocates. However, the potential for guns to prevent crimes and save lives cannot be dismissed outright, especially given the limitations of data collection in this area.

## Conclusion

- Defensive gun use in the United States is a complex and difficult-to-measure phenomenon with estimates ranging from about 100,000 to over 2 million incidents annually.

- Methodological differences between surveys and data sources contribute to the wide range of estimates.

- Recent large-scale surveys suggest that DGUs occur in the range of 1.5 to 2 million times per year, with most incidents involving gun display rather than firing.

- The effectiveness of DGUs varies, with some evidence supporting their role in crime deterrence, though other studies suggest alternative responses may be safer.

- Policymakers and researchers should continue to refine data collection methods to better understand the true frequency and impact of defensive gun use.
