# Report on Legislative Measures to Address Court Delays

## Introduction

The problem of court delays and backlog of cases is a critical challenge faced by judicial systems worldwide, particularly acute in India. The maxim "Justice delayed is justice denied" underscores the urgency of timely justice delivery. Legislative bodies and governments have recognized the detrimental effects of prolonged litigation on litigants, the judiciary's credibility, and societal trust. This report provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the legislative and governmental steps taken to mitigate court delays, with a focus on India, supplemented by insights from other jurisdictions such as the United States and Canada. The report draws on recent data, government initiatives, judicial reforms, and technological interventions aimed at expediting justice.

## The Problem of Court Delays and Backlog

India's judiciary is burdened with an enormous backlog of cases, with pendency crossing the 4.6 crore (46 million) mark as of December 2021, and nearing 5 crore (50 million) cases ([Chacko, 2021](https://t.co/gUtREKoSlN)). This backlog spans across subordinate courts, High Courts, and the Supreme Court. The causes of delays are multifaceted, including judicial vacancies, inadequate infrastructure, procedural complexities, frequent adjournments, and systemic inefficiencies.

The shortage of judges is particularly severe. For instance, as of November 2021, there were 404 vacancies in High Courts out of a sanctioned strength of 1,098 judges, and the subordinate courts had a sanctioned strength of 24,485 judges but faced significant vacancies ([Chacko, 2021](https://t.co/gUtREKoSlN)). The problem is exacerbated by the complexity of cases, lack of adequate infrastructure, and sometimes corruption and judicial overreach.

## Legislative and Governmental Measures in India

### 1. Increasing Judicial Strength and Filling Vacancies

A primary legislative focus has been on increasing the sanctioned strength of judges and expediting appointments. Between May 2014 and December 2021, 44 judges were appointed to the Supreme Court, 690 new judges to High Courts, and the sanctioned strength of subordinate courts increased from 19,518 in 2014 to 24,485 in 2021 ([Chacko, 2021](https://t.co/gUtREKoSlN)). However, challenges remain in filling vacancies promptly due to procedural delays and government-collegium coordination issues.

### 2. Infrastructure Development through Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)

The government has invested ₹8,709.77 crore since 1993-94 under the CSS to improve infrastructure for district and subordinate courts. This has increased court halls from 15,818 in 2014 to 20,565 in 2021 and residential units for judicial officers from 10,211 to 18,142 in the same period. The CSS has been extended till 2025-26 with a total outlay of ₹9,000 crore, including ₹5,307 crore from the central government ([Chacko, 2021](https://t.co/gUtREKoSlN)).

### 3. Adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)

ICT initiatives have been pivotal in enhancing court efficiency:

- Computerization of 18,735 district and subordinate courts as of July 2021.
- Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity to 98.7% of court complexes.
- Access to case status for over 19.56 crore cases and 15.72 crore orders/judgments online.
- Video conferencing facilities between 3,240 court complexes and 1,272 jails, facilitating virtual hearings.
- Establishment of 15 virtual courts across 11 states/UTs handling over 99 lakh cases and collecting ₹193.15 crore in fines ([Chacko, 2021](https://t.co/gUtREKoSlN)).

These technological advancements have allowed courts to continue functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly reducing delays caused by physical restrictions.

### 4. Fast Track and Special Courts

To expedite sensitive and high-priority cases, the government has established:

- 914 fast track courts for heinous crimes and crimes against women and children.
- 10 special courts for criminal cases involving elected representatives.
- A scheme for 1,023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) focusing on rape and POCSO Act cases, with 681 courts currently functional, disposing of over 64,000 cases as of October 2021 ([Chacko, 2021](https://t.co/gUtREKoSlN)).

This targeted approach aims to reduce pendency in cases that require urgent resolution.

### 5. Legislative Reforms and Procedural Simplifications

While the report does not detail specific legislative acts, it references the importance of following Law Commission recommendations (230th and 245th reports) to streamline procedures, reduce frivolous litigation, and impose strict restrictions on adjournments. The Civil Procedure Code’s Order 17 provisions have been emphasized to limit unnecessary delays.

### 6. Encouraging Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

Judicial reforms advocate for the increased use of ADR mechanisms to reduce court caseloads. Simplifying procedures and promoting mediation and arbitration help resolve disputes outside the traditional court system, thereby reducing delays.

### 7. Enhancing Judicial Working Hours and Reducing Vacations

Recommendations include increasing daily court working hours by at least half an hour and reducing court vacations to expedite case disposal. This operational change requires legislative and administrative support to implement effectively.

### 8. Transparency and Accountability Measures

Calls for greater transparency in judicial appointments, case allocation, and court functioning are part of the reform agenda to build public trust and reduce corruption-related delays.

## International Perspectives and Legislative Actions

### United States

The U.S. judiciary has also faced challenges with increasing caseloads without proportional judgeship increases. The Judicial Conference of the United States has recommended adding new judgeships to address this imbalance. For example, as of 2020, district court filings had risen by 39% since 1990, but judgeships had not increased correspondingly, leading to delays and increased expenses for litigants ([Judiciary Makes the Case for New Judgeships, 2020](https://www.uscourts.gov/news/2020/06/30/judiciary-makes-case-new-judgeships)).

Technological innovations such as the Westlaw Edge's Quick Check Judicial tool assist judges and clerks in reviewing documents more efficiently, reducing time spent on legal research ([How Legal Technology Will Help the Backlog, 2021](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/how-legal-technology-will-help-the-backlog/)).

### Canada

Canada has enacted Bill C-75 (2019) to modernize the criminal justice system and reduce delays. The reforms include:

- Streamlining bail processes.
- Creating efficient processes for minor offences.
- Reclassifying offences to free judicial resources.
- Restricting preliminary inquiries to serious offences.
- Improving jury selection transparency.
- Providing judges with enhanced case management tools ([Department of Justice Canada, 2019](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2019/doc_54559.html)).

These legislative reforms aim to make the justice system more efficient and responsive.

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite these measures, significant challenges remain:

- Judicial vacancies persist due to procedural delays and political factors.
- Infrastructure development is uneven across regions.
- Technology adoption faces hurdles such as lack of trained staff, cybersecurity threats, and insufficient funding.
- Corruption and lack of transparency continue to undermine efficiency.
- Complex procedural laws and frequent adjournments delay justice.
- The pandemic has exacerbated backlogs, especially where virtual jury trials are not feasible.

## Recommendations and Conclusion

The legislative and governmental steps taken to address court delays demonstrate a multi-pronged approach involving increasing judicial capacity, infrastructure development, ICT adoption, procedural reforms, and special courts. However, the scale of the backlog necessitates sustained and coordinated efforts.

Key recommendations include:

- Accelerate filling judicial vacancies through streamlined appointments.
- Expand and modernize court infrastructure with a focus on rural and underserved areas.
- Enhance ICT infrastructure and training for all court personnel.
- Implement strict adherence to procedural timelines and limit adjournments.
- Promote ADR mechanisms to reduce court caseloads.
- Increase judicial working hours and reduce vacations to expedite case disposal.
- Ensure transparency and accountability in judicial functioning and appointments.
- Learn from international best practices and adapt technological innovations.

In conclusion, while legislative bodies have initiated significant reforms, continuous evaluation and adaptation are essential to effectively reduce court delays and uphold the principle that justice delayed is justice denied.
