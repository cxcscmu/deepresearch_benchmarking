# Are Vaccinated People Dying More Than Unvaccinated? An In-Depth Analysis

## Introduction

The question of whether vaccinated individuals are dying at a higher rate than unvaccinated individuals has been a subject of public debate and misinformation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Various claims have circulated, some suggesting that vaccinated people die more frequently from COVID-19 than those unvaccinated, while others assert the opposite. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of this question using reliable data and scientific evaluations available up to 2025.

## Overview of Claims and Context

Several sources have made claims about death rates among vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations, often citing raw numbers without proper context. For example, a claim circulated in late 2021 that COVID-19 death rates in England were "4 to 1, vaccinated to unvaccinated," implying vaccinated individuals were dying at a higher rate ([Mic Drop Politics, 2021](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/30/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-covid-19-death-rates-england-are-highe/)). This claim was based on raw death counts: 2,822 deaths among vaccinated people versus 587 among unvaccinated during a specific three-week period. However, this comparison ignored the vastly different sizes of the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

## Importance of Rate vs. Raw Numbers

The critical statistical error in such claims is the failure to account for population size differences. England had over 90% of adults double vaccinated at the time, meaning the vaccinated group was over nine times larger than the unvaccinated group. Therefore, even a small death rate in a large population can produce more deaths in absolute numbers than a higher death rate in a smaller population.

### Death Rates per 100,000 People

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report for a three-week period in October-November 2021 provides death rates per 100,000 people:

| Group         | Deaths per 100,000 People |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Vaccinated    | 54.9                      |
| Unvaccinated  | 125.4                     |

This shows that unvaccinated individuals had more than double the death rate compared to vaccinated individuals during the period analyzed ([UK Health Security Agency, 2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-report)).

## Vaccine Effectiveness Against Death

The UKHSA report and other studies consistently show that COVID-19 vaccines offer more than 90% protection against mortality from the virus. This aligns with data from other countries, including the United States and Israel, where vaccinated individuals have significantly lower risks of severe outcomes and death.

For example, CDC data from the U.S. indicate that unvaccinated people were about 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than vaccinated people during the Delta variant period ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/09/10/1035615527/unvaccinated-people-are-11-times-more-likely-to-die-of-covid-19-than-vaccinated-new-r)).

## Confounding Factors and Biases

### Age and Health Status

Vaccinated and unvaccinated groups differ in age distribution and health status. Older and more vulnerable individuals were prioritized for vaccination, which can skew raw death numbers. Older vaccinated people may still die at higher absolute numbers due to age-related risks, but their death rates relative to their population size remain lower than unvaccinated groups.

### Time Period and Seasonal Effects

The timing of vaccination rollout and fluctuating COVID-19 incidence affect death rates. Early in 2021, most people were unvaccinated during a period of high COVID-19 mortality, while later, as vaccination coverage increased, overall death rates declined. This temporal confounding can bias comparisons if not properly adjusted ([Oke & Heneghan, 2021](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/measuring-vaccine-efficacy-from-population-data/)).

### Breakthrough Infections and Waning Immunity

Breakthrough infections occur but are generally less severe. Waning immunity and variant evolution can reduce vaccine effectiveness over time, but vaccines still substantially reduce the risk of death.

## Analysis of Contradictory Claims

Some sources, such as Alex Berenson and WND News Center, have claimed vaccinated individuals die at higher rates, particularly under age 60, citing raw death counts or misleading statistics ([Berenson, 2021](https://www.wnd.com/2021/11/vaccinated-dying-twice-rate-unvaccinated-uk/)). However, these claims often rely on flawed methodology:

- Ignoring population size differences.
- Not adjusting for age or health status.
- Using raw death counts instead of death rates.
- Failing to consider confounding factors.

Such claims have been fact-checked and rated false by reputable organizations like PolitiFact and Health Feedback ([PolitiFact, 2021](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/30/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-covid-19-death-rates-england-are-highe/); [Health Feedback, 2021](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/unvaccinated-individuals-now-account-for-the-vast-majority-of-covid-19-hospitalizations-and-deaths-in-the-u-s-according-to-available-data/)).

| Death rates per 100,000        | Higher among unvaccinated individuals                                                       |

| Confounding factors            | Age, health status, timing of vaccination, and infection rates affect death statistics      |
| Breakthrough infections        | Occur but rarely lead to death; vaccines reduce severity                                    |
| Credibility of claims          | Claims that vaccinated die more often are based on statistical errors and misinterpretation |

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive evaluation of data from England, the United States, and other countries, vaccinated people are **not** dying at a faster rate than unvaccinated people. In fact, death rates from COVID-19 are significantly higher among unvaccinated populations when accounting for population sizes and confounding factors.

Claims that suggest vaccinated individuals die more frequently are primarily based on raw death counts without proper context, leading to misleading conclusions. Reliable data consistently demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccines provide strong protection against death and severe disease.

Therefore, the assertion that vaccinated people are dying more than unvaccinated people is **false** and unsupported by the evidence.
