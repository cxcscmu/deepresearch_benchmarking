# Are Vaccinated People Dying More Than Unvaccinated? A Comprehensive Analysis

The question of whether vaccinated individuals are dying at a higher rate than unvaccinated individuals has been a topic of significant public interest and debate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based analysis of this issue, drawing upon multiple reliable sources, including government health agencies and fact-checking organizations. The goal is to clarify misconceptions, present relevant data, and offer an informed conclusion based on the best available evidence as of 2025.

## Understanding the Context: Raw Numbers vs. Death Rates

A common source of confusion arises from comparing raw numbers of deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people without accounting for the size of each group. For instance, some reports have cited that during a specific three-week period in England, more deaths occurred among vaccinated individuals than unvaccinated ones (e.g., 2,822 vaccinated deaths vs. 587 unvaccinated deaths) ([Curet, 2021](https://news.yahoo.com/fact-check-vaccinated-people-dying-143012895.html)).

However, this comparison is misleading because it fails to consider the vastly different sizes of the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. In England, well over 90% of the adult population was double vaccinated during that period, making the vaccinated cohort more than nine times larger than the unvaccinated cohort ([Weeks, 2021](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/fact-check-are-vaccinated-people-dying-at-a-faster-rate-than-unvaccinated-people/ar-AARojz4)). Therefore, even a small death rate in a large vaccinated population can produce a higher absolute number of deaths compared to a smaller unvaccinated population with a higher death rate.

## Death Rates Per 100,000 People: Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated

When death rates are adjusted for population size, data consistently show that unvaccinated individuals have significantly higher mortality rates from COVID-19 than vaccinated individuals.

### UK Data (England, October-November 2021)

| Group          | Deaths per 100,000 people |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Vaccinated     | 54.9                      |
| Unvaccinated   | 125.4                     |

This data from the UK Health Security Agency clearly indicates that unvaccinated people were dying at more than twice the rate of vaccinated people during the period analyzed ([PolitiFact, 2021](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/30/blog-posting/vaccinated-people-england-are-not-dying-faster-rat/)).

## Vaccine Effectiveness Against Mortality

The vaccines have been shown to offer more than 90% protection against mortality from COVID-19 according to the UK Health Security Agencyâ€™s reports ([Weeks, 2021](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/fact-check-are-vaccinated-people-dying-at-a-faster-rate-than-unvaccinated-people/ar-AARojz4)). This high level of protection is consistent across multiple studies and countries.

## Misinterpretations and Misinformation

Several articles and social media posts have misinterpreted or misrepresented data, leading to false claims that vaccinated people are dying at higher rates than unvaccinated people. For example:

- **Mic Drop Politics** and **The Expose** published claims that COVID death rates were 4 to 1 in favor of vaccinated individuals dying more than unvaccinated ones. These claims were based on raw death numbers without adjusting for population size and were rated false by fact-checkers ([PolitiFact, 2021](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/30/blog-posting/vaccinated-people-england-are-not-dying-faster-rat/)).

- Independent journalist Alex Berenson claimed that individuals under 60 who were vaccinated were twice as likely to die as unvaccinated individuals, based on Office of National Statistics data. However, this study looked at all-cause mortality and did not adjust for confounding factors such as age and underlying health conditions, which are critical for accurate interpretation ([Trib247, 2021](https://trib247.com/articles/uk-government-data-significantly-higher-death-rate-for-the-vaccinated-over-the-unvaccinated)).

---

## The Importance of Age and Other Confounding Factors

Age is a major confounding factor in mortality data. Older populations are more likely to be vaccinated and also have a higher baseline risk of death from any cause, including COVID-19. Therefore, comparing death rates without adjusting for age can skew results.

- Vaccinated populations tend to be older and have more underlying health conditions, which inherently increases their risk of mortality.

- Studies that adjust for age show that vaccinated individuals have significantly lower death rates than unvaccinated individuals across all age groups ([WBTV, 2021](https://www.wbtv.com/2021/08/27/report-unvaccinated-people-are-more-than-15-times-more-likely-die-covid-19/)).

---

## US Data on Vaccination and Mortality

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from the United States corroborate the findings from the UK:

| Metric                         | Vaccinated    | Unvaccinated  |
|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Likelihood to test positive     | Baseline      | 6 times higher|
| Likelihood to die from COVID-19 | Baseline      | 11 to 14 times higher |

- Unvaccinated adults were nearly six times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 14 times more likely to die from the virus compared to vaccinated individuals ([Beckers Hospital Review, 2021](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/unvaccinated-people-14-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-cdc-says.html)).

- CDC Director Rochelle Walensky noted that 99.5% of COVID-19 deaths in the US were among unvaccinated people during recent months ([Business Insider, 2021](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-coronavirus-deaths-nearly-all-among-unvaccinated-cdc-head-2021-7)).

## Breakthrough Infections and Deaths

Breakthrough infections (COVID-19 infections in vaccinated individuals) do occur, especially with variants such as Delta and Omicron. However:

- Vaccinated individuals who die from COVID-19 tend to be older or have compromised immune systems ([MSN, 2021](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/verify-claim-that-vaccinated-people-more-likely-to-die-from-delta-variant-a-classic-case-of-the-misuse-of-statistics/ar-AALTEST)).

- The death rate among vaccinated individuals remains significantly lower than that of unvaccinated individuals when adjusted for age and health status.

## Conclusion

Based on a comprehensive review of reliable data from the UK and the US, vaccinated individuals are **not** dying at a higher rate than unvaccinated individuals. The apparent higher number of deaths among vaccinated people in some reports is a statistical artifact caused by the much larger size of the vaccinated population and the older age profile of vaccinated individuals.

When death rates are properly adjusted for population size and confounding factors such as age and health status, vaccinated people have significantly lower mortality rates from COVID-19 compared to unvaccinated people. Vaccination offers strong protection against severe disease and death, reducing the risk by more than 90% in many cases.

Claims that vaccinated people are dying more than unvaccinated people are based on misinterpretations of raw data and lack critical context. Trusted health agencies and fact-checking organizations have consistently debunked these claims.

Therefore, the evidence strongly supports that COVID-19 vaccines are effective in reducing mortality and that vaccinated individuals are dying at a substantially lower rate than unvaccinated individuals.
