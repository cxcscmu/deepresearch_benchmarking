# Why Didn’t People Smile in Old Photographs? An In-Depth Analysis

The phenomenon of somber, unsmiling faces in old photographs has long intrigued both casual observers and historians alike. When examining portraits from the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is striking how rare genuine smiles are, especially compared to the ubiquitous grins in contemporary photography. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, well-structured, and evidence-based explanation for why people did not smile in old photographs, drawing on a wide range of scholarly and journalistic sources. The analysis goes beyond simplistic or popular explanations, such as long exposure times or poor dental hygiene, and explores the cultural, technological, and social factors that shaped photographic norms.

## 1. Technological Constraints: The Early Camera and Exposure Times

One of the most commonly cited reasons for the absence of smiles in early photographs is the technological limitation of long exposure times. Early photographic processes, such as the daguerreotype introduced in the 1830s and 1840s, required subjects to remain still for several seconds to minutes to avoid blurring. For example, Louis Daguerre’s 1838 photograph of a busy street required an exposure time between 10 and 15 minutes, during which moving subjects were not captured at all ([Dusty Old Thing, 2025](https://dustyoldthing.com/people-didnt-smile-old-photos/)).

Holding a smile for such extended periods was physically uncomfortable and difficult, leading photographers to encourage subjects to maintain neutral or serious expressions to minimize motion blur. A smile requires muscle tension and is less stable than a relaxed face, increasing the risk of blurring. This is illustrated in an 1860 photograph of the Free Church of Scotland moderators, where one figure appears blurry likely due to movement during the exposure ([Vox, 2015](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs)).

However, this explanation only partially accounts for the lack of smiles. By the 1850s and 1860s, exposure times had decreased significantly, often to just a few seconds under optimal conditions, and by the early 20th century, cameras like the Brownie made exposure times short enough to capture fleeting expressions ([Time, 2016](https://time.com/4568032/smile-serious-old-photos/)). Despite these technological improvements, smiles remained uncommon, suggesting that other factors were at play.

## 2. Cultural and Artistic Traditions: Influence of Painted Portraiture

A deeper and more compelling explanation lies in the cultural and artistic traditions that predated photography. Before the advent of cameras, painted portraits were the primary method of preserving a person’s likeness. These portraits typically featured stoic, solemn expressions, reflecting the social norms and aesthetic values of the time.

The tradition of serious expressions in portraiture was tied to notions of dignity, status, and decorum. Smiling was often associated with lower social classes or undesirable traits. For instance, by the 17th century in Europe, broad smiles were characteristic of the poor, the lewd, the drunk, children, and entertainers—groups not typically immortalized in formal portraits ([PetaPixel, 2013](https://petapixel.com/2013/09/23/didnt-people-smile-old-photos/)). Smiling was considered undignified and inappropriate for the upper classes, who sought to convey gravitas and respectability.

Photographers, especially in high-end studios, emulated these artistic conventions, directing subjects to adopt serious, composed expressions to produce portraits that aligned with societal expectations and the expensive nature of portraiture ([FamilySearch, 2019](https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos)). The goal was to capture the "essence" or "character" of the individual in a timeless manner, rather than a transient emotional state.

This cultural inheritance explains why even when technology allowed for smiles, they remained rare in formal portraits for decades.

## 3. Social Norms and Etiquette: Smiling as a Sign of Foolishness

Another significant factor was the social perception of smiling itself. Historical etiquette and beauty standards often discouraged revealing one’s teeth or smiling openly. According to St. Jean-Baptiste De La Salle’s 1703 treatise on decorum, showing teeth was considered improper because lips were meant to conceal them ([KnowledgeNuts, 2025](https://knowledgenuts.com/real-reason-no-one-smiled-in-old-photographs/)).

Smiling was sometimes viewed as a sign of foolishness or buffoonery. Nicholas Jeeves, in his survey of historical portraits, concluded that smiling was associated with "madness, lewdness, loudness, drunkenness," and other states considered socially undesirable ([Vox, 2015](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs)). This perception persisted well into the 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing both subjects and photographers to avoid smiles in formal images.

Mark Twain famously remarked that a photograph was a serious document and that a "silly, foolish smile" fixed forever would be "damning" to one's legacy ([KnowledgeNuts, 2025](https://knowledgenuts.com/real-reason-no-one-smiled-in-old-photographs/)). This highlights the widespread belief that smiling was not an appropriate expression for posterity.

## 4. Dental Hygiene and Health: A Minor but Real Concern

Poor dental health has often been cited as a reason for the lack of smiles in old photographs. It is true that dental care was rudimentary in the 19th century, and many people had missing, decayed, or otherwise unattractive teeth ([Time, 2016](https://time.com/4568032/smile-serious-old-photos/)). However, historians argue that since bad teeth were so common, they did not necessarily detract from a person's attractiveness or social standing at the time ([PetaPixel, 2013](https://petapixel.com/2013/09/23/didnt-people-smile-old-photos/)).

Moreover, the dental explanation does not account for the continuity of serious expressions in painted portraits, where dental issues were irrelevant. While poor dental health may have reinforced the reluctance to smile, it was not the primary cause.

## 5. The Evolution of Photographic Norms: From Formality to Spontaneity

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, photography began to evolve from a formal, expensive studio practice to a more accessible, everyday activity. Cameras became more affordable and portable, allowing candid and informal photographs where people were caught smiling or laughing naturally ([History of Yesterday, 2025](https://historyofyesterday.com/here-is-why-people-never-smiled-in-old-photos-b9201ccf393f)).

This shift paralleled changes in cultural attitudes toward smiling. As photography became democratized, the norms of portraiture loosened, and smiling became more acceptable and common. By the Edwardian period (circa 1895-1914), painted portraits also began to feature more effervescent smiles, reflecting this cultural change ([Time, 2016](https://time.com/4568032/smile-serious-old-photos/)).

By World War II, the transition was largely complete, and smiling became the standard expression in photographs.

## Conclusion

The absence of smiles in old photographs cannot be attributed to a single cause but rather to a confluence of technological, cultural, social, and health-related factors. While early photographic technology with long exposure times certainly made smiling difficult, this was only a partial explanation. The dominant reasons were rooted in cultural traditions inherited from painted portraiture, where seriousness and dignity were paramount, and social norms that viewed smiling as inappropriate or foolish.

Dental hygiene issues may have contributed to reluctance to smile but were not decisive. The gradual democratization of photography and evolving cultural attitudes eventually led to the smiling norms familiar today.

In my assessment, the cultural and social factors—particularly the influence of artistic traditions and etiquette—were the primary drivers behind the serious expressions in old photographs. Technology and dental health played supporting roles but were insufficient on their own to explain the phenomenon.
