# Why Didn't People Smile in Old Photographs?  
## A Comprehensive Historical and Cultural Analysis

### Introduction

The phenomenon of unsmiling faces in old photographs, particularly those from the 19th and early 20th centuries, has long intrigued historians, photographers, and the general public alike. Contrary to modern expectations where smiling in photos is the norm, historical images often depict subjects with solemn or neutral expressions. This report aims to provide a detailed, well-researched explanation of why people rarely smiled in early photographs, drawing on technological, cultural, artistic, and psychological factors. It also evaluates and debunks popular myths such as poor dental hygiene and long exposure times as primary causes. The report concludes with a reasoned opinion based on the synthesis of available evidence.

### 1. Technological Limitations and Their Role

#### Early Camera Exposure Times

One of the most commonly cited reasons for the lack of smiles in old photographs is the long exposure time required by early photographic technology. Early cameras, such as those using the daguerreotype process, required subjects to remain still for several minutes to avoid blurring, making it difficult to hold a smile comfortably. For example, some exposure times ranged from 5 minutes to over 30 minutes in the earliest days of photography ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos)).

However, by the 1850s and 1860s, exposure times had significantly decreased to a few seconds under optimal conditions, and by the early 20th century, cameras like the Kodak Brownie further reduced exposure times, allowing for more spontaneous expressions ([Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)). This technological improvement did not immediately lead to widespread smiling in photographs, suggesting other factors were at play.

#### Summary Table: Exposure Time vs. Smiling Prevalence

| Period          | Approximate Exposure Time | Smiling Prevalence | Notes                                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1820s-1840s     | Several minutes to 30+ min | Very rare          | Long exposure made holding smiles hard   |
| 1850s-1860s     | Few seconds               | Rare               | Smiles still uncommon despite shorter times |
| 1900s           | Fraction of a second      | Increasing         | Cameras like Brownie popularized candid photos |

### 2. Cultural and Artistic Influences

#### Influence of Painted Portraiture

Photography emerged in the 19th century heavily influenced by the traditions of painted portraiture. In painted portraits, especially during the Victorian and Edwardian eras, subjects were expected to present a dignified, stoic expression. Wide smiles were often associated with madness, drunkenness, or lower social status and were considered inappropriate for formal representation ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos); [Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)).

Portraits were meant to capture the "essence" or idealized character of a person, not fleeting emotions. This tradition carried over to photography, which was initially viewed as a new form of portraiture rather than a medium for candid moments. Even professional models and subjects often posed as if for paintings, maintaining serious expressions ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos)).

#### Victorian and Edwardian Social Norms

Victorian and Edwardian society often regarded smiling as undignified or buffoonish. According to historian Nicholas Jeeves, by the 17th century, broad smiles were socially acceptable only among the poor, the lewd, the drunk, the innocent, and entertainers. Respectable individuals avoided smiling to maintain decorum and social status ([KnowledgeNuts, n.d.](https://knowledgenuts.com/2016/10/07/the-real-reason-no-one-smiled-in-old-photographs/)).

Mark Twain, a humorist himself, famously remarked that a "silly, foolish smile" was "damning to go down to posterity," reflecting the era's serious attitude toward photographic representation ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos)).

### 3. Dental Hygiene and Appearance Concerns

A popular myth suggests that people avoided smiling because of poor dental hygiene, which was common before modern dentistry. While many individuals did have missing or decayed teeth, this was so widespread that it was not necessarily considered unattractive or embarrassing at the time ([KnowledgeNuts, n.d.](https://knowledgenuts.com/2016/10/07/the-real-reason-no-one-smiled-in-old-photographs/)).

Notably, some individuals with good teeth still refrained from smiling, indicating that dental issues alone did not dictate photographic expressions. For example, Lord Palmerston, British Prime Minister in 1855, was considered handsome despite missing several teeth ([KnowledgeNuts, n.d.](https://knowledgenuts.com/2016/10/07/the-real-reason-no-one-smiled-in-old-photographs/)).

### 4. Psychological and Social Factors

#### Photography as a Serious, Immortalizing Medium

Early photography was often viewed as a solemn occasion, akin to creating a lasting legacy or memorial. Photographs were rare, expensive, and sometimes the only visual record of a person. This seriousness discouraged frivolous expressions like smiling ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos)).

The tradition of postmortem photography, where deceased individuals were photographed to preserve their image, further underscores the medium's association with permanence and gravity ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos)).

#### Smiling as a Social Performance

Research indicates that smiling in front of a camera is not an innate human response but a learned social behavior. In the 19th century, smiling publicly was not instinctive and was often discouraged in formal settings ([Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)).

As photography became more accessible with the advent of affordable cameras like the Kodak Brownie in 1900, candid and spontaneous photos became more common, and smiling gradually gained acceptance ([Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)).

### 5. Exceptions and Cultural Variations

While the general trend was toward serious expressions, there are notable exceptions. Early photographs sometimes captured smiles, especially in candid or informal contexts. For example, Mary Dillwyn, a pioneering female photographer in mid-19th century Wales, captured intimate and smiling portraits, illustrating that smiling was not impossible or universally taboo ([The Vintage News, 2019](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/04/04/rare-photographs-1850s/)).

Moreover, anthropologist Berthold Laufer's 1904 photograph of a smiling man eating rice in China suggests cultural differences in attitudes toward smiling in photographs ([Edwards, 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/10/7/13187530/why-people-didnt-smile-old-photos)).

### 6. Transition to Smiling in Photographs

The shift toward smiling in photographs became more pronounced in the early to mid-20th century, influenced by:

- **Technological advances**: Faster cameras and shorter exposure times allowed for more natural expressions.
- **Democratization of photography**: Affordable cameras put photography in the hands of amateurs who favored candid shots ([Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)).
- **Advertising and cultural change**: Companies like Kodak promoted smiling in ads, associating photography with happiness and consumer satisfaction ([Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)).
- **Changing social norms**: Smiling became associated with warmth and friendliness rather than foolishness.

By World War II, smiling had become the standard expression in photographs ([Fabry, 2016](https://time.com/4578049/why-didnt-people-smile-in-old-photos/)).

### Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of historical, cultural, technological, and psychological factors, the primary reason people did not smile in old photographs was cultural rather than technological or physical. While early cameras' long exposure times posed some practical challenges, these were largely overcome by the mid-19th century, yet smiles remained rare due to entrenched social norms and artistic traditions inherited from painted portraiture.

Smiling was culturally associated with lower social status, frivolity, or buffoonery, and the solemnity of photography as a medium for immortalizing one's image reinforced the preference for serious expressions. The myth that people avoided smiling due to bad teeth is not supported by evidence, as dental issues were widespread and not necessarily stigmatized, and many with good teeth also refrained from smiling.

The gradual acceptance of smiling in photographs coincided with technological advances, democratization of photography, and shifts in cultural attitudes toward public expressions of emotion. Advertising and mass media played a significant role in normalizing smiling as a desirable photographic expression.

In sum, the lack of smiles in old photographs reflects a complex interplay of cultural values, artistic conventions, and evolving technology, with culture being the dominant factor shaping photographic expressions.
