# Report: How Culture Influences Deviance

## Introduction

Deviance, broadly defined as behavior that violates social norms, is a complex sociological phenomenon deeply influenced by culture. Culture shapes what is considered normal or abnormal, acceptable or unacceptable, lawful or unlawful. This report explores how culture influences deviance by examining sociological theories, anthropological insights, and empirical examples. Drawing upon multiple scholarly sources, the report provides a comprehensive understanding of the cultural determinants of deviance, the variability of deviant behavior across societies, and the implications for social order and change.

## Defining Deviance and Culture

Deviance refers to actions, beliefs, or traits that violate the established norms of a society or social group. These norms encompass formal laws and informal social expectations, which vary significantly across cultures and historical periods (Crossman, 2018). Culture, in this context, is the shared system of values, beliefs, customs, and behaviors that characterize a group or society.

The relationship between culture and deviance is reciprocal: culture defines norms, and deviance challenges or reaffirms these norms. Anthropologist Ruth Benedict emphasized that normality is culturally relative, stating that "normality is the general way a culture lives and abnormality is simply a deviance from these patterns" (Benedict, 1934). This cultural relativity means that behaviors deemed deviant in one society may be normative or even valued in another.

## Cultural Relativity of Deviance

### Variability Across Societies and Time

Deviance is not a fixed or universal concept but varies according to cultural context. For example, homosexuality has been viewed differently across cultures and epochs—praised in some societies and condemned in others (Crossman, 2018; Benedict, 1934). Similarly, public nudity is considered deviant in many Western societies but is normative in certain indigenous cultures (UKEssays, 2017).

This variability is summarized in the following table:

| Behavior           | Society A (Deviant)             | Society B (Normative)             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Homosexuality      | Condemned, criminalized         | Accepted, even honored            |
| Public Nudity      | Illegal and stigmatized         | Common and culturally accepted   |
| Tattooing/Body Piercing | Viewed as rebellious or deviant | Considered a cultural norm       |

This table illustrates how cultural norms dictate the boundaries of deviance, highlighting the importance of social context in defining deviant behavior.

### Role of Cultural History

Cultural history significantly shapes what is considered deviant. Societies develop their norms based on historical experiences, religious beliefs, and social structures, which influence responses to deviance (Bartleby, n.d.). For instance, the Siwans of North America historically expected males to engage in homosexual intercourse, whereas the Rwalar Bedouins considered homosexuality punishable by death (UKEssays, 2017).

## Theoretical Perspectives on Culture and Deviance

### Structural Functionalism and Durkheim’s Theory

Emile Durkheim, a foundational sociologist, argued that deviance is a natural and necessary part of society. He posited that deviance performs four essential functions: affirming cultural values, clarifying moral boundaries, promoting social unity, and encouraging social change (Crossman, 2018). From this perspective, culture defines norms, and deviance serves to reinforce these norms by illustrating their importance.

### Merton’s Strain Theory

Robert K. Merton’s strain theory suggests that deviance arises when individuals experience a disconnect between culturally valued goals and the means available to achieve them (Crossman, 2018). Culture sets the goals (e.g., economic success), but social structures may limit access, leading to deviant behavior as an adaptation.

### Labeling Theory

Howard Becker’s labeling theory emphasizes the social construction of deviance through labeling processes. Culture, through its norms and power structures, determines who is labeled deviant. This theory highlights how cultural biases related to race, class, or gender influence deviance labeling (Crossman, 2018).

### Conflict Theory

Conflict theory frames deviance as a product of social inequalities embedded in culture. It argues that dominant cultural groups define norms to maintain power, and deviance often reflects resistance to these imposed norms (UKEssays, 2017).

## Culture’s Influence on the Social Construction of Deviance

### Norms as Socially Created and Enforced

Sociologists stress that norms are socially created rather than inherently moral or natural. The enforcement of norms and the social reaction to deviance are culturally mediated processes (Crossman, 2018). For example, tattooing may be stigmatized in one culture but embraced in another.

### Stigma and Social Control

Stigmatization is a cultural mechanism that enforces conformity by marking certain behaviors or individuals as deviant (Bartleby, n.d.). Anthropological studies show that stigma varies across cultures and is tied to historical and social contexts.

## Empirical Examples of Cultural Influence on Deviance

### Deviance and Subcultures

Subcultures develop their own norms, which may conflict with dominant cultural norms. For example, criminal gangs have norms that deviate from mainstream society, leading to their labeling as deviant (UKEssays, 2017). Similarly, religious or ethnic minorities may be labeled deviant due to cultural differences.

### Changing Norms and Social Change

Behaviors once considered deviant can become normative as cultural values evolve. Examples include women's participation in the workforce, acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities, and body modifications (Crossman, 2018). These shifts demonstrate culture’s dynamic role in defining deviance.

## Discussion and Analysis

### Culture as a Determinant of Deviance

The evidence indicates that culture fundamentally shapes what is considered deviant by establishing norms and values. Deviance is not inherent in any behavior but is a label applied within cultural contexts. This cultural relativity challenges universal definitions of deviance and underscores the importance of understanding social and historical contexts.

### Interaction of Culture with Social Structures

Culture interacts with social structures such as class, race, and gender to influence deviance. Labeling theory and conflict theory illustrate how cultural power dynamics affect who is labeled deviant and how deviance is controlled.

### Implications for Policy and Social Understanding

Recognizing the cultural basis of deviance has practical implications for criminal justice, mental health, and social policy. It calls for culturally sensitive approaches that consider the diversity of norms and the social construction of deviance.

## Conclusion

Culture plays a central role in defining, constructing, and responding to deviance. It shapes norms, influences social reactions, and determines the boundaries of acceptable behavior. Deviance is culturally relative, varying across societies and historical periods. Sociological theories provide frameworks to understand this relationship, emphasizing the social construction of deviance and the power dynamics involved. A nuanced appreciation of culture’s influence on deviance is essential for effective social analysis and policy development.
