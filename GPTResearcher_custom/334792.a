# Report on the Rising Prices of Used Cars: Causes and Analysis

The used car market has experienced unprecedented price increases over the past few years, reaching levels that in some cases surpass the original manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of new vehicles. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the key factors driving the surge in used car prices, supported by data and expert insights from multiple trusted sources. The report also examines the interplay between new car production constraints and used car market dynamics, highlighting the central role of the global semiconductor chip shortage and other supply chain disruptions.

## 1. Overview of the Used Car Price Surge

Used car prices have risen dramatically since early 2020, with increases ranging from approximately 30% to over 40% year-over-year in various reports. For example, Consumer Reports noted that used car prices were up nearly 32% over a year earlier as of August 2021, with average listing prices reaching $31,676, a 29% increase compared to the previous year (Preston, 2021). Similarly, JD Power reported a 37% year-over-year increase in October 2021 (Szymkowski, 2021). The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key industry benchmark, indicated a 34.3% increase from the previous year as of mid-2021 (Curry, 2021).

This price escalation has turned used vehicles into appreciating assets, an unusual phenomenon in the automotive market where depreciation is typically expected. For instance, a 2019 Toyota Tacoma SR truck originally priced just under $29,000 was reported to be selling for over $33,000 in the used market two years later (ANSI, 2021).

## 2. Primary Causes of Rising Used Car Prices

### 2.1 Semiconductor Chip Shortage and New Car Production Constraints

The most significant driver of the used car price surge is the global semiconductor chip shortage, which has severely disrupted new car production worldwide. Modern vehicles rely heavily on semiconductor chips for essential electronic components, and the shortage has led to reduced manufacturing output.

- **Production Impact:** Automakers canceled chip orders early in the COVID-19 pandemic due to economic uncertainty, but as demand rebounded, chip manufacturers had shifted capacity to other industries, creating a supply-demand mismatch (Bernstein, 2022). Factories have faced labor shortages, COVID-19 outbreaks, and logistical challenges, further limiting production (D'Souza, 2020).

- **Inventory Decline:** New car inventories have dropped to about half of pre-pandemic levels, forcing consumers to turn to the used car market (Yurchenko, 2022). J.D. Power noted that 41% of new vehicles sold in July 2021 spent fewer than 20 days on dealer lots, indicating tight supply (D'Souza, 2020).

- **Ripple Effect:** The shortage of new cars reduces the number of trade-ins and part exchanges, which traditionally replenish used car inventories. This contraction in used car supply exacerbates price increases (Baggott, 2021).

### 2.2 Reduced Used Car Supply

The shortage of new cars indirectly causes a shortage of used cars. Normally, many used cars enter the market through lease returns, trade-ins, and fleet sales. However:

- **Lease Buyout Restrictions:** Some manufacturers have limited third-party lease buyouts to retain vehicles on their lots, reducing used car availability (Bernstein, 2022).

- **Rental and Fleet Companies:** Rental companies, which typically sell hundreds of thousands of vehicles monthly, have curtailed sales because they cannot replenish fleets with new vehicles (Yurchenko, 2022).

- **Lower Repossessions:** Contrary to expectations, repossessions have not increased significantly, removing another potential source of used car supply (Yurchenko, 2022).

- **Consumer Behavior:** Many owners are reluctant to sell used cars at prices lower than their original purchase price, sometimes holding out for premiums, which further tightens supply (Lame, 2021).

### 2.3 Increased Demand for Used Cars

Demand for used cars has surged due to:

- **New Car Scarcity:** Consumers unable or unwilling to wait months for new cars (due to production delays) turn to the used market (McAreavy, 2021).

- **Economic Factors:** Low borrowing rates during parts of the pandemic, reduced public transit use, and changes in consumer behavior have increased demand (D'Souza, 2020).

- **Feature Availability:** Used cars from recent model years often include in-demand technology features (e.g., Apple CarPlay, heated seats), making them attractive alternatives to new cars (Szymkowski, 2021).

- **Inflation and Investment:** Inflationary pressures have made used cars an appreciating asset, encouraging some buyers to view them as investments rather than depreciating goods (MarketRealist, 2021).

## 4. Market Dynamics and Expert Opinions

### 4.1 Supply and Demand Economics

Alex Yurchenko, Senior VP of Data Science at Black Book, succinctly explains the phenomenon as a classic case of supply and demand imbalance: elevated demand coupled with constrained supply leads to price increases. He notes that while sales figures may appear stable, the actual available inventory is rapidly depleting, intensifying competition among dealers (Yurchenko, 2022).

### 4.2 Industry Predictions

- **Short-Term Outlook:** Experts expect used car prices to continue rising through mid-2022, with some stabilization anticipated in late 2022 or early 2023 as chip production capacity improves (Yurchenko, 2022; Goldman Sachs, 2021).

- **Potential Price Correction:** KPMG and Automotive News predict a significant correction, with used car prices potentially falling 20-30% once new car supply normalizes, possibly starting in late 2022 (Ganz, 2021; Palmer, 2021).

- **Risks to Recovery:** COVID-19 variants (e.g., Omicron) pose risks of renewed factory shutdowns in chip manufacturing hubs, which could delay supply recovery and prolong high prices (Goldman Sachs, 2021).

- **Long-Term Supply Constraints:** Some analysts, such as Cox Automotive, foresee supply chain issues persisting until 2025, suggesting a gradual rather than abrupt normalization (Ganz, 2021).

### 4.3 Consumer Impact

- **Higher Trade-In Values:** Consumers trading in vehicles benefit from elevated used car values, potentially easing the purchase of newer vehicles (Donaldson, 2021).

- **Affordability Challenges:** Despite higher prices, used cars remain generally more affordable than new cars, which have also seen price increases (McAreavy, 2021).

- **Market Volatility:** The anticipated price correction could lead to depreciation risks for recent buyers who paid premiums during the peak (Palmer, 2021).

## 5. Additional Contributing Factors

### 5.1 Pandemic-Driven Supply Chain Disruptions

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered widespread supply chain disruptions beyond semiconductors, including shipping delays, labor shortages, and factory shutdowns, all contributing to reduced vehicle production and availability (Bernstein, 2022).

### 5.2 Shift in Consumer Preferences

The pandemic altered transportation habits, with reduced public transit use and increased preference for personal vehicles, further boosting demand for both new and used cars (D'Souza, 2020).

### 5.3 Manufacturer Strategies

Automakers have implemented measures such as limiting third-party lease buyouts and restricting trade-ins to manage inventory and maximize profitability during the shortage (Bernstein, 2022).

## 6. Summary and Conclusion

The surge in used car prices is primarily driven by a severe shortage of new vehicles caused by the global semiconductor chip shortage and compounded by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. This shortage reduces the flow of used cars into the market by limiting trade-ins, lease returns, and fleet sales, while simultaneously increasing consumer demand for used vehicles as alternatives to scarce new cars.

Price increases have been dramatic, with used car values rising by more than 30% to 40% year-over-year in 2021, and in some cases, used cars selling for more than their original new car MSRP. The market is characterized by tight inventory, elevated demand, and increased competition among buyers and dealers.

Looking forward, industry experts predict a potential price correction of 20-30% beginning in late 2022 or early 2023, contingent on the normalization of semiconductor supply and new car production. However, ongoing risks such as COVID-19 variants and persistent supply chain challenges may delay this recovery.

Consumers currently face higher costs but may benefit from strong trade-in values. It is advisable for buyers to remain informed about market trends and consider timing purchases carefully, given the volatility and potential for future price adjustments.
