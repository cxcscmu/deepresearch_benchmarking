# Should Schools Focus on Teens' Health? An In-Depth Analysis

The health of teenagers is a critical concern globally, given the significant physical, emotional, and psychological changes they undergo during adolescence. Schools, as primary environments for youth development, have a unique opportunity and responsibility to influence teens' health positively. This report analyzes whether schools should focus on teens' health, drawing on recent and reliable research and data. It considers physical health, mental health, preventive care, and the role of school-based programs, ultimately providing an evidence-based conclusion.

## Importance of Focusing on Teens' Health in Schools

### Physical Health and Physical Education

Physical activity is essential for adolescents' healthy development. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that youth aged 6â€“17 engage in at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity to build healthy bones, improve strength, reduce obesity risk, and promote psychological well-being ([Wagner, n.d.](https://www.hertzfurniture.com/buying-guide/healthy-environment/physical-education-benefits.html)).

However, data indicate a decline in physical education (PE) participation among teens. For example, only 24% of grade 12 students attend PE classes, down from 41% in grade 9 ([Wagner, n.d.](https://www.hertzfurniture.com/buying-guide/healthy-environment/physical-education-benefits.html)). This trend is concerning given the rise in adolescent obesity and related health issues such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Mandatory PE in schools has several documented benefits:

| **Advantages of Mandatory PE**                          | **Supporting Evidence**                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Promotes healthy habits and combats lifestyle diseases | Regular physical activity reduces risks of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease ([Anderson, n.d.](https://www.theclassroom.com/advantages-disadvantages-mandatory-pe-schools-12271285.html)) |
| Improves academic performance                           | Studies show a correlation between physical fitness and better grades, concentration, and behavior ([Wagner, n.d.](https://www.hertzfurniture.com/buying-guide/healthy-environment/physical-education-benefits.html)) |
| Builds character and social skills                      | PE fosters responsibility, teamwork, and discipline ([Prosancons, 2018](https://prosancons.com/education/pros-and-cons-of-physical-education/)) |
| Motivates school attendance                             | PE can be a primary motivator for some students to attend school ([Prosancons, 2018](https://prosancons.com/education/pros-and-cons-of-physical-education/)) |

Despite these benefits, some studies reveal that gym classes often involve limited actual physical activity (only about 16 minutes of a 45-minute class), and some students experience anxiety or decreased self-confidence due to performance-based grading ([Junior Scholastic, 2020](https://junior.scholastic.com/issues/2019-20/032320/should-teens-have-to-take-gym-every-day.html)). Thus, while PE is beneficial, its implementation requires careful design to maximize engagement and inclusivity.

### Mental Health and School Environment

Adolescent mental health is a growing concern. One in five teens experiences mental health issues, which can lead to risky behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and poor academic outcomes ([CDC, n.d.](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/healthservices/index.htm); [Lagosmums, 2019](https://lagosmums.com/why-your-teenagers-health-is-important/)).

Schools can play a pivotal role in promoting positive mental health through comprehensive, long-term interventions. Systematic reviews indicate that school-wide programs focusing on positive mental health promotion, social and emotional learning, mindfulness, and mental health literacy are effective, especially when sustained over a year or longer ([Clarke et al., 2021](https://www.eif.org.uk/report/adolescent-mental-health-a-systematic-review-on-the-effectiveness-of-school-based-interventions)).

Moreover, the psychosocial climate of schools significantly affects adolescent mental health and wellbeing. Positive relationships with peers and adults, a sense of safety, and student involvement in decision-making contribute to better health, behavior, and academic outcomes ([Kutsyuruba et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035517313794)).

| **Key School Climate Factors Impacting Mental Health** | **Impact on Adolescents**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Positive relationships with peers and adults           | Improve health, academic, and behavioral outcomes                                                           |
| Perceived school safety                                 | Reduces antisocial behavior and promotes engagement                                                         |
| Student involvement in decision-making                 | Enhances school connectedness and wellbeing                                                                 |
| Comprehensive mental health programs                    | Promote positive mental health and prevent difficulties                                                      |

Schools are uniquely positioned to provide mental health services or referrals, fostering environments that support emotional wellbeing and resilience ([CDC, n.d.](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/healthservices/index.htm)).

### Preventive Health Services and Access

Adolescents often underutilize preventive health services, including vaccinations, screenings, and sexual health services, despite official guidelines recommending these ([CDC, n.d.](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/healthservices/index.htm)). Schools can bridge this gap by offering on-site services or facilitating referrals to youth-friendly providers.

Preventive care is critical to early identification of health issues and reducing long-term risks. For example, teens are disproportionately affected by HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, yet testing rates remain low ([CDC, n.d.](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/healthservices/index.htm)).

Schools can normalize preventive care by integrating health education and services, thereby improving community health outcomes and reducing disparities, especially for disadvantaged youth ([Atkins et al., 2017](https://ukdiss.com/examples/adolescent-development-social-impacts.php)).

## Challenges and Considerations

While the benefits of focusing on teens' health in schools are clear, several challenges must be acknowledged:

| **Challenges**                                         | **Details**                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited time and resources                             | Schools face pressure to prioritize academic subjects, sometimes reducing time for PE and health programs ([Junior Scholastic, 2020](https://junior.scholastic.com/issues/2019-20/032320/should-teens-have-to-take-gym-every-day.html)) |
| Varied student needs and inclusivity                  | Disabled students or those with non-sporting talents may feel disadvantaged in PE programs ([Prosancons, 2018](https://prosancons.com/education/pros-and-cons-of-physical-education/)) |
| Risk of injury and anxiety                             | Physical activities carry injury risks; some students experience anxiety or lowered self-esteem in PE ([Junior Scholastic, 2020](https://junior.scholastic.com/issues/2019-20/032320/should-teens-have-to-take-gym-every-day.html)) |
| Financial costs                                       | Additional costs for sports gear and activity fees may burden students and families ([Prosancons, 2018](https://prosancons.com/education/pros-and-cons-of-physical-education/)) |
| Implementation quality                                | Simply increasing PE time without improving program quality may not yield health benefits ([Public School Review, n.d.](https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-gym-class-in-public-schools)) |

Addressing these challenges requires thoughtful program design, adequate funding, teacher training, and inclusive policies that accommodate diverse student needs.

## Recommendations for Schools

To maximize the benefits of focusing on teens' health, schools should adopt a holistic and evidence-based approach:

1. **Integrate Physical and Mental Health Programs:** Combine PE with mental health promotion, social-emotional learning, and mindfulness to support overall wellbeing ([Clarke et al., 2021](https://www.eif.org.uk/report/adolescent-mental-health-a-systematic-review-on-the-effectiveness-of-school-based-interventions)).

2. **Ensure Quality and Inclusivity in PE:** Design PE curricula that engage all students, including those with disabilities or non-athletic interests, and avoid performance-based grading that harms self-esteem ([Junior Scholastic, 2020](https://junior.scholastic.com/issues/2019-20/032320/should-teens-have-to-take-gym-every-day.html)).

3. **Provide Preventive Health Services On-Site:** Expand school-based health centers and collaborate with community providers to offer vaccinations, screenings, and sexual health services ([CDC, n.d.](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/healthservices/index.htm)).

4. **Create a Positive School Climate:** Foster safe, supportive environments with strong relationships and student participation in decision-making ([Kutsyuruba et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035517313794)).

5. **Educate on Nutrition and Healthy Habits:** While nutrition education is complex, schools should provide basic guidance to help students make informed choices, considering diverse dietary needs ([Debate.org, n.d.](https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-nutrition-be-a-mandatory-part-of-education)).

6. **Monitor and Evaluate Programs:** Use data to assess the effectiveness of health initiatives and adjust strategies accordingly ([Clarke et al., 2021](https://www.eif.org.uk/report/adolescent-mental-health-a-systematic-review-on-the-effectiveness-of-school-based-interventions)).

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly supports that schools should focus on teens' health as a fundamental component of education. Physical education, mental health promotion, preventive services, and a positive school climate collectively contribute to healthier, more engaged, and academically successful adolescents. While challenges exist, they are surmountable with intentional, inclusive, and well-resourced strategies.

Given the rising rates of obesity, mental health issues, and risky behaviors among teens, schools have both an opportunity and an obligation to act. Prioritizing teen health within schools not only benefits individual students but also has long-term societal advantages by fostering healthier adult populations.
