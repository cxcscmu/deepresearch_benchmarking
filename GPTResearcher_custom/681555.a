# Report: Why Are There So Few Women in Congress?

## Introduction

Despite significant social progress and increased participation of women in the workforce and politics, women remain substantially underrepresented in the United States Congress. As of recent years, women hold approximately 23.7% of Congressional seats, a figure that, while historic, still reflects a considerable gender gap compared to men ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)). This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind the persistent underrepresentation of women in Congress, drawing on scholarly research, empirical data, and political analyses. It aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of the structural, cultural, and political barriers that contribute to this disparity.

## Historical and Structural Barriers

### Incumbency Advantage and Electoral System

One of the most significant structural barriers is the incumbency advantage. Historically, men have dominated Congressional seats, and incumbents enjoy substantial advantages in name recognition, fundraising, and party support, making it difficult for new candidates, especially women, to break through ([Flock, 2012](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2012/06/08/why-there-are-so-few-women-in-congress)). The single-member district electoral system in the U.S. further exacerbates this issue by limiting opportunities for new entrants, as most districts have only one representative, reducing the number of open seats available for women to contest ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)).

### Lack of Gender Quotas and Proportional Representation

Unlike many industrialized democracies, the U.S. lacks formal gender quotas or proportional representation systems that have been effective elsewhere in increasing women's political representation. Around half of the world's countries use some form of gender quota, which has been shown to double women's representation in legislatures on average ([Zhou, 2019](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805382/women-congress-gender-gap-quota-voting-reform)). The absence of such mechanisms in the U.S. means that women must compete in a system that does not actively promote gender parity.

### Party Dynamics and Polarization

Political parties in the U.S. play a crucial gatekeeping role in candidate recruitment and support. Research indicates that Democratic women have seen increased representation due to party support structures like EMILY’s List, which funds pro-choice Democratic women candidates. Conversely, Republican women face greater challenges due to less party infrastructure supporting female candidates and a party culture less focused on identity politics ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772); [Zhou, 2019](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805382/women-congress-gender-gap-quota-voting-reform)).

The increasing polarization of parties has also marginalized moderate candidates, disproportionately affecting Republican women who traditionally come from the party's moderate wing ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)).

## Societal and Cultural Factors

### Gender Stereotypes and Voter Bias

Gender stereotypes remain a significant obstacle. Women candidates are often perceived through the lens of traditional feminine stereotypes—caring, emotional, and compassionate—which can conflict with the masculine traits (toughness, decisiveness) culturally associated with political leadership ([Bauer, 2015](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/gender-stereotypes-female-political-candidates/)). Experimental studies show that voters do not automatically apply these stereotypes but do so when feminine traits are explicitly highlighted in campaigns or media coverage, which can reduce support for female candidates by nearly 15% ([Bauer, 2015](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/gender-stereotypes-female-political-candidates/)).

Moreover, economic anxiety can activate latent gender biases, with male voters particularly less likely to support female candidates during times of perceived economic weakness due to stereotypes about women's capabilities on "masculine" issues like the economy and defense ([Lei & Bodenhausen, 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/asap.12144)).

### Media Coverage and Issue Framing

Media coverage tends to focus disproportionately on male politicians and often frames women candidates around gendered issues such as abortion and education rather than economic or defense matters. This skewed coverage reinforces stereotypes and limits women's perceived competence in key policy areas ([Flock, 2012](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2012/06/08/why-there-are-so-few-women-in-congress)).

### Family Responsibilities and Political Ambition

Women often face greater family and caregiving responsibilities, which affect the timing and feasibility of running for office. Many women run later in life, often after child-rearing years, which may limit their political career length and opportunities ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)). The "double shift" of paid work and household labor creates additional barriers to political ambition and campaign involvement ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)).

## Intersectionality and Minority Women

Women of color face compounded challenges due to intersecting racial and gender biases. While women of color have made historic gains, their representation remains disproportionately low, especially in the Senate ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)). Structural barriers such as racially polarized voting, districting, and limited access to party networks and funding further hinder their political advancement.

## Concrete Opinion and Recommendations

The underrepresentation of women in Congress is primarily a product of entrenched structural and cultural barriers rather than a lack of capability or voter willingness. The U.S. political system’s design—particularly its single-member districts and absence of gender quotas—creates a high threshold for women to enter and succeed in politics. Additionally, party dynamics and societal stereotypes continue to disadvantage women candidates, especially Republican women and women of color.

To accelerate progress toward gender parity, the U.S. should consider adopting a combination of reforms:

1. **Implementation of Gender Quotas or Reserved Seats:** Drawing from international examples, legal or voluntary party quotas could significantly increase women’s representation. While constitutional amendments may be challenging, parties could self-impose recruitment targets to ensure more women run in viable districts ([Zhou, 2019](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805382/women-congress-gender-gap-quota-voting-reform)).

2. **Public Financing of Campaigns:** Expanding public financing would reduce reliance on PACs and big donors who historically underfund women candidates, leveling the playing field ([Zhou, 2019](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805382/women-congress-gender-gap-quota-voting-reform)).

3. **Ranked-Choice Voting:** This voting reform encourages broader candidate support and reduces the “electability” concern that often disadvantages women, leading to more diverse representation ([Zhou, 2019](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/14/20805382/women-congress-gender-gap-quota-voting-reform)).

4. **Addressing Gender Stereotypes in Campaigns and Media:** Women candidates should strategically avoid emphasizing feminine stereotypes that activate voter bias. Media outlets should strive for balanced coverage that highlights women’s competence across all policy areas ([Bauer, 2015](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/gender-stereotypes-female-political-candidates/)).

5. **Support for Women of Color:** Targeted efforts to recruit, fund, and support women of color candidates are essential to address intersectional barriers ([Sanbonmatsu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/daed_a_01772)).

6. **Cultural Change and Voter Education:** Long-term progress requires changing societal attitudes about gender roles in leadership and politics, including educating voters about unconscious biases and the importance of descriptive representation.

## Conclusion

The persistent underrepresentation of women in the U.S. Congress is a complex issue rooted in structural electoral mechanisms, party dynamics, societal stereotypes, and intersectional challenges. While progress has been made, especially among Democratic women, achieving gender parity will require concerted reforms and cultural shifts. The evidence suggests that with political will and strategic interventions, the U.S. could see significant improvements in women’s representation within the next decade.
