# Report on Why Adult Children Stop Talking to Parents

## Introduction

Adult child estrangement—when grown children cease communication with their parents—is a complex and increasingly recognized social phenomenon. This report synthesizes findings from recent empirical research, psychological analyses, and personal narratives to provide a comprehensive understanding of why adult children stop talking to their parents. The report draws primarily on a large-scale study conducted by The Ohio State University and insights from psychological experts and affected individuals, integrating quantitative data with qualitative perspectives. The goal is to present an objective, in-depth analysis of the causes, dynamics, and implications of adult child estrangement.

## Overview of Estrangement Prevalence and Context

A 2021 study by Schoppe-Sullivan et al. surveyed 1,035 mothers estranged from one or more adult children, finding that over half (56.8%) had no contact with their children for more than a year. The sample indicated estrangement from daughters (52%) and sons (45%) almost equally, with most mothers being divorced or in new partnerships ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)).

Estrangement often emerges in the mid-twenties of adult children and can last several years, averaging five to seven years according to additional research ([McCulloch, 2021](https://springsofgrace.church/2011/09/exposing-major-blind-spots-of-homeschoolers-by-reb-bradley/)).

## Key Causes of Adult Child Estrangement

### 1. Perceived External Influences

A dominant theme among mothers surveyed is the belief that external parties—such as ex-husbands or the child's spouse/partner—have turned their children against them. Nearly 80% of mothers attributed estrangement to such family members ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)). This externalization reflects a perception that the estrangement is not primarily due to the mothers' actions but due to interference by others.

### 2. Children's Mental Health and Addiction Issues

Approximately 62.4% of mothers identified their children's mental health struggles—including anxiety, depression, addiction, or alcoholism—as contributing factors to estrangement ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)). This association was newly highlighted by the anonymous survey format, which may have encouraged more candid responses.

### 3. Value Conflicts and Personality Clashes

Disagreements over values, including politics and parenting styles, were cited by about 35.7% of mothers. Surprisingly, fundamental issues such as sexual orientation or religion were less frequently mentioned. Adult children, however, often attribute estrangement to emotional abuse, conflicting role expectations, and personality clashes ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)).

### 4. Parenting Style and "Anxious Parenting"

Anxious parenting—characterized by overprotection, control, and micro-management (e.g., "helicopter" or "lawn mower" parenting)—is a significant cause of estrangement. Such parenting can stifle children's autonomy, leading to resentment and a desire for distance ([McCulloch, 2021](https://springsofgrace.church/2011/09/exposing-major-blind-spots-of-homeschoolers-by-reb-bradley/); [Coleman, 2020](https://www.theatlantic.com)).

### 5. Emotional and Physical Abuse

Adult children frequently cite emotional abuse and neglect as reasons for estrangement. These experiences may not be acknowledged by parents, creating a disconnect in perceptions. The failure of parents to recognize or validate these complaints often exacerbates estrangement ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)).

### 6. Generational and Societal Changes

Changing societal norms influence perceptions of parenting and family relationships. Behaviors once considered acceptable may now be viewed as abusive or neglectful. Younger generations increasingly assert the right to sever harmful relationships, including with parents, challenging older views of family permanence ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)).

### 7. Parental Fault and Accountability

Only 18% of mothers acknowledged their own role in estrangement, while adult children rarely accept blame. This mutual reluctance to take responsibility complicates reconciliation efforts ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)).

### 8. Abuse and Neglect Histories

Personal accounts and qualitative data reveal that abuse—physical, emotional, or psychological—is a common underlying cause. Adult children often distance themselves to protect their well-being ([Jess B., 2022](https://wehavekids.com/family-relationships/When-Your-Adult-Child-Stops-Talking-to-You-5-Things-They-Want-You-to-Know)).

## Discrepancies Between Parent and Child Perspectives

There is a significant disconnect between parents' and adult children's views on estrangement causes. Parents often blame external influences or mental health issues, while children emphasize emotional abuse and unmet expectations. This divergence impedes mutual understanding and reconciliation ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198)).

## Psychological and Emotional Dynamics

Estrangement is painful for both parties. Adult children experience a void and mourn the lost relationship, just as parents do. Children often do not take the decision lightly; it follows years of failed communication and attempts at resolution ([Jess B., 2022](https://wehavekids.com/family-relationships/When-Your-Adult-Child-Stops-Talking-to-You-5-Things-They-Want-You-to-Know)).

Anxiety and control issues in parenting can exacerbate estrangement, as children seek autonomy and relief from overbearing behaviors ([McCulloch, 2021](https://springsofgrace.church/2011/09/exposing-major-blind-spots-of-homeschoolers-by-reb-bradley/)).

## Societal and Cultural Factors

The erosion of traditional family structures, increased divorce rates, and decreased community bonds contribute to estrangement. The shift from non-voluntary, permanent family relationships to conditional ones based on well-being reflects broader cultural changes ([Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/cfp0000198); [Coleman, 2020](https://www.theatlantic.com)).

## Implications for Reconciliation

The divergent narratives between parents and adult children pose a major barrier to healing. Parents who wish to reconcile may need to adopt humility, validate their children's experiences, and avoid defensiveness. Psychologists recommend parents listen patiently and accept their children's perspectives, even if they conflict with their own memories ([McCulloch, 2021](https://springsofgrace.church/2011/09/exposing-major-blind-spots-of-homeschoolers-by-reb-bradley/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Adult child estrangement arises from a complex interplay of factors including external family dynamics, mental health challenges, value conflicts, parenting styles, and historical abuse. The phenomenon reflects broader societal shifts in family expectations and individual autonomy. The evidence indicates that while parents often externalize blame, adult children frequently cite emotional harm and unmet needs as primary reasons for cutting ties.

Effective reconciliation requires bridging the gap between these differing perspectives through humility, empathy, and open communication. Parents must recognize the validity of their adult children's experiences and be willing to change. Without this, estrangement is likely to persist.

This report underscores the importance of nuanced understanding and tailored clinical approaches to support families navigating estrangement.
