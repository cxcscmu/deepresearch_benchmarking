## 1. Early U.S. Foreign Policy: Isolationism and Non-Intervention (18th - 19th Century)

### 1.1 Foundations of Isolationism

The United States' initial foreign policy was heavily influenced by the advice of founding leaders such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Washington's Farewell Address (1796) cautioned against "entangling alliances," advocating for limited political connections with foreign nations while promoting commercial relations. Jefferson echoed this sentiment in his inaugural address (1801), emphasizing "peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none" ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

### 1.2 Characteristics and Practice

Throughout the 19th century, U.S. foreign policy was characterized by:

- **Non-interventionism**: Avoidance of involvement in European conflicts and alliances.
- **Economic engagement**: Focus on trade without political entanglements.
- **Limited territorial expansion**: Except for continental expansion and the acquisition of territories such as Louisiana.

This approach was maintained even when confronted with international requests for intervention, such as declining to protest Tsar Alexander II's suppression of the Polish uprising in 1863 ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

## 2. Late 19th Century Shift: Emergence of Expansionism and Imperialism

### 2.1 The Spanish-American War as a Turning Point

The late 1800s marked a critical shift from isolationism to expansionism. The Spanish-American War (1898) symbolized the United States' emergence as an imperial power, acquiring overseas territories such as the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. This war accelerated policies promoting overseas investments and marked the U.S. transition to a global power ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

### 2.2 Economic and Military Expansion

- The U.S. government increasingly relied on military and economic power to pursue foreign policy goals.
- The Great White Fleet (early 1900s) demonstrated American naval strength globally.
- The Progressive Era reforms (late 19th - early 20th century) paralleled increased U.S. involvement abroad, reflecting a more activist regulatory state and international posture.

## 3. Early to Mid-20th Century: From Isolationism to Interventionism

### 3.1 World War I and the League of Nations

Despite entering World War I in 1917, the U.S. maintained a degree of independence, with American forces operating separately from European allies. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points proposed the League of Nations to prevent future conflicts, but the U.S. Senate rejected joining the League, reflecting persistent isolationist sentiment ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

### 3.2 Interwar Period and Non-Interventionism

- The U.S. enacted Neutrality Acts in the 1930s to avoid entanglement in foreign wars.
- The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) symbolized a commitment to peace but lacked enforcement mechanisms.
- Economic focus shifted inward during the Great Depression, reducing international engagement.

### 3.3 World War II and the Shift to Interventionism

- Initially neutral, the U.S. gradually supported Allies through programs like "Cash and Carry" and Lend-Lease.
- The attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) ended isolationism, leading to full military engagement.
- Post-war, the U.S. emerged as a global leader, abandoning isolationism for active international involvement ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

## 4. Cold War Era: Containment and Global Leadership

### 4.1 The Doctrine of Containment

- Proposed by diplomat George F. Kennan in 1946, containment aimed to prevent the spread of communism.
- The Truman Doctrine (1947) pledged support to nations resisting communism.
- NATO (1949) established a collective defense pact among Western nations.

### 4.2 Interventionism and Proxy Conflicts

- U.S. involvement in Korea, Vietnam, and support for anti-communist regimes exemplified interventionism.
- The policy of containment was both military and ideological, shaping U.S. foreign engagements.

### 4.3 Détente and Human Rights Focus

- The 1970s saw a relaxation of tensions (détente) with the USSR, including arms control treaties (SALT I, ABM Treaty).
- The Helsinki Accords emphasized human rights, though tensions over internal affairs persisted.
- Détente ended with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979), leading to renewed Cold War tensions ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

## 5. Post-Cold War Era: Unipolarity and New Challenges

### 5.1 The New World Order

- With the Soviet Union's collapse (1991), the U.S. became the sole superpower.
- Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton promoted multilateralism and democratization.
- The Gulf War (1991) demonstrated coalition-building and regional intervention.

### 5.2 Shifts in Military and Economic Focus

- Military spending and foreign policy budgets were scaled back during the 1990s.
- Emphasis on domestic economic prosperity under Clinton, with a focus on expanding markets and humanitarian goals.

### 5.3 Emerging Multipolarity

- Rising powers such as China, India, Brazil, and a united Europe challenged U.S. dominance.
- Common concerns among major powers included free trade, economic growth, terrorism prevention, and nuclear non-proliferation ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

## 6. 21st Century: The War on Terror and Contemporary Foreign Policy

### 6.1 The War on Terror

- Initiated after the September 11, 2001 attacks, targeting al-Qaeda and affiliated groups.
- Major military operations included Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq).
- The U.S. pursued regime change in Iraq despite international opposition, linking it to counter-terrorism efforts ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

### 6.2 Bipartisan Consensus and Domestic-First Bias

- Recent presidents (Obama, Trump, Biden) share a domestic-first approach, reacting to perceived overreach in Iraq and Afghanistan.
- There is a growing skepticism of "forever wars," free trade, and extensive foreign interventions.
- Despite rhetorical differences, actual foreign policy actions show continuity, such as the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and unilateral decisions ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/29/1041219867/how-has-u-s-foreign-policy-changed-over-the-years-the-answer-may-surprise-you)).

### 6.3 Challenges in Policy Coherence

- U.S. policy towards China is described as inconsistent, with debates over regime change, human rights, and economic competition.
- Efforts to address global issues like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics are seen as insufficient relative to the challenges ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/29/1041219867/how-has-u-s-foreign-policy-changed-over-the-years-the-answer-may-surprise-you)).

## 7. Impact of Globalization and Non-State Actors on Foreign Policy

### 7.1 Globalization's Influence

- Globalization has intensified cross-border interactions, making isolationism untenable.
- States are increasingly interdependent economically, politically, and socially.
- Traditional state-centric foreign policy is challenged by transnational issues like climate change, terrorism, and pandemics ([UKEssays, 2018](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-globalization-on-foreign-policy.php?vref=1)).

### 7.2 Rise of Non-State Actors

- Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations, and other non-state actors play significant roles in shaping foreign policy.
- IGOs like the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, and WTO facilitate cooperation but require states to cede some sovereignty.
- NGOs influence human rights, environmental policies, and humanitarian aid but face challenges in accountability and influence.
- The private sector contributes to sustainable development and economic interdependence ([Stengel & Baumann, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.456)).

### 7.3 Hybrid Governance and Policy Complexity

- Foreign policy is increasingly made within hybrid governance networks involving states and non-state actors.
- This complexity requires new analytical frameworks beyond traditional state-centric theories.
- Democratic legitimacy and transparency in foreign policymaking are ongoing concerns ([Stengel & Baumann, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.456)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evolution of U.S. foreign policy reflects a dynamic interplay between domestic priorities, global power shifts, and emerging international challenges. Initially grounded in isolationism to protect a nascent nation, U.S. policy shifted towards expansionism and imperialism in the late 19th century, marking its rise as a global power. The 20th century saw oscillations between isolationism and interventionism, culminating in a sustained global leadership role during and after World War II and throughout the Cold War.

The post-Cold War era introduced a unipolar world with the U.S. as the predominant power, promoting multilateralism and democratization. However, the 21st century has witnessed a more cautious, domestically focused approach, influenced by war fatigue and skepticism of globalization's benefits. The rise of non-state actors and the complexities of globalization have further complicated foreign policy formulation and execution.

In my assessment, while U.S. foreign policy has adapted to changing circumstances, it currently faces challenges of coherence and strategic clarity, especially regarding China and global issues like climate change and pandemics. The bipartisan domestic-first bias limits proactive global leadership, potentially undermining long-term U.S. interests. To navigate the multipolar and interconnected world effectively, the U.S. must balance domestic concerns with renewed international engagement, leveraging multilateral institutions and embracing the role of non-state actors in a hybrid governance framework.
