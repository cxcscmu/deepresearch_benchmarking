# Report on the Causes of Anti-Science Attitudes

## Introduction

Anti-science attitudes, characterized by skepticism or outright rejection of scientific consensus and methods, have become increasingly prominent in public discourse. These attitudes manifest in various domains, including vaccination, climate change, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and other scientific issues. Understanding the causes of anti-science attitudes is critical for developing effective communication strategies and policy interventions to foster trust in science and evidence-based decision-making. This report synthesizes findings from psychological, sociological, political, and historical perspectives to provide a comprehensive analysis of the causes of anti-science attitudes.

## Psychological Roots of Anti-Science Attitudes

### Motivated Reasoning and Psychological Needs

Research indicates that anti-science attitudes are not primarily due to a lack of scientific literacy but are deeply rooted in psychological and emotional factors. Hornsey et al. (2018) conducted a 24-nation study revealing that antivaccination attitudes correlate strongly with conspiratorial thinking, reactance (resistance to perceived threats to freedom), disgust sensitivity (especially towards blood and needles), and individualistic/hierarchical worldviews. Demographic variables, including education, accounted for negligible variance in these attitudes ([Hornsey et al., 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29389158/)).

Hornsey (2020) further elaborates a tree metaphor where observable anti-science beliefs are the branches supported by deep emotional and psychological roots such as ideology, vested interests, conspiracist worldview, fears, personal and social identities. This model suggests that direct factual corrections often fail because they address only the branches, not the underlying roots ([Hornsey, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721420969364)).

### Ideology and Identity

Ideological commitments strongly influence the acceptance or rejection of scientific findings. For example, conservative political ideology is linked to climate change skepticism, while religious orthodoxy predicts vaccine skepticism. Moreover, political conservatives with higher education levels may become more entrenched in rejecting climate science, highlighting the role of motivated cognition rather than ignorance ([Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721416654436)).

Social and personal identities also play a role. People may reject science to maintain group membership or to affirm a self-concept as being "in the know," especially among conspiracy believers ([Hornsey, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721420969364)).

### Conspiracist Worldview

Belief in conspiracy theories is a significant predictor of anti-science attitudes. Individuals with a conspiracist worldview perceive secret plots by powerful actors as explanations for events, making them more likely to reject scientific consensus, such as vaccine safety or climate change ([Van Prooijen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2021.06.013)).

## Sociopolitical Factors

### Political Ideology and Polarization

Political conservatism, especially in the United States, is associated with skepticism toward climate science and, to a lesser extent, other scientific domains. However, skepticism about vaccines and GMOs does not show a consistent political pattern, indicating that anti-science attitudes are heterogeneous and context-dependent ([Rutjens et al., 2018](https://theconversation.com/who-are-you-calling-anti-science-how-science-serves-social-and-political-agendas-81307)).

Populist movements, both left and right, often distrust elites, including scientific institutions, which fuels anti-science sentiments. The right-wing populist distrust tends to involve conspiracy theories, while left-wing populist skepticism often focuses on the ethical and social implications of science, such as concerns about corporate influence or loss of democratic deliberation ([Durant, 2017](https://theconversation.com/who-are-you-calling-anti-science-how-science-serves-social-and-political-agendas-81307)).

### Distrust in Institutions

Distrust in societal institutions, including scientific bodies, government, and media, undermines public confidence in science. Van Prooijen et al. (2022) argue that institutional distrust and conspiracy beliefs deteriorate social relationships by reducing perceived safety and undermining group norms, leading to decreased cooperation and increased polarization ([Van Prooijen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2021.06.013)).

Historical and contemporary events that reveal corruption or misconduct in institutions exacerbate this distrust, making it challenging to rebuild confidence ([Contessa, 2022](https://theconversation.com/the-reasons-for-science-skepticism-can-be-complex-and-founded-on-real-concerns-174683)).

## Historical and Cultural Context

Anti-science attitudes have historical roots in cultural critiques of science as a dehumanizing or morally corrupting force. Since the early 20th century, critics from various political and religious backgrounds have argued that science undermines traditional values, moral freedom, and human dignity. These critiques intensified during the post-World War II era, coinciding with the rise of welfare liberalism and technocratic governance, which some perceived as alienating and oppressive ([Jewett, 2020](https://bostonreview.net/science-nature/andrew-jewett-how-americans-came-distrust-science)).

The environmental movement, while addressing legitimate concerns, has sometimes been associated with anti-science rhetoric, particularly in opposition to nuclear power and pesticides like DDT. These movements have contributed to a broader cultural skepticism toward scientific and technological progress ([Merrill, 1973](https://archive.ph/20120913124109/https://reason.com/archives/1973/01/01/the-new-anti-science-movement)).

## Implications for Science Communication and Policy

Given the multifaceted causes of anti-science attitudes, simple information campaigns focusing solely on increasing scientific literacy are insufficient and may be counterproductive. Effective strategies should:

- Address underlying psychological needs and emotional concerns, such as fears and identity threats.
- Build trust in institutions through transparency, accountability, and engagement with diverse communities.
- Recognize ideological and cultural values, tailoring communication to resonate with different worldviews.
- Counteract misinformation and conspiracy theories by promoting critical thinking and media literacy.
- Foster inclusive dialogue that respects concerns and avoids condescension or dismissal ([Hornsey, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721420969364); [Contessa, 2022](https://theconversation.com/the-reasons-for-science-skepticism-can-be-complex-and-founded-on-real-concerns-174683)).

## Conclusion

Anti-science attitudes arise from a complex interplay of psychological, ideological, sociopolitical, and cultural factors. Motivated reasoning driven by identity, fear, and conspiratorial thinking plays a central role, often overshadowing deficits in scientific knowledge. Political ideology influences skepticism in some domains, notably climate change, but is less predictive in others. Distrust in institutions and historical critiques of science as dehumanizing further erode public confidence. Addressing these attitudes requires nuanced, empathetic, and multifaceted approaches that go beyond mere dissemination of facts.
