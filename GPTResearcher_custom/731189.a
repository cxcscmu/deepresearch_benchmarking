# Causes of Anti-Science Attitudes: An In-Depth Analysis

Anti-science attitudes, broadly defined as opposition to or rejection of science and scientific methods, have become a significant social and political phenomenon in recent decades. Understanding the causes of these attitudes is crucial, as science remains a key resource in shaping social and political decisions that affect public health, environmental policy, and technological progress. This report synthesizes insights from a range of scholarly and journalistic sources to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the multifaceted causes of anti-science attitudes. The analysis highlights the complexity of the phenomenon, which cannot be reduced to simple explanations such as ignorance or political ideology alone.

## Defining Anti-Science Attitudes

Anti-science attitudes encompass a spectrum of beliefs and behaviors that reject scientific findings, methods, or authority. Merriam-Webster defines anti-science as "a set or system of attitudes and beliefs that are opposed to or reject science and scientific methods and principles" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.). However, the reality is more complex: skepticism toward science can range from questioning specific scientific claims to broader distrust of scientific institutions or the role of science in society.

## Political and Ideological Dimensions

### Political Ideology and Distrust

Political ideology plays a significant but not exclusive role in shaping anti-science attitudes. Research shows that political conservatives, particularly in the United States, have exhibited increasing distrust of science since the 1970s, especially regarding climate change (Gauchat, 2012; Aeon, 2023). However, this distrust is not uniform across all scientific topics. For example, skepticism about genetic modification and vaccines does not correlate strongly with political ideology but is influenced by other factors such as religiosity and scientific literacy (Aeon, 2023).

The political right’s anti-science attitudes often stem from concerns about science's ability to discover causal connections and its implications for market regulation and traditional values. Small-state conservatives worry that science, especially regulatory science, expands government control and displaces traditional social norms (Durant, 2017). On the other hand, the political left tends to be more concerned about the application of science, fearing capitalist profiteering and the displacement of deliberative politics by technical solutions (Durant, 2017).

### Populism and Distrust of Elites

Populist movements on both the left and right share a distrust of elites, which extends to scientific experts perceived as part of an elite class. This distrust can lead to suspicion of scientific claims that appear distant from the lived experiences of populist constituencies. For example, populist right figures may promote conspiracy theories, while populist left concerns often focus on the social implications of science (Durant, 2017).

### Sociological Factors

Sociologist Gordon Gauchat identified four dimensions associated with anti-science attitudes on the political right: religiosity, authoritarianism, distrust of government, and surprisingly, scientific literacy (Gauchat, 2012). This suggests that even scientifically literate individuals may reject scientific consensus if it conflicts with their ideological or social identities.

## Religious and Moral Influences

Religiosity is a significant predictor of skepticism toward certain scientific claims, particularly vaccination. Religious orthodoxy often correlates with moral concerns about the naturalness of medical interventions, leading to vaccine hesitancy (Aeon, 2023). Moral values also influence attitudes toward science, as individuals may reject scientific findings that conflict with deeply held beliefs about society and nature.

## Knowledge and Scientific Literacy

Scientific literacy influences skepticism but is not a straightforward predictor. Lower scientific knowledge correlates with greater skepticism about genetically modified foods, but higher scientific literacy does not necessarily inoculate individuals against all forms of anti-science attitudes (Aeon, 2023; Psychology Today, 2016). Moreover, skepticism can persist even among educated individuals when scientific claims conflict with core beliefs (Psychology Today, 2016).

## Social and Political Contexts

### Historical and Cultural Roots

Skepticism toward science has deep historical roots, with critiques dating back to the early 20th century. Critics have long associated science with moral harm and negative social effects, arguing that it promotes a faulty view of human nature and relationships (Jewett, 2020). Since the 1970s, both radical and conservative groups have challenged the cultural dominance of scientific rationality, linking science to capitalism and state power (Jewett, 2020).

### Science as a Public Good and Democratic Resource

Science is increasingly viewed as a public good that should inform democratic decision-making. However, some small-state conservatives reject the relevance of science in guiding policy, preferring values untouched by scientific information. This rejection can be seen as a form of anti-science that challenges the functional relationship between scientific authority and democracy (Durant, 2017).

### Polarization and Cultural Identity

Science skepticism is often intertwined with cultural identity and group affiliations. People tend to accept or reject scientific claims based on whether they align with their social or political group, a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning (ScienceAlert, 2016). This leads to "cherry-picking" of facts and contributes to a "polluted science communication environment" where scientific consensus is contested along cultural lines (ScienceAlert, 2016).

## Complexity and Heterogeneity of Anti-Science Attitudes

Studies emphasize that anti-science attitudes are heterogeneous and multifactorial. Political ideology, religiosity, moral concerns, and scientific literacy interact in complex ways, sometimes reinforcing and other times canceling each other out (American Council on Science and Health [ACSH], 2018). For example, skepticism about smoking causing lung cancer is primarily linked to scientific illiteracy, while climate change skepticism combines scientific illiteracy with conservative political views (ACSH, 2018).

| Factor                  | Influence on Anti-Science Attitudes                       | Examples                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Political Ideology      | Strong influence, especially on climate change skepticism | Conservative distrust of climate science |
| Religiosity             | Significant, especially for vaccine skepticism            | Moral concerns about vaccination  |
| Moral Values            | Influence varies by topic                                  | Naturalness concerns in vaccination |
| Scientific Literacy     | Mixed influence; low literacy increases skepticism        | GM food skepticism linked to low literacy |
| Distrust of Elites      | Populist distrust affects acceptance of scientific claims | Suspicion of expert authority     |
| Cultural Identity       | Motivated reasoning reinforces skepticism                 | Cherry-picking facts to fit beliefs|

## Addressing Anti-Science Attitudes

Understanding the causes of anti-science attitudes suggests that addressing them requires more than simply providing scientific facts. Empathy and respect toward skeptics are essential to avoid further polarization and social fragmentation (Contessa, 2022). Tailoring communication to align with individuals' values and finding common ground can be more effective than confrontational approaches (ScienceAlert, 2016).

Moreover, increasing the trustworthiness of science through social and political reforms is crucial. This includes addressing concerns about corruption, elitism, and the social implications of scientific research (Contessa, 2022; Durant, 2017).

## Conclusion

Anti-science attitudes arise from a complex interplay of political, religious, moral, educational, and cultural factors. While political conservatism is strongly associated with skepticism toward climate change, other forms of skepticism, such as toward vaccines or genetic modification, are influenced more by religiosity, moral concerns, and scientific literacy. Populist distrust of elites, historical critiques of science's moral implications, and the politicization of scientific issues further complicate the landscape.

Effective responses to anti-science attitudes must recognize this complexity, avoid dismissive or condescending approaches, and engage with the underlying social and political concerns that fuel skepticism. Enhancing the public's trust in science as a democratic resource and public good, alongside tailored communication strategies, offers the best path forward to mitigating anti-science attitudes in society.
