# How Did European “Ethnics” Become White? What Changes Made This Possible?

## Introduction

The concept of "whiteness" as a racial and social category in the United States and broader Western societies is a complex and historically fluid construct. European ethnic groups such as the Irish, Italians, Jews, and others were not always uniformly considered "white" in the social or legal sense. This report explores how these European ethnic groups became classified as white, the social, political, and legal changes that facilitated this transformation, and the implications of this process. The analysis draws on historical, sociological, and anthropological sources, emphasizing the evolution of whiteness as a socio-political identity rather than a fixed biological or phenotypical category.

## Historical Context of Whiteness and Ethnicity

### Early Definitions and Social Constructs

In the 18th and 19th centuries, "whiteness" was often synonymous with Anglo-Saxon Protestant identity (WASP), particularly in the United States. Early classifications, such as those by Benjamin Franklin in 1751, distinguished between English and Saxon peoples as "white," while other European groups like the French, Germans, and Russians were sometimes described as "swarthy" or "tawny" ([Wills, 2016](https://daily.jstor.org/constructing-the-white-race/)). This reflects the fluidity and subjectivity of racial categories, which were deeply intertwined with cultural, religious, and national identities.

### Legal and Social Status of European Ethnic Groups

Despite facing significant discrimination, many European ethnic groups were legally considered white in the United States. Objective legal tests of whiteness included access to "whites-only" schools, eligibility for citizenship, and the legality of interracial marriage with Anglo-Saxon whites. Irish, Italians, Jews, and other white ethnics generally passed these tests, distinguishing their status from African Americans, Native Americans, and Asians, who faced explicit legal exclusions ([Bernstein, 2017](https://reason.com/volokh/2017/03/22/sorry-but-the-irish-were-always-white)).

However, social acceptance lagged behind legal classification. These groups were often marginalized, stereotyped, and subjected to xenophobia and ethnic discrimination, particularly in urban centers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries ([Sociology Textbook, 2014](https://study.com/academy/lesson/white-ethnic-americans.html)).

## Mechanisms of Becoming White

### Assimilation and Social Mobility

One key factor in the "becoming white" process was assimilation into the dominant Anglo-American culture. As ethnic groups gained economic stability, political power, and social visibility, they were increasingly accepted as part of the white majority. For example, the Irish became politically influential in cities like Philadelphia and New York, with Irish Americans holding key positions in police departments and political machines ([Reddit AskHistorians, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1c5kqb/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/)).

Similarly, Jewish Americans' upward mobility through education and professional achievement facilitated their acceptance as white, despite persistent anti-Semitism ([Brodkin, 1998](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/How-Did-Jews-Become-White-Folks-PK7QY3S4Q)).

### Racial Hierarchies and Exclusion of Others

The expansion of whiteness often occurred through the exclusion and marginalization of non-white groups. European ethnics sometimes reinforced their whiteness by distancing themselves from African Americans and other minorities, adopting anti-black attitudes and participating in racial hierarchies ([Quora, 2017](https://www.quora.com/Why-Were-Italians-And-Irish-People-Not-Initially-considered-White-Or-Caucasian-What-Caused-Them-To-Be-classified-That-Way)).

This dynamic is evident in historical events such as the New York City Draft Riots of 1863, where Irish immigrants violently targeted African Americans, asserting their own whiteness by opposing black advancement ([Reddit AskHistorians, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1c5kqb/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/)).

### Legal Codification and Census Classification

Legal and governmental recognition played a crucial role. Immigration laws, naturalization policies, and census classifications codified whiteness in ways that included or excluded certain groups. For instance, the Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, reflecting anxieties about the racial and cultural "purity" of whiteness ([White Ethnic Wikipedia, 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_ethnic)).

Census categories evolved over time, with groups like Mexican Americans being legally classified as white to protect property rights, despite social discrimination ([Reddit AskHistorians, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1c5kqb/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/)).

## Sociological and Anthropological Perspectives

### Whiteness as a Social Construct

Whiteness is not a fixed biological reality but a social and political construct that changes over time and context. Scholars in whiteness studies argue that racial categories are tools used to maintain power structures and social hierarchies ([Kolchin, 2002](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2700127)).

### Internal Hierarchies Within Whiteness

Within the white category, hierarchies based on nationality, religion, and class existed. Irish Catholics, Southern Italians, and Jews were often considered inferior subgroups within whiteness, facing discrimination from Anglo-Saxon Protestants ([Bernstein, 2017](https://reason.com/volokh/2017/03/22/sorry-but-the-irish-were-always-white)).

This internal stratification illustrates that whiteness was not monolithic but stratified, with social mobility and assimilation enabling groups to move up the hierarchy.

## Conclusion

European ethnic groups such as the Irish, Italians, and Jews became classified as white through a complex interplay of legal, social, and political factors. While they were legally considered white in many respects, full social acceptance required assimilation, economic advancement, and participation in existing racial hierarchies that marginalized non-white groups. Whiteness itself is a fluid and constructed category, shaped by historical contingencies and power relations rather than immutable biological traits.

This transformation was not uniform or uncontested; it involved struggles over identity, status, and belonging. Understanding the historical process by which ethnics "became white" reveals the contingent and constructed nature of race and challenges simplistic or essentialist notions of racial identity.
