# The Racialization and "Whitening" of European Ethnic Groups in the United States: Processes and Changes

The concept of "whiteness" in the United States has historically been fluid, socially constructed, and politically charged. European ethnic groups such as the Irish, Italians, Jews, Germans, and Eastern and Southern Europeans were not always considered "white" in the American racial hierarchy. This report examines how these groups transitioned from being racialized as non-white or inferior to being accepted as "white," the social, political, and scientific changes that enabled this transformation, and the broader implications for understanding race as a social construct.

## Historical Context of Whiteness in America

In early American history, "whiteness" was closely tied to the identity of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs), primarily of English descent. Whiteness was not merely a matter of skin color but was deeply intertwined with cultural, religious, and political identity. Groups that did not fit this mold—such as Irish Catholics, Jews, Italians, and Eastern Europeans—were often excluded from full acceptance as white despite their European origins ([Ford, 2023](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-Italians-Germans-Irish-and-Jews-once-not-considered-white)).

The racial hierarchy placed Anglo-Saxon Protestants at the top, with other European ethnic groups occupying ambiguous positions. These groups faced ethnic discrimination, xenophobia, and were often relegated to menial labor and segregated urban enclaves. Their religion (Catholicism, Judaism, Eastern Orthodoxy) and cultural differences further alienated them from the dominant WASP culture ([Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_ethnic)).

## Scientific Racism and the Racialization of European Ethnic Groups

The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of scientific racism, which sought to classify human populations into hierarchical racial categories based on pseudoscientific methods. This period introduced the idea that Europeans themselves were divided into distinct "races," with Northern and Western Europeans (e.g., Anglo-Saxons, Germans) considered superior, and Southern and Eastern Europeans (e.g., Italians, Slavs) viewed as racially inferior ([Academia.edu, 2024](https://www.academia.edu/4992853/The_Visibility_of_Whiteness_and_Immigration_Restriction_in_the_United_States_1880_1930)).

This racialization was reinforced by derogatory stereotypes and ethnic slurs such as "dago" for Italians and "hunkie" for Eastern Europeans. The eugenics movement further cemented these ideas by attributing social problems like poverty and criminality to inherited racial traits, thereby justifying immigration restrictions and social exclusion ([New York Times, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html)).

## Immigration Waves and Changing Social Dynamics

### Irish Americans

The Irish were among the first large European immigrant groups to face racialization in the U.S. due to their Catholic faith and cultural differences from the Protestant Anglo majority. Early discrimination was intense, including events like the Philadelphia Bible Riots, which highlighted religious and ethnic tensions ([Reddit, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1cg6e0/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/)).

However, by the late 19th century, Irish Americans began to gain social and political prominence. Their increasing visibility in public roles such as police commissioners, politicians, and athletes helped normalize their status as white. The Irish also strategically positioned themselves as "white" by distancing themselves from Black Americans and participating in racial hierarchies, exemplified during events like the Draft Riots ([Reddit, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1cg6e0/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/)).

### Italians and Southern/Eastern Europeans

Southern and Eastern Europeans began mass immigration around 1880, arriving after the Irish had largely been accepted as white. Their racialization was more rigid due to scientific racism and cultural differences. The Immigration Act of 1924, which severely restricted new immigration, marked a turning point. It halted the influx of "new" immigrants who were seen as culturally incompatible, allowing existing immigrant communities to assimilate and be reclassified as white ([Reddit, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1cg6e0/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/); [New York Times, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html)).

Assimilation involved adopting Anglo cultural norms, intermarriage, and increased socioeconomic status. Italians, for example, moved from being racialized as "dago" to being recognized as white Americans by mid-20th century ([New York Times, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html)).

### Jewish Americans

Jewish immigrants faced religious and ethnic discrimination but gradually gained acceptance as white through upward social mobility, particularly in education and professional fields. Jews became one of the most educated subgroups in America, with a disproportionately high number of academic professors, which helped elevate their social status and whiteness ([Reddit, 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1cg6e0/when_and_how_did_ethnic_groups_such_as_irish_and/); [Bartleby, 2020](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/How-Did-Jews-Become-White-Folks-F3MS7MKTGXZQ)).

## Mechanisms Facilitating the Transition to Whiteness

The transition of European ethnic groups to whiteness was not automatic but contingent on several interrelated factors:

| Mechanism                         | Description                                                                                     | Examples/Implications                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Social Mobility and Assimilation** | Economic advancement and cultural assimilation into Anglo norms increased acceptance.          | Irish political power in cities; Jewish educational attainment; Italian economic progress.            |
| **Political Inclusion**           | Participation in political institutions and organizations signaled belonging to the dominant group. | Irish dominance in police and politics; ethnic political machines integrating immigrants.             |
| **Racial Boundary Maintenance**  | Distancing from Black Americans and other non-white groups reinforced whiteness.                | Irish participation in racial hierarchies; anti-Black racism as a tool for inclusion.                 |
| **Immigration Restriction**       | Laws like the Immigration Act of 1924 limited new arrivals, stabilizing existing groups’ status. | Reduced influx of "non-white" immigrants allowed existing groups to consolidate whiteness.           |
| **Scientific and Cultural Reinterpretation** | Shifts in racial science and cultural perceptions redefined who counted as white.               | Inclusion of Germans, Irish, Jews, and Southern Europeans as "white" post-WWII.                       |

## Timeline of Key Developments

| Period                 | Event/Development                                                                                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-1880s              | Whiteness defined narrowly as Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Irish and Germans viewed with suspicion.           |
| 1880s–1924             | Mass immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans; rise of scientific racism and ethnic racialization.   |
| 1924                   | Immigration Act restricts new immigrants; existing immigrant groups begin assimilation and social mobility. |
| 1930s–Post WWII        | Increased social mobility and political inclusion; Jews and Italians gain whiteness status.               |
| Late 20th Century      | Whiteness expands to include most European ethnic groups; ethnic distinctions become cultural rather than racial. |

## Critical Analysis and Opinion

The "whitening" of European ethnic groups in the United States was a complex socio-political process rather than a simple biological or phenotypic change. It was deeply tied to the power structures of American society and the need to maintain racial hierarchies that privileged Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

The process was facilitated by the groups’ ability to assimilate culturally, gain economic and political power, and importantly, participate in the racialization of others, particularly Black Americans. This dynamic reveals that whiteness is not a fixed racial category but a mutable social status that can be acquired under certain conditions.

Immigration policies played a crucial role by limiting new arrivals who might challenge existing racial boundaries and by implicitly endorsing the inclusion of assimilated groups. The role of scientific racism, while discredited today, was instrumental in shaping public and political discourse on race and immigration during the critical period of 1880–1930.

In conclusion, European ethnic groups became white through a combination of social mobility, political integration, strategic distancing from non-white groups, and changes in immigration policy and racial science. This underscores the constructed nature of race and highlights how racial categories serve to organize social hierarchies rather than reflect inherent biological differences.
