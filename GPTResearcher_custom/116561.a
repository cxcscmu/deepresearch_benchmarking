# Report on the Rights Prisoners Should Have

The treatment and rights of prisoners remain a complex and debated issue within the criminal justice system, particularly in the United States. While incarceration necessarily involves the deprivation of certain liberties, prisoners retain fundamental human rights that must be respected to uphold human dignity and legal standards. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the rights prisoners should have, balancing the need for security and order in prisons with the imperative to protect inmates’ basic human and constitutional rights.

## Introduction

Prisoners, by virtue of their incarceration, lose certain freedoms such as liberty and autonomy over their movements. However, they do not forfeit all of their human rights. The U.S. legal system, international human rights frameworks, and ethical considerations converge on the principle that prisoners must be treated with dignity and afforded essential rights. The challenge lies in defining which rights are fundamental and must be preserved, and which can be reasonably limited due to the nature of imprisonment.

## Fundamental Rights Retained by Prisoners

### Right to Humane Treatment and Conditions

Prisoners have the right to be treated with respect for their inherent dignity as human beings. This includes access to humane facilities and conditions, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, and protection from cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ([The Infinite Kitchen, 2021](https://theinfinitekitchen.com/faq/quick-answer-how-should-prisoners-treated/); [Article Myriad, n.d.](https://www.articlemyriad.com/issues-surrounding-rights-prisoners/)).

Historically, prisoners were subjected to brutal and degrading conditions such as being caged, chained, or physically abused. Modern standards reject such treatment and emphasize the need for adequate living conditions, including sufficient food, water, and sanitation.

### Right to Access Adequate Medical and Mental Health Care

Prisoners must receive adequate medical and mental health care. The landmark 1976 Supreme Court case *Estelle v. Gamble* established that deliberate indifference to prisoners’ medical needs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, thereby creating a de facto right to health care for incarcerated individuals ([Paris, 2008](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-prisoners-deserve-health-care/2008-02)).

While prisoners are not entitled to the best possible care, the care provided must meet a minimum standard of adequacy. This right extends to mental health treatment, which is critical given the high prevalence of mental illness in prison populations.

### Right to Freedom from Discrimination and Sexual Violence

Prisoners have the right to be free from discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, sex, disability, and other protected characteristics. The Model Sentencing and Corrections Act explicitly protects inmates from such discrimination ([HG.org, n.d.](https://www.hg.org/prison-law.html)).

Additionally, prisoners must be protected from sexual harassment, assault, and rape by both other inmates and prison personnel. This right is essential to maintaining safety and dignity within correctional facilities.

### Right to Access Legal Resources and Courts

The right of prisoners to access the courts is paramount. This includes the right to legal counsel, access to law libraries, and assistance from jailhouse lawyers (inmates who provide legal advice to others). This right ensures that prisoners can challenge unlawful conditions, seek redress for rights violations, and pursue appeals or claims of innocence ([The Infinite Kitchen, 2021](https://theinfinitekitchen.com/faq/quick-answer-how-should-prisoners-treated/)).

### Right to Complain and Voice Grievances

Prisoners should have the right to express complaints about prison conditions and treatment without fear of retaliation. This right supports transparency and accountability within the prison system and helps prevent abuses ([HG.org, n.d.](https://www.hg.org/prisoner-rights-law.html)).

### Rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Inmates with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to prison facilities and programs. This includes physical accessibility and appropriate medical or support services ([The Infinite Kitchen, 2021](https://theinfinitekitchen.com/faq/quick-answer-how-should-prisoners-treated/)).

## Rights That Are Reasonably Limited

While prisoners retain fundamental rights, certain rights enjoyed by free citizens are necessarily curtailed. These include:

| Right | Reason for Limitation |
|-------|----------------------|
| Freedom of movement (right to come and go) | Incarceration inherently restricts liberty to prevent escape and maintain security. |
| Freedom to choose work or residence | Prison authorities determine work assignments and housing for order and safety. |
| Certain privacy rights | Security protocols require searches and monitoring to prevent contraband and violence. |
| Voting rights (varies by jurisdiction) | Some states restrict voting rights for incarcerated individuals, though this is contested. |

These limitations are generally accepted as necessary for the functioning of the prison system and public safety ([Article Myriad, n.d.](https://www.articlemyriad.com/issues-surrounding-rights-prisoners/)).

## The Balance Between Rights and Prison Security

The central issue in prisoner rights is balancing fundamental human rights with the need to maintain order and security in prisons. Overly restrictive policies can lead to inhumane conditions and rights violations, while excessive freedoms can undermine the purpose of incarceration.

Courts have emphasized that while prisoners do not have the full spectrum of rights enjoyed by free citizens, they must retain rights essential for survival and dignity, such as access to food, medical care, and protection from abuse ([Article Myriad, n.d.](https://www.articlemyriad.com/issues-surrounding-rights-prisoners/)).

## Ethical and Social Considerations

Treating prisoners humanely reflects societal values and character. Denying prisoners basic rights risks dehumanizing them and eroding moral standards. Furthermore, many prisoners are eventually released, and humane treatment supports rehabilitation and reduces recidivism ([Debate.org, n.d.](https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-prisoners-have-rights)).

The paradox of prisoners receiving guaranteed health care while many law-abiding citizens lack access highlights broader social inequities but does not negate the obligation to provide care to incarcerated individuals ([Paris, 2008](https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-prisoners-deserve-health-care/2008-02)).

## International and National Legal Frameworks

International human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, affirm that prisoners retain basic human rights. National constitutions, including the U.S. Constitution and the Constitution of India, also protect prisoners’ rights to life, dignity, and freedom from cruel treatment ([Legal Desire, n.d.](https://legaldesire.com/human-rights-prisoners-international-national-perspectives/)).

## Summary Table of Prisoner Rights

| Right Category | Specific Rights | Legal/Ethical Basis | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Humane Treatment | Adequate food, water, shelter, sanitation | Eighth Amendment, International Law | Prohibits cruel and unusual punishment |
| Medical Care | Access to adequate physical and mental health care | *Estelle v. Gamble* (1976), ADA | Care must be adequate, not necessarily best |
| Safety and Security | Freedom from sexual violence, discrimination | Model Sentencing Act, Civil Rights Law | Includes protection from abuse by staff and inmates |
| Legal Rights | Access to courts, legal counsel, law libraries | First Amendment, Due Process | Ensures ability to challenge conditions and convictions |
| Disability Rights | Reasonable accommodations under ADA | ADA, Civil Rights Law | Equal access to facilities and programs |
| Freedom of Expression | Right to complain and voice grievances | First Amendment | Protection against retaliation |
| Limited Rights | Movement, privacy, work choice | Security and order considerations | Necessary restrictions for prison management |

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of legal precedents, ethical considerations, and human rights standards, prisoners should retain all fundamental human rights that preserve their dignity, safety, and ability to seek justice. These include humane living conditions, adequate medical care, protection from abuse and discrimination, access to legal resources, and rights under disability laws.

While certain liberties must be restricted for security and order, these restrictions should be narrowly tailored and never infringe on the basic rights essential for survival and dignity. Denying prisoners these rights not only violates legal standards but undermines the moral fabric of society and the rehabilitative purpose of incarceration.

Therefore, prisons must ensure compliance with constitutional protections and international human rights norms, providing prisoners with the rights necessary to maintain their humanity while serving their sentences.
