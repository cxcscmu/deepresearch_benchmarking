# How Does Immigration Help the Economy?  
_A Comprehensive and In-Depth Report_

---

## Introduction

Immigration is a multifaceted phenomenon that has significant implications for the economies of host countries. It involves the movement of people across borders in search of better opportunities, and it influences labor markets, innovation, demographic structures, and fiscal balances. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based analysis of how immigration helps the economy, drawing on a wide range of authoritative sources including research from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and various economic think tanks. The report prioritizes recent, reliable data and scholarly consensus to present an objective view of the economic contributions of immigrants.

## 1. Immigration and Economic Growth

### 1.1 Labor Market Expansion and Productivity

Immigration expands the labor force, which is a fundamental driver of economic growth. By increasing the number of workers, immigrants contribute to higher total output and GDP growth. For example, Malaysia’s economic modeling suggests that a 10% net increase in low-skilled foreign workers can increase real GDP by up to 1.1% ([World Bank, 2015](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/12/18/reforms-can-optimize-the-role-of-immigration-in-malaysias-development)).

In the United States, immigrants constitute about 16% of the labor force, and their participation helps avoid the stagnation seen in other developed economies facing aging populations and shrinking workforces ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

Immigrants often fill critical gaps in both low- and high-skilled jobs, complementing native-born workers rather than directly competing with them. This complementarity boosts overall labor productivity. For instance, high-skilled immigrants in STEM fields contribute disproportionately to innovation and technological advancement, which fuels productivity growth ([AEIdeas, 2018](https://www.aei.org/economics/how-immigration-boosts-american-economic-growth-and-innovation/)).

### 1.2 Innovation and Entrepreneurship

Immigration is a catalyst for innovation and entrepreneurship. Immigrants bring diverse perspectives and skills that foster creativity and new ideas. Studies show that immigrants account for nearly half of the U.S. workforce with science or engineering doctorates and are founders or co-founders of more than half of U.S. startup “unicorns” (startups valued at over $1 billion) ([AEIdeas, 2018](https://www.aei.org/economics/how-immigration-boosts-american-economic-growth-and-innovation/)).

The National Academies report highlights that high-skilled immigrants increase patenting per capita, which is a proxy for innovation, thereby contributing to long-term economic dynamism ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

### 1.3 Demographic Rebalancing

Immigration helps rebalance demographics, especially in countries with aging populations and low birth rates. Younger immigrants replenish the workforce, support social security systems, and sustain consumption levels. For example, in the 1950s, the U.S. birth rate declined significantly, but immigration helped maintain a balanced demographic structure and economic vitality ([Xpress Money, 2019](https://www.xpressmoney.com/industry/how-immigrants-benefit-the-host-economy/)).

## 2. Impact on Wages and Employment

### 2.1 Effects on Native Workers’ Wages

The impact of immigration on native-born workers’ wages varies by skill level and time horizon. Over periods exceeding ten years, the overall effect on native wages is very small. Negative wage effects, when they occur, are mostly confined to prior immigrants and native-born workers without a high school diploma, who are the closest substitutes for low-skilled immigrant workers ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

George Borjas estimates that immigration increases the aggregate U.S. economy’s size by about 11%, but the net benefit to native-born workers is approximately 0.24% of GDP, reflecting a small redistribution effect rather than a large wage increase ([Borjas, 2019](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25836)).

### 2.2 Employment Effects

There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers. However, some studies indicate that immigration reduces the number of hours worked by native-born teenagers but does not significantly change their employment rates ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

Moreover, immigrants often take jobs in sectors where there are labor shortages, thus creating complementary employment opportunities for native workers. For example, in Malaysia, for every 10 immigrant workers, up to five new jobs may be created for locals in the same sector ([World Bank, 2015](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/12/18/reforms-can-optimize-the-role-of-immigration-in-malaysias-development)).

## 3. Fiscal Impact of Immigration

### 3.1 Taxes and Public Expenditures

The fiscal impact of immigration depends heavily on the education and skill levels of immigrants. First-generation immigrants tend to be more costly to state and local governments, mainly due to education costs for their children. However, the second generation (children of immigrants) often become strong fiscal contributors, paying more in taxes than both their parents and native-born populations ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

Federal fiscal impacts are generally positive because immigrants are typically younger and pay taxes while consuming fewer elderly-related benefits. State and local impacts are more mixed due to education and social service costs ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

### 3.2 Education and Skill Level as Key Determinants

Immigrants with higher education levels contribute positively to government finances, regardless of nativity. Conversely, less-educated immigrants tend to be net fiscal drains due to lower tax contributions and higher use of social services ([Camarota, 2013](https://cis.org/Report/Fiscal-and-Economic-Impact-Immigration-United-States)).

## 4. Consumer Demand and Economic Dynamism

Immigrants contribute to consumer demand by spending on housing, food, healthcare, and leisure, which stimulates economic activity. Their presence supports sectors such as childcare, food preparation, construction, and other services, often reducing prices and increasing availability ([National Academies, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)).

Furthermore, immigrants’ entrepreneurial activities create jobs and foster economic dynamism. For instance, immigrant-founded companies in California generated $52 billion in revenue and created over 400,000 jobs in 2005 ([Justin Hall, 2021](https://www.immigrationresearch.org)).

## 5. Challenges and Considerations

While immigration generally benefits the economy, it also presents challenges:

- **Distributional Effects:** Some native workers, especially low-skilled, may face wage pressures or employment competition.
- **Fiscal Costs:** Education and social services for immigrant children impose costs on state and local governments.
- **Integration and Policy:** Effective immigration policies and workforce integration programs are essential to maximize benefits and mitigate adverse effects ([World Bank, 2015](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/12/18/reforms-can-optimize-the-role-of-immigration-in-malaysias-development)).

## Conclusion

Immigration plays a vital role in enhancing economic growth, innovation, and demographic balance in host countries. While the overall benefits to GDP and native-born workers are positive, they are often modest and accompanied by distributional effects that require thoughtful policy responses. High-skilled immigrants contribute disproportionately to innovation and fiscal health, while low-skilled immigrants fill essential labor market gaps and support consumer demand.

Effective immigration policies that align with labor market needs, promote skill development, and ensure integration can maximize the economic benefits of immigration while mitigating challenges. The evidence strongly supports immigration as a net positive force for economic growth and dynamism, especially when managed strategically.
