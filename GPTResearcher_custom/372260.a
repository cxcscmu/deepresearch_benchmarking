# Why Should Christians Share Their Faith? A Comprehensive Analysis

Sharing the Christian faith, often referred to as evangelism, is a fundamental aspect of Christianity that has shaped its history, growth, and influence worldwide.

This report explores the reasons why Christians should share their faith, drawing on biblical mandates, theological imperatives, personal and communal benefits, and practical considerations. The analysis is based on a synthesis of recent and reliable sources, aiming to provide an in-depth, well-structured, and comprehensive understanding of this critical Christian practice.

## Biblical Mandate and Theological Imperatives

### The Great Commission: A Divine Command

One of the clearest and most compelling reasons for Christians to share their faith is the explicit command given by Jesus Christ, known as the Great Commission. According to Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus instructed His followers to "go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them... and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you" (Christianity.org.uk, n.d.). This directive is not optional but a foundational mission for all believers, emphasizing the universal scope of evangelism.

Rick Warren, a prominent Christian pastor, underscores that evangelism was Jesus’ mission, and Christians are called to continue this work (Pastors.com, 2018). This divine mandate establishes evangelism as a core responsibility, integral to the identity and purpose of every Christian.

### Evangelism as an Act of Obedience and Love

Sharing the gospel is also an act of obedience to God’s will and an expression of love for others. Ray Comfort highlights that Christians are commanded to preach the gospel to all creation (Living Waters, 2020). The existence of hell, as a reality described in Scripture, adds urgency to this task, as believers are motivated by a desire to warn others of eternal consequences (Living Waters, 2020).

Moreover, evangelism reflects the biblical principle of loving one’s neighbor as oneself. Sharing the good news is a tangible way to demonstrate care and concern for others’ spiritual well-being (Living Waters, 2020).

## Personal and Communal Benefits of Sharing Faith

### Spiritual Growth and Discipleship

Engaging in evangelism benefits the believer by deepening their understanding of Scripture and reinforcing the centrality of the gospel in their life. According to 9Marks, evangelism helps keep the gospel central in the life of the church and individual believers (9Marks.org, 2012). It forces Christians to articulate and clarify their faith, which enhances their theological comprehension and discipleship.

Furthermore, evangelism fosters spiritual maturity by encouraging believers to rely on the Holy Spirit and embrace potential persecution, which can strengthen character and hope (9Marks.org, 2012).

### Joy and Fulfillment

Contrary to the perception of evangelism as a burdensome duty, it brings joy and happiness to the believer. The Apostle John expresses that sharing the message of eternal life completes the joy of those who proclaim it (Engage 360 Ministries, 2019). This joy arises from participating in God’s redemptive work and witnessing lives transformed by the gospel.

### Community Impact and Eternal Rewards

Rick Warren notes that when Christians share their faith, they contribute to the growth of God’s kingdom and will rejoice in heaven over those they helped bring to salvation (Pastors.com, 2018). Evangelism is thus both a privilege and an investment with eternal significance.

## Overcoming Barriers to Sharing Faith

### Common Hindrances

Despite its importance, many Christians refrain from sharing their faith due to fear, anxiety, lack of knowledge, or social discomfort. Studies indicate that over 60% of church-going Christians never share their faith (One Mission Society, n.d.). Fear of rejection, ridicule, or offending others often inhibits evangelistic efforts (Beliefnet, n.d.).

Steve and Cheri Saccone identify the challenge of sharing faith "smartly" in a fast-paced culture where complex theological explanations are difficult to convey quickly (Crosswalk.com, 2017). This cultural barrier can discourage believers from engaging in faith conversations.

### Practical Approaches to Evangelism

Effective evangelism does not require theological expertise or lengthy sermons. Sharing personal testimonies and having natural conversations about faith can be powerful and less intimidating (Equipping Godly Women, n.d.). Christians are encouraged to be transparent about their faith journey and to focus on giving God credit rather than seeking human approval (Crosswalk.com, 2017).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The imperative for Christians to share their faith is grounded in clear biblical commands, theological truths, and practical benefits for both the evangelist and the community. While cultural and personal barriers exist, these challenges can be overcome through intentionality, reliance on the Holy Spirit, and adopting simple, authentic methods of sharing.

In my assessment, sharing the Christian faith is not merely a recommended practice but a vital expression of obedience, love, and identity for believers. It is both a privilege and a responsibility that yields profound spiritual growth and joy. The urgency of the gospel message, coupled with the eternal stakes involved, compels Christians to actively engage in evangelism. Churches and leaders should prioritize equipping believers with the understanding, confidence, and tools necessary to fulfill this mission effectively.

Ultimately, sharing faith is about participating in God’s redemptive plan and extending the hope found in Christ to a hurting world. It is an indispensable aspect of discipleship and a tangible demonstration of living out one’s faith.
