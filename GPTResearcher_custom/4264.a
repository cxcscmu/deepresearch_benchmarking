# Does Personality Change Over Time? A Comprehensive Analysis

Personality, defined as the pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors unique to an individual, has long been a subject of psychological inquiry. Traditionally, personality was viewed as a fixed construct, largely stable after early adulthood. However, contemporary research increasingly challenges this notion, suggesting that personality traits can and do change over the lifespan. This report synthesizes findings from multiple longitudinal studies, meta-analyses, and expert opinions to provide an in-depth, evidence-based examination of whether personality changes over time, the nature of such changes, and the factors influencing them.

## Stability and Change in Personality: An Overview

Historically, the seminal work of William James (1890) posited that personality becomes "set like plaster" after the age of 30. This view dominated psychological thought for much of the 20th century, supported by studies indicating high stability coefficients for major personality traits in adulthood (Costa & McCrae, 1988). However, more recent longitudinal research has revealed a more nuanced picture, demonstrating both stability and change in personality traits across the lifespan.

### Evidence for Stability

Longitudinal studies, such as the Victoria Longitudinal Study, have shown substantial stability in personality traits among older adults over six-year intervals, with high rank-order consistency (differential stability) observed (Small et al., 2003). Stability coefficients often indicate that individuals maintain their relative standing on traits compared to peers, even as mean levels of traits may shift. This suggests that while people may change, their personality profiles relative to others remain somewhat consistent.

### Evidence for Change

Contrary to the traditional view, multiple large-scale studies have found that personality traits exhibit gradual but consistent changes throughout life. For example, a study analyzing self-reported data from over 132,000 North Americans aged 21 to 60 found that certain traits, such as conscientiousness and emotional stability, tend to increase with age, reflecting what psychologists term the "maturity principle" (Srivastava et al., 2003). Similarly, a meta-analysis combining 14 longitudinal studies across diverse populations found downward trends in all Big Five traits except agreeableness, which showed inconsistent patterns (Roberts et al., 2018).

## The Big Five Personality Traits and Their Trajectories Over Time

The Big Five personality traits—neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, and agreeableness—are widely accepted as the core dimensions of personality. Research indicates that these traits do not remain static but follow distinct developmental trajectories.

| Trait           | Typical Change Over Time                          | Notes                                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Neuroticism     | Decreases                                      | Individuals tend to become more emotionally stable with age (Srivastava et al., 2003). |
| Conscientiousness | Increases                                     | Reflects greater responsibility and self-discipline in adulthood (Srivastava et al., 2003). |
| Openness       | Decreases slightly                              | Decline in openness to new experiences is observed in older age (Roberts et al., 2018). |
| Extraversion   | Decreases slightly                              | Some decline in social engagement noted with aging (Roberts et al., 2018). |
| Agreeableness  | Mixed findings; some studies show increase, others show decrease | Evidence is inconsistent; some research suggests older adults may become less agreeable (Hogan, 2003). |

## Individual Differences and Environmental Influences

While average trends in personality change exist, significant individual differences are evident. Some people experience more pronounced changes, while others remain relatively stable. These differences are influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and life experience factors.

### Genetic Contributions

Twin studies, such as the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart, have demonstrated that genetics account for approximately 40-50% of the variance in personality traits, with identical twins showing higher trait similarity compared to fraternal twins (Crystal Knows, 2025). Genetic predispositions provide a baseline or limit within which personality can develop.

### Environmental and Life Experiences

Environmental factors—including social relationships, cultural context, life events, and purposeful interventions—play a crucial role in shaping personality over time. For instance, engaging in intellectual activities, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and experiencing significant life transitions can influence personality development (Bleidorn, 2019). Research suggests that personality traits are malleable and responsive to environmental stimuli even into old age (Bleidorn, 2019).

## Theoretical Perspectives on Personality Change

Several theoretical models attempt to explain personality development and change:

- **Five Factor Theory (McCrae & Costa):** Emphasizes biological maturation as the primary driver of personality stability, with limited role for life experiences.
- **Neo-Socioanalytic Theory:** Highlights the interaction between biological predispositions and social roles/experiences in shaping personality.
- **Plasticity Model:** Suggests personality traits are dynamic and can change in response to environmental demands and personal goals throughout life (Roberts & Mroczek, 2008).

---

## Practical Implications and Conclusions

The evidence indicates that personality is neither entirely fixed nor completely fluid. Instead, it exhibits a balance of stability and change, with core traits maintaining relative consistency while mean levels shift due to maturation and life experiences.

Understanding this dynamic nature of personality has important implications:

- **Personal Growth:** Recognizing that personality can change offers hope for self-improvement and adaptation.
- **Clinical Practice:** Therapeutic interventions can target personality traits to foster healthier behaviors.
- **Social Perception:** Awareness of personality change can reduce stigma and promote empathy toward others' evolving identities.

## Summary

- Personality traits show substantial stability in rank order across the lifespan but also exhibit meaningful mean-level changes.
- The Big Five traits generally follow the "maturity principle," with increases in conscientiousness and emotional stability and decreases in neuroticism and openness.
- Agreeableness shows inconsistent patterns, with some evidence suggesting it may decrease in older age.
- Genetic factors provide a baseline for personality, but environmental influences and life experiences significantly contribute to personality development and change.
- Personality change is a lifelong process without an upper age limit, and even older adults can experience significant shifts.
- The traditional view of personality as "set like plaster" after age 30 is outdated and unsupported by contemporary research.

This comprehensive analysis concludes that personality is a dynamic construct, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and subject to meaningful change throughout the lifespan. The evidence supports a balanced view recognizing both stability and plasticity in personality traits.
