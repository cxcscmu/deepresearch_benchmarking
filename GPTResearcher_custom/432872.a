# Promoting Interprofessional Collaboration During Patient Transitions: A Comprehensive Report

Patient transitions—defined as the movement of patients between healthcare practitioners and settings as their conditions and care needs evolve—are critical junctures in healthcare delivery. Effective interprofessional collaboration during these transitions is vital to ensuring patient safety, continuity of care, and optimal outcomes. This report examines how healthcare facilities can promote interprofessional collaboration during patient transitions, drawing on evidence-based practices, frameworks, and models from recent and authoritative sources.

## The Importance of Interprofessional Collaboration in Patient Transitions

Transitions of care are vulnerable points where communication failures, fragmented coordination, and role ambiguity can lead to adverse outcomes such as medication errors, hospital readmissions, and patient dissatisfaction. Research indicates that ineffective collaboration between healthcare workers accounts for two-thirds of sentinel events reported to The Joint Commission (TJC) (Martin et al., 2010; Commission, 2016). Conversely, effective interprofessional collaboration enhances patient safety, reduces hospital length of stay, lowers mortality rates, and improves job satisfaction among healthcare providers (Epstein, 2014; Galletta et al., 2016).

## Foundations for Safe Care Transitions and Collaboration

The Joint Commission identifies seven foundational elements essential for safe, effective patient care transitions:

| Foundation                      | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early identification of patients at risk | Proactively recognizing patients who may face challenges during transitions.             |
| Leadership support             | Commitment from organizational leaders to foster collaboration and allocate resources.       |
| Medication management          | Accurate reconciliation and communication of medication information.                         |
| Multidisciplinary collaboration | Coordinated teamwork across disciplines to ensure seamless care.                            |
| Patient and family action/engagement | Involving patients and families as active participants in the transition process.          |
| Transfer of information        | Timely, accurate, and complete sharing of patient data among providers.                      |

## Strategies to Promote Interprofessional Collaboration

### 1. Clear Role Definition and Accountability

Each member of the interdisciplinary care team must understand their unique responsibilities during transitions. For example, nurses often act as the voice of the patient, the source of patient information, and the transition coordinator, ensuring continuity and advocating for patient needs. Defining roles such as medication reconciliation, patient education, and follow-up coordination reduces overlap and gaps in care ([Wolters Kluwer, 2019](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/best-practices-for-safe-and-successful-care-transitions)).

### 2. Standardized Communication Tools and Protocols

Effective communication is the cornerstone of collaboration. Facilities promote collaboration by implementing standardized hand-off tools, care plans, and organizational care pathways that ensure consistent information transfer. Regular interdisciplinary meetings and use of electronic health records (EHRs) facilitate timely and accurate data sharing. Communication models that include patient and family engagement further enhance understanding and adherence to care plans ([Patel & Landrigan, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230621/); [Wolters Kluwer, 2019](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/best-practices-for-safe-and-successful-care-transitions)).

### 3. Leadership Support and Culture of Collaboration

Leadership endorsement is critical to fostering an environment where interprofessional collaboration thrives. Nurse managers and clinical leaders play pivotal roles in promoting shared vision, trust, and teamwork. They provide resources for training in communication and quality improvement skills, and establish policies that encourage collaborative practice. This cultural shift is essential to overcoming traditional silos and hierarchical barriers in healthcare settings ([Martin et al., 2010](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71042-6_12)).

### 4. Development of Comprehensive Care Models

Organizations can develop and implement care models tailored to specific types of transitions, such as from acute care to skilled nursing facilities or home care. These models formalize team roles and standardize processes for information gathering and patient care delivery. By following evidence-based protocols, teams reduce variability and improve outcomes ([Wolters Kluwer, 2019](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/best-practices-for-safe-and-successful-care-transitions)).

### 5. Patient and Family Engagement

Recognizing patients and families as central partners in care transitions improves communication and satisfaction. Engaging them in goal-setting, education about the transition process, and self-management strategies empowers patients and reduces readmissions. The Care Transitions Intervention® (CTI) model exemplifies this approach by involving a Transitions Coach® who supports patients and caregivers through hospital visits, home visits, and follow-up calls over 30 days ([Care Transitions Health, 2025](https://caretransitions.health/about)).

### 6. Cross-Setting Partnerships and Community Collaboration

Successful transitions require collaboration beyond the walls of a single facility. Establishing partnerships among hospitals, primary care, home health agencies, and community resources enables streamlined access to patient information and coordinated care plans. Shared learning models across communities support continuous improvement and sustainability of collaboration efforts ([PSQH, 2025](https://www.psqh.com/analysis/understanding-care-transitions-as-a-patient-safety-issue/)).
