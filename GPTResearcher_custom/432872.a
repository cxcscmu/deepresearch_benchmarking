## The Importance of Interprofessional Collaboration in Patient Transitions

Interprofessional collaboration involves multiple health professionals from different disciplines working together to deliver comprehensive care. During patient transitions, collaboration is crucial because:

- It reduces communication breakdowns that can lead to medical errors and adverse events.
- It ensures that all relevant patient information is accurately shared and understood.
- It supports coordinated care planning and shared decision-making.
- It enhances patient and family engagement in care processes.
- It improves overall patient safety and satisfaction.

Studies have shown that poor communication and siloed approaches during transitions contribute to increased readmissions, emergency visits, and patient dissatisfaction ([Patel & Landrigan, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcl.2019.03.004)).

## Communication Frameworks and Tools

Effective communication is the cornerstone of interprofessional collaboration during patient transitions. Facilities promote collaboration by adopting standardized communication tools and processes:

### 1. Standardized Handoff Protocols

- Use of structured handoff tools such as SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) ensures consistent and complete information transfer.
- Electronic health records (EHR) integrated handoff modules facilitate real-time data sharing.

### 2. Care Transition Models

- Comprehensive care models formalize roles and workflows among interdisciplinary teams, enhancing clarity and accountability ([Wolters Kluwer Health, 2019](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/ovid/best-practices-for-safe-and-successful-care-transitions)).

### 3. RAAPID System (Referral, Access, Advice, Placement, Information & Destination)

- In Alberta’s Connect Care system, RAAPID manages consultation requests and facilitates interfacility transfers with a shared electronic intake encounter, reducing duplication and improving communication ([Alberta Health Services, 2024](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/info/hp/cc/if-cc-manual-patient-movement.pdf)).

### 4. Multidisciplinary Team Meetings

- Regular interdisciplinary rounds and case conferences enable collaborative care planning and problem-solving.
