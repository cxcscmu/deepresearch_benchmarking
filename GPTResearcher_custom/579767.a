# Consequences of Children Not Liking to Share: An In-Depth Analysis

The ability to share is a fundamental aspect of social development in children, closely linked to the emergence of fairness, empathy, cooperation, and moral understanding. However, not all children naturally enjoy or are willing to share, especially at early developmental stages. This report explores the consequences of children not liking to share, drawing on empirical research and expert opinions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the social, emotional, and developmental implications. The analysis also considers the nuanced reasons behind children's reluctance to share and the broader context of sharing as a developmental milestone.

## 1. Understanding Children's Reluctance to Share

Young children, particularly toddlers and preschoolers, often exhibit possessiveness over their belongings, a behavior that is developmentally normative. This possessiveness is rooted in their egocentric worldview and limited cognitive capacities, such as an underdeveloped sense of time and fairness ([Education.com, n.d.](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/What_if_Child_Doesnt_Share/); [Greater Good Science Center, 2018](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_is_your_preschooler_not_sharing)). For example, toddlers perceive a toy taken away as lost forever, which explains aggressive responses to sharing demands.

Moreover, children's sharing behavior is influenced by their cognitive abilities, such as counting and fairness understanding, which develop gradually. Research shows that young children may want to share but lack the "cognitive toolbox" to do so fairly ([Greater Good Science Center, 2018](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_is_your_preschooler_not_sharing)). Temperament and social context also play roles; children are more willing to share with less threatening or younger peers and may be selective based on their relationship with the other child ([AskDrSears, n.d.](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/morals-manners/11-ways-teach-your-child-share/)).

## 2. Social and Emotional Consequences of Not Liking to Share

### 2.1 Peer Relationships and Social Acceptance

One of the most significant consequences of children not liking to share is the impact on peer relationships and social acceptance. Children who consistently refuse to share may experience social rejection or isolation, as sharing is a key behavior that facilitates cooperation and friendship formation. The longitudinal study by Malti et al. (2012) found that feelings of social acceptance at age 6 strongly predicted sharing behavior at age 7, indicating that children who feel accepted are more willing to share valuable resources ([Malti et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052017)).

Conversely, children who do not share may be perceived as less cooperative or generous, leading to fewer play opportunities and strained social interactions. This can create a negative feedback loop where social rejection further diminishes a child's motivation to share, potentially impacting their social-emotional development.

### 2.2 Development of Other-Regarding Preferences and Moral Growth

Sharing behavior is closely linked to the development of other-regarding preferences—concern for the welfare of others—which underpin fairness, care, and cooperation. Children who resist sharing may lag in developing these pro-social orientations. Malti et al. (2012) demonstrated that sharing increases significantly between ages 6 and 9 and is associated with early-developing sympathy towards anonymous others. Lack of sharing may therefore reflect or contribute to delayed moral development ([Malti et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052017)).

Moreover, forced sharing, often used by parents or educators to encourage sharing, can backfire by teaching children that sharing is a coercive act rather than a voluntary expression of empathy and kindness. This may undermine the internal motivation necessary for genuine generosity and moral growth ([Verywell Family, 2021](https://www.verywellfamily.com/forcing-your-kid-to-share-4126426); [Center for Parenting Education, n.d.](https://centerforparentingeducation.org/library-of-articles/sibling-rivalry/sharing/)).

### 2.3 Emotional Responses: Resentment and Anger

When children are compelled to share before they are developmentally ready or against their will, they often experience negative emotions such as resentment, unfairness, and anger. These feelings can overshadow the positive emotions associated with kindness and generosity, potentially leading to behavioral issues and strained parent-child relationships ([Center for Parenting Education, n.d.](https://centerforparentingeducation.org/library-of-articles/sibling-rivalry/sharing/)).

Furthermore, children who are forced to share may learn maladaptive lessons, such as crying loudly to get what they want or believing that adults control all resource distribution, which can hinder their development of self-advocacy and fairness understanding ([Verywell Family, 2021](https://www.verywellfamily.com/forcing-your-kid-to-share-4126426)).

## 3. Developmental and Cognitive Implications

### 3.1 Cognitive Limitations and Sharing

Children's reluctance or inability to share fairly is often linked to cognitive developmental stages. For example, preschoolers may lack the counting skills or fairness concepts necessary to divide resources equitably, which explains inconsistent sharing behavior observed in experimental settings ([Greater Good Science Center, 2018](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_is_your_preschooler_not_sharing)).

This cognitive immaturity means that children who do not like to share are not necessarily selfish but may be limited by their developmental stage. Recognizing this helps avoid mislabeling children as unkind and instead encourages supportive teaching approaches.

### 3.2 Role of Empathy and Sympathy

Empathy and sympathy are critical social-emotional skills that promote sharing. Children who develop sympathy towards others, including anonymous peers, show increased sharing behavior over time ([Malti et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052017)). Conversely, children who do not like to share may have underdeveloped empathy, which could be a marker for broader social-emotional difficulties.

## 4. Long-Term Consequences and Social-Emotional Development

Children who consistently avoid sharing may face challenges beyond immediate peer interactions. The inability or unwillingness to share can be an early indicator of atypical or antisocial orientations, which are characterized by social-emotional deficits ([Malti et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052017)). This can affect their ability to form cooperative relationships, succeed in group settings, and develop prosocial behaviors essential for adult social functioning.

Furthermore, the development of sharing behavior is linked to feelings of social acceptance and belonging, which are core human needs. Children who do not share may struggle with these needs, potentially leading to emotional difficulties such as loneliness or low self-esteem.

## 5. Parental and Educational Implications

Given the consequences of children not liking to share, it is important for parents and educators to adopt developmentally appropriate strategies that encourage sharing without coercion.

| Strategy                         | Description                                                                                          | Rationale                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Respect Possessiveness**       | Acknowledge children's right to own and protect treasured possessions.                            | Builds trust and respects developmental stages, reducing resentment.                          |
| **Model Sharing Behavior**       | Adults demonstrate sharing in daily life.                                                       | Children learn through observation and imitation.                                            |
| **Encourage Turn-Taking**        | Promote taking turns rather than simultaneous sharing.                                          | More realistic and developmentally appropriate for young children.                            |
| **Create Positive Social Contexts** | Foster environments where children feel socially accepted and safe.                              | Enhances motivation to share and develop other-regarding preferences.                         |
| **Teach Empathy and Sympathy**   | Use stories, role-playing, and discussions to build social-emotional skills.                     | Supports the development of genuine sharing motivation.                                      |
| **Avoid Forced Sharing**         | Do not compel children to share against their will.                                             | Prevents negative emotional responses and teaches autonomy and fairness.                      |
| **Provide Conflict Resolution Tools** | Equip children with skills to negotiate sharing and advocate for themselves.                     | Encourages self-regulation and social competence.                                            |

These approaches align with findings that forced sharing can teach undesirable lessons and that children develop sharing behaviors gradually as their cognitive and social-emotional skills mature ([Verywell Family, 2021](https://www.verywellfamily.com/forcing-your-kid-to-share-4126426); [AskDrSears, n.d.](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/morals-manners/11-ways-teach-your-child-share/)).

## 6. Summary of Key Findings

| Consequence Area               | Description                                                                                          | Supporting Evidence                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Peer Relationships**         | Poor sharing leads to social rejection and fewer friendships.                                     | Malti et al. (2012) showed social acceptance predicts sharing; lack of sharing may reduce acceptance.         |
| **Moral Development**           | Sharing is linked to empathy and fairness; lack thereof may delay moral growth.                   | Longitudinal studies show sharing increases with sympathy development (Malti et al., 2012).                    |
| **Emotional Impact**            | Forced sharing causes resentment and anger, undermining genuine generosity.                       | Parenting experts caution against forced sharing (Center for Parenting Education, n.d.; Verywell Family, 2021).|
| **Cognitive Limitations**       | Young children may not share due to underdeveloped counting and fairness concepts.                | Greater Good Science Center (2018) highlights cognitive constraints on sharing.                               |
| **Long-Term Social-Emotional** | Persistent non-sharing may indicate or contribute to antisocial tendencies.                       | Malti et al. (2012) link sharing deficits to atypical social-emotional development.                           |

## 7. Conclusion

Children not liking to share is a multifaceted issue with significant social, emotional, and developmental consequences. While reluctance to share is often a normal part of early childhood due to cognitive and emotional immaturity, persistent refusal or inability to share can hinder social acceptance, moral development, and emotional well-being. Forced sharing is generally counterproductive, potentially teaching children negative lessons about fairness and autonomy.

The most effective approach involves respecting children's developmental stages, fostering empathy and social acceptance, modeling sharing behaviors, and providing supportive environments that encourage voluntary sharing. Understanding the underlying causes and consequences of sharing reluctance allows parents, educators, and clinicians to better support children's social-emotional growth and prepare them for cooperative, prosocial adult lives.
