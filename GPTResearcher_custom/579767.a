# Report on the Consequences if Children Don't Like to Share

## Introduction

Sharing is widely regarded as a foundational social skill that supports cooperation, empathy, and prosocial behavior in children. However, many young children exhibit reluctance or refusal to share, especially in early developmental stages. Understanding the consequences of children not liking to share is essential for parents, educators, and caregivers to foster healthy social and emotional development. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the consequences of children's reluctance to share, drawing on developmental psychology, social-emotional research, and practical parenting insights. It also offers a critical perspective on how such behaviors are natural in early childhood and how they evolve over time.

## Developmental Context of Sharing

### Normal Developmental Trajectory

Children's reluctance to share is often a normal part of their developmental process. Early childhood is characterized by egocentrism and a limited Theory of Mind (ToM), meaning children are naturally focused on their own needs and have difficulty understanding others' perspectives ([Ockwell-Smith, n.d.](https://www.teachearlyyears.com/a-unique-child/developing-empathy)). Toddlers and preschoolers typically engage in parallel play rather than cooperative play, and possessiveness ("Mine!") is a common expression of emerging identity and attachment to objects ([Education.com, 2013](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/mine-mine-mine-child-doesnt-share/)).

Empathy and sharing skills develop gradually, often not fully emerging until around age 4 or later, when children begin to understand others' feelings and develop social-emotional competencies ([Ockwell-Smith, n.d.](https://www.teachearlyyears.com/a-unique-child/developing-empathy)). Forced sharing before children are developmentally ready can be counterproductive and may lead to negative emotional responses.

### Social-Emotional Roots of Sharing

Research indicates that sharing behavior increases significantly from ages 6 to 9, correlating with children's growing ability to sympathize with others and their feelings of social acceptance ([Malti et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052017)). Early social-emotional skills such as sympathy and peer acceptance are predictors of a child's willingness to share valuable resources.

## Consequences of Children Not Liking to Share

### 1. Social Interaction Challenges

Children who do not like to share may experience difficulties in peer relationships. Sharing is a key component of cooperative play and social bonding. Reluctance to share can lead to conflicts, exclusion from group activities, and challenges in forming friendships ([Education.com, 2013](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/mine-mine-mine-child-doesnt-share/)).

However, it is important to note that refusal to share is also a way children explore social interactions and boundaries. Aggressive behaviors or tantrums related to sharing often reflect developmental stages rather than inherent selfishness ([Education.com, 2013](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/mine-mine-mine-child-doesnt-share/)).

### 2. Emotional and Behavioral Responses

Forcing children to share before they are ready can send unintended messages, such as:

- Crying loudly will get what they want.
- Adults control who gets what and when.
- Children must always interrupt their activities to accommodate others.

These messages can undermine children's ability to self-regulate and advocate for themselves, potentially increasing tantrums and resistance ([Ceder, 2021](https://www.verywellfamily.com/why-you-shouldnt-force-your-kid-to-share-5087554)).

### 3. Impact on Moral and Social Development

While sharing is a moral milestone, children develop the capacity for true sharing only when they acquire empathy and generosity. Children under 6 often share due to conditioning rather than internal motivation ([Sears, 2020](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/morals-manners/11-ways-teach-your-child-share)).

Children who are not yet ready to share may cling to possessions as part of their identity and emotional security. Forcing sharing can threaten their sense of safety and self-worth ([Sears, 2020](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/morals-manners/11-ways-teach-your-child-share)).

### 4. Potential for Delayed Development of Prosocial Skills

If children are consistently forced to share without understanding or empathy, they may not develop patience, self-regulation, or the ability to negotiate social situations effectively. Conversely, when children are allowed to share voluntarily and learn to take turns, they develop important life skills such as impulse control and empathy ([Ceder, 2021](https://www.verywellfamily.com/why-you-shouldnt-force-your-kid-to-share-5087554)).

### 5. Gender Differences and Social Expectations

Girls tend to develop sharing behaviors earlier than boys, but by age 9, these differences typically disappear ([Malti et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052017)). Children who do not like to share may face social pressures or stigmatization, especially in environments that emphasize cooperation and fairness.

## Balancing Expectations and Developmental Readiness

### The Role of Adults

Adults play a crucial role in modeling sharing and empathy. Children learn sharing behaviors by observing adults share time, attention, and resources ([Education.com, 2013](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/mine-mine-mine-child-doesnt-share/)).

Rather than forcing sharing, adults should provide tools to manage conflicts, teach children to advocate for themselves, and encourage self-regulation ([Ceder, 2021](https://www.verywellfamily.com/why-you-shouldnt-force-your-kid-to-share-5087554)).

### Practical Strategies

- Use turn-taking instead of simultaneous sharing.
- Set up neutral play materials during playdates.
- Allow children to keep special toys private.
- Use timers to manage sharing durations.
- Encourage children to use words to negotiate sharing.
- Acknowledge children's feelings about sharing and ownership ([Education.com, 2013](https://www.education.com/magazine/article/mine-mine-mine-child-doesnt-share/); [Sears, 2020](https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/parenting/discipline-behavior/morals-manners/11-ways-teach-your-child-share)).

| Moral and Social Development  | Threat to self-worth if forced to share; sharing linked to empathy development                  | Sharing emerges with empathy, typically after age 4-6            |
| Delayed Prosocial Skills      | Lack of voluntary sharing may hinder patience, impulse control, and negotiation abilities      | Voluntary sharing fosters important life skills                  |
| Gender and Social Expectations| Possible stigmatization or pressure, especially for boys who develop sharing later              | Gender differences diminish by late childhood                    |

## Opinion and Implications

Based on the reviewed evidence, children not liking to share during early childhood should not be viewed as a negative trait or a sign of selfishness but rather as a natural developmental phase. Forcing children to share before they are developmentally ready can have adverse consequences, including emotional distress, behavioral issues, and undermining the internalization of prosocial values.

The focus should be on nurturing empathy, providing appropriate social tools, and modeling sharing behaviors. Encouraging turn-taking and voluntary sharing respects children's autonomy and fosters genuine generosity. Recognizing individual differences in temperament and developmental pace is crucial.

Therefore, the consequences of children not liking to share are context-dependent. When managed with understanding and appropriate support, early reluctance to share does not predict long-term social deficits but reflects a stage in social-emotional growth.

## Conclusion

Children's reluctance to share is a normative aspect of early development tied to cognitive and emotional maturation. While it can lead to social challenges and emotional responses, these are typically transient and manageable with sensitive adult guidance. Forced sharing can produce unintended negative consequences, whereas fostering empathy and voluntary sharing promotes healthy social development. Understanding these nuances allows caregivers to support children effectively through this critical stage.
