# The End of the Cambodian Genocide: A Comprehensive Analysis

The Cambodian genocide, one of the most brutal and devastating genocides of the 20th century, resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.5 to 2 million people—about a quarter to a third of Cambodia's population—between 1975 and 1979. The genocide was orchestrated by the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot, whose radical communist policies sought to transform Cambodia into an agrarian utopia through forced relocations, mass executions, starvation, and forced labor. This report provides an in-depth analysis of how the Cambodian genocide ended, focusing on the key events, actors, and consequences that led to the downfall of the Khmer Rouge and the cessation of mass atrocities.

## Background: The Khmer Rouge and the Genocide

The Khmer Rouge, officially the Communist Party of Kampuchea, seized power in Cambodia on April 17, 1975, after winning the Cambodian Civil War (1967-1975). Upon taking control, the regime renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea and implemented radical policies aimed at eradicating perceived enemies, including intellectuals, religious groups, ethnic minorities, and anyone associated with the former government or foreign powers. The regime emptied cities, forcing millions into rural labor camps where executions, starvation, torture, and disease were rampant ([Harold, 2021](https://www.cambodia-travel.com/what-came-after-the-cambodian-genocide/); [Wikipedia, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide)).

## The Role of the United States Before the Genocide's End

Before the genocide ended, the United States had been involved in Cambodia during the Vietnam War, including extensive bombing campaigns from 1969 until 1973. The US bombing aimed to target North Vietnamese sanctuaries but also contributed to destabilizing Cambodia, indirectly facilitating the rise of the Khmer Rouge. US bombing ceased in August 1973 following Congressional legislation and peace agreements with North Vietnam. However, the Khmer Rouge continued to fight against the Lon Nol government until their victory in 1975 ([AskingTheLot, 2022](https://askingthelot.com/how-did-the-cambodian-genocide-end/)).

## The Vietnamese Invasion: The Decisive Factor Ending the Genocide

### Causes of Vietnamese Intervention

The primary factor that ended the Cambodian genocide was the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in late 1978. Relations between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnam were fraught with hostility despite their earlier communist affiliations. The Khmer Rouge viewed Vietnam as a threat and engaged in border skirmishes and attacks on Vietnamese territory. Vietnam, perceiving the Khmer Rouge regime as pro-Chinese and hostile, decided to intervene militarily to remove Pol Pot's government ([Military History Fandom, n.d.](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War); [AskingTheLot, 2022](https://askingthelot.com/how-did-the-cambodian-genocide-end/)).

### The Invasion and Overthrow of the Khmer Rouge

On December 25, 1978, approximately 150,000 Vietnamese troops launched a full-scale invasion of Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge forces were overwhelmed within two weeks. By January 7, 1979, Vietnamese troops had captured Phnom Penh, effectively ending the Khmer Rouge's control over Cambodia. Pol Pot fled to remote border areas and later into Thailand, where remnants of the Khmer Rouge continued guerrilla warfare but with diminishing power ([Cambodia Genocides Weebly, n.d.](https://cambodiangenocides.weebly.com/end-of-the-genocide.html); [Military History Fandom, n.d.](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War)).

### Establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea

Following the invasion, Vietnam established the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) with Heng Samrin, a former Khmer Rouge commander who had defected, as the head of state. Hun Sen, who fled to Vietnam during the Khmer Rouge regime, was installed as Prime Minister. This new government was pro-Vietnamese and marked the beginning of a decade-long Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia ([GlobalSecurity.org, n.d.](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cambodia/history-vietnam.htm); [Cambodia Travel, 2021](https://www.cambodia-travel.com/what-came-after-the-cambodian-genocide/)).

## Impact of the Vietnamese Invasion on Ending the Genocide

The Vietnamese military victory effectively ended the mass killings and genocidal policies of the Khmer Rouge. The invasion stopped the forced labor camps, mass executions, and starvation policies that had decimated Cambodia's population. However, the aftermath left Cambodia devastated:

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Population Loss            | Approximately 1.5 to 2 million deaths, about 25-30% of the population ([Wikipedia, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide)) |
| Landmines                  | Estimated 10 million landmines left scattered across the country, causing ongoing casualties ([Cambodia Genocides Weebly, n.d.](https://cambodiangenocides.weebly.com/end-of-the-genocide.html)) |

| Mass Graves & Trauma       | Thousands of mass graves discovered; survivors faced long-term psychological and social trauma ([Wikipedia, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide)) |

## International Response and Aftermath

### Continued Conflict and Recognition Issues

Despite the Vietnamese occupation ending the genocide, the Khmer Rouge remained recognized by the United Nations as the legitimate government of Cambodia until the late 1980s. This was largely due to Cold War geopolitics, with Western powers and China opposing Vietnam's invasion. The Khmer Rouge, along with other resistance groups, continued insurgency efforts against the Vietnamese-backed government ([Military History Fandom, n.d.](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War); [Wikipedia, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide)).

### Trials and Justice

Cambodia established the Khmer Rouge Tribunal (Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia) on January 2, 2001, to try senior Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Notable convictions include life sentences for Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 2014 ([AskingTheLot, 2022](https://askingthelot.com/how-did-the-cambodian-genocide-end/); [FactFile, n.d.](https://factfile.org/10-facts-about-cambodian-genocide)).

## The Role of Other Actors

### The United States

The US ceased bombing Cambodia in 1973 but did not intervene to stop the Khmer Rouge's rise or the genocide. After the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975, the US evacuated its personnel and did not attempt to halt the Khmer Rouge's atrocities. The US only began to acknowledge the genocide officially in the late 1980s and supported trials in the 1990s ([AskingTheLot, 2022](https://askingthelot.com/how-did-the-cambodian-genocide-end/); [Wikipedia, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide)).

### China and Soviet Union

China was a key supporter of the Khmer Rouge, providing military and economic aid. In response to Vietnam's invasion, China launched a brief punitive invasion of northern Vietnam in 1979. The Soviet Union supported Vietnam during its occupation of Cambodia, providing military and diplomatic backing ([Cambodia Travel, 2021](https://www.cambodia-travel.com/what-came-after-the-cambodian-genocide/); [Cambodia Genocides Weebly, n.d.](https://cambodiangenocides.weebly.com/end-of-the-genocide.html)).

## Summary and Conclusion

The Cambodian genocide ended primarily due to the Vietnamese military intervention in late 1978 and early 1979, which overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime and halted its genocidal policies. This invasion was motivated by ongoing border conflicts, ideological hostility, and geopolitical alignments during the Cold War. The Vietnamese occupation established a new government that ended mass killings but also led to a decade-long conflict involving Khmer Rouge insurgents and international diplomatic complexities.

The genocide's end did not immediately resolve Cambodia's deep social, economic, and political wounds. The country faced massive population loss, infrastructure devastation, and ongoing violence from landmines and insurgencies. International recognition of the Khmer Rouge's crimes and justice for victims evolved slowly, culminating in the establishment of tribunals decades later.

In conclusion, the Vietnamese invasion was the decisive factor that ended the Cambodian genocide. While other international actors played roles before and after, it was Vietnam's military action that stopped the mass atrocities and began Cambodia's long path to recovery.
