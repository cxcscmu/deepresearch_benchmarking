## Background: The Bonus Army and Its Demands

The Bonus Army was a group of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 World War I veterans, along with their families, who gathered in Washington, D.C., in 1932. Their primary demand was the early payment of a promised monetary bonus for their wartime service. This bonus was authorized by Congress in 1924 as compensation certificates worth about $1,000 each, but the payment was scheduled to be made in 1945, long after the veterans had returned home.

Due to the economic hardships of the Great Depression, many veterans faced severe financial distress and sought immediate payment to alleviate their suffering. The Bonus Army organized a peaceful protest and set up makeshift camps in the capital, hoping to pressure Congress and the administration into advancing the payment schedule.

## Hoover’s Initial Position and Political Context

President Herbert Hoover faced a complex situation. While sympathetic to veterans' plight, Hoover opposed early payment of the bonuses. His opposition was rooted in fiscal concerns; he believed that paying the bonuses early would necessitate raising taxes or increasing the national debt during an already severe economic crisis. Congress debated a bill to authorize early payments, but it was ultimately rejected by the Senate.

Hoover’s stance was consistent with his broader economic philosophy that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government intervention. He prioritized maintaining fiscal discipline over immediate relief measures, reflecting the prevailing conservative economic attitudes of the time.

## The Escalation: Hoover’s Use of Military Force

After the Senate rejected the early payment bill, tensions escalated. The Bonus Army veterans refused to disperse, maintaining their camps on government property in Washington, D.C. On July 28, 1932, the U.S. Attorney General ordered the veterans to vacate the premises. The Washington police attempted to enforce this order but met resistance, resulting in clashes that led to the deaths of two veterans.

Following this violent confrontation, President Hoover ordered the U.S. Army to intervene. General Douglas MacArthur, along with Major Dwight D. Eisenhower and Major George S. Patton, led troops to forcibly remove the Bonus Army from their camps. The military used tear gas, tanks, and bayonets to disperse the veterans and destroy their makeshift shelters.

This military action resulted in injuries and at least one death among the protesters. The use of force against veterans, many of whom were impoverished and unemployed, sparked widespread public outrage and severely damaged Hoover’s reputation.

## Public and Historical Reactions

The violent eviction of the Bonus Army became a national scandal. Many Americans viewed Hoover’s actions as harsh and insensitive, especially given the veterans’ service and sacrifices during World War I. The incident reinforced the perception that Hoover was out of touch with the struggles of ordinary citizens during the Depression.

Historians often cite the Bonus Army episode as a critical factor in Hoover’s political downfall. It undermined public confidence in his leadership and contributed to the landslide victory of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt’s subsequent welcoming of a second Bonus Army in 1933 further highlighted the contrast between the two administrations’ approaches to the crisis.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of the available information, it is clear that Herbert Hoover responded to the demands of the Bonus Army primarily through rejection and the use of military force. While his fiscal concerns were valid within the context of the economic policies of the era, the decision to employ the army to evict protesting veterans was a grave misjudgment in terms of public relations and humanitarian considerations.

Hoover’s response lacked empathy for the veterans’ plight and failed to address the underlying economic distress that motivated the protests. The use of force against veterans not only escalated the conflict but also alienated a significant portion of the American public. This response arguably accelerated Hoover’s political decline and remains a controversial aspect of his presidency.

In summary, Hoover’s handling of the Bonus Army was a decisive moment that exemplified the limitations of his administration’s approach to the Great Depression. It serves as a historical lesson on the importance of balancing fiscal responsibility with compassionate governance, especially during times of national crisis.
