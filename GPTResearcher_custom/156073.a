## Background: The Bonus Army and Its Demands

Following World War I, the U.S. government promised veterans a monetary bonus for their service, which was formalized in 1924 through legislation. The bonus was issued in the form of certificates, which veterans could redeem for cash starting in 1945. However, the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 caused widespread unemployment and economic hardship, particularly for veterans. By 1932, approximately 12,000 to 15,000 veterans, along with their families, converged on Washington, D.C., forming what became known as the Bonus Army. Their demand was for immediate cash payment of their bonuses, including interest, to alleviate their financial distress ([Becca7828, 2017](https://brainly.com/question/3105833)).

## Hoover’s Initial Position on the Bonus Payments

President Hoover opposed the early payment of the bonuses. He believed that paying the bonuses ahead of schedule would require raising taxes or increasing government debt, which he feared would worsen the already fragile economy. Hoover’s administration argued that Congress had already legislated the payment schedule, and altering it would disrupt fiscal policy. When a bill proposing early payment was introduced in Congress, it was rejected by the Senate, reflecting Hoover’s stance and the broader political opposition ([Isabell Schimmel, 2018](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/how-did-herbert-hoover-respond-to-the-demands-of-the-bonus-army-2069160)).

## The Bonus Army’s Encampment and Rising Tensions

The veterans set up makeshift camps in Washington, D.C., including a large one at Anacostia Flats. Their presence became a growing concern for local authorities and the federal government. On July 28, 1932, the Attorney General ordered the veterans to vacate government property. The Washington police attempted to enforce this order but faced resistance from the veterans, leading to violent clashes and the deaths of two veterans ([Becca7828, 2017](https://brainly.com/question/3105833)).

## Hoover’s Decision to Use Military Force

Following the failure of local law enforcement to disperse the Bonus Army, President Hoover authorized the use of the U.S. Army to remove the veterans forcibly. General Douglas MacArthur, along with Major Dwight D. Eisenhower and Major George S. Patton, led the military operation. The troops used tear gas, cavalry, tanks, and infantry to clear the veterans’ camps. The operation resulted in injuries and at least one death among the protesters. The military also destroyed the veterans’ makeshift shelters ([agrippa, 2017](https://brainly.com/question/3105833); [Wiki User, 2013](https://brainly.com/question/3105833)).

## Impact and Public Perception

The violent eviction of the Bonus Army was widely criticized and became a significant political liability for Hoover. Many Americans viewed the use of military force against impoverished veterans as harsh and insensitive. The incident contributed to Hoover’s loss in the 1932 presidential election to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt, in contrast, welcomed a subsequent Bonus Army march in 1933 and sought more compassionate solutions to veterans’ issues ([agrippa, 2017](https://brainly.com/question/3105833)).

## Analysis and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive information provided, it is evident that Herbert Hoover’s response to the Bonus Army was primarily characterized by rejection of their demands and the use of military force to disperse them. Hoover’s fiscal conservatism and concern for government finances led him to oppose early payment of bonuses, despite the veterans’ dire economic conditions. His decision to authorize a military crackdown, while legally within his authority, was politically and morally contentious.

The use of force against veterans, many of whom were suffering from unemployment and poverty, damaged Hoover’s public image and alienated a significant portion of the electorate. The event symbolized the administration’s perceived insensitivity to the struggles of ordinary Americans during the Great Depression. While Hoover’s concerns about fiscal responsibility were valid in the context of the economic crisis, the harsh response arguably lacked compassion and political foresight.

In conclusion, Hoover’s handling of the Bonus Army was a pivotal moment that highlighted the limitations of his approach to the Great Depression. It underscored the need for more empathetic and innovative policies, which were later pursued by the Roosevelt administration. Thus, Hoover’s response can be seen as a failure to adequately address the social and economic realities faced by veterans and the broader population at that time.
