# Report: The Legacy a Church Can Leave

## Introduction

A church's legacy is a multifaceted concept that encompasses spiritual, communal, cultural, and material dimensions. It reflects the enduring impact a church leaves on its congregation, community, and future generations. This report explores the kinds of legacies a church can leave, drawing on information from Legacy Center Church, The Church of England, and other trusted sources. The report aims to provide a comprehensive, well-structured, and in-depth analysis, supported by relevant facts, figures, and examples.

## Defining Church Legacy

Legacy, in the context of a church, refers to the lasting imprint of its identity, mission, ministry, and stewardship. It includes:

- **Spiritual Legacy:** The faith, teachings, and transformation imparted to individuals and communities.
- **Community Legacy:** The social impact, relationships, and acts of kindness fostered.
- **Material Legacy:** Financial gifts, property, and resources bequeathed to sustain and grow the church's mission.
- **Cultural Legacy:** Traditions, worship styles, and values passed down through generations.

Legacy Center Church emphasizes identity, inheritance, and impact as core to their mission, highlighting that a church is "a family with an identity" and "was made to impact the world" ([Legacy Center Church](https://legacycenterchurch.org)).

## Spiritual Legacy

### Faith Formation and Discipleship

A church’s spiritual legacy is primarily its role in nurturing faith and discipleship. Through sermons, Bible studies, worship, and community engagement, churches cultivate spiritual growth and transformation. Legacy Center Church, for instance, offers midweek Bible studies and worship nights (Lampstand) to deepen believers' faith and encourage sharing the Word of God with others ([Legacy Center Church](https://legacycenterchurch.org)).

### Impact on Individual Lives

The spiritual legacy is reflected in the lives changed by the church’s ministry. This includes:

- Encouraging individuals to grow in faith and obedience to God’s commandments.
- Inspiring members to live lives that honor God, thus leaving a positive memory and testimony.
- Passing on biblical values and teachings that shape character and lifestyle.

Janet Treadway (2013) highlights that a legacy begins in the heart and response to God, with the Ten Commandments serving as a blueprint for building good memories and legacies within families and communities ([Treadway, 2013](https://www.ucg.org/beyond-today/blogs/what-memory-or-legacy-will-you-leave-behind)).

## Community Legacy

### Acts of Kindness and Social Impact

Churches leave a community legacy through acts of kindness, social outreach, and fostering a sense of belonging. Legacy Center Church promotes R.E.A.C.H ideas for random acts of kindness, adapting to contemporary challenges like social distancing ([Legacy Center Church](https://legacycenterchurch.org)).

### Building Community and Relationships

Legacy churches prioritize community involvement, encouraging members to get involved and build relationships. This strengthens social cohesion and provides support networks that extend beyond the church walls.

### Supporting Future Generations

Legacy gifts and ministries often focus on youth and future generations, ensuring the church remains relevant and impactful. For example, legacy gifts can fund youth ministries, refurbish facilities, or support mission partners ([Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org)).

## Material Legacy

### Financial Gifts and Stewardship

One of the most tangible legacies a church can leave is through financial stewardship, particularly gifts in wills (legacies). The Church of England reports that around 4,000 people annually leave gifts in their wills to their local churches, which fund mission projects, building maintenance, and community growth ([Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org)).

### Legacy Gifts Usage

Legacy gifts are often earmarked for special projects rather than everyday expenses, ensuring they make a significant difference. Examples include:

- Supporting youth ministries.
- Refurbishing kitchens or other facilities.
- Supporting overseas mission partners.
- Preserving historic church features like bells.
- Equipping the church with new Bibles.

This approach ensures the legacy gift contributes to the church's long-term mission and spiritual heritage ([Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org)).

### Financial Trends and Giving Patterns

A study of 1,231 churches in 2019 revealed key financial insights:

| Aspect                              | Statistic/Fact                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Total donations received (2018)   | $124.52 billion                                       |
| Average congregation size         | 65 people                                            |
| Median congregational revenue     | $169,000                                            |
| Percentage of revenue from individuals | 81%                                               |
| Percentage of giving digitally    | 22%, with rapid growth                                |
| Average gift by check             | $4,544                                              |
| Average digital gift              | $1,180                                              |
| Average cash gift                | $1,020                                              |
| Percentage spent on personnel     | 49% on average (varies by denomination)              |
| Percentage spent on missions      | 11% on average                                       |
| Missions budget allocation        | 61% local, 20% U.S., 19% international               |

These figures illustrate that while churches receive substantial donations, much of the giving is from individuals and small to medium gifts. Digital giving and recurring donations are growing trends that enhance financial stability ([Maxwell, 2019](http://get.tithe.ly)).

## Cultural Legacy

### Worship and Traditions

Churches pass down worship styles, liturgies, and traditions that shape their identity and influence future generations. Legacy Center Church, for example, emphasizes a purpose-driven model that integrates biblical values into worship and community life ([Legacy Center Church](https://legacycenterchurch.org)).

### Teaching and Leadership

Legacy includes the training and development of leaders who will continue the church's mission. Pastors Soboma and Faith Wokoma express a vision of transformation through the unchanging Word of God and leadership that fosters impact ([Legacy Center Church](https://legacycenterchurch.org)).

## Legacy in Memory and Character

Beyond material and organizational legacies, churches also leave a legacy in the memories and character they instill in individuals. As Janet Treadway (2013) notes, the legacy one leaves is often reflected in the stories and memories shared at funerals and in the lives of descendants. A church’s legacy, therefore, is also about shaping upright, faithful individuals who continue to bless their families and communities ([Treadway, 2013](https://www.ucg.org/beyond-today/blogs/what-memory-or-legacy-will-you-leave-behind)).

## Encouraging Legacy Giving

Churches can actively encourage legacy giving by:

- Providing information and literature about gifts in wills.
- Establishing clear legacy policies.
- Sharing stories of how past gifts have made a difference.
- Making legacy giving a part of their teaching and communication strategy.
- Offering tools like the PCC Legacy Toolkit from the Church of England ([Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org)).

## Conclusion

A church leaves a legacy that is spiritual, communal, material, and cultural. This legacy is expressed through transformed lives, strengthened communities, sustained ministries, and preserved heritage. Financial legacies, particularly gifts in wills, play a crucial role in enabling churches to make a lasting impact beyond regular giving. The integration of modern giving mechanisms such as digital and recurring donations further supports the church’s mission and legacy.

Legacy Center Church’s emphasis on identity, inheritance, and impact encapsulates the holistic nature of church legacy. Churches that nurture faith, foster community, steward resources wisely, and cultivate leadership will leave enduring legacies that bless future generations and honor God.
