# How Does Deforestation Cause Climate Change? — A Comprehensive Analysis

Deforestation, the large-scale removal of forest cover, is a critical environmental issue with profound implications for climate change. Forests play a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate system by sequestering carbon dioxide (CO₂), modulating energy and water fluxes, and maintaining biodiversity. The process of deforestation disrupts these functions, contributing significantly to global warming and climate change. This report provides an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of how deforestation causes climate change, integrating scientific findings, quantitative data, and biophysical mechanisms.

## 1. Deforestation as a Major Source of Greenhouse Gas Emissions

### 1.1 Carbon Storage and Release

Forests act as major carbon sinks, absorbing approximately one-fourth of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions annually through photosynthesis and storing carbon in biomass (trees, roots, leaves) and soils ([Science, 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac8083)). When forests are cleared or burned, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere primarily as CO₂, a potent greenhouse gas. This reversal of carbon sequestration accelerates the greenhouse effect.

- Tropical deforestation alone contributes about **2.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year**, accounting for roughly **6.5% of global CO₂ emissions** ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).
- As of 2019, deforestation is responsible for about **11% of global greenhouse gas emissions** ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).
- Averaged over 2015–2017, global loss of tropical forests contributed approximately **4.8 billion tonnes of CO₂ annually**, representing **8–10% of annual human CO₂ emissions** ([Climate Council, 2022](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/deforestation/)).

### 1.2 Forest Degradation and Peatland Emissions

Beyond outright deforestation, forest degradation—changes that negatively affect forest structure or function without reducing area—also contributes significantly to emissions. Including forest degradation and tropical peatland emissions raises the contribution of forest-related emissions to **up to 15%** of human-caused CO₂ emissions ([LSE Grantham Institute, 2017](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/whats-redd-and-will-it-help-tackle-climate-change/)).

Peatland degradation, often associated with deforestation, releases additional greenhouse gases (GHGs), further exacerbating climate change.

## 2. Biophysical Mechanisms Linking Deforestation and Climate Change

### 2.1 Changes in Surface Albedo and Energy Balance

Deforestation alters the Earth's surface reflectivity (albedo). Forests typically have a low albedo, absorbing more sunlight, but they also cool the surface through evapotranspiration. When forests are removed:

- The albedo generally **increases** in boreal regions (due to snow cover on cleared land), potentially causing **local cooling**.
- In tropical regions, deforestation **decreases albedo** less significantly, but the loss of evapotranspiration leads to **substantial warming** ([Science, 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac8083); [Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

### 2.2 Evapotranspiration and Water Cycle Disruption

Forests regulate the hydrological cycle by transpiring water vapor, which contributes to cloud formation and precipitation. The removal of forests disrupts this process:

- Loss of forest cover reduces evapotranspiration, leading to **decreased precipitation** and **drier climates** locally and regionally ([Yale e360, 2018](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-deforestation-affecting-global-water-cycles-climate-change)).
- This disruption can affect distant agricultural regions by altering atmospheric moisture transport, risking droughts in key breadbaskets such as the U.S. Midwest, India, and China ([Yale e360, 2018](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-deforestation-affecting-global-water-cycles-climate-change)).

### 2.3 Temperature Variability and Local Warming

Recent observational studies reveal that forest loss:

- Amplifies diurnal temperature variations (greater differences between day and night temperatures).
- Increases mean and maximum air temperatures, especially in arid and tropical zones ([Science, 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac8083)).

These biophysical effects contribute to localized warming that compounds the greenhouse gas-driven global warming.

## 3. Positive Feedback Loops Between Deforestation and Climate Change

Deforestation and climate change are linked in a **positive feedback loop**:

- Increased deforestation leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions and biophysical changes that warm the climate.
- Warming climate conditions, including more frequent and severe wildfires, droughts, and pest outbreaks, further degrade forests and accelerate deforestation ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

This feedback loop threatens to amplify climate change impacts and forest loss globally.

## 4. Broader Ecological and Climatic Impacts

### 4.1 Biodiversity Loss and Ecosystem Services

Deforestation leads to loss of biodiversity, which weakens ecosystem resilience and reduces the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks and climate regulators ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

### 4.2 Soil Degradation and Carbon Release

Clearing forests affects soil properties:

- Soil loses hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity.
- Soil temperature rises by 1–3°C due to loss of shading and moisture.
- Microbial biodiversity declines, reducing soil carbon sequestration.
- Soils become more susceptible to fires, releasing additional CO₂ ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

### 4.3 Forest Fires

Slash-and-burn agriculture and uncontrolled wildfires release large amounts of CO₂ and other GHGs, further contributing to climate change ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

## 6. Human Drivers and the Scale of Deforestation

Deforestation is driven by:

- Logging and timber extraction.
- Agricultural expansion (including livestock ranching).
- Urbanization and mining ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

Annually, approximately **75,700 square kilometers (18.7 million acres)** of forest are lost globally, with tropical forests being the most affected ([Wikipedia, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

## 7. Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive evidence, deforestation is a **major and multifaceted driver of climate change**. It contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, disrupts critical biophysical processes that regulate temperature and precipitation, and initiates feedback loops that exacerbate global warming. The loss of tropical forests, in particular, poses an urgent threat due to their outsized role in carbon storage and climate regulation.

While fossil fuel combustion remains the largest source of anthropogenic CO₂, deforestation ranks as the **second largest source**, responsible for approximately one-tenth to one-sixth of global emissions when including degradation and peatland effects. Moreover, the biophysical impacts of deforestation—such as altered albedo, evapotranspiration, and local temperature variability—amplify its climatic influence beyond carbon emissions alone.

In my assessment, **addressing deforestation must be a central pillar of climate change mitigation strategies**. Protecting existing forests, restoring degraded lands, and implementing sustainable land-use policies are critical to reducing emissions and preserving the climate-regulating functions of forests. Ignoring deforestation risks undermining global efforts to limit warming and threatens ecosystem stability and human livelihoods worldwide.
