## Eligibility Requirements for Naturalization

Before applying for U.S. citizenship, immigrants must meet specific eligibility criteria established by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The primary requirements include:

- **Age**: Applicants must be at least 18 years old.
- **Permanent Residency**: Must have been a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) for at least five years, or three years if married to a U.S. citizen.
- **Continuous Residence**: Must have lived continuously in the U.S. for at least five years prior to filing the application (or three years if married to a U.S. citizen).
- **Physical Presence**: Must have been physically present in the U.S. for at least 30 months out of the five years (or 18 months out of three years for spouses of U.S. citizens).
- **Residency in USCIS District**: Must have lived in the state or USCIS district where the application is filed for at least three months.
- **Good Moral Character**: Applicants must demonstrate good moral character during the statutory period.
- **English Language Proficiency**: Ability to speak, read, and write basic English.
- **Knowledge of U.S. Civics**: Basic understanding of U.S. history and government principles.

These requirements ensure that applicants have established strong ties to the United States and are prepared to uphold its laws and values ([Sintsirmas & Mueller Co.

## The Naturalization Process: Step-by-Step

The naturalization process consists of a series of steps that applicants must complete successfully. The USCIS outlines a ten-step process, which is widely recognized and followed:

| Step | Description                                                                                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **Determine if you are already a U.S. citizen** (e.g., by birth or through parents)               |
| 2     | **Determine eligibility** based on residency, age, moral character, and other criteria           |
| 3     | **Prepare and submit Form N-400, Application for Naturalization**, including supporting documents |
| 4     | **Pay the application and biometrics fees** ($725 total, including $85 biometrics fee)            |
| 5     | **Attend biometrics appointment** for fingerprinting and photographing                            |
| 6     | **Complete the naturalization interview** with a USCIS officer                                    |
| 7     | **Take the English and civics tests** during the interview                                        |
| 8     | **Receive a decision** from USCIS on the application                                              |
| 9     | **Attend the Oath of Allegiance ceremony**                                                        |
| 10    | **Receive Certificate of Naturalization** and officially become a U.S. citizen                    |

This structured process is designed to verify applicants’ eligibility, assess their knowledge of English and U.S. civics, and ensure their commitment to the United States ([USCIS, 2021](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization); [Path2USA, 2025](https://www.path2usa.com/us-citizenship-steps)).

---

### Step 1 & 2: Citizenship Status and Eligibility

Applicants first confirm they are not already U.S. citizens by birth or through parents. If not, they assess eligibility using USCIS guidelines, which consider residency duration, age, and other factors. Special eligibility tables help applicants determine if they qualify for exceptions or accommodations, such as for military service members ([USCIS, 2021](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

---

### Step 3 & 4: Application Preparation and Submission

Applicants must complete Form N-400, the official application for naturalization. This form can be submitted online or by mail. Along with the form, applicants must provide supporting documents proving eligibility, such as green card copies, tax returns, and evidence of residence. The total filing fee is $725, which includes the biometrics fee. After submission, applicants receive a receipt notice and can track their case status online ([Sintsirmas & Mueller Co. L.P.A., 2020](https://www.smimmigrationattorneys.com/blog/2020/june/the-steps-of-the-naturalization-process/); [USCIS, 2021](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

---

### Step 5: Biometrics Appointment

USCIS schedules a biometrics appointment where applicants are fingerprinted and photographed. These biometrics are used for background checks by the Department of Justice, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security. Clearance is required before proceeding to the interview stage ([International Rescue Committee, 2020](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

---

### Step 6 & 7: Interview and Testing

Applicants attend an in-person interview with a USCIS officer, who reviews the application and asks questions about the applicant’s background and eligibility. During the interview, applicants must pass English and civics tests, demonstrating the ability to read, write, and speak English and knowledge of U.S. history and government. Exemptions may apply for certain applicants based on age and disability ([USCIS, 2021](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization); [International Rescue Committee, 2020](https://www.rescue.org/article/how-immigrants-and-refugees-become-us-citizens)).

---

### Step 8: USCIS Decision

After the interview and tests, USCIS issues a decision. The application may be approved, continued (pending further review or additional documents), or denied. Applicants can appeal denials by requesting a hearing using Form N-336 ([Path2USA, 2025](https://www.path2usa.com/us-citizenship-steps)).

---

### Step 9 & 10: Oath of Allegiance and Citizenship

Upon approval, applicants receive a notice to attend a naturalization ceremony where they take the Oath of Allegiance, pledging loyalty to the United States. After the oath, they receive a Certificate of Naturalization, officially becoming U.S. citizens. They must surrender their green card at this time and can apply for a U.S. passport and register to vote ([Ask Ellis Staff, 2020](https://askellis.com/naturalization-becoming-us-citizen/); [USCIS, 2021](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)).

## Alternative Paths to Citizenship

While naturalization is the most common path, there are other routes to U.S. citizenship:

| Pathway                  | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Citizenship Through Birth | Automatic citizenship if born in the U.S. or certain territories                          |
| Citizenship Through Parents | Derived or acquired citizenship if born abroad to U.S. citizen parents                    |
| Citizenship Through Military Service | Expedited naturalization for those who serve honorably in the U.S. armed forces     |
| Citizenship Through Marriage | Naturalization after three years of permanent residency if married to a U.S. citizen     |

Military service members may qualify for expedited naturalization by serving honorably for at least one year and filing while in service or within six months of separation ([WikiHow, 2025](https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-US-Citizen); [Fileright, 2021](https://www.fileright.com/blog/4-ways-to-become-a-u-s-citizen/)).

## Challenges and Considerations

The naturalization process can be complex, time-consuming, and costly. The application fee alone is $725, and processing times can range from nine months to over two years depending on case complexity and USCIS backlogs. Applicants with criminal records, long absences from the U.S., or other complicating factors should seek legal assistance to improve their chances of approval and avoid costly mistakes ([VisaPlace, 2021](https://www.visaplace.com/usa-immigration/permanent-residence-green-card/citizenship/); [Ask Ellis Staff, 2020](https://askellis.com/naturalization-becoming-us-citizen/)).
