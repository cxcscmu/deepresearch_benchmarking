# Report: Should High Schools Dispense Contraceptives to Students?

## Introduction

The question of whether high schools should dispense contraceptives to students is a complex and often contentious issue that intersects public health, ethics, education, and parental rights. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the topic, drawing on multiple sources to evaluate the benefits, drawbacks, and ethical considerations surrounding contraceptive availability in high schools. The report concludes with a reasoned position based on the synthesis of current data and arguments.

## Background and Context

Teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain significant public health concerns in the United States. Despite declining teen pregnancy rates over the past decades, nearly 625,000 American teens became pregnant in 2010, and STIs continue to affect a substantial portion of adolescents (Kaplan, 2014; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015). High schools, as institutions responsible for adolescent education and welfare, have increasingly become venues for sexual health education and, in some cases, contraceptive distribution.

## Arguments in Favor of Dispensing Contraceptives in High Schools

### 1. Reduction in Teen Pregnancy and Associated Social Costs

Statistical evidence suggests that increased contraceptive use correlates with a decline in teen pregnancy rates. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services attributes the decline in teen pregnancies partly to increased contraceptive use and delayed sexual activity (DiSabito, 2014). The Contraceptive CHOICE Project demonstrated that providing free access to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as hormonal implants and IUDs drastically reduced pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates among at-risk teens, with pregnancy rates 41% lower than the national average (Kaplan, 2014).

Teen pregnancies impose significant economic burdens on society, costing taxpayers approximately $9.4 billion in 2010 due to healthcare, public assistance, and lost income from educational disruption (Debate.org, 2010; Kaplan, 2014). By providing contraceptives in schools, these costs can be mitigated through prevention.

### 2. Accessibility and Confidentiality for Teens

Many teenagers face barriers in obtaining contraceptives, including embarrassment, fear of parental judgment, and lack of transportation to clinics (DiSabito, 2014). Schools can provide a confidential and accessible environment where students can obtain contraceptives without stigma or logistical challenges. Approximately one in four U.S. public schools with health centers provide condoms or other contraceptives, albeit this represents less than 2% of all schools (Dimond, 2015).

### 3. Realistic Acknowledgment of Teen Sexual Behavior

Research indicates that a significant proportion of teens are sexually active, with many initiating sex at younger ages (Debate.org, 2025). Abstinence-only education has been found ineffective in preventing sexual activity and may even correlate with higher teen pregnancy rates (DiSabito, 2014). Providing contraceptives acknowledges this reality and equips teens to engage in safer sexual practices.

### 4. Comprehensive Sex Education and Harm Reduction

Contraceptive availability complements comprehensive sex education that addresses not only the mechanics of sex but also social and emotional aspects, promoting informed decision-making (Debate.org, 2025). This approach minimizes harm by reducing the risks of unintended pregnancy and STIs.

## Arguments Against Dispensing Contraceptives in High Schools

### 1. Potential Encouragement of Sexual Activity

Opponents argue that providing contraceptives in schools may implicitly encourage sexual activity among teens, undermining abstinence messages (Debate.org, 2025). Some parents and educators believe that access to contraceptives conflicts with moral or religious values and that schools should not facilitate behavior they consider inappropriate.

### 2. Ethical and Parental Rights Concerns

There is an ethical dilemma regarding minors’ autonomy versus parental rights. Many states do not require parental consent for minors to receive contraceptives, which some parents view as undermining their authority to guide their children's upbringing (Dimond, 2015). The ethical frameworks of the common good and rights approach highlight tensions between community welfare and individual/family rights.

### 3. Limited Evidence on Impact on STIs and Risk Behavior

Some studies have shown that condom distribution programs in the 1990s did not reduce teen birth rates and may have increased them slightly, especially when condoms were available without counseling (Green, 2016). This suggests that without proper education and counseling, contraceptive availability alone may not reduce risky sexual behavior or STIs.

### 4. Medical Supervision and Individual Health Needs

Contraceptives, especially hormonal methods, require medical supervision due to varying effects on individuals (Dimond, 2015). Schools may lack the capacity to provide personalized medical advice, raising concerns about safety and appropriateness.

## Analysis of Evidence

| Aspect                          | Supporting Dispensing Contraceptives                  | Opposing Dispensing Contraceptives                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Teen Pregnancy Rates**        | Decreased with increased contraceptive access (Kaplan, 2014) | Some programs increased births without counseling (Green, 2016) |
| **Access and Confidentiality** | Schools provide confidential access overcoming barriers (DiSabito, 2014) | Parental rights may be compromised (Dimond, 2015)      |
| **Sexual Activity Impact**      | Abstinence-only education ineffective; contraceptives reduce harm (DiSabito, 2014) | May encourage sexual activity (Debate.org, 2025)       |
| **STI Prevention**              | Condoms reduce STIs; comprehensive education essential (Debate.org, 2025) | Condom programs alone insufficient to control STIs (Green, 2016) |
| **Ethical Considerations**      | Common good approach supports community health (Dimond, 2015) | Rights approach emphasizes parental authority (Dimond, 2015) |
| **Medical Oversight**           | School health centers can provide contraceptives (Dimond, 2015) | Schools lack capacity for individualized medical care (Dimond, 2015) |

## Discussion

The evidence suggests that providing contraceptives in high schools, combined with comprehensive sex education, can significantly reduce teen pregnancy rates and associated social costs. The Contraceptive CHOICE Project exemplifies how removing barriers to effective contraception leads to better outcomes for teens at high risk (Kaplan, 2014). Accessibility and confidentiality are critical, as embarrassment and fear deter many teens from seeking contraceptives elsewhere (DiSabito, 2014).

However, the potential for contraceptive availability to encourage sexual activity remains a concern for some stakeholders. Yet, abstinence-only programs have not proven effective and may inadvertently increase risky behavior (DiSabito, 2014). The key lies in balanced education that respects moral perspectives while prioritizing health and safety.

Ethical tensions between parental rights and minors’ autonomy require careful navigation. While parents have legitimate interests in their children’s upbringing, denying teens access to contraceptives can lead to greater harm. Policies should strive for parental involvement while safeguarding minors’ health rights.

Medical supervision is essential, especially for hormonal contraceptives. Schools with health centers staffed by qualified professionals can address this need, but widespread implementation remains limited (Dimond, 2015).

## Conclusion and Position

Based on the comprehensive review of current data and ethical considerations, **high schools should be permitted and encouraged to dispense contraceptives to students**, provided that:

- Contraceptive distribution is integrated with comprehensive, age-appropriate sex education that includes information on abstinence, contraception, and STI prevention.
- Confidentiality for students is maintained to reduce barriers to access.
- Medical oversight is ensured through qualified health professionals in school health centers.
- Efforts are made to involve parents in education and health decisions, respecting family values while prioritizing student health.
- Programs include counseling to accompany contraceptive provision, mitigating risks of increased sexual activity without protection.

This approach balances public health benefits, ethical concerns, and practical realities, aiming to reduce teen pregnancy and STIs while respecting diverse perspectives.
