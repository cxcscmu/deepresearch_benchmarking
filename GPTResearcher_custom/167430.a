This report analyzes the available evidence, ethical considerations, and public opinion to provide a comprehensive, objective evaluation of the topic. Drawing on recent studies, expert opinions, and statistical data, the report aims to determine whether high schools dispensing contraceptives is beneficial, harmful, or neutral in terms of teen pregnancy rates, sexual health, and broader societal impacts.

## Overview of Teen Pregnancy and Contraceptive Use

Teen pregnancy rates in the United States have declined significantly over the past two decades. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this decline is attributable to increased contraceptive use and a growing number of teens delaying sexual activity ([DiSabito, 2014](https://dailycollegian.com/2014/03/high-school-provided-contraception-is-beneficial/)). Despite this progress, teenage pregnancy remains a common issue with substantial health, social, and economic consequences.

The availability and use of contraceptives are critical factors in preventing unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms remain the most commonly used contraceptive method among teens, but they have higher failure rates compared to hormonal birth control methods such as the pill or long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) ([Green, 2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/condoms-teens-pregnancy/489626/)).

## Arguments in Favor of Dispensing Contraceptives in High Schools

### 1. Reducing Teen Pregnancy and STIs

Proponents argue that since many teenagers are sexually active regardless of education or restrictions, providing contraceptives in schools offers a practical means to reduce unintended pregnancies and STIs. Alyssa DiSabito (2014) emphasizes that school-provided contraception removes barriers such as cost, embarrassment, and parental communication difficulties, thereby increasing access to protection and reducing risks ([DiSabito, 2014](https://dailycollegian.com/2014/03/high-school-provided-contraception-is-beneficial/)).

The Contraceptive CHOICE Project (2008-2013) demonstrated that providing free, effective contraceptives to teens resulted in a 41% lower pregnancy rate compared to the national average and a 79% lower rate compared to sexually experienced teens not in the program ([LA Times, 2014](https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-teen-pregnancy-contraception-choices-project-20141001-story.html)). This suggests that access to contraceptives, coupled with counseling, can significantly reduce teen pregnancy.

### 2. Promoting Safe Sex Practices

Comprehensive sex education combined with contraceptive availability has been shown to delay sexual initiation and increase safe sex practices. Studies reviewed by Parnes (2010) and Frost & Forrest (1995) indicate that health promotion interventions reduce sexual activity and increase contraceptive use among adolescents ([Parnes, 2010](https://clgonzalez6.weebly.com/literature-review.html); [McLaughlin & Broer, n.d.](https://rn-journal.com/journal-of-nursing/effectiveness-of-sexual-health-promotion-in-adolescents)).

### 3. Ethical and Public Health Considerations

From an ethical standpoint, schools have a duty to protect student welfare, which includes providing access to health services that prevent harm. The Common Good approach supports contraceptive distribution as it benefits the entire community by reducing teen pregnancies and STIs ([Preston, 2015](https://rampages.us/dimondpreston/2015/04/27/contraceptive-use-in-high-schools-is-it-ethical-for-public-high-schools-to-distribute-contraceptives-to-students/)).

Public opinion polls, such as the 2007 Associated Press-Ipsos survey, show that 67% of Americans support providing contraceptives in schools, with many favoring parental consent but recognizing the importance of access to protect teens ([CBS News, 2007](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/birth-control-at-school-most-say-its-ok/)).

## Arguments Against Dispensing Contraceptives in High Schools

### 1. Potential Increase in Teen Pregnancy Rates

Contrary to expectations, some studies suggest that condom distribution without adequate counseling may increase teen pregnancy rates. A 2016 study published in *The Atlantic* found that condom access programs in schools were associated with roughly two additional births per 1,000 teens, and this effect was more pronounced when condoms were available without counseling ([Green, 2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/condoms-teens-pregnancy/489626/)).

This counterintuitive finding raises concerns about unintended consequences of poorly implemented programs and highlights the importance of education alongside access.

### 2. Ethical Dilemmas Regarding Parental Consent

Many opponents argue that dispensing contraceptives in schools without parental consent infringes on parental rights to direct their children's upbringing and health decisions. The ethical conflict lies between the school's responsibility to protect students and parents' rights to be involved in such decisions ([Preston, 2015](https://rampages.us/dimondpreston/2015/04/27/contraceptive-use-in-high-schools-is-it-ethical-for-public-high-schools-to-distribute-contraceptives-to-students/)).

Some parents and community members feel that providing contraceptives in schools implicitly encourages sexual activity, which they oppose on moral or religious grounds ([CBS News, 2007](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/birth-control-at-school-most-say-its-ok/)).

### 3. Medical Supervision and Individual Needs

Critics also point out that contraceptives, especially hormonal methods, should be prescribed and monitored by healthcare professionals. Schools lack the medical expertise to tailor contraceptive methods to individual students' health needs, which can vary widely ([Debate.org, n.d.](https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-contraception-be-available-in-high-schools)).

## Recommendations and Conclusion

Based on the evidence, the decision to dispense contraceptives in high schools should be nuanced and accompanied by comprehensive sexual education and counseling. The key factors influencing the effectiveness of such programs include:

- **Mandatory Counseling:** Programs that provide counseling alongside contraceptive access are more effective in reducing teen pregnancy rates and promoting responsible sexual behavior.

- **Parental Involvement:** While respecting minors' rights to confidential care, schools should strive to engage parents in education efforts to balance ethical concerns.

- **Medical Support:** Schools with health centers staffed by qualified medical professionals can better tailor contraceptive methods to individual students, enhancing safety and effectiveness.

- **Shift Toward Hormonal Contraceptives:** Given the higher failure rates of condoms compared to hormonal methods, programs should consider facilitating access to LARCs and other effective birth control options, as seen in Colorado's Family Planning Initiative which reduced teen births by 5% ([Green, 2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/condoms-teens-pregnancy/489626/)).

In conclusion, **high schools should be able to dispense contraceptives to students**, provided that such programs are implemented with appropriate counseling, medical oversight, and efforts to involve parents where possible. This approach aligns with public health goals to reduce teen pregnancy and STIs, respects students' rights to confidential care, and addresses ethical concerns through transparency and education.
