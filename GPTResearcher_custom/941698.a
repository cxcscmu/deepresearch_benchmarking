# Report on Factors Creating Differences in Perceptions from Person to Person

## Introduction

Perception is the process through which individuals gather, interpret, and organize sensory information to understand their environment and the people within it. Despite encountering the same stimuli, different individuals often perceive and interpret information in distinct ways. These perceptual differences arise due to a complex interplay of individual characteristics, cultural backgrounds, cognitive processes, and situational contexts. This report provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the factors that contribute to these differences in perception, drawing on contemporary social psychological research and theory.

## 1. Perceiver Characteristics

### 1.1 Prior Experiences and Schemas

One of the foundational reasons for perceptual differences lies in the unique prior experiences and mental frameworks—known as schemas—that each perceiver brings to a situation. Schemas are cognitive structures that help individuals organize knowledge and guide information processing. Because no two individuals share identical life experiences, their schemas differ, leading to varied interpretations of the same behavior or stimuli.

For example, two people observing the same behavior of a mutual friend, Janetta, may form different impressions due to their distinct interactions and conversations with her. Moreover, even when witnessing the same behavior simultaneously, their schemas, attitudes, and expectations color their interpretations, ensuring that perceptions are not uniform (Dornbusch, Hastorf, Richardson, Muzzy, & Vreeland, 1965; Park, 1986).

### 1.2 Cognitive Accessibility

Cognitive accessibility refers to the ease with which certain personal characteristics or constructs come to mind for a perceiver. Differences in what traits or features are most accessible influence what aspects of others individuals attend to first and how they interpret those aspects.

For instance, someone who values physical appearance highly will more readily notice attractiveness, whereas another person might focus on athletic skills or clothing style. This selective attention shapes the impressions formed and can result in more overlap in descriptions provided by the same perceiver about different people than by different perceivers about the same person (Dornbusch et al., 1965; Park, 1986).

### 1.3 Need for Cognition

The need for cognition is an individual difference variable that describes the tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activities. People with a high need for cognition process information more deeply and carefully, leading to more thoughtful and nuanced causal attributions about others’ behaviors. Conversely, those with a low need for cognition tend to be more impulsive and make quicker, less reflective attributions (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982; Sargent, 2004).

Research indicates that individuals high in need for cognition are more likely to consider situational factors when evaluating others, resulting in more tolerant and less punitive judgments, especially regarding stigmatized groups (Van Hiel, Pandelaere, & Duriez, 2004).

### 1.4 Interest in People

Beyond general cognitive tendencies, individuals vary in their specific interest in understanding others. For example, psychology majors have been found to be more curious about people than natural science majors, which influences the types of attributions they make about behavior (Fletcher, Danilovics, Fernandez, Peterson, & Reeder, 1986).

### 1.5 Implicit Theories of Personality: Entity vs. Incremental Theorists

A critical individual difference in perception and attribution involves implicit theories about personality. Entity theorists believe that traits are fixed and stable, leading them to focus on personal attributions and trait explanations. Incremental theorists view personality as malleable and changing, making them more likely to consider situational factors in their attributions (Plaks, Levy, & Dweck, 2009).

When forced to make quick judgments, entity theorists tend to encode personal attributions but struggle with situational causes, whereas incremental theorists better incorporate situational information (Molden, Plaks, & Dweck, 2006).

These attributional styles influence not only perceptions of others but also self-perceptions and responses to challenges. Incremental theorists tend to be more optimistic and adaptable, performing better in novel situations, while entity theorists may struggle due to fixed beliefs about their abilities (Malle, Knobe, O’Laughlin, Pearce, & Nelson, 2000).

## 2. Cultural Influences on Perception

Culture profoundly shapes how individuals perceive others and interpret behavior. Differences between individualistic cultures (e.g., United States, Canada, Australia) and collectivistic cultures (e.g., Japan, China, India) exemplify this influence.

### 2.1 Individualism vs. Collectivism

People from individualistic cultures emphasize the individual as autonomous and responsible for their actions, leading to a focus on personal attributions. In contrast, collectivistic cultures emphasize relationships and contextual factors, resulting in greater attention to situational explanations (Ji, Peng, & Nisbett, 2000; Lewis, Goto, & Kong, 2008; Maddux & Yuki, 2006).

For example, in a study comparing children and adults in India (collectivist) and the United States (individualist), older participants from the U.S. made more personal attributions for negative actions, whereas Indian participants favored situational attributions (Miller, 1984).

### 2.2 Holistic vs. Analytic Perception

Cultural differences extend to perceptual processing styles. East Asians tend to process scenes holistically, attending to context and background, while Westerners focus more on salient objects (Masuda & Nisbett, 2001). This affects memory and description of social scenes, influencing person perception.

### 2.3 Biculturalism and Cultural Priming

Individuals exposed to multiple cultures may shift their attributional styles depending on cultural cues. For instance, Hong Kong students primed with American cultural symbols made more personal attributions, whereas those primed with Chinese symbols emphasized situational factors (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martínez, 2000).

### 2.4 Cultural Narratives in Self-Description

Athletes from China often attribute success to situational factors like coaches and spectators, whereas American athletes emphasize personal traits such as determination and focus (Kim & Markus, 1999). This reflects broader cultural narratives about the self and agency.

## 3. Attributional Styles and Mental Health

Individual differences in attributional style—the habitual way people explain causes of events—affect perceptions and reactions to both others and oneself.

### 3.1 Negative vs. Positive Attributional Styles

Negative attributional style involves explaining negative events as caused by internal, stable, and global factors (e.g., “I failed because I am no good,” “I always fail,” “I fail at everything”). This style is linked to feelings of hopelessness, depression, and learned helplessness (Metalsky, Joiner, Hardin, & Abramson, 1993; Alloy, Abramson, & Francis, 1999).

Conversely, a positive attributional style attributes failures to external, unstable, and specific causes (e.g., “The task was difficult,” “I will do better next time,” “I failed in this domain but not others”), fostering persistence and better mental health (Boyer, 2006; Vines & Nixon, 2009).

### 3.2 Learned Helplessness

Learned helplessness arises when individuals make external, stable, and global attributions for negative outcomes, leading to passivity and lack of control (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978; Seligman, 1975). This phenomenon has been linked to various negative health outcomes, including anxiety and depression (Henry, 2005; Peterson & Seligman, 1984).

### 3.3 Self-Handicapping

Self-handicapping is an attributional strategy where individuals create external excuses for potential failure, either by claiming external impediments beforehand or by engaging in behaviors that reduce the likelihood of success (Berglas & Jones, 1978). Men tend to engage in self-handicapping more frequently than women, possibly due to greater concern with self-esteem and social status (Hirt, Deppe, & Gordon, 1991).

While self-handicapping can protect self-esteem in the short term, it is associated with lower life satisfaction, poorer moods, reduced competence, and increased substance abuse (Zuckerman & Tsai, 2005; Schwinger, Wirthwein, Lemmer, & Steinmayr, 2014).

## 4. Personality and Perception

Personality traits influence how individuals perceive others and interpret social information.

### 4.1 The Big Five Personality Traits

The Big Five traits—extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness—shape perception and social interaction (McCrea, 2001). For example:

| Trait          | Description                                   | Influence on Perception                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Extraversion   | Sociability and interest in social interaction | Extroverts may attend more to social cues    |
| Agreeableness  | Trustworthiness and friendliness               | High agreeableness leads to more positive perceptions |
| Conscientiousness | Organization and dependability                | May influence attention to detail            |
| Neuroticism    | Emotional instability and negative affect      | May bias perception towards threat or negativity |
| Openness       | Creativity and openness to new experiences     | May influence receptivity to novel information |

### 4.2 Assumed Similarity

People tend to perceive others as similar to themselves, especially when lacking sufficient information. This "assumed similarity" can bias perception and lead to inaccurate judgments (Beer & Watson, 2008). We tend to like traits in others that we value in ourselves and dislike traits we find undesirable.

### 4.3 Implicit Personality Theories

Individuals use implicit personality theories—experience-based assumptions about how traits cluster—to form impressions quickly. While these provide perceptual shortcuts, they can also lead to errors such as halo or horn effects, where one trait influences overall perception (Malle et al., 2000).

## 5. Contextual and Situational Factors

Context influences perception by providing background information that shapes interpretation. For example, recognizing a familiar face in an unusual setting may be delayed due to contextual incongruence. Similarly, situational cues can moderate the attributions people make about behavior (Park, 1986).

## 6. Sensory and Cultural Variations in Basic Perception

Even basic sensory perceptions vary across cultures. For instance, reactions to smells, tastes, sounds, and touch differ culturally, influencing initial sensory processing and subsequent interpretation (McCornack, 2007). These differences can cascade into higher-level social perceptions.

| Sensory and Cultural Variations | Differences in sensory processing (smell, taste, sound, touch) | Affects initial perception and cultural meaning  | McCornack (2007)                      |

## Conclusion

Perceptual differences among individuals arise from a complex set of interrelated factors. Individual differences in prior experiences, cognitive accessibility, need for cognition, and implicit theories shape how people attend to and interpret social information. Cultural backgrounds further influence perception by framing attributional styles and processing modes. Personality traits and assumed similarity biases affect the traits and attitudes perceived in others. Additionally, attributional styles influence emotional and behavioral responses to social stimuli, while contextual and sensory variations modify the initial reception and interpretation of information.

Understanding these factors is crucial for appreciating the subjective nature of person perception and for fostering more accurate and empathetic social interactions. Awareness of these influences can help mitigate misunderstandings and promote more effective communication across diverse individuals and cultures.
