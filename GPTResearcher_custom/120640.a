# Report: How Family Background Affects the Way One Sees the World

## Introduction

Family background is a foundational element that profoundly shapes an individual's worldview. It encompasses cultural heritage, socioeconomic status, parental values, and the environment in which one is nurtured. This report explores how family background influences perception, attitudes, and behaviors towards the world, drawing from diverse personal narratives, scholarly insights, and cultural analyses. The objective is to present a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of this influence, supported by relevant examples and research findings.

## Influence of Family Background on Worldview

### 1. Cultural Heritage and Multicultural Exposure

One of the most significant ways family background affects worldview is through cultural heritage. Individuals raised in multicultural families often develop a broader, more inclusive perspective. For example, Sean Martin Johnson, born into a military family with a Japanese American mother, experienced a blend of American and Japanese cultures. This bicultural upbringing enabled him to appreciate diverse customs, languages, and values, fostering adaptability and cross-cultural competence (Johnson, 2010).

Similarly, Aishah Eljirby’s experience growing up between American and Arab cultures enriched her understanding of cultural diversity and tolerance. Her children are raised bilingually and biculturally, which she believes prepares them for a globalized world that values multicultural fluency (Eljirby, 2019).

| Aspect                    | Example                                        | Impact on Worldview                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Bicultural upbringing     | Japanese-American family (Johnson, 2010)       | Enhanced cultural adaptability and empathy  |
| Multicultural parenting   | Arab-American family (Eljirby, 2019)            | Increased tolerance and global awareness     |
| Language acquisition      | Bilingual children in multicultural homes      | Cognitive advantages and communication skills|

### 2. Socioeconomic Status and Opportunities

Family socioeconomic status (SES) plays a critical role in shaping opportunities and, consequently, worldview. For instance, a Hispanic family background characterized by early poverty but striving for stability and education provided a strong work ethic and resilience to the individual in the narrative. Despite hardships, the family prioritized education and moral values, which influenced the individual’s optimistic and determined outlook on life (Anonymous, n.d.).

Conversely, individuals from military families often experience discipline, structure, and exposure to diverse environments, which can cultivate a worldview centered on service, responsibility, and global awareness (Johnson, 2010).

| SES Factor                | Example                                        | Impact on Worldview                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Poverty and resilience    | Hispanic migrant family                          | Emphasis on hard work and perseverance       |
| Military family discipline| Military family with long service history       | Values of duty, structure, and global outlook|

### 3. Family Values and Parenting Styles

Parenting styles and family values directly influence personality development and worldview formation. Research indicates that supportive, nurturing environments promote positive attitudes and self-efficacy, whereas overly strict or neglectful parenting can lead to fear or rebellion (Goldsmith, 2000).

For example, a case study highlighted a child who forged a signature due to fear of stern parental discipline, illustrating how harsh parenting can negatively affect trust and responsibility development (Goldsmith, 2000). In contrast, families emphasizing encouragement and support foster confidence and openness to learning.

### 4. Impact of Family Experiences and Relationships

Family relationships and experiences shape emotional intelligence and social attitudes. The loss of a parent or close family member, as described by one individual reflecting on their father's death, deepened their appreciation for relationships and instilled values of acceptance and compassion (Anonymous, n.d.).

Furthermore, growing up in diverse communities, such as the Bay Area’s multicultural environment, can reinforce inclusive worldviews and reduce prejudice (Anonymous, n.d.).

### 5. Language and Education

Language acquisition within the family context is pivotal. Children raised in bilingual homes develop enhanced cognitive skills and cultural awareness. For example, children learning Japanese and English simultaneously, as in Johnson’s family, benefit from improved analytical abilities and cultural literacy (Johnson, 2010).

Education, both formal and cultural, reinforces worldview. Attending schools that reflect family heritage or cultural values strengthens identity and broadens perspectives.

Multicultural and bilingual upbringings foster adaptability and inclusivity, while socioeconomic challenges instill perseverance. Parenting approaches critically affect personality and responsibility development. Ultimately, family background provides the lens through which individuals interpret experiences, shaping their worldview in profound and lasting ways.
