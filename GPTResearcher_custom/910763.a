## Key Uses of LinkedIn Learning by Companies

### 1. **Upskilling and Reskilling as a Strategic Priority**

A majority of Learning & Development professionals (59%) identify upskilling and reskilling as their top priority ([LinkedIn Learning, 2022](https://learning.linkedin.com/?trk=lynda_redirect_learning&disableLocaleAutoRedirect=true)). Companies leverage LinkedIn Learning to:

- Keep pace with rapidly changing job skills.
- Address skill gaps identified through data analytics.
- Prepare employees for evolving roles and technologies.

The World Economic Forum projects that one-third of core job skills will change within the next five years, underscoring the urgency for continuous learning ([World Economic Forum](https://learning.linkedin.com/en-us/for-entire-companies?disableLocaleAutoRedirect=true&trk=lil-b2b-nav_business_member&src=li-learning-nav)).

### 2. **Scaling Learning Programs Across Organizations**

LinkedIn Learning enables companies to scale their learning initiatives efficiently. The platform supports both employee-driven and management-driven learning, fostering a culture of continuous development. Its robust infrastructure allows organizations to distribute relevant, professionally produced content to a broad employee base without the logistical challenges of traditional training.

### 3. **Increasing Employee Engagement and Retention**

Employee engagement is a critical concern for companies, with lack of professional development being the primary reason employees leave their jobs. LinkedIn Learning addresses this by providing:

- Engaging, high-quality content taught by real-world experts.
- Consistently updated courses to maintain relevance.
- A familiar platform integrated with LinkedIn’s professional network.

This approach helps companies retain top talent by meeting the learning needs of modern employees and increasing overall job satisfaction ([LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/en-us/for-entire-companies?disableLocaleAutoRedirect=true&trk=lil-b2b-nav_business_member&src=li-learning-nav)).

### 4. **Personalized and Data-Driven Learning**

LinkedIn Learning leverages proprietary skills data from LinkedIn’s vast professional network to inform course development and recommend personalized learning paths. This data-driven strategy allows companies to:

- Identify in-demand skills relevant to their industry.
- Tailor content to individual employee needs.
- Close critical skills gaps effectively.

The platform’s analytics provide strategic insights that help L&D leaders make informed decisions about learning investments and measure impact ([LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/?trk=d_flagship3_nav&veh=learning_solutions&src=li-nav)).

### 5. **Fostering Social and Collaborative Learning Environments**

More than half of learners value social and collaborative learning environments, both in the office and online. LinkedIn Learning enhances engagement through social features that connect learners with instructors and peers, promoting knowledge sharing and community building. Learners who use these social features watch 30 times more hours of content, indicating a significant boost in engagement ([LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/?src=li-footer&trk=homepage-basic_directory_learningMicrositeUrl)).
