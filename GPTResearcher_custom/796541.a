# Report on the Increasing Incidence of Domestic Violence: Causes and Contributing Factors

## Introduction

Domestic violence (DV) remains a pervasive social issue globally, with alarming increases reported in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite numerous awareness campaigns and interventions, the prevalence of domestic violence continues to rise, posing severe physical, psychological, and social consequences for victims, predominantly women and children. This report aims to provide a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of the factors contributing to the increase in domestic violence, drawing on recent empirical studies, government reports, and expert analyses. The report also integrates data from various countries to offer a global perspective.

## Overview of Domestic Violence Trends

Domestic violence is defined as physical, sexual, emotional, or economic abuse by an intimate partner or family member. Data from the United States Office on Violence Against Women indicate that a woman is assaulted every nine seconds, making DV the leading cause of injury to women in the country (Bell, 2013). Globally, one in three women experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime (UN Women, 2020).

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue, with many countries reporting significant surges in DV cases during lockdowns and social distancing measures. For instance, police calls for domestic violence increased by approximately 7.5% to 9.7% in 14 U.S. cities following the implementation of social distancing (Leslie & Wilson, 2021). Similar trends have been observed worldwide, with some regions reporting increases of 20% or more (Leboeuf, 2021; Wikipedia, 2024).

## Key Factors Contributing to the Increase in Domestic Violence

### 1. Intergenerational Transmission of Violence

Research shows that exposure to abuse in childhood is a strong predictor of perpetrating or experiencing domestic violence in adulthood. Individuals who witnessed or experienced family violence often internalize these behaviors as normative, perpetuating a cycle of abuse (Kwong et al., 2003; Lünnemann et al., 2019). This social learning mechanism makes breaking patterns of violence challenging.

### 2. Power and Control Dynamics

Abusive behavior often stems from a desire to exert power and control over another individual. For some perpetrators, especially those with histories of childhood abuse, controlling an intimate partner provides a sense of empowerment and self-worth (Bell, 2013). This psychological need can drive persistent abusive behaviors.

### 3. Societal and External Stressors

External factors such as economic hardship, substance abuse, and exposure to violence in media contribute to increased domestic violence. Economic downturns, unemployment, and poverty elevate stress levels, which can trigger or intensify abusive behavior (Ely, Dulmus, & Wodarski, 2004; Leboeuf, 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic intensified these stressors by causing widespread job losses and financial insecurity.

### 4. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdowns

The pandemic created conditions conducive to domestic violence escalation:

- **Increased Time at Home:** Stay-at-home orders increased the time victims spent with abusers, raising the risk of abuse (Leslie & Wilson, 2021).
- **Social Isolation:** Restrictions limited victims' access to support networks and services, increasing their vulnerability (UN Women, 2020).
- **Economic Insecurity:** Job losses and financial stress heightened tensions within households (Leboeuf, 2021).
- **Reduced Access to Help:** Many support services and shelters were overwhelmed or limited due to health restrictions (Wikipedia, 2024).

### 5. Fear and Barriers to Leaving Abusive Relationships

Victims often remain in abusive relationships due to fear of retaliation, economic dependence, lack of safe alternatives, and emotional attachment. The pandemic exacerbated these barriers by restricting movement and reducing available resources (Bell, 2013; Lyons, 2020).

### 6. Increased Reporting and Awareness

Some increases in reported cases may reflect improved awareness and willingness to report abuse, as well as increased third-party reporting due to neighbors spending more time at home (Leslie & Wilson, 2021). However, underreporting remains a significant issue.

## Psychological and Social Consequences

Domestic violence has profound impacts on victims, including physical injuries, mental health disorders (e.g., PTSD, depression), and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (Ely et al., 2004). Children exposed to domestic violence suffer emotional trauma and are at risk of perpetuating violence in future relationships (Lünnemann et al., 2019).

## Policy and Intervention Implications

Given the multifaceted causes of increasing domestic violence, effective interventions require:

- **Enhanced Support Services:** Increased funding and accessibility for shelters, hotlines, and counseling services, especially during crises like pandemics.
- **Economic Support:** Addressing financial insecurity through social welfare programs to reduce stress-related triggers.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns:** Educating communities to recognize and report domestic violence.
- **Legal Protections:** Strengthening laws and enforcement to protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable.
- **Targeted Interventions:** Programs addressing intergenerational violence transmission and perpetrator rehabilitation.

## Conclusion

The increase in domestic violence is a complex phenomenon driven by interrelated factors including historical abuse patterns, power dynamics, societal stressors, and acute crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic insecurity, social isolation, and barriers to seeking help have particularly intensified the problem during recent years. Addressing this rise requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches that combine prevention, support, and policy reforms to protect victims and break the cycle of abuse.
