# Report on the Increasing Rates of Domestic Violence: Causes and Contributing Factors

Domestic violence (DV) is a pervasive social issue that transcends cultural, economic, and geographic boundaries. Despite ongoing efforts to combat it, evidence indicates that domestic violence rates have been increasing globally, with notable surges during specific periods such as economic downturns and the COVID-19 pandemic. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted reasons behind the rise in domestic violence, drawing on recent research and data from diverse and reliable sources. The objective is to present an in-depth, evidence-based understanding of why domestic violence is increasing, highlighting key contributing factors and contextual influences.

## 1. Generational Cycles and Learned Behavior

One of the most significant and well-documented contributors to the persistence and increase of domestic violence is the generational cycle of abuse. Studies worldwide indicate that individuals who experience abuse during childhood are more likely to become perpetrators or victims of domestic violence in adulthood. This cycle is perpetuated by the normalization of violence as a method of conflict resolution or control within family environments.

Children exposed to verbal threats, intimidation, physical violence, or emotional abuse often internalize these behaviors as acceptable or inevitable. For example, witnessing a parent’s violent behavior or experiencing neglect can imprint on a child’s psyche that violence is a means to exert power or solve problems. This learned behavior manifests later in intimate relationships, perpetuating the cycle of abuse ([All About Life Challenges, n.d.](https://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org/causes-of-domestic-violence-faq.htm); [Weekly Living, 2013](https://weeklyliving.com/5-reasons-domestic-violence-increasing/)).

## 2. Power, Control, and Psychological Factors

Domestic violence fundamentally revolves around power and control. Abusers often seek to dominate their partners to compensate for feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem, or unresolved childhood trauma. Psychological disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and drug abuse can exacerbate these tendencies, although they are not sole causes.

The need for control can be intensified by external stressors, including economic hardship, unemployment, and social isolation. Abusers may feel empowered by controlling another person, especially if they previously experienced powerlessness. This dynamic is a critical driver of domestic violence and explains why abuse can escalate during periods of increased stress or instability ([Domestic Violence Objectives, n.d.](https://domesticviolence340.weebly.com/objectives.html); [Weekly Living, 2013](https://weeklyliving.com/5-reasons-domestic-violence-increasing/)).

## 3. Economic Stress and Financial Insecurity

Economic hardship is a major catalyst for domestic violence. Loss of employment, poverty, and financial insecurity increase household tensions and frustrations, often triggering violent outbursts. The inability to meet financial obligations, such as paying bills or buying necessities, can lead to feelings of helplessness and anger, which may be displaced onto intimate partners or family members.

Research shows that domestic violence peaks during financially stressful periods, such as the Christmas season, when financial pressures mount. The stress of economic instability undermines coping mechanisms, increasing the likelihood of violence in the home ([All About Life Challenges, n.d.](https://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org/causes-of-domestic-violence-faq.htm); [Psychology Today, 2012](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/compassion-matters/201210/why-domestic-violence-occurs-and-how-stop-it)).

## 4. Societal and Cultural Influences

Cultural norms and societal structures play a significant role in domestic violence prevalence. In many societies, gender biases and patriarchal values perpetuate the notion of male dominance and female subordination, which can legitimize or obscure abusive behaviors. Beliefs that women are inferior or property of men contribute to the normalization of violence against women.

Additionally, societal acceptance of violence, as portrayed in media or cultural narratives, can desensitize individuals to abusive behavior. Exposure to violence in media, where aggressors are sometimes glorified, may influence real-life behavior, reinforcing violent patterns ([PhD Essay, 2022](https://phdessay.com/psychological-sociological-theories-domestic-violence/); [Weekly Living, 2013](https://weeklyliving.com/5-reasons-domestic-violence-increasing/)).

## 5. Substance Abuse

Alcohol and drug abuse are strongly correlated with domestic violence. Substance abuse impairs judgment and self-control, often leading to out-of-control behavior and increased aggression. Families with substance abuse problems frequently experience poor emotional health, which fuels anger and violent incidents.

Substance abuse acts as both a trigger and a complicating factor, making it harder for abusers to regulate emotions and for victims to seek help. The cyclical nature of addiction and violence often traps families in ongoing abuse ([All About Life Challenges, n.d.](https://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org/causes-of-domestic-violence-faq.htm)).

## 6. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdowns

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have had a profound impact on domestic violence rates worldwide. Research from multiple countries, including the United States, India, Spain, and the UK, shows a significant increase in domestic violence incidents during periods of quarantine and restricted movement.

### Key Findings:

| Factor | Impact on Domestic Violence |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| **Isolation** | Victims are confined with abusers, limiting access to help and increasing exposure to violence. |
| **Economic Uncertainty** | Job losses and financial stress exacerbate tensions and increase abuse risk. |
| **Reduced Social Services** | Overburdened healthcare and social systems reduce support availability for victims. |
| **Changes in Reporting** | Increase in third-party reporting and hotline calls, indicating heightened awareness but also barriers to direct victim reporting. |
| **Shift in Abuse Patterns** | Increase in abuse by current partners and family members; decrease in abuse by ex-partners during lockdowns. |

For instance, the National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice (NCCCJ) reported an 8.1% increase in domestic violence incidents in the US during lockdowns, with a 131% increase in complaints in India’s strict lockdown zones. Similarly, domestic abuse hotlines in Spain and France saw increases of 18% and 30%, respectively, during lockdown periods ([LSE Research Online, 2020](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/108483/); [Foundation for Economic Education, 2020](https://fee.org/articles/domestic-violence-more-than-doubled-under-lockdowns-new-study-finds/); [CNN, 2021](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/01/us/domestic-violence-pandemic-trnd/index.html)).

## 7. Fear and Barriers to Leaving Abusive Relationships

Victims often remain in abusive relationships due to fear, economic dependence, social stigma, or lack of access to support services. This reluctance to leave allows abuse to continue and often escalate.

During crises such as the pandemic, these barriers are heightened. Economic insecurity, fear of deportation (for undocumented immigrants), and reduced social safety nets make it harder for victims to seek help or escape abusive environments. The lack of a robust social safety net in some countries, especially the United States, exacerbates these issues ([Medium, 2020](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/why-is-domestic-violence-rising-during-the-pandemic-fbf4dd7e1f8e); [Redefy, 2020](https://www.redefy.org/stories/domestic-abuse-rates-are-rising-heres-why)).

## 8. Young Couples and Situational Violence

Research indicates that domestic violence among young couples often differs from that in long-term relationships. Situational violence, characterized by physical aggression in response to specific conflicts rather than a pattern of control, is more common among younger individuals.

This type of violence may increase during stressful life transitions or breakups, which are more frequent in younger populations. The rise in break-up violence among teenagers and young adults is a concerning trend contributing to overall increases in domestic violence ([Contexts, 2015](https://contexts.org/blog/quicklit-6-recent-sociological-findings-on-domestic-violence/); [Weekly Living, 2013](https://weeklyliving.com/5-reasons-domestic-violence-increasing/)).

## 9. Summary Table of Key Factors Contributing to the Increase in Domestic Violence

| Factor | Description | Evidence/Impact |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Generational Cycle | Abuse learned and perpetuated across generations | High risk of adult abuse among childhood abuse survivors |
| Power and Control | Abuser’s need for dominance, often linked to psychological issues | Central motive in DV cases |
| Economic Stress | Financial hardship increases household tensions | DV peaks during economic downturns and holidays |
| Societal Norms | Cultural acceptance of gender inequality and violence | Normalizes abuse, especially against women |
| Substance Abuse | Alcohol and drugs impair control and increase aggression | Strong correlation with DV incidents |
| COVID-19 Pandemic | Lockdowns increase isolation and economic stress | Significant spikes in DV reports globally |
| Barriers to Leaving | Fear, economic dependence, and stigma prevent escape | Sustains cycles of abuse |
| Youth and Situational Violence | Conflict-driven aggression in young couples | Increasing trend in break-up violence |

## Conclusion

The increase in domestic violence is a complex phenomenon driven by an interplay of individual, relational, societal, and situational factors. The generational cycle of abuse, psychological needs for power and control, economic stress, cultural norms, and substance abuse form a foundational framework explaining the persistence and growth of domestic violence. The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst, amplifying existing vulnerabilities through isolation, economic insecurity, and reduced access to support services.

Addressing the rise in domestic violence requires multifaceted interventions targeting these root causes. Prevention efforts must focus on breaking the cycle of abuse through education and support for at-risk families, improving economic stability, challenging harmful cultural norms, and expanding access to mental health and substance abuse treatment. Additionally, strengthening social safety nets and ensuring accessible support services during crises are critical to protecting vulnerable populations.

While the challenge is formidable, emerging evidence suggests that well-designed programs targeting societal attitudes and providing comprehensive support can reduce domestic violence rates over time. Continued research, policy formulation, and resource allocation are essential to reversing the upward trend and fostering safer communities.
