# What Do People Look for in a President? A Comprehensive Analysis of Leadership Qualities Desired by Americans

## Introduction

The qualities that Americans seek in a president have long been a subject of interest for political analysts, candidates, and voters alike. Understanding these qualities is crucial for candidates aiming to align their campaigns with voter expectations and for voters who wish to make informed decisions. This report synthesizes findings from multiple reputable surveys and studies conducted between 2016 and 2022, including polls by YouGov, Gallup, Pew Research Center, INSIDER, and Sachs Media Group. The goal is to provide a detailed, data-driven, and objective overview of the leadership qualities Americans prioritize in a president, how these preferences vary across political and demographic lines, and how current and past candidates measure up against these expectations.

## Key Leadership Qualities Desired by Americans

### 1. Taking Responsibility

One of the most universally valued leadership qualities is the ability to take responsibility. According to a July 2020 YouGov poll, 85% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans rated "taking responsibility" as very important for a president, making it the top characteristic for both parties ([Ballard, 2020](https://news.yahoo.com/leadership-qualities-americans-president-061500595.html)).

### 2. Honesty and Integrity

Honesty consistently ranks as a critical trait. The same YouGov poll found that 81% of Democrats and a majority of Republicans also value honesty highly. Gallup polling from September 2020 similarly showed that Americans perceive Joe Biden as more honest and trustworthy compared to Donald Trump, with 74% of Biden supporters rating him honest versus 66% of Trump supporters rating Trump so ([Jones, 2020](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321208/americans-view-biden-likable-honest-trump-strong.aspx)).

### 3. Competence

Competence is another top priority. YouGov data indicated that 77% of Democrats and a significant portion of Republicans consider competence very important. Supporters of both Biden (74%) and Trump (76%) believe their candidate possesses this quality ([Ballard, 2020](https://news.yahoo.com/leadership-qualities-americans-president-061500595.html)).

### 4. Strength and Decisiveness

Strength is particularly valued by Republicans, with 76% saying it is important, and 89% of Trump supporters perceiving Trump as strong. Gallup polls confirm that Trump is seen as a strong and decisive leader by a majority, while Biden scores lower in this dimension ([Ballard, 2020](https://news.yahoo.com/leadership-qualities-americans-president-061500595.html); [Jones, 2020](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321208/americans-view-biden-likable-honest-trump-strong.aspx)).

### 5. Empathy and Compassion

Democrats tend to value empathy more highly than Republicans (69% vs. 48%). Biden supporters rate him higher on empathy (73%) compared to Trump supporters rating Trump (55%) ([Ballard, 2020](https://news.yahoo.com/leadership-qualities-americans-president-061500595.html)).

### 6. Audacity and Boldness

Audacity is more associated with Trump, with 65% of his supporters attributing this quality to him, while only 26% of Biden supporters say the same of Biden ([Ballard, 2020](https://news.yahoo.com/leadership-qualities-americans-president-061500595.html)).

### 7. Other Qualities: Sense of Humor, Open-Mindedness, and Education

Sachs Media Group's 2015 survey highlighted generational differences: Millennials prioritize a highly educated, charismatic, motivating, and compassionate candidate, while older voters emphasize strength, decisiveness, patriotism, and the ability to command respect internationally. Both groups value open-mindedness and a sense of humor ([Sachs Media Group, 2015](https://sachsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sachs-Media-Presidential-Survey.pdf)).

## Demographic and Ideological Variations in Desired Qualities

### Political Party Differences

- **Republicans**: Value strength, decisiveness, and audacity. They tend to rate Trump highly on these traits.
- **Democrats**: Prioritize honesty, competence, and empathy. Biden is viewed more favorably on these dimensions.
- **Independents**: Tend to favor Biden on honesty and empathy but see Trump as stronger and more decisive ([Ballard, 2020](https://news.yahoo.com/leadership-qualities-americans-president-061500595.html)).

### Age Differences

- **Millennials (18-34)**: Emphasize education, charisma, compassion, and motivation.
- **Older Voters (65+)**: Place more importance on strength, decisiveness, patriotism, and international respect.
- Both groups agree on the importance of honesty, trustworthiness, open-mindedness, and sense of humor, though middle-aged voters (35-64) are less enthusiastic about these traits ([Sachs Media Group, 2015](https://sachsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sachs-Media-Presidential-Survey.pdf)).

## Resume and Background Qualities Valued by Voters

INSIDER's 2019 poll identified specific resume attributes that increase voter likelihood to support a candidate:

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive data reviewed, Americans overwhelmingly desire a president who takes responsibility, demonstrates honesty, and exhibits competence. These qualities form the foundation of effective and trustworthy leadership. However, ideological and demographic differences influence the weighting of other traits such as strength, empathy, and audacity.

Republicans prioritize strength and decisiveness, aligning with their perception of Donald Trump, while Democrats emphasize honesty and empathy, aligning with Joe Biden’s image. Independents often serve as a balancing group, valuing a mix of these traits.

Candidates who combine these core qualities with a strong resume—governorship, vice presidency, military service, transparency, and relatability—tend to be more favorably viewed by voters. However, possessing these qualities does not guarantee electoral success, as campaign dynamics and broader political contexts also play critical roles.

In my objective assessment, the most critical leadership quality that transcends party lines and demographics is the ability to take responsibility. This trait underpins accountability and trust, which are essential for effective governance. Honesty and competence closely follow, as they ensure that the president can be trusted and is capable of managing complex national and international issues.

Candidates and political strategists should focus on demonstrating these core qualities authentically while also addressing the nuanced preferences of their target voter demographics to build broad-based support.
