# Report on National and Local Policies That Help Protect People from Abuse

## Introduction

Safeguarding individuals from abuse is a critical responsibility embedded within the health and social care sectors in the United Kingdom. Abuse can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, financial, discriminatory abuse, neglect, and modern slavery. To effectively protect vulnerable individuals, a comprehensive framework of legislation, national policies, and local systems has been developed. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the key national and local policies that help protect people from abuse, emphasizing their roles, interrelationships, and practical implications.

## National Policies Protecting People from Abuse

National policies provide the overarching framework and standards for safeguarding practices across England. These policies guide care providers, statutory agencies, and other stakeholders in identifying, preventing, and responding to abuse.

### 1. Code of Conduct for Healthcare Support Workers and Adult Social Care Workers in England

This code sets out the professional standards and ethical responsibilities for healthcare and social care workers. It emphasizes respect, dignity, and safeguarding principles, ensuring workers act in the best interests of individuals and report any concerns about abuse ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 2. Care Quality Commission (CQC) Fundamental Standards

The CQC regulates and inspects health and social care providers to ensure compliance with fundamental standards of quality and safety. These standards include safeguarding requirements to protect individuals from abuse and neglect. Providers failing to meet these standards can face sanctions, including closure ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 3. Duty of Care and Duty of Candour

- **Duty of Care**: Requires care providers to act in ways that protect individuals from harm, including abuse.
- **Duty of Candour**: Mandates openness and transparency when things go wrong, including incidents of abuse, ensuring affected individuals are informed and supported ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 4. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS)

DoLS provide legal protection for individuals who lack the capacity to consent to their care arrangements, ensuring any deprivation of liberty is lawful, necessary, and in their best interests. This safeguards against unlawful restraint or confinement, which could constitute abuse ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 5. Professional Bodies and Registration Requirements

Registration with professional bodies (e.g., Nursing and Midwifery Council, Health and Care Professions Council) enforces adherence to safeguarding standards and ethical codes. These bodies have disciplinary powers to address professional misconduct related to abuse ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 6. NHS England Safeguarding Policies

NHS England oversees safeguarding through its National Safeguarding Steering Group (NSSG) and associated sub-groups focusing on specific issues such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), Mental Capacity Act (MCA), Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE), Looked After Children (LAC), and Prevent (counter-terrorism). These policies ensure consistent safeguarding practices across NHS services ([NHS England, 2018](https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/safeguarding/)).

### 7. Government Policy Statements and Campaigns

The government has issued policy statements and campaigns such as "Together, we can tackle child abuse," which promote awareness, training, and multi-agency collaboration to prevent abuse and neglect ([Department for Education et al., 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-outlines-strengthened-plans-to-tackle-child-abuse)).

## Local Systems Protecting People from Abuse

Local systems operationalize national policies by coordinating safeguarding activities within communities. These systems involve multi-agency collaboration and local governance structures.

### 1. Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs)

SABs are statutory bodies established under the Care Act 2014. They bring together representatives from local authorities, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), police, and other partners to oversee safeguarding arrangements, promote awareness, and coordinate responses to abuse ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

| **Role of Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs)** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Coordination                                  | Facilitate multi-agency collaboration to prevent abuse |
| Oversight                                     | Monitor effectiveness of local safeguarding practices |
| Safeguarding Adults Reviews (SARs)            | Investigate serious abuse cases to learn and improve systems |

### 2. Safeguarding Adults Reviews (SARs)

SARs, formerly known as Serious Case Reviews, are conducted when an adult dies or suffers serious harm due to abuse or neglect. They aim to identify lessons learned and improve future safeguarding efforts ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 3. Employer’s Agreed Ways of Working

Care providers must establish safeguarding policies, whistleblowing procedures, and ensure staff training to recognize and respond to abuse. These internal systems are vital for early detection and prevention of abuse within care settings ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

### 4. Local Multi-Agency Partnerships

Local safeguarding systems include partnerships among police, social services, housing teams, advocacy groups, and voluntary organizations. These partnerships enable comprehensive support and protection for vulnerable individuals ([Juls Pena, n.d.](https://www.academia.edu)).

## Summary of Key Legislation Underpinning Policies and Systems

| **Legislation**                           | **Purpose**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

These laws form the legal framework that supports national policies and local systems, ensuring a comprehensive approach to safeguarding ([StudyPrism, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk); [Care Certificate, n.d.](https://www.studyprism.co.uk)).

## Critical Analysis and Opinion

The national and local policies and systems outlined above collectively create a robust safeguarding framework. The Care Act 2014 is particularly pivotal, as it not only codifies the duty of local authorities but also mandates multi-agency collaboration through SABs, ensuring that safeguarding is a shared responsibility.

The integration of safeguarding principles into professional codes of conduct and regulatory standards (e.g., CQC Fundamental Standards) ensures that safeguarding is embedded in everyday practice. The inclusion of whistleblowing policies within employer systems empowers staff to report concerns without fear of reprisal, which is critical for early intervention.

However, challenges remain. For example, the government’s consultation on mandatory reporting of child abuse revealed significant professional resistance, highlighting the complexity of balancing legal duties with professional judgment ([Department for Education et al., 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-outlines-strengthened-plans-to-tackle-child-abuse)). This suggests that while policies are comprehensive, their implementation requires ongoing training, support, and evaluation to be effective.

Moreover, the evolving nature of abuse, such as modern slavery and online exploitation, demands that policies remain dynamic and responsive. The establishment of specialized NHS England sub-groups (e.g., Prevent, FGM) demonstrates a proactive approach to emerging safeguarding issues.

In conclusion, national policies provide essential standards and legal frameworks, while local systems operationalize these policies through coordinated, multi-agency efforts. Together, they offer a comprehensive mechanism to protect individuals from abuse. Continuous review, training, and resource allocation are necessary to address emerging challenges and ensure safeguarding remains effective.

## Conclusion

Protecting people from abuse requires a multi-layered approach involving national legislation, policies, and local safeguarding systems. Key national policies such as the Code of Conduct, CQC standards, and government safeguarding campaigns set the standards and expectations for care providers and professionals. Local systems, including Safeguarding Adults Boards and employer safeguarding policies, ensure these standards are implemented and monitored effectively.

The legislative framework underpins these policies and systems, providing legal authority and guidance. While the framework is comprehensive, effective safeguarding depends on the commitment of all stakeholders to work collaboratively, uphold ethical standards, and respond promptly to abuse concerns.
