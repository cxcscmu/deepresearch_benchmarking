# Why Is Same-Sex Marriage Illegal? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Same-sex marriage remains a highly contentious issue worldwide, with legality varying significantly across countries and regions. While many nations have legalized it, others maintain prohibitions based on cultural, religious, legal, and social grounds. This report examines the reasons why same-sex marriage is illegal in many jurisdictions, focusing on the interplay of historical, religious, social, and legal factors. It also explores the consequences of such illegality and the ongoing debates surrounding the issue. The analysis is grounded in a review of sociological, legal, and cultural perspectives, with particular attention to the Philippines as a case study, given its unique socio-religious context.

## Historical and Cultural Context

Marriage has traditionally been defined as a union between a man and a woman, a concept deeply rooted in most cultures and legal systems worldwide. Historical evidence shows that while some societies recognized same-sex unions in various forms, the dominant global narrative has long been heteronormative. For instance, same-sex marriages existed in special forms about 600 years ago, but these instances were exceptions rather than the rule (Tulchin, 2007). The modern fight for same-sex marriage rights began in the 1960s but gained significant legal traction only in the 1990s, with landmark cases such as the lawsuit against Hawaii's ban on same-sex marriage in the United States (Bauer, 2010).

In the Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country, the traditional view of marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman is deeply ingrained in the culture and legal framework. The Family Code of the Philippines explicitly defines marriage as between a man and a woman, reflecting the influence of religious and cultural norms (GradesFixer, 2019). This cultural backdrop significantly influences the legal status of same-sex marriage in the country and similar societies.

## Religious Influences

One of the most influential reasons for the illegality of same-sex marriage is religious doctrine. Major religions, including Roman Catholicism, Islam, and conservative branches of Judaism, traditionally oppose same-sex unions on theological grounds. These religions often cite procreation as a fundamental purpose of marriage, which same-sex couples cannot fulfill biologically (Messner, 2008).

For example, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a lifelong union between one man and one woman, ordained for procreation and the upbringing of children (Charron & Skylstad, 1996). Scriptural references such as Leviticus 18:22 and Genesis 2:22 are often invoked to argue that same-sex relationships are sinful and contrary to divine will (GradesFixer, 2019). This religious stance heavily influences public opinion and legislative decisions, particularly in countries with strong religious identities like the Philippines.

The conflict between same-sex marriage and religious liberty is complex. Redefining marriage to include same-sex unions poses significant threats to the religious freedoms of individuals and institutions that hold traditional views on marriage. Legal recognition of same-sex marriage can lead to burdens such as denial of government benefits, increased civil liability under nondiscrimination laws, and social ostracism for those expressing traditional beliefs (Messner, 2008).

## Legal and Constitutional Arguments

Legally, many countries and states justify the prohibition of same-sex marriage based on the traditional definition of marriage and the state's interest in promoting procreation and child-rearing within a heterosexual framework. Courts in some jurisdictions have ruled that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples does not constitute unconstitutional discrimination because of these interests (Messner, 2008).

For instance, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court redefined marriage laws by dismissing the traditional rationale based on child-rearing, declaring restrictions on same-sex marriage as persistent prejudice (Messner, 2008). However, this judicial activism has been met with resistance in other states and countries, where constitutional amendments and laws explicitly define marriage as between a man and a woman to preserve traditional values.

In the Philippines, the Supreme Court rejected petitions to legalize same-sex marriage, emphasizing that such matters should be addressed legislatively rather than judicially. The court acknowledged the marginalization of the LGBTQI+ community but deferred the issue to Congress, reflecting the political and social sensitivities involved (Herrera, 2020).

## Social and Psychological Concerns

Opponents of same-sex marriage often argue that such unions may negatively impact children and society. They claim that children raised by same-sex couples may experience confusion regarding gender roles and face psychological challenges due to the absence of a mother or father figure (MyInfoBasket.com, 2021). Studies cited by opponents suggest that children benefit from being raised by heterosexual parents, who provide distinct masculine and feminine role models (GradesFixer, 2019).

However, these claims are contested by numerous studies indicating that children raised by same-sex couples fare as well as those raised by opposite-sex couples in terms of psychological adjustment, cognitive development, and social functioning (Persuasive Essay on Same Sex Marriage, n.d.). The debate remains polarized, with social acceptance gradually increasing but legal recognition lagging in many regions.

## Political and Public Opinion Factors

Public opinion plays a crucial role in shaping the legality of same-sex marriage. Polls in the United States reveal a divided society, with approximately 48% believing that legalizing same-sex marriage would negatively affect society, 10% seeing positive effects, and 40% perceiving no effect (Legalizing Same Sex Marriage, n.d.). In the Philippines, surveys indicate that only about 20% of the population supports same-sex marriage legalization, reflecting the strong influence of religious and cultural values (GradesFixer, 2019).

Political parties also align differently on this issue, with liberal parties generally supporting legalization and conservative parties opposing it. Religious affiliations further influence political stances, with Catholic and Islamic groups predominantly opposing same-sex marriage, while Jewish Reform and Wicca faiths tend to be more accepting (Legalizing Same Sex Marriage, n.d.).

## Conclusion

Same-sex marriage remains illegal in many parts of the world due to a confluence of religious, legal, cultural, and social factors. The traditional definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman, deeply embedded in religious teachings and cultural norms, forms the cornerstone of opposition. Legal systems often reflect these traditions, emphasizing procreation and child-rearing as central to marriage.

Religious liberty concerns further complicate the issue, as redefining marriage challenges the beliefs of many individuals and institutions. Social arguments about the welfare of children and societal stability also contribute to resistance, despite growing evidence to the contrary.

In countries like the Philippines, the strong influence of Catholicism and conservative politics maintains the illegality of same-sex marriage, with ongoing debates about civil unions as a potential compromise. Public opinion remains divided, and legislative change is often slow and contentious.

Ultimately, the illegality of same-sex marriage is rooted in a complex interplay of historical, religious, legal, and social dynamics. As societies evolve and acceptance grows, legal frameworks may gradually adapt, but the pace and nature of change will continue to vary widely across different cultural and political contexts.
