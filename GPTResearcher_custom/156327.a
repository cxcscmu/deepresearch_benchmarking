# Report on Potential Shareholder Actions When a Firm Holds a High Cash Balance

## Introduction

The accumulation of significant cash reserves by firms has become a prominent feature in corporate finance, especially in developed markets such as the United States. While holding cash provides firms with liquidity and flexibility, it also raises concerns among shareholders regarding the optimal use of these resources. This report explores the potential actions shareholders may take when a firm holds a high cash balance, drawing from financial theories, empirical research, and recent market trends. The analysis integrates insights from dividend policy literature, corporate governance studies, and practical corporate finance considerations to provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of shareholder responses to cash-rich firms.

## Context and Importance of Cash Holdings

Firms accumulate cash for various motives, including transactional needs, precautionary reasons, speculative opportunities, future obligations, and compensating balances for banking services (Financial Management Motives). The strategic management of cash reserves is crucial because excessive cash can either represent a valuable buffer enabling investment and stability or signal inefficiency and potential agency problems where managers may misuse free cash flow.

Empirical evidence shows that firms with strong growth opportunities and riskier cash flows tend to hold higher cash ratios, whereas firms with better access to capital markets hold lower cash ratios, reflecting their ability to raise external funds when needed (Opler et al., 1999). However, the presence of large cash reserves often triggers scrutiny from shareholders and can influence firm valuation and governance dynamics.

## Shareholder Concerns Regarding High Cash Balances

Shareholders may perceive large cash holdings differently depending on the firm's governance structure, investment opportunities, and payout policies. Key concerns include:

- **Agency Problems:** Managers may hoard cash to increase their discretion and avoid external discipline, potentially leading to suboptimal investment decisions or empire-building (Harford et al., 2008).
- **Underinvestment or Overinvestment:** Excess cash might be invested in projects with negative net present value (NPV), harming shareholder value.
- **Opportunity Cost:** Idle cash generates low returns, especially in low-interest environments, potentially reducing overall firm profitability.
- **Signaling Effects:** Large cash reserves can signal uncertainty about future prospects or lack of profitable investment opportunities.

## Potential Shareholder Actions

Given these concerns, shareholders may undertake various actions to influence management decisions regarding the use of excess cash. These actions can be categorized into direct interventions, voting mechanisms, and market-based responses.

### 1. **Advocacy for Dividends or Share Buybacks**

When firms hold excess cash and lack positive NPV investment opportunities, finance theory suggests returning cash to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases ([Dividend Policy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_policy)).

- **Dividends:** Shareholders may pressure management to increase or initiate dividend payments, providing immediate cash returns and reducing free cash flow available for potential misuse. Dividends are generally preferred by shareholders of value or secondary stocks.
  
- **Share Buybacks:** Alternatively, shareholders, especially in growth companies, may favor share repurchases, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and share value without committing to permanent payouts. Buybacks offer flexibility to management and can be tax-efficient for investors ([J.P. Morgan Research, 2019](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/stock-buybacks)).

### 2. **Engagement in Corporate Governance and Activism**

Shareholders may engage in governance actions to influence cash management:

- **Proxy Contests and Shareholder Proposals:** Activist shareholders can initiate proxy fights to replace board members or propose resolutions demanding better capital allocation strategies, including cash deployment.
  
- **Voting on Antitakeover Provisions:** Shareholders may vote against management proposals that entrench executives and limit shareholder rights, as weak governance correlates with lower cash holdings and potentially suboptimal spending (Harford et al., 2008).

- **Engagement with Management:** Institutional investors often engage in dialogue with management to advocate for transparent and shareholder-friendly cash policies.

### 3. **Market-Based Responses**

Shareholders can respond through market mechanisms:

- **Selling Shares:** Dissatisfied shareholders may sell their holdings, exerting downward pressure on the stock price and signaling disapproval of cash hoarding.

- **Demanding Higher Returns:** Investors may require higher expected returns to compensate for perceived agency risks associated with excess cash, impacting the firm’s cost of capital.

### 4. **Legal and Regulatory Actions**

In extreme cases, shareholders may resort to legal avenues if they believe management is misappropriating cash or violating fiduciary duties.

## Empirical Evidence on Shareholder Actions and Cash Holdings

### Corporate Governance and Cash Holdings

Harford, Mansi, and Maxwell (2008) provide comprehensive evidence that firms with weaker shareholder rights tend to hold lower cash reserves because managers in such firms spend cash more quickly, often on acquisitions and capital expenditures that may not enhance value. Conversely, firms with stronger governance hold higher cash balances and use them more judiciously, often returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or buybacks.

| Governance Factor          | Cash Holdings Relationship | Investment Behavior                   | Payout Preference                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Strong Shareholder Rights  | Higher cash holdings       | More R&D, controlled investments    | Prefer dividends (committed)    |
| Weak Shareholder Rights    | Lower cash holdings        | More acquisitions, capital spending | Prefer buybacks (flexible)      |

This suggests that shareholders in firms with strong governance have more influence over cash deployment, often advocating for returns via dividends, while those in weaker governance settings may tolerate or even encourage flexible buybacks.

### Buybacks and Dividends as Shareholder Tools

Buybacks have become a prevalent method for returning cash, especially in the U.S., with record levels exceeding $900 billion in 2018, although slightly declining thereafter ([J.P. Morgan Research, 2019](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/stock-buybacks)). Shareholders often view buybacks favorably due to their flexibility and tax advantages. However, critics argue that buybacks may detract from long-term investments.

Dividends, on the other hand, provide predictable income streams and are favored by income-focused investors. Companies with stable earnings and strong governance tend to maintain or increase dividends, responding to shareholder preferences.

### Shareholder Activism and Cash Management

Research indicates that excess cash holdings can attract activist shareholders who push for better capital allocation. Proxy contests are more frequent in firms with large cash reserves, and such activism often leads to increased payouts and reduced cash holdings (Faleye, 2004).

## Practical Considerations for Shareholders

When evaluating a firm with a high cash balance, shareholders should consider:

- **Growth Opportunities:** Firms with significant positive NPV projects may justifiably retain cash for investment.
- **Governance Quality:** Strong governance correlates with more efficient cash use.
- **Payout History and Policy:** Consistent dividend policies and buyback programs signal management’s commitment to shareholder returns.
- **Market Conditions:** Tax considerations and market valuations may influence preferences for dividends versus buybacks.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the reviewed literature and empirical evidence, shareholders of firms holding high cash balances are likely to take proactive actions to ensure optimal use of these funds. These actions include advocating for dividends or buybacks, engaging in governance mechanisms to influence management decisions, participating in shareholder activism, and utilizing market responses to express approval or dissent.

It is my opinion that shareholders should prioritize engagement and governance tools to influence cash management policies, especially in firms with weaker governance structures where the risk of suboptimal cash deployment is higher. Encouraging transparent and disciplined capital allocation strategies benefits both shareholders and the long-term health of the firm.

Moreover, shareholders should recognize the nuanced preferences between dividends and buybacks based on firm type (growth vs. value) and tax considerations, advocating accordingly. Passive responses such as share selling may be less effective than active governance participation in driving positive outcomes.

In summary, shareholder actions in response to high cash balances are multifaceted and essential for aligning management’s use of cash with shareholder wealth maximization.
