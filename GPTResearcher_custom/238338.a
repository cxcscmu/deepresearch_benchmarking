# Why Are Cubans Protesting? An In-Depth Analysis of the 2021 Unrest

In July 2021, Cuba witnessed its largest anti-government protests in decades, with thousands of citizens taking to the streets across the island. These demonstrations were fueled by a complex interplay of economic hardship, political dissatisfaction, and public health crises. This report aims to provide a comprehensive and objective analysis of the underlying causes of the Cuban protests, drawing on multiple reliable sources and recent data. The report will explore the economic conditions, the impact of U.S. sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic, political dynamics, and social factors that culminated in the widespread unrest.

## Overview of the Protests

On July 11, 2021, protests erupted initially in San Antonio de los Baños and quickly spread to Havana and other cities. Protesters voiced grievances over food and medicine shortages, high prices, power outages, and the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Slogans such as "Freedom," "Down with the dictatorship," and "Patria y Vida" (Fatherland and Life) — a song critical of the regime — became rallying cries. The Cuban government responded with arrests, internet blackouts, and calls for government supporters to confront protesters ([CBS News, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cuba-protests-food-shortages-high-prices-coronavirus/); [BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852)).

## Key Drivers of the Protests

### 1. Economic Crisis

#### 1.1 Economic Contraction and Inflation

Cuba has been enduring its worst economic crisis in decades. The country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by approximately 11% in 2020 and continued to decline in 2021. Inflation surged dramatically, with estimates ranging between 500% and 900% price increases in basic goods within months ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852); [The New York Times, 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/world/americas/cuba-protests-hunger.html)).

The government’s currency unification and wage increases early in 2021 inadvertently triggered inflation that outpaced income gains, eroding purchasing power. Long queues for food and basic necessities became routine, with many stores running out of staples such as beans, rice, and cooking oil. Shops selling goods in foreign currencies, particularly U.S. dollars, further alienated those paid in Cuban pesos ([NBC Latino, 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-hunger-has-fueled-cuba-s-protests-n1273780)).

#### 1.2 Shortages of Food, Medicine, and Fuel

The shortages extend beyond food to essential medicines and fuel. Pharmacies and hospitals faced critical deficits of antibiotics, aspirin, and other basic medicines, which exacerbated public health challenges. Fuel shortages, partly due to reduced Venezuelan oil imports, led to frequent power outages lasting up to 12 hours during the summer heat, intensifying public frustration ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852); [The Nation, 2021](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-protests/)).

#### 1.3 Decline in Foreign Exchange Earnings

Cuba’s economy heavily depends on foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and medical service contracts. The COVID-19 pandemic devastated tourism, which was the second-largest source of revenue after medical exports. Remittances, the third-largest source, declined due to U.S. sanctions and pandemic-related economic hardships among Cuban expatriates ([Vox, 2021](https://www.vox.com/2021/7/14/22577485/biden-cuba-sanctions-protests-economic-crisis)).

The Trump administration’s sanctions, including travel restrictions and the closure of Western Union offices in Cuba, further constricted remittance flows, estimated at $3.5 billion annually before the sanctions ([The Nation, 2021](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-protests/); [NBC Latino, 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-hunger-has-fueled-cuba-s-protests-n1273780)).

### 2. Impact of U.S. Sanctions

The longstanding U.S. embargo on Cuba, intensified during the Trump administration, has played a significant role in exacerbating Cuba’s economic woes. The sanctions restrict Cuba’s ability to import goods, access international financial markets, and receive remittances efficiently. The Biden administration, despite campaign promises, has largely maintained these sanctions, including voting against a United Nations resolution condemning the embargo in June 2021 ([CBS News, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cuba-protests-food-shortages-high-prices-coronavirus/); [Vox, 2021](https://www.vox.com/2021/7/14/22577485/biden-cuba-sanctions-protests-economic-crisis)).

While the embargo is a key factor, experts emphasize that Cuba’s economic problems are multifaceted, including internal mismanagement and a rigid centrally planned economy ([NBC Latino, 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-hunger-has-fueled-cuba-s-protests-n1273780); [The Nation, 2021](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-protests/)).

### 3. COVID-19 Pandemic and Health Crisis

Cuba initially managed the COVID-19 pandemic effectively in 2020 but faced a severe resurgence in 2021. Daily cases and deaths reached record highs, overwhelming the healthcare system. Hospitals ran out of beds and medicines, and some patients died at home due to lack of access to care ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852); [CBS News, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cuba-protests-food-shortages-high-prices-coronavirus/)).

The pandemic’s impact extended beyond health, further crippling the economy by halting tourism and disrupting supply chains. Vaccine production in Cuba, while significant, was insufficient to curb the surge during the protests ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852)).

### 4. Political and Social Factors

#### 4.1 Authoritarian Governance and Lack of Political Freedoms

Cuba’s one-party communist system has long suppressed political dissent, with limited freedom of expression, assembly, and press. The protests marked a rare public outcry against the government, reflecting deep-seated frustrations with political repression and lack of democratic reforms ([CBS News, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cuba-protests-food-shortages-high-prices-coronavirus/); [The Nation, 2021](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-protests/)).

The government’s response included arrests, internet blackouts, and propaganda campaigns accusing protesters of being U.S.-backed mercenaries, which further polarized society ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852)).

#### 4.2 Generational Shift and Loss of Legitimacy

The revolutionary generation that supported Fidel Castro’s regime is aging, and younger Cubans who grew up after the Soviet Union’s collapse have experienced persistent economic hardship and unfulfilled promises of reform. This generational gap has eroded the regime’s legitimacy ([The Nation, 2021](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/cuba-protests/)).

#### 4.3 Role of Social Media and Cultural Expression

Greater internet access and social media use among Cubans, especially youth, have facilitated the spread of information and mobilization. The viral song "Patria y Vida" became an anthem for protesters, symbolizing a call for change and life over the revolutionary slogan "Patria o Muerte" (Fatherland or Death) ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57799852)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The Cuban protests of July 2021 were the result of a perfect storm of economic collapse, public health crisis, and political repression. While U.S. sanctions have undeniably worsened Cuba’s economic situation by restricting access to foreign currency and trade, internal factors such as a rigid centrally planned economy, delayed reforms, and mismanagement have also played critical roles.

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst, exposing and deepening existing vulnerabilities. The government's failure to adequately address food and medicine shortages, combined with rising inflation and power outages, directly impacted daily life and livelihoods, pushing citizens to the breaking point.

Politically, the protests reveal a significant erosion of the regime's legitimacy, especially among younger Cubans who have grown up without the revolutionary fervor that sustained earlier generations. The role of social media in organizing and amplifying dissent marks a new dynamic in Cuban society.

In my assessment, addressing Cuba's crisis requires a multifaceted approach: easing sanctions to allow humanitarian aid and remittances, coupled with genuine economic reforms and political openness from the Cuban government. Without such changes, the underlying grievances that sparked the protests will persist, risking further instability.
