# Why Are Cubans Protesting? A Comprehensive Analysis of the 2021 Cuban Protests

The July 2021 protests in Cuba marked the largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, with thousands of Cubans taking to the streets across the island to express their dissatisfaction with the country's economic and political situation. These protests were unprecedented in scale and scope, occurring in a nation known for its repressive government and limited tolerance for dissent. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the causes behind these protests, drawing on multiple reliable sources to present a comprehensive picture of the factors driving Cuban citizens to demand change.

## Economic Crisis as the Primary Driver

### Dependence on Tourism and Imports

Cuba's economy is heavily reliant on tourism and the export of raw materials such as rum, tobacco, sugar, and minerals. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism accounted for approximately 40% to 50% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and was a significant source of foreign exchange reserves for the government ([Salazar-Carrillo, 2021](https://news.fiu.edu/2021/why-cubans-took-to-the-streets-3-questions-about-cubas-economic-crisis-answered)). The pandemic's impact on global travel led to a near-collapse of the tourism sector, severely reducing government revenues and foreign currency inflows.

In addition, Cuba imports more than half of the fuel, food, medicine, and other essential goods consumed by its population. The disruption of supply chains and the reduction in foreign exchange reserves have made it increasingly difficult for the country to procure these necessities, leading to widespread shortages.

### Inflation and Shortages

The economic crisis has been exacerbated by soaring prices, particularly for foreign imports such as oil and medicines. Inflation in Cuba was predicted to exceed 400% in 2021, severely diminishing the purchasing power of ordinary Cubans ([Salazar-Carrillo, 2021](https://news.fiu.edu/2021/why-cubans-took-to-the-streets-3-questions-about-cubas-economic-crisis-answered)). This hyperinflation has made it increasingly difficult for people to afford basic necessities like food and medicine, even when these items are available.

The shortages have forced Cubans to endure long queues, sometimes lasting hours or days, to obtain basic goods. The scarcity of food, medicine, and fuel has created a daily struggle for survival for many citizens, intensifying public frustration.

### Economic Contraction and Stagnation

Cuba's economy contracted by 10.9% in 2020 and continued to shrink by 2% through June 2021 ([Bentley-York, 2021](https://www.the-sun.com/news/3266382/why-protests-cuba/)). This decline is the worst the country has experienced since the early 1990s, a period known as the "special period," which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of its subsidies.

The economic stagnation is attributed not only to external shocks but also to systemic issues within Cuba's centrally planned economy. The government's hesitation to implement market-oriented reforms, unlike other communist countries, has contributed to inefficiencies and a failure to stimulate growth ([NBC News, 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-exploded-protests-goes-us-embargo-pandemic-rcna1399)).

### Historical Context of Economic Mismanagement

Jorge Salazar-Carrillo, an economist and former Cuban government official, highlights that the Cuban government's economic policies have long been unsustainable. Since the revolution in 1959, the government has often chosen to spend beyond its means, leading to inflation, currency devaluation, and the imposition of foreign exchange controls. These policies have been repeated over decades, contributing to chronic economic instability ([Salazar-Carrillo, 2021](https://news.fiu.edu/2021/why-cubans-took-to-the-streets-3-questions-about-cubas-economic-crisis-answered)).

## Political and Social Factors

### Government Repression and Lack of Political Freedom

The Cuban government, led by President Miguel Díaz-Canel, has a long history of repressing dissent and limiting political freedoms. The July 2021 protests were remarkable not only for their size but also for their spontaneous and leaderless nature, reflecting widespread discontent across different segments of society ([PBS NewsHour, 2021](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-are-cubans-protesting-examining-the-nations-disappointment-with-the-communist-party)).

Following the protests, the government responded with arrests, internet shutdowns, and violent crackdowns on demonstrators. Such repression has further alienated the population and underscored the lack of avenues for peaceful political expression.

### Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The pandemic has had a severe impact on Cuba, not only by collapsing the tourism sector but also by straining the healthcare system. Despite launching a mass vaccination campaign, the country faced a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths, including the spread of the Delta variant in mid-2021 ([The Sun, 2021](https://www.the-sun.com/news/3266382/why-protests-cuba/)).

The health crisis compounded existing economic hardships, with shortages of medicines and medical supplies becoming more acute. The public's frustration with the government's handling of the pandemic contributed to the protests.

### Role of U.S. Sanctions

The Cuban government attributes much of the economic crisis to the decades-old U.S. trade embargo, which was tightened during the Trump administration. President Díaz-Canel described the sanctions as "economic asphyxiation" that has had a "cumulative effect" on the Cuban economy ([Forbes, 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2021/07/12/heres-why-cubans-are-protesting---and-why-the-us-response-is-so-important/)).

The embargo restricts Cuba's access to international markets and financial systems, limiting its ability to import goods and attract investment. However, experts and analysts agree that while the embargo has exacerbated Cuba's problems, it is not the sole cause of the crisis. Structural economic issues and policy failures within Cuba play a significant role ([Mesa-Lago, 2021](https://horizontecubano.law.columbia.edu/news/magnitude-economic-crisis-cuba)).

### Public Disillusionment and Loss of Hope

A recurring theme among protesters and analysts is the loss of hope for economic improvement. Despite promises of reforms over the years, tangible changes have failed to materialize. This has led to widespread despair and a desire for fundamental change in both economic and political spheres ([NBC News, 2021](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cuba-exploded-protests-goes-us-embargo-pandemic-rcna1399)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The 2021 Cuban protests are the culmination of a multifaceted crisis involving deep economic, political, and social challenges. While the U.S. embargo has undeniably contributed to Cuba's economic difficulties, it is not the sole or even primary cause. The Cuban government's long-standing economic mismanagement, reliance on a fragile tourism sector, and resistance to meaningful market reforms have created a structurally weak economy vulnerable to external shocks like the pandemic.

The pandemic acted as a catalyst, exposing and amplifying existing vulnerabilities, leading to acute shortages of food, medicine, and fuel, and triggering widespread public frustration. The government's repressive response to dissent and failure to address the population's grievances further fueled the unrest.

In my assessment, the protests represent a genuine and profound expression of popular discontent rooted in everyday hardships and a desire for political and economic change. The Cuban government's narrative blaming external forces, while partially valid, overlooks its own responsibility for decades of policy failures. Sustainable solutions require not only easing external pressures but also comprehensive internal reforms that prioritize economic diversification, political openness, and social welfare.

The international community, including the United States, faces a complex dilemma in responding to the crisis. While sanctions have aimed to pressure the Cuban government, they have also contributed to the suffering of ordinary Cubans. A balanced approach that supports the Cuban people's aspirations without empowering authoritarian repression is crucial.
