# Should Beauty Standards Be More Inclusive? A Comprehensive Analysis

Beauty standards have long been a powerful social construct shaping how individuals perceive themselves and others. Traditionally, these standards have been narrow, often Eurocentric, gender-specific, and restrictive, leading to significant social, psychological, and economic consequences. In recent years, however, there has been a growing movement toward inclusivity in beauty standards, reflecting diversity in race, gender, age, body type, and ability. This report examines whether beauty standards should be more inclusive, analyzing the societal impact, consumer demand, industry trends, and psychological effects, supported by recent data and scholarly insights.

## The Historical Context and Impact of Traditional Beauty Standards

Historically, beauty standards have been predominantly defined by Western and Eurocentric ideals, emphasizing fair skin, slim bodies, and specific facial features. These standards have been perpetuated through media, advertising, and popular culture, often marginalizing those who do not conform. For example, fair skin has been associated with superiority and attractiveness in many parts of the world, creating racial hierarchies that stigmatize darker skin tones ([Marway, 2017](https://www.essaysauce.com/sociology-essays/politics-of-bodies-and-the-standards-of-beauty/)).

The consequences of these narrow standards are profound. Women and marginalized groups often experience low self-esteem, stigmatization, and social exclusion when they do not meet these ideals. The pressure to conform leads to unhealthy behaviors such as extreme dieting, cosmetic surgery, and mental health issues like eating disorders and body dysmorphia ([Bartleby, n.d.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Standard-Of-Beauty-Essay-FKX37U594F); [Cnique, 2017](https://cnique.blogspot.com/2017/04/why-its-wrong-for-media-to-promote.html)).

## The Shift Toward Inclusive Beauty: Market and Social Dynamics

### Consumer Demand for Diversity and Inclusivity

Recent market research highlights a significant consumer shift toward inclusivity in beauty. According to Mintel (2021), 63% of Americans are inspired by beauty brands that showcase diversity in advertising, with 68% appreciating it because it "reflects real life," and 56% recognizing that it "shows that there are different ways to be beautiful" ([Mintel, 2021](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/63-of-americans-are-inspired-by-beauty-brands-that-show-diversity-in-advertising)). Furthermore, nearly half of beauty consumers have actively sought out or purchased from brands that promote diversity or inclusivity, and 24% have supported minority-owned beauty brands.

This consumer behavior signals a demand for brands to move beyond traditional, narrow beauty ideals and embrace a broader spectrum of identities, including race, age, gender identity, body size, and ability.

### Industry Response and Inclusive Beauty Initiatives

The beauty industry has begun responding to these demands. The launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017, offering 40 foundation shades, is often cited as a turning point that "sparked a shift in the makeup industry" toward diversity and inclusivity ([CB Insights, 2021](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/what-is-inclusive-beauty/)). Since then, many brands have expanded product ranges to accommodate a wider variety of skin tones, introduced gender-neutral products, and developed formulations catering to different skin types and abilities.

Moreover, the industry is increasingly focusing on authentic representation in advertising, moving from "aspirational" to "inspirational" marketing that empowers consumers by reflecting their diverse realities ([Mintel, 2021](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/63-of-americans-are-inspired-by-beauty-brands-that-show-diversity-in-advertising)).

### Table 1: Key Inclusive Beauty Trends and Industry Actions

| Trend                      | Description                                      | Industry Examples                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Expanded Shade Ranges       | Products catering to diverse skin tones         | Fenty Beauty, Mented Cosmetics            |
| Gender-Neutral Products     | Beauty products marketed beyond gender binaries | Fluide, Milk Makeup                        |
| Accessibility              | Products and packaging for people with disabilities | Brands offering adaptive tools and formulations |
| Age Diversity              | Products and marketing inclusive of all ages    | Brands targeting Baby Boomers and Gen Z   |
| Authentic Representation    | Use of unretouched images and diverse models    | Aerie REAL campaign                        |

## Psychological and Social Benefits of Inclusive Beauty Standards

Inclusive beauty standards contribute positively to mental health and social well-being. Exposure to diverse representations helps reduce internalized stigma and promotes self-acceptance among marginalized groups. For teenagers and young adults, who are particularly vulnerable to body image issues, seeing realistic and varied portrayals of beauty can bolster self-esteem and reduce the risk of eating disorders and depression ([The Inkblot, 2020](https://theinkblotnews.com/10701/opinion/modern-beauty-standards-and-their-effects-on-society/); [Cnique, 2017](https://cnique.blogspot.com/2017/04/why-its-wrong-for-media-to-promote.html)).

Furthermore, inclusive beauty challenges the harmful "beauty is good" stereotype, which associates attractiveness with positive traits such as intelligence and success, often leading to discrimination against those who do not fit conventional beauty norms ([Iowa State University, n.d.](https://iastate.pressbooks.pub/dressappearancediversity/chapter/physical-attractiveness/)).

## Challenges and Considerations in Implementing Inclusive Beauty Standards

While the movement toward inclusivity is gaining momentum, challenges remain. One significant issue is the inconsistency in brand commitments. For example, during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, many beauty brands increased representation of darker skin tones in their advertising; however, this visibility declined shortly afterward, raising concerns about the authenticity and sustainability of diversity efforts ([CB Insights, 2021](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/what-is-inclusive-beauty/)).

Additionally, consumer perceptions of inclusivity vary by demographic factors such as age. For instance, Baby Boomers prioritize products that meet age-related needs, whereas Gen Z values gender-neutral products more highly ([Mintel, 2021](https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/63-of-americans-are-inspired-by-beauty-brands-that-show-diversity-in-advertising)). This complexity requires nuanced approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

## The Economic Imperative for Inclusivity

Beyond social and psychological benefits, inclusivity is also an economic imperative. Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) consumers spend an estimated 80% more on beauty products than other groups, highlighting the financial opportunity for brands that authentically engage these markets ([The Drum, 2021](https://www.thedrum.com/profile/gottabe/news/why-beauty-brands-need-to-be-more-inclusive-and-diverse)).

Inclusive beauty initiatives not only attract a broader customer base but also foster brand loyalty by demonstrating genuine commitment to diversity and social justice.

## Conclusion: The Case for More Inclusive Beauty Standards

Based on the comprehensive evidence, beauty standards should indeed be more inclusive. The traditional narrow standards have caused significant harm by marginalizing large segments of the population and perpetuating unhealthy ideals. In contrast, inclusive beauty standards promote diversity, authenticity, and acceptance, leading to improved mental health outcomes, greater social equity, and economic benefits for the beauty industry.

The shift toward inclusivity is not merely a trend but a necessary evolution reflecting the diverse realities of contemporary society. Brands and media must commit to sustained, authentic inclusivity that goes beyond marketing campaigns to product development, representation, and corporate practices.

Ultimately, inclusive beauty standards empower individuals to define beauty on their own terms, fostering a culture where everyone can feel valued and represented.
