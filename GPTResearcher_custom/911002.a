# Should Beauty Standards Be More Inclusive? A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Beauty standards have long been a reflection of societal values, cultural norms, and media portrayals. Historically, these standards have been narrow, often emphasizing specific body types, skin tones, and gender expressions that exclude vast segments of the population. In recent years, however, there has been a growing movement toward inclusivity in beauty standards, recognizing the diversity of human appearance across race, gender identity, age, body type, and ability. This report critically examines whether beauty standards should be more inclusive, drawing on extensive research and industry trends to provide a detailed, evidence-based perspective.

## Historical Context and Impact of Narrow Beauty Standards

Traditional beauty standards have often promoted an unrealistic and homogenized ideal, such as the thin, hourglass figure for women or the absence of body hair for females, as perpetuated by media and advertising (Hoffman, 2020). These ideals have been linked to negative psychological outcomes, including body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders, particularly among women and young girls (American Psychological Association, 2007). For example, the internalization of the "thin ideal" correlates with increased body dissatisfaction and the development of eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia, which have the highest mortality rates among mental illnesses (Wilhelmsen, 2016).

The media’s portrayal of beauty often sexualizes women’s bodies to sell products, contributing to a social pressure to conform that can lead to physical and emotional distress (Graydon, 2010). Moreover, these portrayals have historically lacked diversity, marginalizing people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, older adults, and those with disabilities.

## The Case for Inclusive Beauty Standards

### Psychological and Social Benefits

Inclusive beauty standards promote acceptance and celebration of diverse body types, skin tones, ages, and gender identities. This inclusivity can reduce social stress related to body image and improve mental health outcomes by fostering self-esteem and reducing feelings of alienation (Wilhelmsen, 2016). For instance, exposure to diverse role models in media has been shown to positively impact body esteem and prosocial behavior in children (Coyne et al., 2016).

### Economic and Market Trends

The beauty industry has recognized the financial incentives of inclusivity. The global makeup industry was projected to be worth $640 billion by 2020, with significant growth in niches such as male personal care, gender-neutral products, and products for people of color (Astran, 2021). Brands like Fenty Beauty have revolutionized the market by offering a wide range of foundation shades, prompting other companies to expand their inclusivity efforts (Allen, 2020).

### Representation and Social Justice

Inclusive beauty standards reflect the demographic and cultural realities of contemporary society. They challenge systemic biases and promote equity by representing marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ communities and people with disabilities (Sweetman, 2021). This representation fosters a sense of belonging and validates diverse identities, which is crucial for social cohesion and individual well-being.

## Current Movements and Industry Responses

### Expanding Definitions of Beauty

The beauty industry is increasingly embracing "beauty without bias," catering to all individuals regardless of gender, age, skin tone, or ability (Sweetman, 2021). This includes:

- **Male Personal Care:** Expansion beyond basic hygiene to include skincare and makeup products tailored for men, with markets in Asia and the US growing rapidly (Astran, 2021).
- **Gender-Neutral Products:** Brands like Milk Makeup and Fluide offer products that transcend traditional gender norms, appealing to non-binary and transgender consumers (Sweetman, 2021).
- **People of Color:** Efforts to develop products suitable for diverse skin tones and conditions, addressing historical neglect in dermatology and product formulation (Astran, 2021).
- **Age Inclusivity:** Targeting older consumers with products addressing perimenopausal concerns and packaging designed for accessibility (Astran, 2021).

### Inclusive Marketing and Workplace Practices

Beauty companies are adopting inclusive marketing campaigns and creating safe, supportive environments for LGBTQ+ employees and clients (Sweetman, 2021). Examples include gender-neutral pricing, use of inclusive language, and participation in Pride events.

### Challenges and Criticisms

Despite progress, challenges remain. Some inclusivity efforts are criticized as performative or insufficiently sustained beyond marketing campaigns (Allen, 2020). Additionally, the persistence of Photoshop and unrealistic portrayals continues to undermine authentic representation (Hoffman, 2020).

## Comparative Overview of Traditional vs. Inclusive Beauty Standards

| Aspect                  | Traditional Beauty Standards                          | Inclusive Beauty Standards                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Body Types**          | Thin, hourglass figure, specific measurements       | All body types celebrated, including diverse shapes    |
| **Skin Tone**           | Predominantly light skin tones                       | Wide range of skin tones, including dark and mixed    |
| **Gender Expression**   | Binary gender norms, gendered products               | Gender-neutral and non-binary inclusive products      |
| **Age Representation**  | Youth-centric                                        | Inclusion of all ages, including older adults          |
| **Disability Inclusion**| Often excluded                                       | Products and marketing designed for accessibility      |
| **Media Portrayal**     | Sexualization and objectification                    | Authentic, diverse, and empowering representation      |
| **Mental Health Impact**| Linked to body dissatisfaction and disorders       | Promotes self-acceptance and mental well-being         |

## Implications for Mental Health and Society

The mental health benefits of inclusive beauty standards are substantial. Reducing the pressure to conform to narrow ideals can decrease the prevalence of eating disorders, depression, and anxiety related to body image (American Psychological Association, 2007). Moreover, inclusive standards can foster resilience and empower individuals to embrace their unique identities (Wilhelmsen, 2016).

From a societal perspective, inclusivity in beauty standards promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion, which are essential for social justice and reducing discrimination. It also encourages industries to innovate and cater to a broader consumer base, driving economic growth.

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive evidence and current industry trends, beauty standards should indeed be more inclusive. Inclusive beauty standards not only reflect the diverse realities of society but also contribute positively to mental health, social equity, and economic vitality. While challenges remain, the ongoing shift toward inclusivity in the beauty industry marks a significant and necessary evolution away from harmful, narrow ideals toward a more accepting and empowering vision of beauty.
