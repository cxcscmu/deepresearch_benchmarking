# Why Are Chemical Weapons Banned? A Comprehensive Report

## Introduction

Chemical weapons, defined as devices or munitions employing toxic chemicals specifically designed to cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation, or sensory irritation, have been a subject of international condemnation and legal prohibition for over a century. Despite their historical use, notably in World War I and various conflicts thereafter, chemical weapons are banned globally due to their indiscriminate nature, inhumane effects, limited military utility, and the long-term environmental and societal consequences they impose. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasons behind the ban on chemical weapons, supported by historical data, legal frameworks, ethical considerations, and military assessments.

## Historical Context and Military Ineffectiveness

The first large-scale use of chemical weapons occurred during World War I, with the German army releasing chlorine gas at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915. The attack caused immediate and horrific casualties, killing over 5,000 soldiers and injuring thousands more, many of whom suffered debilitating after-effects for decades ([Perry, 2017](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/why-the-world-banned-chemical-weapons-215538)).

Despite the initial shock and terror, chemical weapons proved militarily ineffective. By the end of World War I, chemical weapons accounted for approximately 91,000 deaths, less than 10% of total war casualties. Conventional weapons such as machine guns and artillery were far more lethal and decisive on the battlefield. Additionally, the development of gas masks and countermeasures reduced the effectiveness of chemical agents, and the unpredictable nature of gas clouds sometimes resulted in "blowback," harming the deploying forces themselves ([Perry, 2017](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/why-the-world-banned-chemical-weapons-215538)).

Subsequent conflicts, including World War II and the Iran-Iraq War, saw limited use of chemical weapons, often causing more terror and suffering than strategic military advantage. For example, Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the 1980s resulted in approximately 5,000 deaths, a small fraction of total war casualties ([Harigel, 2001](https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/01/18/introduction-to-chemical-and-biological-weapons-pub-809)).

## Ethical and Humanitarian Considerations

Chemical weapons are inherently indiscriminate, affecting combatants and civilians alike without distinction. Their use violates the principle of distinction, a cornerstone of international humanitarian law, which requires parties in conflict to differentiate between military targets and non-combatants ([Quora User, 2017](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-unethical-to-use-chemical-or-biological-weapons)).

The effects of chemical agents are often agonizing and prolonged, causing severe burns, respiratory distress, blindness, and other debilitating injuries. Unlike conventional weapons that cause immediate death or injury, chemical weapons can inflict lingering suffering, which is considered unnecessary cruelty. For instance, mustard gas causes severe blistering and long-term health complications, as witnessed by World War I veterans ([Basterfield, 2017](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-unethical-to-use-chemical-or-biological-weapons)).

The psychological impact of chemical warfare is profound, instilling terror and panic among civilian populations and soldiers. The use of such weapons is widely regarded as a weapon of mass terror rather than a legitimate instrument of war ([Perry, 2017](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/why-the-world-banned-chemical-weapons-215538)).

## Legal Frameworks and International Treaties

The international community has responded to the horrors of chemical warfare by establishing legal prohibitions and treaties:

- **The Hague Conventions (1899, 1907):** Early agreements prohibiting the use of poison or poisoned weapons, though not effectively enforced during World War I ([Harigel, 2001](https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/01/18/introduction-to-chemical-and-biological-weapons-pub-809)).

- **The Geneva Protocol (1925):** Prohibited the use of asphyxiating, poisonous gases, and bacteriological methods of warfare. However, it did not ban production or stockpiling and allowed for retaliatory use ([Britannica, 2024](https://www.britannica.com/event/Geneva-Gas-Protocol)).

- **The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) (1993):** A comprehensive treaty banning the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, and mandating their destruction. As of 2013, most countries have ratified the CWC, with only a few exceptions ([Schneider, 1993](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chemical-Weapons-Convention)).

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), established to enforce the CWC, has conducted thousands of inspections worldwide and facilitated the destruction of over 96% of declared chemical weapon stockpiles ([ACS, 2024](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/policy/publicpolicies/chemical-weapons.html)).

## Environmental and Long-Term Health Impacts

Chemical weapons pose significant environmental hazards. Many agents are persistent, contaminating soil and water for decades. For example, mustard gas and lewisite can remain dangerous long after deployment, with lewisite breaking down into arsenic compounds that contaminate groundwater ([Harigel, 2001](https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/01/18/introduction-to-chemical-and-biological-weapons-pub-809)).

The disposal of chemical weapons has also created environmental challenges. Post-World War II, large quantities of chemical munitions were dumped into oceans, including the Baltic and North Seas, posing ongoing risks to marine life and human health ([Harigel, 2001](https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/01/18/introduction-to-chemical-and-biological-weapons-pub-809)).

## Military and Strategic Considerations

Chemical weapons have limited military utility. Their effectiveness depends heavily on weather conditions, delivery methods, and the ability to protect one's own troops. The need for low-altitude delivery to achieve lethal concentrations exposes delivery aircraft to enemy fire ([Harigel, 2001](https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/01/18/introduction-to-chemical-and-biological-weapons-pub-809)).

Moreover, chemical weapons are less decisive than nuclear weapons or conventional arms in determining the outcome of conflicts. Their use often results in localized effects and does not guarantee strategic advantage ([Harigel, 2001](https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/01/18/introduction-to-chemical-and-biological-weapons-pub-809)).

## Psychological and Political Impact

The use of chemical weapons carries a heavy psychological burden, often provoking international outrage and political consequences. The 2013 sarin gas attack in Ghouta, Syria, which killed hundreds of civilians, led to widespread condemnation and prompted U.S. missile strikes on Syrian military facilities ([Perry, 2017](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/why-the-world-banned-chemical-weapons-215538)).

Chemical weapons symbolize a breach of civilized conduct in warfare, undermining the legitimacy of the user and often galvanizing opposition forces. This stigma has contributed to their international ban and the reluctance of militaries to employ them despite possessing stockpiles ([Perry, 2017](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/why-the-world-banned-chemical-weapons-215538)).

## Conclusion

The ban on chemical weapons is grounded in a combination of ethical, legal, military, environmental, and political factors. Their indiscriminate nature and capacity for causing unnecessary suffering make their use morally unacceptable. Militarily, they offer limited strategic value and are easily countered by protective measures. Environmentally, they pose long-term hazards that extend beyond the battlefield. Legally, a robust framework exists that prohibits their use and mandates destruction, reflecting a global consensus against these weapons.

While chemical weapons remain a threat due to existing stockpiles and potential use by rogue actors, international efforts through treaties like the Chemical Weapons Convention and organizations such as the OPCW have significantly reduced their prevalence and stigmatized their use. The continued prohibition of chemical weapons is essential to uphold humanitarian principles, maintain international security, and prevent the recurrence of the horrors witnessed in past conflicts.
