# Are Abortions Harmful to Women? A Comprehensive Review of Physical and Mental Health Outcomes

## Introduction

The question of whether abortions are harmful to women encompasses complex physical, psychological, and social dimensions. This report synthesizes extensive research, including longitudinal cohort studies, meta-analyses, and registry-based investigations, to provide an evidence-based, objective assessment of the potential harms associated with abortion. The analysis prioritizes recent, methodologically rigorous studies and addresses both short- and long-term outcomes related to physical health, mental health, and mortality.

## Physical Health Risks Associated with Abortion

### Safety Compared to Childbirth

Abortion is widely considered a safe medical procedure, especially when conducted legally and under appropriate medical conditions. However, when compared to childbirth, the risk profiles differ significantly.

- A study from the Turnaway Study cohort found that women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported more life-threatening complications such as eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage, whereas women who had abortions did not report such severe complications ([Gerdts et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576470/)).

- However, mortality data indicate that during the first six months after an early abortion (â‰¤12 weeks), women have double the risk of death compared to women who give birth, and after late abortion (>12 weeks), the risk is over three times higher ([LifeNews.com, 2014](https://www.lifenews.com/2014/09/12/study-proves-abortion-is-more-dangerous-than-childbirth/)).

- Historical data from the 1980s show maternal mortality rates for legal abortion are almost twice as high as those for vaginal deliveries but significantly lower than cesarean sections ([Lanska et al., 1983](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6854898/)).

### Complications and Long-Term Physical Effects

Several physical complications and long-term health consequences have been associated with abortion:

| Physical Outcome                    | Evidence Summary                                                                                   | References                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)** | Increased risk post-abortion, especially with existing STIs; up to 30% incidence reported in some studies. | [WHAA Summary](#)                           |
| **Ectopic Pregnancy**              | Risk doubled after one abortion; quadrupled after multiple abortions; ectopic pregnancy is life-threatening and affects fertility. | [WHAA Summary](#), [Bouyer et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12522089/) |
| **Placenta Previa**               | Risk increased 7 to 15 times among women with prior abortions; risk escalates with number of abortions. | [WHAA Summary](#), [Thorp et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12522089/) |
| **Uterine Perforation**           | Occurs in 1-2% of surgical abortions, potentially causing organ damage.                           | [WHAA Summary](#)                           |
| **Preterm Birth and Low Birth Weight** | Multiple studies report increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in subsequent pregnancies, especially with multiple prior abortions. | [Thorp et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12522089/), [Woolner et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150210/) |
| **Breast Cancer**                 | Meta-analyses show inconsistent results; some large registry-based studies find no increased risk, while others suggest possible associations. | [National Academies, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/) |
| **Secondary Infertility**         | No increased risk found in high-quality registry studies.                                         | [National Academies, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/) |

Notably, a 2018 comprehensive review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that abortion does not increase the risk of secondary infertility, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, or breast cancer when controlling for confounders and using documented abortion histories ([National Academies, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/)).

### Mortality

Long-term mortality studies present mixed findings:

- Some registry-based studies in Finland and Denmark found increased long-term mortality rates among women who had abortions, potentially related to associated risk-taking behaviors ([Reardon et al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173141/); [Gissler et al., 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14754750/)).

- However, confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and preexisting health conditions complicate causal interpretations.

## Mental Health Outcomes Post-Abortion

### Overview of Findings

Mental health consequences of abortion have been extensively studied, with varying conclusions depending on study design, control groups, and adjustment for confounders.

- The Turnaway Study, a prospective longitudinal cohort study with 5-year follow-up, found that women denied abortions initially experienced more anxiety, lower self-esteem, and lower life satisfaction compared to women who received abortions. Over time, psychological well-being converged between groups, and depression levels were similar ([Biggs et al., 2017](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2598227)).

- A 2011 meta-analysis by Coleman found an 81% increased risk of mental health problems (including depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal behavior) among women who had abortions compared to those who did not, with nearly 10% of mental health problems attributable to abortion ([Coleman, 2011](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-quantitative-synthesis-and-analysis-of-research-published-19952009/)).

- Other systematic reviews, including one by the UK National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (2011), concluded that rates of mental health problems were similar between women who had abortions and those who carried unwanted pregnancies to term, emphasizing the importance of controlling for preexisting mental health conditions ([NCCMH, 2011](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/clinical-guidelines/induced-abortion-and-mental-health.pdf)).

### Substance Use and Suicidal Behavior

- Substance misuse and suicidal behavior show stronger associations with abortion history. For example, women with abortions were found to be 2.6 times more likely to die by suicide compared to women who gave birth ([Reardon et al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173141/)).

- Meta-analytic data indicate increased risks for substance use disorders and suicidal behaviors post-abortion ([Coleman, 2011](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-quantitative-synthesis-and-analysis-of-research-published-19952009/)).

### Psychological Distress Compared to Miscarriage

- Some studies suggest that miscarriage may be associated with higher short-term psychological distress than abortion, but abortion-related distress may persist longer ([Broen et al., 2005](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-3-18)).

| **Physical Health**   | Abortion is generally safer than childbirth in the short term but carries risks of complications including PID, ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, and preterm birth, especially with multiple abortions. No increased risk for secondary infertility or breast cancer found in high-quality studies. | [Gerdts et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576470/), [National Academies, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/) |
| **Mortality**          | Short-term mortality lower than childbirth; long-term mortality data mixed and confounded by socioeconomic factors. | [Reardon et al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173141/), [LifeNews.com, 2014](https://www.lifenews.com/2014/09/12/study-proves-abortion-is-more-dangerous-than-childbirth/) |
| **Mental Health**      | Mixed evidence; some studies show increased risk of mental health problems post-abortion, particularly substance use and suicidal behavior; others find no difference when controlling for confounders. Psychological distress may be higher initially when abortion is denied. | [Biggs et al., 2017](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2598227), [Coleman, 2011](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abortion-and-mental-health-quantitative-synthesis-and-analysis-of-research-published-19952009/) |
| **Comparison to Childbirth** | Childbirth carries higher immediate physical risks; abortion carries higher risks of some long-term mental health issues; both have unique risk profiles. | [Gerdts et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576470/), [Biggs et al., 2017](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2598227) |

## Discussion and Opinion

The evidence indicates that abortion is not without risks to women's physical and mental health. While abortion is generally safer than childbirth in terms of immediate physical complications and mortality, it is associated with increased risks of certain adverse outcomes, particularly when multiple abortions occur or when abortions are performed later in gestation.

Mental health outcomes are complex and influenced by numerous factors, including preexisting mental health status, social support, and whether the pregnancy was wanted or unwanted. The Turnaway Study provides compelling evidence that being denied an abortion may initially result in worse psychological outcomes than receiving one, but over time, mental health trajectories converge. However, meta-analytic evidence also suggests that abortion is associated with increased risks of substance use and suicidal behaviors.

Given these nuanced findings, it is critical that women considering abortion receive comprehensive, evidence-based counseling that includes information on potential physical and psychological risks. Healthcare providers should also consider individual patient circumstances, including mental health history and social context.

The politicization of abortion research has led to conflicting interpretations and selective reporting. This report emphasizes the importance of relying on methodologically rigorous, peer-reviewed studies with appropriate controls and objective data sources.

## Conclusion

Abortions can be harmful to women in specific physical and mental health domains, particularly with repeated procedures and in the context of inadequate support or preexisting vulnerabilities. While abortion is safer than childbirth in terms of immediate physical risks, it carries its own set of potential long-term complications. Mental health risks, especially related to substance use and suicidal behavior, warrant careful attention and support.

Healthcare systems should prioritize informed consent processes that transparently communicate these risks. Further high-quality research is needed to clarify causal pathways and to develop interventions that mitigate adverse outcomes.
