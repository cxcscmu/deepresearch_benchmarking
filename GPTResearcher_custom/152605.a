## Physical Health Consequences of Abortion

### Safety Compared to Childbirth

Legal induced abortion, when performed under appropriate medical conditions, is generally considered safe and is associated with lower immediate morbidity and mortality compared to childbirth. For instance, Raymond and Grimes (2012) analyzed mortality rates in the United States from 1998 to 2005 and found that abortion had a significantly lower mortality rate than childbirth ([Raymond & Grimes, 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22270271/)).

Similarly, the Turnaway Study, a large prospective cohort study, reported that women who gave birth experienced more potentially life-threatening complications such as eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage than those who had abortions. Moreover, women who gave birth reported a longer need to limit physical activity post-delivery compared to women who had abortions ([Foster et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576470/)).

| Outcome                          | Abortion Group          | Childbirth Group        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Maternal Deaths                 | Lower                  | Higher                 |
| Life-threatening Complications  | Rare                   | More common (e.g., eclampsia, hemorrhage) |
| Physical Activity Limitation    | Shorter duration        | Longer duration        |

### Long-Term Physical Health Effects

Research on long-term physical consequences such as secondary infertility, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, and breast cancer risk has produced mixed findings. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) committee reviewed the epidemiological evidence and concluded that abortion does **not** increase the risk of secondary infertility, pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, abnormal placentation (after dilation and evacuation), preterm birth (except in cases of multiple prior abortions), breast cancer, or mental health disorders ([NASEM, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/)).

However, an increased risk of very preterm birth (<28 weeks gestation) was associated with having two or more prior aspiration abortions, especially when conception occurs less than six months after abortion ([NASEM, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/)).

### Unsafe Abortions and Complications

Unsafe abortions, defined as those performed by untrained individuals or outside medical guidelines, are a significant source of morbidity and mortality globally. They can cause uterine perforation, incomplete abortion, pelvic infection, and even death. The World Health Organization estimates that unsafe abortions cause approximately 68,000 deaths annually worldwide ([WomenHealthZone](https://www.womenhealthzone.com/womens-reproductive-health/abortion/consequences-of-abortion/)).

### Summary of Physical Health Risks

- **Legal, medically supervised abortions**: Generally safe with lower immediate risks than childbirth.
- **Multiple prior abortions**: Possible increased risk of very preterm birth.
- **Unsafe abortions**: High risk of severe complications and death.
- **Long-term physical risks**: No consistent evidence linking abortion to breast cancer or infertility.

## Mental Health Consequences of Abortion

### Overview of Research and Methodological Considerations

The mental health impact of abortion has been extensively studied, with over 30 systematic reviews, cohort studies, and analyses of registry data conducted since 1995. However, the literature is complicated by methodological challenges such as recall bias, inadequate control for confounders (especially prior mental health status), and inappropriate comparison groups ([NASEM, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/)).

The most rigorous studies use documented medical records, control for pre-existing mental health conditions, and compare women who had abortions to those who delivered unwanted pregnancies.

### Mental Health Outcomes Compared to Childbirth

A systematic review by Charles et al. (2008) and a quantitative synthesis by Coleman (2011) found that women who had abortions had an increased risk of mental health problems compared to women who delivered, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse disorders ([Charles et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/); [Coleman, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/)).

A detailed analysis of 30 studies showed:

| Comparison Group                 | Number of Studies | Findings of Increased Risk in Abortion Group | Findings of No Difference | Findings of Worse Outcome in Childbirth Group |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Abortion vs. Childbirth         | 19                | 13                                           | 5                         | 1                                             |
| Abortion vs. Unplanned Childbirth | 7                 | 4                                            | 3                         | 0                                             |
| Abortion vs. Miscarriage       | 9                 | 3                                            | 4                         | 2 (short-term anxiety/depression higher in miscarriage; long-term higher in abortion) |

This suggests a consistent pattern where abortion is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems compared to childbirth, even when controlling for the unintended nature of the pregnancy ([LiveAction, 2019](https://www.liveaction.org/news/psychological-consequences-abortion/)).

### Suicide and Suicidal Behaviors

Several studies report elevated suicide rates among women who have had abortions compared to those who delivered:

- Scandinavian women had a suicide rate nearly six times greater within 12 months post-abortion compared to post-childbirth (34.9 vs. 5.9 per 1000) ([Gissler et al., 1996](https://www.deveber.org/womens-health-after-abortion/)).
- Studies in Wales and the U.S. found suicide rates 3.25 and 2.6 times higher, respectively, among women who aborted ([Morgan et al., 1987](https://www.deveber.org/womens-health-after-abortion/); [Reardon et al., 2001](https://www.deveber.org/womens-health-after-abortion/)).

### Psychological Effects in Women Without Prior Psychiatric History

Earlier research emphasized that women with prior mental health problems were at greater risk of psychological harm post-abortion. However, more recent, methodologically robust longitudinal studies, including a landmark New Zealand study, demonstrate that even women without previous psychiatric conditions face increased risks of depression and other psychiatric disorders after abortion ([CMF, 2006](https://www.cmf.org.uk/resources/publications/content/?context=article&id=1850)).

### Contrasting Views and Limitations

Some reviews, such as Bradshaw (2003), concluded no long-term mental health differences between abortion and childbirth groups. However, these reviews often excluded more recent studies or failed to control adequately for confounders.

The NASEM committee emphasized that many studies suffer from selective recall bias and inadequate controls, limiting the reliability of some findings. Nevertheless, the preponderance of higher-quality evidence indicates an increased risk of mental health problems post-abortion ([NASEM, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507237/)).

## Conclusion

Based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature, abortions performed legally and under medical supervision are generally safer than childbirth in terms of immediate physical health outcomes. However, multiple prior abortions and short intervals between abortion and subsequent conception may increase risks such as very preterm birth.

Mental health outcomes present a more complex picture. The best available evidence indicates that abortion is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse, and suicide, compared to women who carry pregnancies to term, even when controlling for confounding factors such as prior mental health status and pregnancy intention.

Unsafe abortions, which remain a significant global health issue, carry substantial risks of severe physical harm and death.

Women considering abortion should be fully informed of both the relative physical safety of the procedure compared to childbirth and the potential for long-term mental health consequences. Healthcare providers have an ethical duty to provide comprehensive counseling that includes these risks to support informed decision-making.
