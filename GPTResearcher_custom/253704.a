# Report: How Do Police Investigate Crimes?

## Introduction

Police investigations are fundamental to the criminal justice system, aiming to determine whether a crime has occurred, identify and apprehend the perpetrator, and gather sufficient evidence to support prosecution and conviction. The investigative process is complex, involving multiple stages, methods, and sources of information. This report provides a detailed, structured, and comprehensive overview of how police investigate crimes, drawing on information from Singapore, the United States, and the United Kingdom, with a focus on procedural steps, investigative strategies, and evidentiary considerations.

## Overview of Police Investigations

Police investigations can be broadly categorized into two types:

- **Reactive investigations**: These commence after a crime has been reported or discovered. The police respond to incidents that have already occurred.
- **Proactive investigations**: These involve surveillance and other investigative activities conducted before or during the commission of an offense, aiming to prevent crime or catch offenders in the act.

Both types of investigations are essential and often complement each other in effective law enforcement ([Brandl, 1993](https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/legal-and-political-magazines/police-criminal-investigations)).

## Stepwise Process of Police Investigation

### 1. Initial Discovery and Reporting

The investigation process typically begins when a crime is reported, usually by a victim or witness. This initial report is often referred to as the **First Information Report (FIR)** in Singapore or simply a crime report elsewhere. The police then assess whether the information discloses a possible offense and whether it is arrestable or non-arrestable, which influences subsequent police powers and actions ([SingaporeLegalAdvice.com, 2021](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/police-investigation-process-crimes-singapore/)).

| Aspect                  | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reporting               | Victim or witness notifies police of a crime                                                 |
| Assessment             | Police determine if the offense is arrestable (e.g., rape, robbery) or non-arrestable (e.g., defamation) |
| Initial Action          | Arrest without warrant for arrestable offenses; warrant required for non-arrestable offenses |

### 2. Initial Response and Crime Scene Management

Upon receiving the report, patrol officers are dispatched to the scene to:

- Secure and preserve the crime scene to prevent contamination.
- Identify and assist victims and witnesses.
- Arrest the suspect if present and known.
- Collect and preserve physical evidence.

This phase is critical as it sets the foundation for the entire investigation. Immediate actions, often called **fast-track actions**, are vital to establish facts and preserve evidence ([JRank Articles, 2022](https://law.jrank.org/pages/2269/Police-Criminal-Investigations.html)).

### 3. Interviews and Statement Recording

Police conduct interviews with witnesses, victims, and suspects to gather information.

- **Witness statements**: Governed by legal provisions (e.g., Section 22 of the CPC in Singapore), witnesses must state the truth but are not compelled to incriminate themselves.
- **Cautioned statements**: Taken from suspects post-arrest, where the suspect is informed of the charge and their rights. The suspect’s responses are recorded in writing and signed.

In Singapore, suspects under 16 are entitled to have an independent adult present during interviews ([SingaporeLegalAdvice.com, 2021](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/police-investigation-process-crimes-singapore/)).

### 4. Evidence Gathering

Police gather physical and testimonial evidence to establish the occurrence of the crime and link suspects to the offense.

- **Search and seizure**: Police may obtain search warrants (general or specific) to search premises and seize relevant items.
- **Forensic evidence**: Includes fingerprints, DNA, bloodstains, fibers, and ballistic evidence.
- **Polygraph tests**: Used in some jurisdictions as investigative tools but generally inadmissible as court evidence.

The **golden hour** concept emphasizes the importance of prompt evidence collection to maximize the quantity and quality of material gathered ([Gardner & Krouskup, 2018](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-Crime-Scene-Processing-and-Investigation-Third-Edition/Gardner-Krouskup/p/book/9781351692373)).

### 5. Follow-Up and Case Screening

If the suspect is not arrested during the initial investigation, cases may undergo **case screening** to determine if further investigative resources should be allocated. Factors influencing this decision include:

- Seriousness of the crime.
- Solvability factors (availability of leads, evidence).

Cases selected for follow-up are typically assigned to detectives who conduct in-depth investigations, including surveillance, undercover operations, and informant management ([Brandl, 1993](https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/legal-and-political-magazines/police-criminal-investigations)).

### 6. Suspect Management and Interrogation

Once a suspect is identified, police focus investigative efforts on:

- Interviewing and interrogating the suspect.
- Using behavioral analysis, body language, and verbal cues to assess truthfulness.
- Employing psychological techniques and, where legal, polygraph tests.

Interrogations aim to obtain confessions or admissions but must respect legal rights and avoid coercion ([Brandl, 1993](https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/legal-and-political-magazines/police-criminal-investigations)).

### 7. Referral to Prosecutors and Case Preparation

After completing investigations, the police refer the case to the **Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC)** or equivalent prosecutorial authority for review.

Possible outcomes include:

- No charges, with or without warnings.
- Conditional warnings requiring compliance with specific conditions.
- Formal charges leading to court proceedings.

The prosecutor has the discretion to decide whether to proceed based on the sufficiency and admissibility of evidence ([SingaporeLegalAdvice.com, 2021](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/police-investigation-process-crimes-singapore/)).

## Reactive vs. Proactive Investigations

| Aspect               | Reactive Investigations                                         | Proactive Investigations                                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initiation           | Response to reported crimes                                     | Initiated based on intelligence or suspicion                    |
| Objective            | Solve crimes after occurrence                                  | Prevent crimes or catch offenders in the act                    |
| Methods              | Crime scene processing, witness interviews, evidence collection | Surveillance, undercover operations, informants, data analysis |
| Advantages           | Direct response to victim needs, evidence preservation         | Crime prevention, disruption of criminal networks               |
| Disadvantages        | Resource-intensive, may overwhelm police with volume           | Ethical concerns (entrapment), high resource and cost demands   |

Both approaches are necessary and complementary. Reactive investigations address immediate crime consequences, while proactive methods aim to reduce crime rates and target prolific offenders ([GraduateWay, 2018](https://graduateway.com/reactive-and-proactive-police-investigations/)).

## Sources of Information and Evidence

Police rely on multiple sources:

- **Physical evidence**: Tangible items such as weapons, fingerprints, DNA, and forensic samples.
- **Witnesses and victims**: Provide direct or indirect information about the crime.
- **Suspects**: Their statements and behavior are scrutinized.
- **Intelligence databases**: Crime pattern analysis, offender profiles.
- **Public tips and informants**: Valuable for uncovering hidden information.

Each source varies in reliability and relevance. Physical evidence is crucial for corroborating testimonies and establishing links, while witness statements can be prone to inaccuracies due to memory and perception limitations ([Brandl, 1993](https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/legal-and-political-magazines/police-criminal-investigations)).

## Challenges in Police Investigations

- **Volume and complexity of information**: Police must sift through massive, incomplete, or inaccurate data.
- **Preservation of evidence**: Contamination or loss can jeopardize cases.
- **Legal constraints**: Respecting suspects' rights while conducting thorough investigations.
- **Resource limitations**: Time, personnel, and technology constraints affect investigation quality.
- **Ethical issues**: Particularly in proactive investigations involving surveillance and undercover operations.

Effective investigations require balancing thoroughness, legality, and ethical considerations.

## Conclusion and Opinion

Police investigations are multifaceted processes requiring systematic approaches, legal knowledge, and investigative skills. The structured four-step process in Singapore—receiving reports, interviewing, evidence gathering, and prosecutorial referral—provides a clear framework that aligns with international best practices. The distinction and integration of reactive and proactive methods enhance law enforcement's ability to respond to and prevent crime.

However, challenges such as resource constraints, evidentiary complexities, and ethical dilemmas necessitate continuous improvement in training, technology adoption, and procedural standardization. Emphasizing early evidence preservation (golden hour), comprehensive witness interviewing techniques, and judicious use of proactive strategies can improve investigation outcomes.

In my opinion, police investigations should prioritize transparency, adherence to legal safeguards, and victim support while leveraging technological advancements and intelligence-led policing. This balanced approach ensures justice is served effectively and fairly.
