# Report: The Impact of Beauty Pageants on Mental Health

## Introduction

Beauty pageants have been a longstanding cultural phenomenon, involving participants—often young girls and women—competing based on physical appearance, talent, and sometimes intelligence. While proponents argue that pageants can build confidence and provide opportunities, a growing body of research and critical analysis highlights significant mental health concerns associated with participation in beauty pageants. This report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based examination of how beauty pageants affect mental health, emphasizing psychological issues such as self-esteem, eating disorders, depression, and identity development. The report also analyzes the broader social implications of beauty pageants on mental well-being.

## Overview of Mental Health Issues Linked to Beauty Pageants

### Psychological Stress and Identity Challenges

The preparation for and participation in beauty pageants can be highly demanding and stressful, especially for young girls. The process often involves extensive grooming, rehearsals, and adherence to strict beauty standards, which can lead to the creation of a "mask" or a persona that is disconnected from the participant's authentic self ([Mental and Physical Issues Caused by Beauty Pageants | 123 Help Me](https://www.123helpme.com/essay/Mental-and-Physical-Issues-Caused-by-Beauty-Pageants-123HelpMe-312886)).

Young contestants are judged and objectified based on sexualized ideals, which can detrimentally impact their identity formation, self-esteem, and body perception. The competitive environment fosters a mindset where external validation, particularly from judges, becomes paramount, often at the expense of internal self-worth ([Wonderlich et al., 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16864534/)).

### Self-Esteem and Body Image

Self-esteem among beauty pageant participants is a complex issue. While some argue that pageants can boost confidence, many studies indicate that the emphasis on physical appearance and winning can lead to low self-esteem, especially when contestants do not win or meet the unrealistic standards set by the pageant culture.

A 2003 study involving 131 female beauty pageant contestants showed that although higher levels of competition correlated with increased self-esteem, nearly half of participants desired to be thinner, and over half were actively trying to lose weight. Moreover, over a quarter reported having or perceiving they had an eating disorder beginning around age 16 ([Thompson & Hammond, 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14649788/)).

### Eating Disorders and Body Dysmorphia

Beauty pageants are linked to a heightened risk of eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. The average Body Mass Index (BMI) of beauty pageant contestants was reported as 18.3 in 2010, which falls into the underweight category, indicating a potential unhealthy focus on weight control ([Mental and Physical Issues Caused by Beauty Pageants | 123 Help Me](https://www.123helpme.com/essay/Mental-and-Physical-Issues-Caused-by-Beauty-Pageants-123HelpMe-312886)).

A 2005 study found that adults who participated in beauty pageants as children exhibited higher rates of eating and mental disorders compared to non-participants, suggesting long-term psychological consequences ([Wonderlich et al., 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16864534/)).

### Depression and Psychological Distress

The competitive nature of beauty pageants, combined with the emphasis on physical appearance, can lead to depression and other psychological issues. Contestants often internalize losses as personal failures, which can result in feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth. The support from family and friends may be insufficient to counteract the negative impact of being judged primarily on appearance ([Dr. Adams Plastic Surgery Blog](https://dradamsplasticsurgery.com/blog/how-beauty-pageants-can-affect-self-esteem/)).

### Objectification and Hypersexualization

Beauty pageants contribute to the objectification and hypersexualization of young girls, which is associated with adverse mental health outcomes. This objectification reduces participants to their physical attributes, undermining their sense of self and promoting unhealthy comparisons with unrealistic beauty ideals ([Jouanno, 2013](https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0919/Ending-the-hypersexualization-of-girls)).

## Critical Evaluation and Opinion

Based on the reviewed evidence, beauty pageants have a predominantly negative impact on mental health, particularly for children and adolescents. The culture of beauty pageants emphasizes external validation through physical appearance, which fosters low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and unhealthy behaviors such as extreme dieting and disordered eating.

While some participants may experience increased confidence and social opportunities, these benefits are overshadowed by the risks of psychological distress and long-term mental health challenges. The objectification and hypersexualization of young girls in pageants are especially concerning, as they contribute to identity confusion and reinforce harmful societal beauty standards.

Given the significant mental health risks and the availability of alternative avenues for building self-esteem and talent, it is advisable to reconsider the role and structure of beauty pageants, particularly those involving children under 16. Emphasizing holistic development over appearance and introducing mental health support for participants could mitigate some adverse effects.

## Recommendations

1. **Age Restrictions and Regulation:** Implement stricter age limits and regulations to protect young children from premature exposure to competitive beauty standards.

2. **Mental Health Support:** Provide psychological counseling and support for participants to address self-esteem and body image issues.

3. **Shift Focus:** Redesign pageant criteria to prioritize talents, intelligence, community service, and character over physical appearance.

4. **Parental and Coach Education:** Educate parents and coaches about the risks of beauty pageants and promote healthy attitudes toward body image.

5. **Public Awareness:** Increase public awareness about the potential mental health consequences of beauty pageants to foster informed decision-making.

## Conclusion

Beauty pageants have a complex relationship with mental health, but the preponderance of evidence indicates that they pose significant risks, especially to young participants. The focus on physical appearance and external validation can lead to low self-esteem, eating disorders, depression, and identity issues. While some benefits exist, they do not outweigh the potential harm. Responsible reforms and increased mental health support are essential to mitigate these negative effects.
