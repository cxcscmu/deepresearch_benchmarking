# Report: Why Are U.S. Military Veterans Deported?

## Introduction

The deportation of U.S. military veterans, particularly those who are non-citizens but have served in the armed forces, is a complex and contentious issue rooted in immigration law, criminal justice, and national security policies. Despite their service and sacrifices, thousands of non-citizen veterans have been deported from the United States, often due to criminal convictions or immigration technicalities. This report examines the reasons behind the deportation of veterans, the legal and policy frameworks that enable it, and the human and societal impacts of such actions. It draws on multiple sources, including government reports, legislative summaries, and journalistic investigations, to provide a comprehensive and objective analysis.

## Background: Non-Citizen Veterans in the U.S. Military

Non-citizens can legally join the U.S. military if they are lawful permanent residents (green card holders). Between 2013 and 2018, over 44,000 non-citizens enlisted, although enlistment rates declined sharply under the Trump administration ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

Typically, foreign-born service members with honorable discharges are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship, but citizenship is not automatically granted. Some veterans do not complete the naturalization process and remain permanent residents, which leaves them vulnerable to deportation if they commit crimes ([Salon, 2019](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/13/clumsiness-or-cruelty-trump-now-deporting-military-veterans-in-violation-of-federal-rules)).

## Legal Framework Enabling Deportation of Veterans

### Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996

The IIRIRA significantly expanded the grounds for deportation, especially for lawful permanent residents with criminal records. Since its passage, thousands of non-citizen veterans with criminal convictions have been deported, regardless of their military service or honorable discharge status ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)).

### Secure Communities Program

Implemented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Secure Communities mandates local law enforcement to share fingerprints of arrested individuals with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This program has led to the identification and deportation of many permanent residents with criminal records, including veterans, often without consideration of their military service ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)).

### Mandatory Detention and Removal Proceedings

Under current immigration law, ICE is required to detain and initiate removal proceedings against individuals convicted of aggravated felonies, which include a wide range of crimes such as drug offenses, sexual abuse, firearms violations, kidnapping, and terrorist threats ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

## Reasons for Deportation of Veterans

### 1. Criminal Convictions

The primary reason for the deportation of non-citizen veterans is criminal convictions. According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review, 92 veterans were deported between 2013 and 2018, with 90 of them having at least one criminal conviction, often for serious offenses ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

ICE states that all deported veterans in the cases reviewed were convicted of felonies related to drugs, sexual abuse (including cases involving minors), firearms offenses, kidnapping, terrorist threats, and other serious crimes ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

### 2. Failure to Naturalize

Some veterans do not complete the naturalization process despite eligibility, leaving them as permanent residents vulnerable to deportation if they commit crimes. For example, Jason Madrid, a Marine who served in Operation Desert Fox, was deported after a criminal conviction despite believing he would become a citizen upon enlistment ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)).

### 3. Immigration Status and Administrative Failures

ICE has been criticized for failing to properly track and review cases involving veterans. A GAO report found that ICE did not consistently follow policies requiring senior officials to review veteran deportation cases, resulting in some veterans being deported without adequate consideration of their service ([Salon, 2019](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/13/clumsiness-or-cruelty-trump-now-deporting-military-veterans-in-violation-of-federal-rules)).

### 4. Policy Shifts and Enforcement Priorities

Under the Trump administration, deportations increased sharply, including of veterans. The administration expanded enforcement programs and pressured immigration judges to expedite deportation proceedings, sometimes resulting in veterans being deported for relatively minor offenses or without thorough case reviews ([New York Times, 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/more-deportations-follow-minor-crimes-records-show.html)).

## Case Studies Illustrating Deportation Reasons and Impacts

| Veteran Name | Background | Reason for Deportation | Impact |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Alex Murillo | Brought to U.S. as a child, Navy veteran | Convicted of marijuana possession | Deported after full sentence; left behind 4 children; struggles adapting in Mexico; advocates for reform ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)) |
| Jason Madrid | Brought to U.S. as a child, Marine Corps veteran | Criminal conviction; misunderstanding about citizenship eligibility | Deported; suffers from PTSD; works as police officer in Mexico; feels alienated from his country ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)) |
| Jilmar Ramos-Gomez | Michigan-born Marine veteran | Arrested and turned over to ICE despite military ID and passport | Detained; released after 3 days; case raised concerns about ICE procedures ([Salon, 2019](https://www.salon.com/2019/06/13/clumsiness-or-cruelty-trump-now-deporting-military-veterans-in-violation-of-federal-rules)) |

## Human and Social Consequences

The deportation of veterans often results in severe personal and familial hardship. Many deported veterans leave behind U.S.-born children and families who depend on them emotionally and financially. The trauma extends to children who lose parental support, sometimes leading to school dropouts and mental health crises ([New York Times, 2014](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/more-deportations-follow-minor-crimes-records-show.html)).

Veterans deported to countries they barely know struggle to adapt socially and economically, often facing isolation and lack of access to healthcare, including treatment for service-related conditions like PTSD. Some have been recruited by criminal organizations aware of their military training ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)).

Paradoxically, the U.S. military honors deported veterans with full military burials, even though deportation may have contributed to their inability to receive timely medical care, sometimes resulting in premature death ([Global Migration Center, n.d.](https://globalmigrationcenter.org)).

## Legislative and Policy Responses

### Veteran Deportation Prevention and Reform Act (H.R. 4890)

Introduced by Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA), this bill aims to prevent deportation of non-citizen veterans except in cases involving violent crimes or threats to national security. It also proposes pathways for permanent residence and citizenship for veterans and their families ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

**Supporters' Arguments:**

- Veterans deserve legal protections and benefits for their service.
- Deportation of veterans is a grave injustice and harms families.
- Legislative reform can correct systemic flaws ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

**Opponents' Arguments:**

- Deportations occur rarely and only for serious crimes.
- ICE must enforce laws mandating removal of aggravated felons.
- Deportation is necessary for public safety ([GovTrack, 2019](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4890)).

### Senator Tammy Duckworth's Legislative Package (2021)

Senator Duckworth, a combat veteran herself, introduced bills to:

- Ban deportation of nonviolent veteran servicemembers.
- Create a tracking system for immigrant veterans.
- Allow deported veterans to temporarily return for medical care ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1009645764/senator-aims-to-reverse-trump-era-policies-for-deported-military-veterans)).

## Analysis and Opinion

The deportation of non-citizen veterans primarily stems from a rigid immigration enforcement framework that prioritizes criminal convictions without adequately considering military service or the circumstances leading to offenses. While public safety concerns justify deportation in cases of serious violent crimes or threats to national security, the current system lacks sufficient discretion and safeguards for veterans who have served honorably.

The failure of ICE to maintain accurate records and consistently review veteran cases reflects administrative negligence, exacerbating injustices. The paradox of honoring deported veterans with military burials while denying them residence and healthcare access underscores systemic contradictions.

Legislative efforts like the Veteran Deportation Prevention and Reform Act and Senator Duckworth's bills represent necessary steps toward balancing immigration enforcement with recognition of veterans' service and sacrifices. However, political obstacles, especially in the Senate, limit their prospects.

In my assessment, veterans who have served honorably and do not pose a threat to public safety should be shielded from deportation. The law should provide clear pathways to citizenship and residency, coupled with support systems addressing mental health and reintegration challenges. Deportation should be reserved strictly for cases involving serious violent offenses or national security risks, with comprehensive case reviews ensuring fairness.

## Conclusion

The deportation of U.S. military veterans is a multifaceted issue rooted in immigration law, criminal justice, and administrative practices. While criminal convictions are the primary legal basis for deportation, the system often fails to account for veterans' service and the complexities of their situations. Administrative lapses and policy shifts have exacerbated these issues, leading to deportations that many view as unjust and harmful.

Legislative reforms are underway but face political challenges. A balanced approach that protects public safety while honoring veterans' contributions and providing fair legal pathways is essential. This would uphold the nation's moral obligations to those who have served and strengthen the integrity of immigration enforcement.
