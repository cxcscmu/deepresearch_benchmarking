# How Technology Has Changed Nursing: A Comprehensive Report

The nursing profession has undergone monumental changes over the past few decades, largely driven by rapid technological advancements. These changes have transformed nursing practice, education, and patient care delivery, shaping a future where technology is integral to healthcare. This report provides an in-depth analysis of how technology has changed nursing, drawing from recent and reliable sources to present a comprehensive and objective perspective.

## Technological Evolution in Nursing Practice

### Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Digital Documentation

One of the most significant technological shifts in nursing has been the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs have replaced traditional paper charts, enabling nurses to access, update, and share patient information digitally. This transformation has improved the accuracy, clarity, and accessibility of medical records, facilitating better communication among healthcare providers and enhancing patient safety ([Risling, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049072/); [Hoover, 2017](https://journals.lww.com/nursingcriticalcare/Fulltext/2017/01000/Benefits_of_using_an_electronic_health_record.3.aspx)).

Nurses report that EHRs increase efficiency by reducing duplication of tests and delays in treatment, and by providing helpful alerts for medication administration and patient monitoring ([Avant Healthcare, 2019](https://avanthealthcare.com/blog/articles/how-technology-is-impacting-nursing-practice-in-2019.stml)). However, challenges such as increased screen time, potential impairment of critical thinking, and decreased interdisciplinary communication have also been noted ([Kossman & Scheidenhelm, 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18317257/)).

### Telehealth and Remote Patient Monitoring

Telehealth technologies have revolutionized nursing by enabling remote patient care through audio, video, and mobile health applications. This has expanded access to healthcare, especially in rural and underserved areas, addressing shortages of healthcare professionals and reducing healthcare costs by minimizing emergency room visits and hospital admissions ([Avant Healthcare, 2019](https://avanthealthcare.com/blog/articles/how-technology-is-impacting-nursing-practice-in-2019.stml); [Fundamento Juni, 2020](https://askinglot.com/how-does-telehealth-impact-nursing-informatics)).

Telehealth also allows nurses to communicate asynchronously with physicians and other healthcare providers, improving the quality and efficiency of care delivery ([Fundamento Juni, 2020](https://askinglot.com/how-does-telehealth-impact-nursing-informatics)).

### Wearable Technologies and Portable Monitoring Devices

Wearable devices and portable monitors provide real-time data on vital signs such as respiratory rate, oxygen levels, and electrocardiography. These tools enable nurses to monitor patients continuously and respond promptly to emergencies, significantly reducing response times ([NurseJournal, 2021](https://nursejournal.org/articles/technology-changing-nursing-roles/); [21st Century Tech, 2020](https://www.21stcentech.com/technology-transforming-nursing-patient-care-2/)).

Smart medical devices, including automated IV pumps and smart medication delivery systems, have simplified routine procedures, reduced human error, and enhanced medication safety ([Avant Healthcare, 2019](https://avanthealthcare.com/blog/articles/how-technology-is-impacting-nursing-practice-in-2019.stml); [Walsh University, 2018](https://online.walsh.edu/news/how-nursing-has-changed-technology)).

### Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Data Analytics

The integration of big data and AI into nursing practice is emerging as a transformative force. These technologies enable the analysis of vast amounts of health data to identify patterns, predict patient outcomes, and personalize care plans. AI applications are increasingly used globally to optimize care delivery and support nursing operations, contributing to improved health outcomes and operational efficiency ([HIMSS, 2020](https://www.himss.org/resources/2020-emerging-technology-global-nursing-care)).

### Communication and Collaboration Technologies

Modern communication tools such as instant messaging, team collaboration platforms, and wearable communication devices have streamlined coordination among healthcare teams. These technologies facilitate real-time communication, improve patient handovers, and enhance interdisciplinary collaboration, leading to more efficient and safer patient care ([NurseJournal, 2021](https://nursejournal.org/articles/technology-changing-nursing-roles/)).

## Impact on Nursing Education and Workforce Preparedness

### Curriculum Evolution and Informatics Competencies

The rapid pace of technological change has necessitated significant revisions in nursing education curricula. Nurse educators are encouraged to incorporate training on EHRs, wearable technologies, big data, data analytics, and patient engagement strategies to prepare nurses for future practice environments ([Risling, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049072/)).

Initiatives such as the Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform (TIGER) and the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing (CASN) have developed informatics competencies and toolkits to support nursing education in technology integration ([Risling, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049072/)).

### Online Learning and Telemedicine Exposure

The shift to online nursing programs has provided students with unique exposure to telemedicine and digital health tools, equipping them with technological proficiency before entering the workforce. This trend is expected to continue, producing nurses who are more technologically savvy and better prepared to utilize advanced healthcare technologies ([Data Carts, 2022](https://data-carts.com/top-5-nursing-trends-in-2022/)).

### Continuous Professional Development

Ongoing educational opportunities are essential for practicing nurses to enhance their informatics skills and adapt to evolving technologies. This continuous learning supports improved patient care and helps mitigate challenges such as nurse burnout by increasing efficiency and reducing workload ([Avant Healthcare, 2019](https://avanthealthcare.com/blog/articles/how-technology-is-impacting-nursing-practice-in-2019.stml)).

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite the many benefits, technology integration in nursing also presents challenges:

- **Increased Screen Time and Workload:** Nurses report spending significant portions of their shifts interacting with EHRs, which can detract from direct patient care and increase cognitive load ([Kossman & Scheidenhelm, 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18317257/)).

- **Potential Impairment of Critical Thinking:** Overreliance on technology may hinder nurses' clinical judgment and decision-making skills if not balanced appropriately ([Kossman & Scheidenhelm, 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18317257/)).

- **Digital Divide and Health Equity:** Access to technology and digital literacy vary among populations, potentially exacerbating health disparities. Nurses must be equipped to address these social determinants of health ([Risling, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049072/)).

- **Cost and Resource Intensity:** Emerging technologies such as AI and virtual reality can be expensive and resource-intensive, limiting their availability in underserved regions ([HIMSS, 2020](https://www.himss.org/resources/2020-emerging-technology-global-nursing-care)).

## Future Outlook and Conclusion

The nursing profession is at the forefront of healthcare transformation driven by technology. Nurses are not only users but also innovators and champions of emerging technologies that improve patient care and operational efficiency globally ([HIMSS, 2020](https://www.himss.org/resources/2020-emerging-technology-global-nursing-care)).

To maximize the benefits and mitigate challenges, nursing education must continue evolving to integrate informatics competencies and prepare nurses for a technology-infused practice environment. Continuous professional development and research are essential to document best practices and advance the effective use of technology in nursing.

In conclusion, technology has fundamentally changed nursing by enhancing patient safety, expanding access to care, improving efficiency, and enabling data-driven decision-making. While challenges remain, the ongoing integration of technology promises to further empower nurses and improve healthcare outcomes worldwide.
