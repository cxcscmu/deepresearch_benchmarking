# Report: Why Should We Increase the Minimum Wage?

## Introduction

The federal minimum wage in the United States has remained stagnant at $7.25 per hour since 2009, despite significant increases in the cost of living and economic productivity. This report presents a comprehensive and objective analysis of the reasons for increasing the minimum wage, drawing on recent empirical research, economic analyses, and policy evaluations. The report focuses on the economic, social, and public health implications of raising the minimum wage, particularly to $15 per hour by 2025, as proposed in various legislative efforts. 

## Economic Rationale for Increasing the Minimum Wage

### Addressing Wage Stagnation and Income Inequality

The purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has eroded significantly over the past decades. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage peaked in 1968 and has since declined by approximately 23% ([Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/)). Meanwhile, economic productivity and corporate profits have grown substantially, yet the benefits have not been equitably shared with low-wage workers. For example, the pay gap between CEOs and average workers has widened dramatically, with CEOs earning over 300 times more than typical workers ([NationofChange, 2021](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/02/10/6-simple-reasons-we-should-raise-the-minimum-wage-right-now/)).

Raising the minimum wage helps reduce wage inequality by lifting the earnings of the lowest-paid workers, who are disproportionately women and people of color. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 39% of Black and Latina women and 38% of African American workers would benefit from a $15 minimum wage, compared to 18% of white men ([Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/)).

### Poverty Reduction and Increased Family Income

Increasing the minimum wage directly raises the income of millions of low-wage workers and their families, thereby reducing poverty rates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would lift approximately 900,000 people out of poverty ([Congressional Budget Office, 2019](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410)). The Economic Policy Institute estimates even larger impacts, projecting that over 33 million workers would benefit, with an average annual income increase of about $2,800 per affected worker ([Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/)).

### Stimulating Economic Growth

Higher wages for low-income workers increase consumer spending, as these workers are more likely to spend additional income on necessities such as food, housing, and clothing. This increased consumption stimulates demand in the economy, potentially leading to job creation and economic growth. Studies have shown that the additional $120 billion in wages paid to workers from a $15 minimum wage would be re-injected into the economy, benefiting businesses and communities ([NationofChange, 2021](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/02/10/6-simple-reasons-we-should-raise-the-minimum-wage-right-now/)).

### Employment Effects: Job Loss Concerns and Evidence

A common argument against raising the minimum wage is that it may lead to job losses as employers reduce hiring or substitute labor with automation. However, extensive research, including meta-analyses and natural experiments, finds that moderate increases in the minimum wage have little to no statistically significant negative effects on employment levels ([Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/); [Upjohn Institute, 2019](https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1223&context=up_press)). For example, studies of minimum wage increases in cities like Seattle and San Francisco found no significant job losses and even some increases in employment in certain sectors ([Equitable Growth, 2019](https://equitablegrowth.org/factsheet-minimum-wage-increases-are-good-for-u-s-workers-and-the-u-s-economy/)).

The CBO estimates a possible reduction of 1.4 million jobs by 2025 due to a $15 minimum wage, but this estimate is considered conservative and based on assumptions about stronger baseline wage growth and employer substitution effects ([Congressional Budget Office, 2019](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410)).

## Social and Public Health Benefits

### Reducing Poverty-Related Health Disparities

Income is a critical social determinant of health. Low wages are linked to poorer health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic diseases, lower life expectancy, and increased stress and mental health challenges ([American Public Health Association, 2016](https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2017/01/09/14/19/improving-health-by-increasing-the-minimum-wage)). Raising the minimum wage improves the ability of workers to afford healthcare, nutritious food, safe housing, and childcare, thereby reducing health disparities.

Studies have shown that increases in the minimum wage are associated with reductions in low birthweight births, infant mortality, and premature deaths, especially in marginalized communities ([American Public Health Association, 2016](https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2017/01/09/14/19/improving-health-by-increasing-the-minimum-wage); [Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/)).

### Narrowing Racial and Gender Inequities

Women and people of color are overrepresented among minimum wage workers and low-wage earners. Raising the minimum wage disproportionately benefits these groups and helps narrow the gender and racial wage gaps. For example, women constitute 58.3% of workers affected by a $15 minimum wage increase, and workers of color constitute over 50% of affected workers ([Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/)).

## State-Level Impacts and Variations

Minimum wage laws vary widely across states and municipalities. Some states, such as New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, and Connecticut, have already enacted $15 minimum wages, which reduces the impact of federal increases in those states ([Economic Policy Institute, 2019](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-wages-for-over-33-million-workers/)).

The table below summarizes the estimated share of the workforce affected by a $15 minimum wage increase in selected states:

| State       | Total Workforce (Thousands) | Total Affected (Thousands) | Share of Workforce Affected (%) | Avg. Annual Earnings Increase (2018$) | Real % Change in Earnings |
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Alabama     | 2,016                       | 717                        | 35.6                            | $4,000                                | 16.6                      |
| California  | 19,073                      | 9                          | 0.0                             | $1,700                                | 5.9                       |
| Florida     | 8,969                       | 3,109                      | 34.7                            | $3,500                                | 14.0                      |
| New York    | 9,535                       | 1,101                      | 11.5                            | $800                                  | 3.0                       |
| Texas       | 13,345                      | 4,539                      | 34.0                            | $4,300                                | 17.5                      |

States with lower existing minimum wages and higher shares of low-wage workers see greater impacts from a federal increase. For example, Alabama and Texas have over one-third of their workforce affected, with substantial average earnings increases.

## Counterarguments and Considerations

### Potential Job Losses and Automation

While some studies find minimal employment effects, concerns remain about job losses, particularly for young and less-skilled workers, and increased automation replacing low-wage jobs ([American Experiment, 2021](https://www.americanexperiment.org/research-on-the-effects-of-raising-the-minimum-wage/)). Policymakers should monitor labor market responses and consider complementary policies such as job training and education.

### Impact on Small Businesses

Small businesses may face challenges absorbing higher labor costs. However, research indicates that many businesses adjust through productivity gains, reduced turnover, and moderate price increases without significant closures ([Equitable Growth, 2019](https://equitablegrowth.org/factsheet-minimum-wage-increases-are-good-for-u-s-workers-and-the-u-s-economy/)).

### Interaction with Social Benefits

Increasing wages may reduce eligibility for means-tested programs, potentially offsetting income gains. Policymakers should adjust benefit eligibility rules to avoid unintended hardships ([American Public Health Association, 2016](https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2017/01/09/14/19/improving-health-by-increasing-the-minimum-wage)).

## Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

The preponderance of evidence supports raising the federal minimum wage as a means to reduce poverty, decrease income inequality, improve public health, and stimulate economic growth. While concerns about employment effects and business impacts warrant attention, empirical research suggests these effects are modest and manageable.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025**, with gradual phase-in to allow adjustment.

2. **Index the minimum wage to inflation or median wage growth** to maintain purchasing power.

3. **Adjust social safety net eligibility criteria** to complement wage increases and prevent benefit cliffs.

4. **Support workforce development and training programs** to mitigate potential employment impacts.

5. **Conduct ongoing research and evaluation** to monitor economic and social outcomes.

By implementing these measures, policymakers can ensure that raising the minimum wage fulfills its potential to improve the lives of millions of workers and their families while supporting a robust and equitable economy.
