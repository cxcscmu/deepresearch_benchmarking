# Report on the Rising Cost of Gas: Causes and Analysis

The cost of gas has been rising significantly in recent years, impacting consumers globally and influencing economic activities. Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind this increase requires an examination of supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical factors, production constraints, market speculation, and policy decisions. This report presents a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the causes driving the rising gas prices, supported by data and expert insights from trusted sources.

## Supply and Demand Imbalance

The primary driver of rising gas prices is the imbalance between supply and demand. Global demand for natural gas and crude oil has been recovering strongly following the COVID-19 pandemic downturn, but supply has struggled to keep pace.

### Demand Recovery and Growth

After a 4% drop in natural gas demand in 2020 due to the pandemic, demand has rebounded and is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 1.5% from 2019 to 2025 ([IEA, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/gas-2020/2021-2025-rebound-and-beyond)). This growth is driven by economic rebounds in emerging markets and a return to near pre-pandemic consumption levels in mature markets. Industrial use accounts for about 40% of gas demand growth, with power generation and transport sectors also contributing significantly.

However, the pandemic has caused a permanent loss of about 75 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas demand growth over the forecast period, indicating a structural shift in consumption patterns ([IEA, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/gas-2020/2021-2025-rebound-and-beyond)).

### Supply Constraints

On the supply side, natural gas production is expected to rise incrementally until 2025, with a significant jump anticipated around that year. However, the current period is marked by limited new supply entering the market, contributing to tightness and price volatility ([CNBC, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/energy-crisis-analysts-split-on-whether-gas-prices-will-remain-high.html)).

Key supply challenges include:

- **US Shale Industry Vulnerability:** The US shale sector, a major driver of recent global gas output growth, faces reduced upstream investment, with spending on shale tight oil and gas declining by 50% year-over-year in 2020 ([IEA, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/gas-2020/2021-2025-rebound-and-beyond)). This limits the sector's ability to replace declining conventional production and meet LNG export demands.
- **Geopolitical Risks in the Middle East:** Production growth in the Middle East depends on large conventional projects in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Qatar. However, oil price volatility and political uncertainties pose downside risks to supply stability ([IEA, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/gas-2020/2021-2025-rebound-and-beyond)).
- **Low Investment Due to Past Price Trends:** Prolonged periods of low crude oil and gas prices in the previous decade discouraged investment in new drilling and infrastructure, leading to constrained supply capacity today ([Natural Gas Costs Rising, 2021](https://www.cfu.net/news/newsletter/november-2021/why-are-natural-gas-costs-rising)).

### Supply and Demand Summary Table

| Factor                     | Description                                              | Impact on Prices          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Demand Growth              | 1.5% annual growth with 75 bcm lost growth due to COVID-19 | Increases demand pressure |
| US Shale Production        | 50% cut in upstream spending limits output growth        | Limits supply growth      |
| Middle East Production     | Political instability and oil price volatility            | Creates supply uncertainty|
| Past Low Prices            | Reduced investment in new production                      | Constrains current supply |

## Geopolitical and Political Factors

Geopolitical tensions and political decisions significantly influence gas and oil prices by affecting supply routes, production decisions, and market confidence.

### Middle East Instability and Shipping Routes

The Middle East remains a critical region for global oil and gas supplies. Political turmoil, conflicts, or threats to key shipping chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez Canal can disrupt supply chains, leading to price spikes ([IG UK, 2018](https://www.ig.com/uk/news-and-trade-ideas/commodities-news/how-can-political-events-affect-the-oil-price--42098-180209)).

For example, the Iranian threat to block the Strait of Hormuz in 2011-2012 caused significant market anxiety despite no actual blockade occurring. Such political posturing can cause speculative price increases and supply concerns.

### OPEC Production Decisions

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), controlling over 50% of global oil production, wields considerable influence over prices. Decisions by OPEC to limit or increase production affect global supply levels. Recently, OPEC and its allies have been reluctant to increase production despite rising demand, contributing to the supply-demand imbalance ([Essaytown, 2011](https://www.essaytown.com/subjects/paper/rising-gas-prices/49595)).

### US Political and Policy Environment

US energy policies also impact production and prices. For instance, a more environmentally focused administration may impose regulations and taxes that restrict production, raising prices. Conversely, policies encouraging production can alleviate supply constraints ([IG UK, 2018](https://www.ig.com/uk/news-and-trade-ideas/commodities-news/how-can-political-events-affect-the-oil-price--42098-180209)).

The Biden administration's ban on Russian oil imports and ongoing policy uncertainties have added to market volatility and supply challenges ([API, 2022](https://gaspricesexplained.com/)).

## Market Speculation and External Factors

Speculation in commodity markets can exacerbate price movements beyond what supply and demand fundamentals dictate.

- Reports indicate that unregulated speculation in global commodity markets may have contributed to unprecedented rises in natural gas prices during winter periods ([Essaytown, 2011](https://www.essaytown.com/subjects/paper/rising-gas-prices/49595)).
- External shocks such as hurricanes (e.g., Hurricane Ida) disrupt production and refining, temporarily reducing supply and pushing prices higher ([Market Realist, 2021](https://marketrealist.com/p/why-is-gas-so-expensive-right-now/)).

## Refining, Distribution, and Retail Factors

The cost of gasoline at the pump is influenced not only by crude oil prices but also by refining, distribution, marketing, and taxation.

- Crude oil accounts for approximately 61% of gasoline prices.
- Refining costs contribute about 14%, with distribution and marketing adding 11%.
- Federal and state taxes make up around 14% of the retail price ([Gas Prices Explained, 2022](https://gaspricesexplained.com/)).

Local factors such as competition, store location, and operational costs also affect retail prices.

|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Supply-Demand Imbalance        | Demand rebounding faster than supply growth; limited new supply                             | Primary driver of price increases |
| Geopolitical Instability       | Middle East conflicts, shipping route risks, OPEC production decisions                      | Creates supply uncertainty and price volatility |
| US Policy and Regulation       | Production restrictions, import bans, and policy uncertainty                               | Limits supply and raises prices |
| Market Speculation             | Unregulated trading and investor behavior                                                  | Amplifies price fluctuations  |
| Refining and Distribution Costs| Operational costs and taxes add to wholesale and retail prices                             | Contributes to final price at pump |

## Conclusion and Outlook

The rising cost of gas is a complex phenomenon driven predominantly by a persistent imbalance between supply and demand, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, production constraints, and policy decisions. While demand is expected to grow moderately through 2025, supply is constrained by underinvestment, political risks, and regulatory environments, particularly in key producing regions such as the US shale sector and the Middle East.

Geopolitical instability and OPEC's cautious production policies further tighten supply, while market speculation and external shocks add volatility. Additionally, refining, distribution, and taxation contribute to the final price consumers pay.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that gas prices are likely to remain elevated in the near to medium term, with potential relief contingent on increased investment in production, geopolitical stabilization, and policy measures aimed at enhancing supply resilience. Policymakers focusing on incentivizing domestic production and energy infrastructure development may help mitigate price pressures.
