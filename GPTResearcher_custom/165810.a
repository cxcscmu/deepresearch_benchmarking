# Are Dream Catchers Cultural Appropriation?  
## A Comprehensive Report

---

### Introduction

Dream catchers are widely recognized symbols often associated with Native American culture, believed traditionally to protect children from nightmares. However, their widespread commercialization and use by non-Native individuals and entities have sparked debates about cultural appropriation. This report aims to explore whether the use, creation, and commercialization of dream catchers by non-Native people constitute cultural appropriation. It draws on perspectives from Native American voices, cultural experts, and public discourse to provide a nuanced, well-informed, and balanced understanding of the issue.

### Understanding Dream Catchers: Origins and Significance

Dream catchers originated with the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people, a Native American tribe primarily around the Great Lakes region. Traditionally, dream catchers were small, handmade objects placed above a baby's cradle to filter out nightmares, allowing only good dreams to pass through the web-like structure to the sleeping child below. The making of a dream catcher involves intricate ceremonial steps, including giving thanks for the spirit of the wood used, reflecting its sacred nature ([Clarence Sherrick, 2019](https://www.quora.com/What-Native-American-culture-invented-dream-catchers)).

The dream catcher is not a universal Native American symbol but specific to Ojibwe culture, though it has been adopted by some other tribes in recent decades. It holds spiritual and cultural significance, especially when made and used according to traditional practices.

### The Issue of Cultural Appropriation

**Cultural appropriation** is broadly defined as the disrespectful or unacknowledged use of a cultural symbol, practice, or artifact by someone outside that culture, often stripped of its original meaning and context. In the case of dream catchers, the debate centers on whether non-Native use and commercialization disrespect or dilute the cultural and spiritual significance of the object.

### Perspectives from Native American Communities

#### Voices Against Appropriation

- **André Cramblit**, an enrolled member of the Karuk Tribe, explicitly states that his tribe does not make dream catchers and views non-Native creation and commercialization of dream catchers as cultural appropriation ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://www.aaanativearts.com/article225.html)).

- **Millie Benjamin**, of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, expresses dismay at dream catchers being worn as earrings, hung from car mirrors, and sold as keychains in convenience stores, calling it disrespectful and trivializing a sacred tradition.

- **Gerald White**, member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, emphasizes that dream catchers are sacred items and that mass-produced kits sold in discount stores bypass the ceremonial steps, leading to a loss of meaning even within Native communities.

- **Martha Jourdain**, cultural assistant with the Fond du Lac tribe, believes dream catchers should be given away, not sold, and sees their commercialization as making a mockery of a sacred item.

These perspectives highlight concerns about the **loss of cultural integrity**, **commercial exploitation**, and **disrespect** toward the spiritual significance of dream catchers.

#### Voices Supporting Controlled Sharing and Economic Benefit

- **Colleen Heminger-Cordell**, a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, has been making and selling dream catchers for over 15 years. She notes that while her work sometimes embellishes traditional designs, she has never encountered objections and views the craft as a source of income for Native families.

- **Ruth Garbow**, an Ojibwe artisan, sells dream catchers and sees them as a way to display her talents and educate customers about their meaning. She also advocates for limits on selling other sacred cultural items.

- **Dark Feather Red Eagle**, an elder of the Pine Ridge Lakota Sioux, sells dream catchers made by his family and does not consider them sacred objects, distinguishing them from medicine pouches or ceremonial pipes.

These voices suggest that **economic empowerment** and **cultural education** can coexist with respect for traditions, provided sacred items are not commodified indiscriminately.

### Commercialization and Mass Production

Since the early 2000s, dream catchers have become popular worldwide, often mass-produced and sold by non-Native companies, including in discount stores and online marketplaces. Many kits lack traditional materials and ceremonial significance, reducing the dream catcher to a decorative or novelty item.

This commercialization raises several issues:

| Aspect                      | Concerns                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loss of sacred meaning       | Traditional ceremonial steps are ignored in mass production                              | Leads to cultural dilution and disrespect                                              |
| Economic exploitation        | Non-Native businesses profit from Native culture without benefiting Native communities    | Undermines Native artisans' livelihoods                                               |
| Misrepresentation            | Dream catchers marketed as generic Native American symbols                              | Ignores the specific Ojibwe origin and cultural context                               |
| Cultural misunderstanding    | Used as fashion accessories or trinkets without understanding or respect                 | Seen as trivializing or mocking by some Native people                                 |

### Public and Online Discourse

On platforms such as Quora, opinions vary widely:

- Some Native individuals advise purchasing dream catchers directly from Indigenous artisans to support their communities and ensure authenticity ([Kaiden Harjo, 2023](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-cultural-appropriation-to-use-a-dream-catcher-Im-13-and-white-with-severe-PTSD-and-the-dreamcatchers-have-kept-away-a-lot-of-nightmares-but-I-dont-want-to-be-a-jerk)).

- Others argue that cultural appropriation claims are overblown or used to control cultural exchange ([Colby Johnson, 2021](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-cultural-appropriation-to-use-a-dream-catcher-Im-13-and-white-with-severe-PTSD-and-the-dreamcatchers-have-kept-away-a-lot-of-nightmares-but-I-dont-want-to-be-a-jerk)).

- Many emphasize the importance of **respect, education, and context** over outright prohibition, encouraging non-Natives to learn about the history and meaning of dream catchers ([Chiyo Kagami, 2022](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-cultural-appropriation-to-use-a-dream-catcher-Im-13-and-white-with-severe-PTSD-and-the-dreamcatchers-have-kept-away-a-lot-of-nightmares-but-I-dont-want-to-be-a-jerk)).

- Some users highlight that cultural exchange has always been part of human history, and that appreciation is different from appropriation when done respectfully ([Madison Snodgrass, 2022](https://www.quora.com/Is-buying-a-dream-catcher-a-form-of-cultural-appropriation-if-purchased-from-a-Native-American-craftsman)).

### Educational Approaches and Respectful Engagement

Educational initiatives, such as lesson plans for students, emphasize:

- Learning the **history and symbolism** of dream catchers.

- Understanding the **importance of respecting other cultures** and their sacred symbols.

- Encouraging **support for Native artists** and communities.

- Discussing **how to appreciate culture without appropriation**.

Such approaches foster cultural sensitivity and reduce the risk of unintentional disrespect ([Tammy Galloway, n.d.](https://study.com/academy/lesson/dream-catcher-lesson-plan.html)).

### Analysis and Opinion

Based on the evidence, the answer to whether dream catchers are cultural appropriation is **complex and context-dependent**.

| Context                         | Appropriation?                               | Explanation                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-Native mass production and sale without cultural understanding | Yes                                         | Disrespects sacred traditions, exploits culture for profit, dilutes meaning                 |
| Non-Native purchase from Native artisans with respect and support  | No                                          | Supports Native communities, respects cultural significance                                 |
| Non-Native personal use with cultural education and respect        | Generally no, but caution advised           | Shows appreciation; important to avoid trivializing or mocking                             |
| Use as fashion accessory or trivial decoration                      | Yes                                         | Often seen as disrespectful and trivializing by Native people                              |
| Native individuals making and selling dream catchers               | No                                          | Cultural expression and economic empowerment within the community                          |

Therefore, **dream catchers themselves are not inherently cultural appropriation**, but the **context of their use, production, and commercialization determines whether appropriation occurs**.

### Recommendations for Non-Native Individuals and Organizations

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the Ojibwe origins and cultural significance of dream catchers before acquiring or using them.

2. **Support Native Artisans**: Purchase dream catchers directly from Native American artists or reputable Indigenous-owned businesses.

3. **Respect Sacred Traditions**: Avoid using dream catchers as mere decoration, fashion accessories, or trivial gifts without understanding their meaning.

4. **Avoid Mass-Produced Kits**: Steer clear of cheap, mass-produced dream catcher kits lacking traditional materials and ceremonial context.

5. **Engage with Native Communities**: When possible, ask Native artisans about the meaning and stories behind their craft.

6. **Promote Cultural Sensitivity**: Encourage educational programs that teach respect for Indigenous cultures and their sacred symbols.

### Conclusion

Dream catchers hold profound cultural and spiritual significance for the Ojibwe people and some other Native American communities. Their widespread commercialization and use by non-Natives have raised valid concerns about cultural appropriation, especially when the objects are mass-produced, stripped of meaning, or used disrespectfully.

However, when approached with respect, education, and support for Native artisans, the use of dream catchers by non-Natives can be a form of cultural appreciation rather than appropriation. The key lies in **intent, context, and respect**.

As cultural symbols, dream catchers deserve thoughtful engagement to honor their origins and the communities that cherish them.
