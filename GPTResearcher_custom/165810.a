# Are Dream Catchers Cultural Appropriation? An In-Depth Analysis

Dream catchers have become widely recognized symbols, often used as decorative items or talismans believed to protect against nightmares. Originating from Native American cultures, particularly the Ojibwe people, dream catchers carry deep cultural and spiritual significance. However, their widespread commercialization and use by non-Native individuals have sparked debates about cultural appropriation. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, objective analysis of whether the use of dream catchers by non-Native people constitutes cultural appropriation, drawing on various perspectives, cultural contexts, and expert opinions.

## Origins and Cultural Significance of Dream Catchers

Dream catchers were originally crafted by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people and later adopted by other Native American tribes through trade and intermarriage ([Fact File, 2016](https://factfile.org/10-facts-about-dream-catchers)). Traditionally, they are made from natural materials such as willow hoops, sinew, feathers, and beads, and are relatively small in size. The design resembles a spider web intended to filter dreams: bad dreams are caught in the web and dissipated with the morning sun, while good dreams pass through to the sleeper, often a child ([Terry Cralle, n.d.](https://www.terrycralle.com/dream-catcher-meaning/)).

The making of a dream catcher is a sacred process involving ceremonial steps, including giving thanks to the spirit of the wood used. Dream catchers are traditionally meant to be placed above a babyâ€™s cradle to protect children from nightmares ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)). They are not merely decorative but hold spiritual and cultural meaning, symbolizing protection and unity among Native communities.

## Commercialization and Misuse

In recent decades, dream catchers have become commercialized and mass-produced, often made from synthetic materials, brightly colored feathers, and sold as souvenirs, decorations, or fashion accessories worldwide. This commercialization has led to concerns among Native Americans about the loss of meaning and disrespect toward their culture.

Millie Benjamin, a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, expressed dismay at the widespread marketing of dream catchers as earrings, keychains, and car decorations, stating that such uses are disrespectful and trivialize a sacred tradition ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)). Gerald White, a member of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, emphasized that dream catchers are sacred items and that their mass production and sale in discount stores cause a loss of cultural meaning, likening it to the loss of language and culture ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)).

## Perspectives on Cultural Appropriation

### Arguments Supporting Cultural Appropriation Claims

1. **Sacredness and Cultural Context**: Dream catchers are sacred objects tied to specific cultural rituals and meanings. Using them outside this context, especially without understanding or respecting their origins, can be seen as cultural appropriation ([Terry Cralle, n.d.](https://www.terrycralle.com/dream-catcher-meaning/)).

2. **Commercial Exploitation**: The mass production and commercialization of dream catchers by non-Native companies, often without benefiting Native communities, is viewed as exploitation of Indigenous culture for profit ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)).

3. **Loss of Cultural Integrity**: The trivialization of dream catchers as mere decorations or fashion accessories dilutes their cultural significance and contributes to the broader issue of Indigenous cultural erasure ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)).

4. **Tribal Specificity**: Some tribes, such as the Karuk, do not make or use dream catchers, and their use by others can be seen as misrepresentation or appropriation ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)).

### Arguments Against Cultural Appropriation Claims

1. **Personal Use and Respect**: Many individuals argue that using dream catchers for personal, non-commercial purposes, especially when done with respect and understanding of their origins, is not cultural appropriation ([Quora, 2022](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-cultural-appropriation-to-use-a-dream-catcher-Im-13-and-white-with-severe-PTSD-and-the-dreamcatchers-have-kept-away-a-lot-of-nightmares-but-I-dont-want-to-be-a-jerk)).

2. **Cultural Exchange and Influence**: Some commentators view cultural exchange as natural and positive, noting that cultures have historically influenced each other. They argue that sharing symbols like dream catchers promotes unity rather than appropriation ([Quora, 2023](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-cultural-appropriation-to-use-a-dream-catcher-Im-13-and-white-with-severe-PTSD-and-the-dreamcatchers-have-kept-away-a-lot-of-nightmares-but-I-dont-want-to-be-a-jerk)).

3. **No Universal Native American Ownership**: Since Native American cultures are diverse, and some tribes do not use dream catchers, the claim that all use by non-Natives is appropriation is contested ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)).

4. **Economic Benefits for Some Native Artisans**: Some Native artisans, such as Colleen Heminger-Cordell of the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, have benefited economically from selling dream catchers, indicating that commercialization can have positive impacts within Native communities ([Native News Network, n.d.](http://nativenewsnetwork.posthaven.com/dream-catchcer-cultural-appropriation)).

## Analysis and Opinion

The question of whether dream catchers constitute cultural appropriation is complex and nuanced. Based on the evidence, the answer depends largely on context, intent, and awareness.

- **Commercial Mass Production and Misuse**: The mass production and commercialization of dream catchers by non-Native entities, especially when done without respect for their cultural significance or benefit to Native communities, can be reasonably classified as cultural appropriation. This practice trivializes a sacred tradition, contributes to cultural erasure, and exploits Indigenous culture for profit.

- **Personal Use with Cultural Respect**: Individuals who use dream catchers for personal reasons, particularly when they have taken the time to understand and respect the cultural origins and significance, are less likely to be engaging in harmful appropriation. Many Native voices acknowledge that respectful use, especially for healing or protective purposes, can be acceptable.

- **Cultural Exchange vs. Appropriation**: While cultural exchange is a natural phenomenon, it becomes appropriation when power imbalances, disrespect, or exploitation occur. Dream catchers, as sacred objects, require sensitivity to these dynamics.

- **Tribal Specificity**: Since not all Native American tribes use dream catchers, it is important to recognize the diversity within Indigenous cultures and avoid broad generalizations.

In conclusion, dream catchers can be cultural appropriation when used disrespectfully or commercially by non-Natives without acknowledgment or benefit to Native peoples. However, personal, respectful use informed by cultural understanding does not inherently constitute appropriation.

## Recommendations for Respectful Engagement

1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about the origins, cultural significance, and traditional uses of dream catchers before acquiring or using one.

2. **Support Native Artisans**: Purchase dream catchers from Native American artists and communities to ensure cultural respect and economic support.

3. **Avoid Commercial Exploitation**: Refrain from mass-producing or selling dream catchers without Native involvement or permission.

4. **Respect Cultural Context**: Understand that dream catchers are traditionally for children and have spiritual meaning beyond decoration.

5. **Promote Cultural Appreciation, Not Appropriation**: Engage with Indigenous cultures in ways that honor and uplift their traditions rather than commodify them.
