# What Can Machine Learning Do? Workforce Implications

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has rapidly evolved to become a transformative force across industries and occupations. Unlike earlier waves of automation that primarily replaced manual or routine tasks, ML is uniquely positioned to affect cognitive and analytical tasks by enabling machines to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of what machine learning can do, focusing on its implications for the workforce, occupations, and the broader economy. Drawing on seminal research by Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, Rock, and others, this report examines the suitability of tasks for ML, the impact on job redesign rather than outright job replacement, and the critical role of reskilling and organizational adaptation.

## Understanding Machine Learning’s Capabilities and Limitations

Machine learning systems excel at specific, narrow tasks where large datasets are available for training, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. These systems typically rely on supervised learning and deep learning algorithms, which require vast amounts of labeled data to achieve high accuracy ([Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap8062)). However, ML remains far from achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would entail human-like versatility across all cognitive domains. The current state of ML is characterized by powerful narrow AI systems capable of outperforming humans in specific tasks but unable to generalize across diverse activities.

## Suitability for Machine Learning (SML) Framework

To systematically assess which tasks are amenable to ML, Brynjolfsson and colleagues developed a 23-question rubric evaluating the "Suitability for Machine Learning" (SML) of tasks. This rubric scores tasks on a scale from 1 (very low suitability) to 5 (very high suitability) based on factors such as the availability of data, the predictability of outcomes, and the need for human judgment ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

Using this rubric, the researchers analyzed 18,112 tasks across 950 U.S. occupations, revealing several key insights:

- **No occupation is fully automatable by ML:** The highest SML score for any task was 4.0, and no occupation consists entirely of high-SML tasks.
- **Most occupations contain some tasks suitable for ML:** Nearly every job has at least some tasks that ML can perform effectively.
- **ML affects different parts of the workforce than previous automation waves:** Unlike earlier automation that targeted manual and routine tasks, ML impacts cognitive and clerical tasks across wage levels.
- **Job redesign is crucial:** Realizing ML’s potential requires reorganizing tasks within jobs rather than eliminating entire occupations.

These findings underscore that ML will transform work by augmenting human labor and driving the reengineering of job content rather than wholesale job replacement ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

## Impact on Occupations and Industries

### Distribution of ML Exposure Across Jobs

The distribution of SML scores across occupations reveals that:

| Occupation Type               | Exposure to ML (SML Score) | Notes                                         |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Lower-wage occupations        | Higher SML scores          | More tasks suitable for ML, e.g., clerical   |
| Higher-wage occupations       | Lower SML scores           | More tasks requiring interpersonal skills    |
| Occupations with routine clerical tasks | Moderate to high SML scores | Tasks like balancing accounts, data entry    |
| Occupations requiring social and emotional skills | Low SML scores | Tasks like counseling, negotiation            |

Lower-wage jobs in retail, transportation, and food services tend to have a higher proportion of tasks suitable for ML, whereas jobs in education and healthcare have fewer such tasks ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

### Industry-Level Exposure

Industries vary in their exposure to ML-enabled task reorganization:

| Industry                      | Relative Exposure to ML     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Accommodation and Food Services| High                        |
| Transportation and Warehousing | High                        |
| Retail Trade                  | High                        |
| Education                    | Low                         |
| Health Care                 | Low                         |

These differences reflect the nature of tasks predominant in each industry and their suitability for ML automation ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

### Geographic Variation

Smaller cities and regions with lower median wages tend to have occupations with higher average SML scores, indicating greater exposure to ML-driven task changes. Conversely, large metropolitan areas show lower overall SML exposure but higher concentration of ML tasks involving image data and advanced analytics ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

## Workforce Implications: Redesign, Reskilling, and Human-Machine Collaboration

### Job Redesign Over Job Replacement

The prevailing impact of ML is expected to be the redesign of jobs rather than their elimination. Since only some tasks within jobs are automatable, organizations must separate high-SML tasks from those requiring human skills and reorganize work accordingly. This reorganization can lead to increased productivity and profitability by allowing ML to handle routine or data-intensive tasks while humans focus on interpersonal, creative, and judgment-based activities ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

For example, radiologists perform multiple tasks, including image reading (high SML) and patient communication (low SML). ML can augment image analysis, freeing radiologists to concentrate on patient care and complex decision-making ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019)).

### Reskilling and Skill Complementarity

The integration of ML into the workforce necessitates substantial reskilling efforts. Employees must acquire new skills to work alongside ML systems, such as data literacy, algorithm oversight, and advanced problem-solving. Firms investing in IT-related intangible capital (ITIC)—including skills, business process reengineering, and organizational knowledge—are positioned to capture greater value from ML technologies.

Research using LinkedIn data shows that skills related to ML implementation, such as proficiency in TensorFlow and cloud computing, have increased firm market value by 4–7% upon the introduction of enabling technologies ([Rock, 2019](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/123456)).

### Human-Machine Partnerships

Rather than replacing workers, ML often complements human labor by automating tedious tasks and augmenting decision-making. This partnership allows workers to focus on higher-level tasks, innovation, and customer engagement. Organizations that foster a culture of continuous learning and collaboration between humans and machines are more likely to succeed in the ML era ([Wellers & Jendroska, 2018](https://insights.sap.com/human-side-machine-learning/)).

### Organizational and Cultural Change

Successful ML adoption requires leadership engagement, clear digital transformation strategies, and organizational willingness to evolve. Fast-adopting companies (“fast learners”) actively retrain employees and redefine roles to integrate ML capabilities, resulting in less resistance and greater competitive advantage ([Wellers & Jendroska, 2018](https://insights.sap.com/human-side-machine-learning/)).

## Economic and Policy Considerations

### Intangible Capital and Firm Value

Investments in ITIC have grown significantly, now accounting for about 25–39% of the value of installed physical capital in large firms. This intangible capital includes skills, processes, and organizational knowledge critical for leveraging ML technologies ([Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, & Rock, 2019](https://www.hoover.org/research/how-will-machine-learning-transform-labor-market)).

The concentration of ITIC in a small number of firms suggests increasing economic concentration and potential productivity gains for those firms, but also raises concerns about inequality and labor market polarization.

### Labor Market Dynamics

ML’s impact on labor demand is complex and mediated by factors beyond task automation, including changes in information flows, income effects, and complementary innovations. Models suggest that increased automation can stimulate the creation of new tasks and occupations, but the transition requires substantial investments in skills and institutions ([Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160696)).

### Challenges

- **Reskilling bottleneck:** The pace of workforce reskilling and business process redesign lags behind technological advances, limiting the realization of ML’s full economic potential.
- **Measurement difficulties:** ITIC and related intangible assets are difficult to measure, complicating policy and investment decisions.
- **Unequal impacts:** Lower-wage workers and smaller cities face greater exposure to ML-driven task changes, necessitating targeted policy interventions.

## Conclusion

Machine learning is poised to transform the nature of work by automating specific tasks rather than entire jobs. Its greatest impact lies in driving the redesign of occupations and business processes, requiring organizations to rethink task allocation and invest heavily in workforce reskilling and intangible capital. While ML offers substantial productivity and economic growth potential, realizing these benefits depends critically on human capital development, organizational adaptation, and supportive policies.

The future workforce will be characterized by human-machine partnerships where ML augments human capabilities, enabling workers to focus on complex, creative, and interpersonal tasks. Companies and policymakers must prioritize strategies that facilitate this transition, including continuous learning, skill development, and inclusive economic policies to mitigate disparities.
