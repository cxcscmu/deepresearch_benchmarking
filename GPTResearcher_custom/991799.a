# When Did Racism First Start? A Comprehensive Historical Report

## Introduction

Racism, defined as prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against individuals or groups based on perceived racial differences, is a complex social phenomenon with deep historical roots. Understanding when racism first started requires examining its origins from multiple perspectives: biological, social, economic, and ideological. This report aims to provide a detailed, in-depth, and comprehensive analysis of the origins of racism, drawing on historical, anthropological, and sociological evidence, while prioritizing relevance, reliability, and recent scholarship.

## Defining Racism and Its Distinction from Discrimination

Before exploring the origins, it is crucial to distinguish **racism** from **discrimination**. Discrimination, the unfair treatment of individuals based on group membership, is a much older and broader phenomenon that predates racism. Racism specifically involves the belief in inherent biological or cultural superiority or inferiority of certain groups, often codified around physical characteristics such as skin color.

Historically, many societies practiced discrimination based on religion, language, tribe, or nationality without the racialized ideology that characterizes modern racism ([Cravero, 2019](https://www.quora.com/How-did-racism-in-Europe-start-When-and-who-started-it)).

## Early Human Social Behavior and Tribalism

Human beings evolved as social animals living in small bands or tribes, where survival depended on cooperation within the group and competition with others. This natural tendency to divide the world into "us" and "them" forms the basis of **tribalism**, which is considered a precursor to racism.

- Early humans, such as *Homo erectus*, emerged about 2.5 million years ago in East Africa and began migrating out of Africa around 2 million years ago ([Tempest, 2019](https://www.quora.com/How-did-racism-in-Europe-start-When-and-who-started-it)).
- Tribalism involved preferential treatment of in-group members and suspicion or hostility toward outsiders.
- This basic form of xenophobia is universal and predates the concept of race.

However, tribalism alone does not constitute racism, which involves a systematized belief in racial hierarchies.

## Ancient and Medieval Contexts: Absence of Modern Racism

### Ancient Greece and Rome

- Ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome practiced slavery and discrimination but **not based on race** as understood today.
- Slaves were often war captives or conquered peoples, and many slaves were ethnically similar to their owners.
- There was no concept of racial inferiority tied to skin color; rather, distinctions were made between "civilized" and "barbarian" peoples ([Cravero, 2019](https://www.quora.com/How-did-racism-in-Europe-start-When-and-who-started-it)).
- Intermarriage and integration between black Africans and Mediterranean populations were documented, with no institutionalized color prejudice ([Snowden, 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Europe)).

### Medieval Europe

- Discrimination existed, especially religiously based anti-Semitism, but again, this was not racial in the modern sense.
- Groups like the Cagots in France and Spain were persecuted minorities but based on social stigma rather than race ([Wikipedia, Cagot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagot)).
- The Romani people faced discrimination but were not racialized in the same way as later racial groups.

## The Emergence of Racism: The Role of Capitalism and Slavery

### The African Slave Trade and the Birth of Modern Racism

- Modern racism is widely understood to have emerged during the **15th and 16th centuries** alongside European colonial expansion and the transatlantic slave trade.
- The Portuguese began trading with African kingdoms in the 1400s, initially engaging in commerce but soon expanding into the forced enslavement of Africans ([Jones, Quora](https://www.quora.com/Who-started-racism-The-Start-of-Racism-History-of-racism)).
- The **material culture of Africa was comparable to Europe** at the time, and early European traders did not initially view Africans as inferior.
- However, to justify the brutal system of slavery, Europeans developed ideologies that dehumanized Africans, portraying them as subhuman or just above animals.
- The term "negro" was adapted by Europeans and later transformed into racial slurs, reflecting the racialization process ([Jones, Quora](https://www.quora.com/Who-started-racism-The-Start-of-Racism-History-of-racism)).

### Economic Motivations and Ideological Justifications

- Slavery was primarily an economic system designed to supply labor for plantations in the Americas, producing commodities such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton.
- The ideology of racism served to **justify the enslavement and exploitation** of Africans by creating a belief in their inherent inferiority.
- Karl Marx and historians like Eric Williams argue that **racism was a consequence of slavery**, not its cause ([Selfa, 2021](https://isreview.org/issue/26/roots_of_racism.shtml)).
- The **triangular trade** between Europe, Africa, and the Americas institutionalized this system, with millions of Africans forcibly transported and enslaved.

### Institutionalization of Racism in the Americas

- In the early English colonies, initially, labor included both white indentured servants and African slaves.
- Over time, laws were enacted to codify racial distinctions, such as determining slave status by the mother's condition, ensuring that children of enslaved African women remained slaves ([Fields, 1990](https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii170/articles/barbara-jeanne-fields-slavery-race-and-ideology-in-the-united-states-of-america)).
- Racism became embedded in social, legal, and economic structures, culminating in systems like Jim Crow segregation in the United States.

## Summary Timeline of Racism's Emergence

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Prehistoric          | Tribalism and in-group/out-group dynamics               | No racial ideology; group identity based on kinship    |
| Ancient Civilizations | Slavery and discrimination based on conquest            | No racialized slavery; slaves often ethnically similar |
| Medieval Europe      | Religious and social discrimination (e.g., anti-Semitism) | No modern racial categories                            |
| 15th-16th centuries  | European colonialism and transatlantic slave trade       | Emergence of racialized slavery and racist ideologies  |
| 17th-18th centuries  | Codification of racial laws in colonies                   | Institutional racism in Americas                        |
| 19th-20th centuries  | Scientific racism and white supremacy ideologies         | Racism used to justify imperialism and segregation     |

## Biological and Neuroscientific Perspectives

- Recent research suggests that **racism may stem partly from evolved psychological mechanisms** related to in-group favoritism and fear of out-group males, linked to survival in ancestral environments ([Brooks, 2012](https://theconversation.com/the-origins-of-racism-8478)).
- Brain regions such as the amygdala are implicated in unconscious racial bias, which can operate beneath conscious awareness.
- However, these biases are **not hardwired** and can be altered through education, exposure, and conscious effort.

## Conclusion: When Did Racism First Start?

Based on the comprehensive review of historical, economic, and scientific evidence, **racism as a structured ideology based on biological or cultural superiority and inferiority is a relatively modern phenomenon that emerged primarily during the European colonial expansion and the transatlantic slave trade in the 15th and 16th centuries**.

- While **discrimination and tribalism** have existed since prehistoric times, these do not equate to racism.
- Ancient and medieval societies practiced forms of discrimination but lacked the racialized worldview that defines modern racism.
- The **economic imperatives of slavery and colonialism** necessitated the invention of racial ideologies to justify exploitation.
- Racism became institutionalized through laws, social practices, and cultural beliefs, particularly in the Americas.
- Understanding this origin is crucial because it implies that racism is **not an inherent or natural human condition but a social construct that can be dismantled**.
