# When Did Racism First Start? An In-Depth Historical Analysis

Racism, as a social and ideological phenomenon, has been a persistent and complex aspect of human history. Understanding when racism first started requires an exploration of the evolution of human societies, the development of social hierarchies, and the emergence of ideas that classified and discriminated against groups based on perceived inherent differences. This report synthesizes information from historical records, scholarly analyses, and documentary sources to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based timeline and explanation of the origins and development of racism.

## Defining Racism

Before delving into its origins, it is essential to clarify what is meant by racism. Racism is generally understood as the belief that one ethnic or racial group is inherently superior or inferior to another, often used to justify domination, exclusion, or discrimination ([Fredrickson, n.d.](https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-01.htm)). This distinguishes racism from more general forms of discrimination or xenophobia, which may not be based on immutable biological or hereditary traits.

## Early Human Societies and Pre-Racist Discrimination

Human beings have lived in small tribal groups since prehistoric times. Early interactions between groups often involved conflict, including killing enemy men and taking women as captives, which later evolved into systems of slavery ([History of Racism, n.d.](https://historyofracismw.wordpress.com/about/)). However, this early form of discrimination was not necessarily based on race or ethnicity as understood today, but rather on tribal affiliation, conquest, and power dynamics.

In ancient civilizations such as Greece and Rome, while there were stereotypes and social hierarchies, there was no concept of race akin to modern racism. For example, Greeks had stereotypes about Asians, and Romans had slaves from various regions, but these did not constitute racial inferiority based on immutable biological traits ([Quora, 2019](https://www.quora.com/How-did-racism-in-Europe-start-When-and-who-started-it)).

## Medieval Period: Religious-Based Prejudice as Proto-Racism

The Middle Ages witnessed significant religious-based discrimination, particularly against Jews, who were portrayed as greedy, untrustworthy, and associated with witchcraft and devilry ([Fredrickson, n.d.](https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-01.htm)). This period marks one of the earliest identifiable forms of racialized thinking, where a group was demonized and excluded based on perceived inherent characteristics linked to religion and ethnicity.

This religious prejudice, while not strictly racial in the modern sense, laid the groundwork for later racial ideologies by establishing the acceptability of viewing certain groups as fundamentally different and inferior.

## The 15th Century and the Beginning of Racialized Slavery

The 15th century is a critical turning point in the history of racism. European exploration and colonization began in earnest, particularly with the Portuguese trading with African peoples. The transatlantic slave trade emerged, marking the beginning of systemic racialized slavery ([Thomas, as cited in History of Racism, n.d.](https://historyofracismw.wordpress.com/about/)).

Africans were labeled as "negro," a term that evolved into racial slurs in English, and were increasingly seen as inherently inferior, justifying their enslavement and brutal treatment. This period marks the start of racism as a codified ideology used to legitimize economic exploitation and social hierarchy based on skin color ([Reference.com, 2020](https://www.reference.com/world-view/did-racial-discrimination-start-37e75fd1280fd14)).

## The 18th and 19th Centuries: Scientific Racism and Institutionalization

The Enlightenment and subsequent centuries saw the rise of scientific racism, where pseudoscientific methods like phrenology and craniometry were used to classify humans into hierarchical races. Ethnologists categorized humans into three to five races, often arguing that these races were separate species ([Fredrickson, n.d.](https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-01.htm)).

This era also coincided with the defense of slavery and colonialism, where racial theories were used to justify European domination over Africans, Asians, and Indigenous peoples. The 19th century's ideological racism was intertwined with nationalism and imperialism, reinforcing racial hierarchies and segregation laws such as the Jim Crow laws in the United States and apartheid in South Africa ([PBS, n.d.](https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-01.htm); [Timetoast, 2022](https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/7050)).

## The 20th Century: Racism and Its Global Impact

The 20th century saw the climax of overtly racist regimes, most notably Nazi Germany, which adopted eugenics and racial purity ideologies leading to the Holocaust ([Wikipedia, 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism:_A_History)). European colonial powers intensified exploitation and genocidal practices in Africa, such as King Leopold II's brutal regime in the Congo ([Wikipedia, 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism:_A_History)).

In the United States, institutional racism persisted through segregation, disenfranchisement, and violent repression of African Americans ([PBS, n.d.](https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-01.htm)).

## Biological and Evolutionary Perspectives on Racism

Modern evolutionary biology suggests that racism is not innate but rather a social construct arising from group identity and fear of outsiders ([Brooks, 2012](https://theconversation.com/the-origins-of-racism-8321)). While humans evolved to identify with "us" versus "them," the specific racial categories and hierarchies are culturally constructed.

Research shows that biological responses linked to race, such as amygdala activation, develop in adolescence and are influenced by social environment, not innate biology ([The Atlantic, 2012](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/nature-vs-nurture-new-research-shows-racism-isnt-innate/429126/)).

## Conclusion: When Did Racism First Start?

Based on the comprehensive review of historical and scientific evidence, racism as we understand it today—an ideology that classifies humans into hierarchical races based on immutable biological traits—did not exist in prehistoric or ancient times. Early human discrimination was tribal and based on power, not race.

Proto-racist attitudes emerged in the Middle Ages with religious-based exclusion, particularly against Jews, but these were not fully racialized in the modern sense. The true inception of racism as a racial ideology coincides with the 15th century transatlantic slave trade, when Europeans began to systematically categorize Africans as inferior to justify slavery and colonization.

This racial ideology was further developed and institutionalized in the 18th and 19th centuries through scientific racism, which provided a pseudo-biological justification for racial hierarchies that persisted into the 20th century and beyond.

Therefore, **racism first started as a distinct and codified ideology in the 15th century with the onset of European colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade**, evolving through scientific and political frameworks over subsequent centuries.
