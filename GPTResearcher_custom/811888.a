# Reliance on Other Parties’ Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Procedures: A Comprehensive Analysis

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a critical component of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) frameworks globally. It involves verifying the identity of customers, understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships, and ongoing monitoring to detect suspicious activities. A pertinent question in the compliance landscape is whether organizations can rely on other parties’ CDD procedures, and under what conditions such reliance is appropriate and legally sound. This report provides an in-depth, structured, and objective analysis of reliance on third-party CDD procedures, drawing on regulatory frameworks, risk considerations, and best practices.

## 1. Introduction

The concept of reliance on third-party CDD procedures allows one reporting entity to depend on the customer identification and verification processes performed by another entity, typically a “reliable third party.” This practice can reduce duplication, lower costs, and improve customer experience by avoiding repetitive identity verification requests. However, reliance is subject to strict regulatory requirements and risk management considerations to ensure compliance and mitigate exposure to financial crimes.

## 2. Regulatory Frameworks Governing Reliance on Third-Party CDD

### 2.1 Australian AML/CTF Act and Rules

In Australia, reliance on third-party CDD procedures is explicitly permitted under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act), specifically sections 37A, 37B, and 38, and Chapter 7 of the AML/CTF Rules. There are two primary modes of reliance:

- **Ongoing Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Arrangements** (Section 37A): This requires a written agreement or arrangement with a reliable third party. The relying entity must have reasonable grounds to believe that the third party has appropriate AML/CTF systems and controls that meet regulatory requirements at the time of entering into the arrangement. This is an objective test, meaning the relying entity must be able to demonstrate compliance based on evidence and documentation.

- **Case-by-Case Reliance** (Section 38): This allows reliance on identification procedures carried out by a reliable third party without a formal CDD arrangement, but only when the relying entity has reasonable grounds to believe it is appropriate, considering the money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks involved.

The relying entity’s own Applicable Customer Identification Procedures (ACIP) are considered complete once reliance is established ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party)).

### 2.2 United States FinCEN CDD Rule

In the United States, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) finalized CDD rules effective July 11, 2016, with compliance required by May 11, 2018. While FinCEN’s rules emphasize robust CDD, including beneficial ownership identification and ongoing monitoring, reliance on third-party CDD is generally less formalized compared to Australia but is practiced under certain conditions, especially among financial institutions with correspondent relationships. The emphasis remains on risk-based procedures and ongoing monitoring ([FinCEN](https://www.younginc.com/new-customer-due-diligence-cdd-requirements-for-banks/)).

## 3. Conditions and Requirements for Reliance

### 3.1 Written CDD Arrangements

A formal CDD arrangement requires a written agreement that clearly defines the responsibilities of the third party and the relying entity. The relying entity must:

- Have reasonable grounds to believe the third party has AML/CTF systems and controls compliant with regulatory requirements.

- Conduct periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compliance.

- Remain responsible for any systemic breaches or failures by the third party.

- Remediate any isolated breaches promptly.

This arrangement provides a “safe harbour” from liability for isolated breaches under section 32 of the AML/CTF Act, provided the arrangement complies with the Act and Rules ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party)).

### 3.2 Case-by-Case Reliance

Where no formal arrangement exists, reliance may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if:

- The relying entity has reasonable grounds to believe reliance is appropriate based on the ML/TF risks.

- The third party is a reliable entity, such as another reporting entity or an AML/CTF-regulated foreign equivalent.

- The relying entity complies with the requirements for case-by-case reliance.

However, in this scenario, the relying entity remains liable for any breaches of customer identification procedures and record-keeping obligations ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party)).

## 4. Risk Management and Due Diligence in Reliance

### 4.1 Assessing the Reliability of Third Parties

Reliance is contingent on the third party’s reliability, which encompasses:

- **AML/CTF Systems and Controls:** The third party must have robust AML/CTF frameworks that satisfy regulatory standards.

- **Reputation and Track Record:** Prior performance, regulatory history, and absence of adverse events.

- **Jurisdictional Risk:** The regulatory environment of the third party’s location and its effectiveness in AML/CTF enforcement.

- **Ongoing Monitoring:** The third party’s commitment to continuous monitoring and updating of customer information.

The relying entity must conduct due diligence before entering into reliance arrangements and periodically thereafter to ensure continued compliance ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party); [RiskScreen](https://kyc360.riskscreen.com/article/aml-third-party-risks-what-matters-most/)).

### 4.2 Due Diligence Best Practices

Effective due diligence on third parties includes:

| Due Diligence Aspect       | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Information Gathering      | Incorporation documents, business lines, geographic locations, ownership, leadership profiles.  |
| Validation                | Screening against sanctions lists, adverse media, law enforcement records, and regulatory databases. |
| Risk Assessment           | Classifying third parties by risk level (low, medium, high) based on jurisdiction, business type, etc. |
| Ongoing Monitoring        | Periodic reassessment and monitoring of third-party activities and compliance status.            |
| Documentation            | Maintaining comprehensive records of due diligence, assessments, and decisions for audit and legal purposes. |

Automation and technology can augment these processes, but human insights remain critical for nuanced risk evaluation ([Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/advisory/articles/third-party-due-diligence.html); [RiskScreen](https://kyc360.riskscreen.com/article/aml-third-party-risks-what-matters-most/)).

## 5. Benefits and Risks of Reliance

### 5.1 Benefits

- **Cost Reduction:** Avoids duplication of customer identification efforts across entities.

- **Customer Convenience:** Reduces the burden on customers to provide identification multiple times.

- **Efficiency:** Streamlines compliance processes, especially in complex transactions involving multiple entities.

- **Safe Harbour Protection:** Formal CDD arrangements provide legal protection against isolated breaches ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party)).

### 5.2 Risks and Liabilities

- **Systemic Breaches:** The relying entity remains liable for systemic breaches if the third party’s AML/CTF controls are inadequate.

- **Individual Breaches:** In case-by-case reliance without formal arrangements, the relying entity is liable for each breach.

- **Reputational Risk:** Failure of third-party compliance can damage the relying entity’s reputation.

- **Regulatory Sanctions:** Non-compliance can lead to fines, legal actions, and operational restrictions.

- **Monitoring Burden:** The relying entity must maintain oversight and be prepared to remediate issues promptly ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party)).

## 6. Practical Considerations and Recommendations

### 6.1 When to Use Reliance

Reliance is most appropriate when:

- The third party is a regulated entity with proven AML/CTF controls.

- There is a formal, written CDD arrangement in place.

- The ML/TF risks are assessed and deemed manageable.

- The customer relationship involves multiple reporting entities or foreign equivalents, making repeated ACIP completion inefficient.

- The relying entity has sufficient resources and processes to monitor and manage reliance risks ([AUSTRAC](https://www.austrac.gov.au/business/how-comply-and-report-guidance-and-resources/customer-identification-and-verification/reliance-customer-identification-procedures-third-party)).

### 6.2 Due Diligence and Monitoring

Organizations should implement a robust third-party risk management program that includes:

- **Risk-Based Classification:** Prioritize due diligence efforts based on risk profiles.

- **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Gather detailed information on third-party ownership, operations, and compliance history.

- **Use of External Data Sources:** Leverage sanctions lists, adverse media, law enforcement records.

- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously assess third-party compliance and update risk assessments.

- **Documentation:** Maintain thorough records to support decisions and demonstrate compliance ([RiskScreen](https://kyc360.riskscreen.com/article/aml-third-party-risks-what-matters-most/); [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/advisory/articles/third-party-due-diligence.html)).

### 6.3 Legal and Compliance Oversight

- Review and update reliance arrangements regularly to ensure compliance with evolving regulations.

- Train staff on reliance policies and risk indicators.

- Establish clear remediation protocols for breaches.

- Engage external auditors or consultants for independent assessments if necessary ([FDIC](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/5000-2450.html)).

## 7. Conclusion

Based on comprehensive analysis of regulatory frameworks, risk management principles, and industry best practices, it is clear that organizations **can rely on other parties’ CDD procedures** under specific, controlled conditions. Reliance is not a blanket permission but a carefully regulated practice that requires:

- A formal written arrangement or justified case-by-case reliance.

- Reasonable grounds and objective evidence of the third party’s compliance with AML/CTF requirements.

- Ongoing monitoring and risk management by the relying entity.

- Acceptance of liability for breaches and prompt remediation efforts.

When these conditions are met, reliance on third-party CDD can be a valuable tool to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience without compromising regulatory compliance or risk management. Conversely, failure to adhere to these principles exposes organizations to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks.
