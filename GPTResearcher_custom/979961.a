- **Empowerment Model**: Instead of traditional one-for-one donations, Warby Parker funds the production of glasses for VisionSpring, which trains low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries to sell affordable glasses, fostering economic empowerment and sustainable local businesses.

- **User-Generated Content and Social Media Engagement**: The company’s Home Try-On program encourages customers to share their experiences on social media using hashtags like #WarbyHomeTryOn, generating over 56,000 user-generated videos.
