# Why Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?  
## A Comprehensive and Objective Report

---

## Introduction

The death penalty, or capital punishment, remains one of the most controversial and debated topics in criminal justice worldwide. While many countries have abolished it, others maintain it as a legal form of punishment for the most heinous crimes. This report aims to provide a detailed, well-structured, and evidence-based analysis of why the death penalty should be allowed, drawing on empirical research, criminological studies, legal perspectives, and societal considerations. The report prioritizes recent and reliable sources, presenting arguments supported by data and scholarly consensus where available.

## 1. Deterrence Effect of the Death Penalty

One of the primary arguments in favor of the death penalty is its potential deterrent effect on serious crimes, particularly murder. The rationale is grounded in classical criminology: increasing the cost of committing a crime (in this case, the threat of death) reduces the likelihood of its commission.

### Empirical Evidence on Deterrence

- A series of academic studies over the past two decades suggest that executions have a measurable deterrent effect on homicide rates. For instance, a 2003 nationwide study estimated that each execution deters an average of 18 murders ([Associated Press, 2015](https://www.foxnews.com/us/studies-death-penalty-discourages-crime)). Other studies estimate the number of murders deterred per execution to range from 3 to 14, indicating a consistent trend of deterrence albeit with varying magnitudes.

- The Illinois moratorium on executions in 2000 reportedly led to 150 additional homicides over the following four years, underscoring the potential consequences of suspending capital punishment ([Associated Press, 2015](https://www.foxnews.com/us/studies-death-penalty-discourages-crime)).

- Speeding up executions is posited to strengthen deterrence. A 2004 study found that reducing time on death row by 2.75 years could prevent one murder ([Associated Press, 2015](https://www.foxnews.com/us/studies-death-penalty-discourages-crime)).

### Theoretical Justification

Ernest van den Haag, a professor of jurisprudence, argued that people fear death more than any other punishment, making capital punishment uniquely effective as a deterrent. He also noted that the death penalty deters not only potential first-time offenders but also prisoners already serving life sentences from committing further murders ([Michigan State University & Death Penalty Information Center](https://deathpenaltyinfo.msu.edu/)).

### Counterpoints and Limitations

While some critics argue that data is insufficient or inconclusive, proponents maintain that the rarity and delayed nature of executions complicate statistical analysis but do not negate the deterrent effect. The consensus among many economists and criminologists is that the death penalty likely deters more than alternative punishments.

## 2. Incapacitation and Public Safety

Capital punishment ensures that convicted murderers, especially repeat offenders and dangerous criminals, cannot commit further crimes, either inside or outside prison.

- Data shows that a significant proportion of murderers on death row have prior felony convictions, and many were on probation or parole at the time of their crimes ([The Death Penalty: Keeping Our Society Safe, 2016](https://graduateway.com/the-death-penalty-keeping-our-society-safe/)).

- Life imprisonment, while severe, does not eliminate the risk of parole, escape, or further violence within prisons. Cases such as Robert Massie, who was paroled and then committed another murder, highlight this risk ([The Death Penalty: Keeping Our Society Safe, 2016](https://graduateway.com/the-death-penalty-keeping-our-society-safe/)).

- The death penalty removes any possibility of recidivism, thereby protecting society and law enforcement personnel from potential harm.

## 3. Justice and Moral Retribution

The principle of "an eye for an eye" remains a foundational argument for capital punishment, emphasizing proportionality and moral justice.

- The death penalty is viewed as a just and fitting punishment for those who deliberately take a human life, reflecting society's condemnation of such acts ([Benefits of Death Penalty, Hinton, 2009](https://www.suite101.com/content/the-pros-and-cons-of-the-death-penalty-a90241)).

- It respects the value of the victim’s life by ensuring that the perpetrator forfeits their own life in return, reinforcing societal norms about the sanctity of life.

- For many victims’ families, the death penalty provides closure and a sense of finality, which can be critical for emotional healing ([Benefits of Death Penalty, Hinton, 2009](https://www.suite101.com/content/the-pros-and-cons-of-the-death-penalty-a90241)).

## 4. Economic Considerations

Although the death penalty involves significant upfront costs related to trials and appeals, some argue it may be less costly than life imprisonment over decades.

| Cost Component          | Death Penalty                     | Life Imprisonment                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Trial and Sentencing   | High due to complexity and appeals | Generally lower, fewer appeals  |
| Incarceration         | Costs until execution (varies)    | Costs over entire life          |
| Appeals Process       | Lengthy and expensive             | Less frequent and shorter       |
| Execution Costs       | Includes lethal injection, security | N/A                            |
| Total Cost            | High upfront, potentially lower long-term | High over long term             |

- Some analyses suggest that the death penalty costs less in the long run because it eliminates the need for lifelong incarceration ([Benefits Of The Death Penalty, IPL](https://www.ipl.org/essay/Benefits-Of-The-Death-Penalty-PKQJ9J9F3)).

- However, this remains a contentious issue, with other studies indicating that prolonged appeals and legal processes increase costs significantly.

## 5. Addressing Wrongful Convictions

Opponents often cite the risk of executing innocent people. However, advances in forensic science, especially DNA testing, have greatly reduced this risk.

- Modern investigative techniques and multiple layers of appeals provide safeguards against wrongful executions ([Benefits of Death Penalty, Hinton, 2009](https://www.suite101.com/content/the-pros-and-cons-of-the-death-penalty-a90241)).

- While no system is infallible, the number of innocent people executed in the U.S. since the reinstatement of the death penalty is effectively zero, due to these protections ([No credible evidence of wrongful executions](https://deathpenaltyinfo.msu.edu/)).

---

## 6. Societal and Legal Perspectives

- The death penalty is legally sanctioned in 35 U.S. states and remains a constitutional punishment under U.S. law ([Michigan State University & Death Penalty Information Center](https://deathpenaltyinfo.msu.edu/)).

- Public opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans support the death penalty for the most serious crimes, reflecting societal endorsement ([Debate.org](https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-the-death-penalty-be-allowed)).

- Some religious and cultural traditions view capital punishment as a just and necessary measure for maintaining social order and moral balance ([Death Penalty Persuasive Essay, GPALabs](https://gpalabs.com/blog/death-penalty-persuasive-essay-why-should-the-death-penalty-exist)).

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of empirical studies, legal frameworks, and societal considerations, there is substantial evidence supporting the allowance of the death penalty, particularly as a deterrent to serious crimes, a means of incapacitation, and as a form of just retribution. While acknowledging the complexities and moral debates surrounding capital punishment, the death penalty serves critical functions in protecting society, delivering justice, and potentially saving lives by deterring future murders.

Advances in forensic science and legal safeguards have minimized the risk of wrongful executions, addressing one of the most significant criticisms of capital punishment. Moreover, the death penalty aligns with the values of many communities and legal systems that prioritize proportionality and public safety.

Therefore, the death penalty should be allowed as a legal and judicial option for the most egregious crimes, implemented with rigorous procedural safeguards to ensure fairness and accuracy.
