# Why Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed? A Comprehensive Report

The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, remains one of the most contentious issues in criminal justice and ethics. This report explores the arguments supporting the legalization and application of the death penalty, drawing on a wide range of sources to provide an in-depth, balanced, and evidence-based analysis. The report aims to clarify why the death penalty should be allowed, considering its purported benefits such as deterrence, retribution, incapacitation, and social justice, while acknowledging criticisms and challenges.

## Deterrence of Crime

One of the most frequently cited justifications for the death penalty is its potential to deter heinous crimes, particularly murder. The deterrence theory posits that criminals weigh the consequences of their actions, and the threat of the death penalty may dissuade those contemplating capital offenses. Proponents argue that the fear of execution creates a powerful psychological barrier against committing murder or other capital crimes ([UK Essays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php)).

Empirical evidence on deterrence is mixed but suggests some support for the death penalty's deterrent effect. For example, research following the suspension of executions in Illinois in 2000 found an increase of approximately 150 homicides over four years, implying a correlation between the absence of capital punishment and rising murder rates ([Listland, 2016](https://www.listland.com/10-reasons-the-death-penalty-should-be-legal/)). Additionally, economic analyses, such as those by Professor Joanna Shepherd, indicate a consensus among economists that capital punishment deters crime, with modern studies showing consistent deterrent effects ([Quizlet, 2019](https://quizlet.com/57796922/death-penalty-test-3-flash-cards/)).

However, critics argue that many studies fail to adequately control for confounding variables such as unemployment rates, policing levels, and social factors, making it difficult to isolate the death penalty's deterrent effect ([Death Penalty Information Center, 2019](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/deterrence)). Despite this, the general agreement among proponents is that when implemented with certainty and swiftness, the death penalty can deter premeditated murders more effectively than life imprisonment.

## Retribution and Justice

Retributive justice is a foundational argument for the death penalty. It holds that punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed. The death penalty is seen as the only punishment commensurate with the severity of taking another person's life. This principle satisfies society's need for moral balance and delivers justice to victims and their families ([UK Essays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php)).

Retribution also serves a social function by channeling the natural human desire for vengeance into a lawful process, thereby maintaining social order and preventing private acts of revenge ([eNotes, 2023](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/5-reasons-support-death-penalty-506371)). This legalized form of retribution reassures the public that justice is served, which can contribute to social stability.

## Incapacitation of Dangerous Offenders

Another significant argument for the death penalty is incapacitation—the permanent removal of dangerous criminals from society. Proponents assert that executing habitual killers, serial offenders, and violent criminals ensures they cannot commit further crimes, thus enhancing public safety ([UK Essays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php); [eNotes, 2023](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/5-reasons-support-death-penalty-506371)).

Unlike life imprisonment, which still carries a risk of escape or violence within prison, the death penalty eliminates any possibility of recidivism. This argument is particularly compelling in cases involving serial killers or terrorists who pose ongoing threats.

## Cost Considerations and Social Anxiety

While opponents often highlight the high financial costs of death penalty cases due to lengthy trials and appeals, proponents argue that the death penalty can reduce long-term incarceration costs by removing inmates permanently ([UK Essays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php)). Additionally, the social anxiety and fear generated by dangerous criminals living in society or prison can be mitigated by capital punishment.

The economic argument also extends to the burden on taxpayers, who fund the incarceration and care of life-term prisoners. Proponents suggest that the death penalty is a rational allocation of resources when balanced against the need for public safety and justice ([Debate.org, 2023](https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-the-death-penalty-be-allowed)).

## Constitutional and Legal Validity

The death penalty is constitutionally permissible in the United States under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, provided it is applied fairly and judiciously ([Listland, 2016](https://www.listland.com/10-reasons-the-death-penalty-should-be-legal/)). This legal framework ensures that capital punishment is reserved for the most serious crimes and that defendants receive due process.

Advances in forensic science, such as DNA evidence, have improved the accuracy of convictions, reducing the risk of wrongful executions and strengthening the legal justification for the death penalty ([Listland, 2016](https://www.listland.com/10-reasons-the-death-penalty-should-be-legal/)).

## Addressing Common Criticisms

### Risk of Wrongful Execution

Opponents often cite the irreversible nature of the death penalty and the possibility of executing innocent people. However, improvements in forensic technology and rigorous legal safeguards have significantly lowered this risk. Moreover, the justice system continues to evolve to prevent miscarriages of justice ([Listland, 2016](https://www.listland.com/10-reasons-the-death-penalty-should-be-legal/)).

### Moral and Ethical Concerns

While moral objections are valid, proponents argue that the death penalty is a necessary response to the most egregious violations of human rights—namely, murder. The punishment reflects society's condemnation of taking innocent life and upholds the principle that serious crimes deserve serious consequences ([UK Essays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php)).

### Cost and Efficiency

Although death penalty cases can be expensive, proponents emphasize the importance of streamlining legal proceedings to increase certainty, swiftness, and proportionality of justice, thereby reducing costs without compromising fairness ([UK Essays, 2019](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/arguments-for-the-death-penalty-philosophy-essay.php)).

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of available evidence and arguments, the death penalty should be allowed as a legal form of punishment for the most serious crimes, particularly premeditated murder and acts that gravely endanger society. The death penalty serves multiple purposes: it acts as a deterrent to potential offenders, delivers just retribution proportionate to the crime, incapacitates dangerous criminals permanently, and aligns with constitutional provisions when applied judiciously.

While acknowledging the criticisms related to costs, moral concerns, and the risk of wrongful executions, these challenges can be mitigated through legal reforms, technological advancements, and procedural safeguards. The death penalty, therefore, remains a necessary component of the criminal justice system to protect society, uphold justice, and maintain social order.

Governments should focus on ensuring that death penalty cases are handled with the utmost fairness, speed, and proportionality to maximize its intended benefits while minimizing risks and ethical dilemmas.
