# Report on Nursing Time Spent Documenting Using Electronic Health Records (EHR)

The adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has transformed healthcare documentation, aiming to improve patient care, enhance data accuracy, and streamline workflows. However, a critical concern remains: Are nurses spending too much time documenting using EHR systems? This report provides a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of this question, drawing from multiple systematic reviews, empirical studies, and expert analyses to present an objective evaluation of nursing documentation burden related to EHR use.

## Overview of Nursing Documentation Time with EHR

Nurses play a pivotal role in patient care, requiring meticulous documentation of assessments, care plans, medication administration, and clinical changes. EHRs have been introduced to facilitate this process, offering standardized formats, templates, and real-time access to patient data. Despite these advantages, evidence suggests that EHR implementation has led to significant changes in documentation time, with mixed impacts on nursing productivity and patient care.

### Quantitative Findings on Documentation Time

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide quantitative insights into the time nurses spend on documentation with EHRs:

- A systematic review of 23 studies found that nurses saved approximately **24.5% of their overall documentation time during shifts** when using bedside terminals or central station desktops compared to paper-based methods ([Poissant et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1205599/)).

- Conversely, when documentation time was measured per patient, EHR use was associated with **increases in documentation time ranging from 7.7% to 128.4%**, indicating that while total shift documentation time may decrease, the time per patient may increase ([Poissant et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1205599/)).

- Nurses reportedly spend **more than half of their shift time on EHR data entry and retrieval**, which reduces direct patient contact time ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

- In a community hospital study, 73% of nurses reported spending at least half their shift using EHRs, highlighting the significant documentation burden ([Bakken et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18317257/)).

### Documentation Burden and Its Consequences

The documentation burden associated with EHRs is multifaceted, involving increased clinician documentation time, extended work hours, and clerical workload. This burden has been linked to:

- **Increased medical errors and threats to patient safety** due to documentation overload ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

- **Inferior documentation quality** when nurses resort to workarounds or incomplete entries to manage time constraints ([American Nurse, 2018](https://www.myamericannurse.com/documentation-electronic-health-record/)).

- **Job attrition and burnout** among nurses, driven by dissatisfaction with existing documentation methods ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

- **Reduced direct patient care time**, which may negatively impact patient outcomes ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

## Factors Influencing Documentation Time in Nursing

### EHR System Design and Accessibility

- Use of **bedside terminals and point-of-care systems** tends to save nurses time during shifts by reducing the need to move between workstations ([Poissant et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1205599/)).

- However, some studies report that bedside terminals can **increase documentation time**, depending on the specific content being documented and system usability ([Poissant et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1205599/)).

- Proprietary and opaque vendor-defined time metrics and EHR usage logs have been found to lack accuracy, complicating precise measurement of documentation time ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

### Workflow and Work Environment

- Shift-based work may be associated with less documentation burden compared to ambulatory settings, where documentation is rated equally valuable and burdensome ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

- Nurses in inpatient settings rarely perform after-hours documentation ("pajama time"), suggesting that data entry rates during shifts are more relevant for measuring burden ([Sinsky et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/998/6090156)).

- Team-based documentation models, involving nursing staff, medical assistants, or scribes, have been shown to reduce documentation burden for physicians and may have implications for nursing workflows ([Healthcare IT News, 2021](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/alleviate-ehr-burdens-teamwork-makes-dream-work)).

### Impact on Nursing Practice and Patient Care

- Nurses report that EHR use enhances nursing work through increased information access, improved organization, and helpful alert screens, which can improve patient safety ([Bakken et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18317257/)).

- However, EHRs can also impair critical thinking, decrease interdisciplinary communication, and demand high documentation time, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction ([American Nurse, 2018](https://www.myamericannurse.com/documentation-electronic-health-record/)).

- Efficient EHR use can improve patient outcomes by reducing medical errors and enabling timely reporting of critical lab values ([Digital Health Folio3, 2023](https://digitalhealth.folio3.com/blog/impact-of-ehr-in-nursing-practice/)).

## Opinion and Interpretation

Based on the comprehensive review of the evidence, it is clear that **nurses are spending a substantial amount of time documenting using EHR systems—often more than half of their shift time**. While some studies report time savings in total shift documentation time, these are offset by increased time spent per patient and the overall high documentation demands. This extensive documentation burden contributes to reduced direct patient care time, clinician dissatisfaction, and potential risks to patient safety due to rushed or incomplete documentation.

The variability in findings reflects differences in EHR system design, workflow integration, and clinical settings. Systems that facilitate bedside or point-of-care documentation tend to reduce time spent on documentation, but usability issues and system complexity can negate these benefits. Moreover, the lack of standardized and accurate measurement methods for documentation time complicates assessment and improvement efforts.

Therefore, **it is reasonable to conclude that nurses are currently spending too much time documenting in EHRs**, which can detract from patient care and contribute to burnout. However, this burden is not an inherent flaw of EHR technology but rather a consequence of system design, implementation strategies, and workflow integration challenges.

## Recommendations for Addressing Nursing Documentation Burden

1. **Optimize EHR Usability:** Improve interface design, reduce unnecessary data entry fields, and streamline workflows to minimize documentation time.

2. **Implement Team-Based Documentation:** Utilize nursing assistants, scribes, or other support staff to share documentation responsibilities.

3. **Standardize Metrics:** Develop and validate reliable measures of documentation time and burden to guide quality improvement.

4. **Provide Training and Support:** Offer scenario-based training and simulations to enhance EHR proficiency and efficiency.

5. **Engage Nurses in EHR Design:** Involve frontline nursing staff in system customization to ensure alignment with clinical needs.

6. **Leverage Technology Integration:** Use connected devices and automated data capture to reduce manual entry and transcription errors.

## Conclusion

The evidence indicates that nurses are spending a significant and often excessive amount of time documenting using EHR systems. While EHRs offer benefits such as improved data access and potential time savings in some contexts, the overall documentation burden remains high, impacting nurse satisfaction, patient care, and safety. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach involving system design improvements, workflow optimization, team-based care models, and robust measurement strategies.
