# How Did the Armenian Genocide Happen? A Comprehensive Analysis

The Armenian Genocide, which occurred between 1915 and 1923, stands as one of the most tragic and significant atrocities of the twentieth century. Approximately 1.5 million Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were systematically uprooted, deported, and exterminated. This report provides a detailed, structured, and comprehensive examination of how the Armenian Genocide happened, drawing upon a wide range of scholarly sources and historical evidence.

## Historical and Political Context

### The Ottoman Empire and the Armenian Population

On the eve of World War I, the Ottoman Empire was a declining multinational state facing significant internal and external challenges. Armenians, numbering about two million, were a Christian minority primarily residing in eastern Anatolia. They were often economically prosperous and more educated compared to the Muslim Turkish majority, which fostered resentment and envy ([Kifner, n.d.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/timestopics/topics_armeniangenocide.html); [Armenian Weekly, 2018](https://armenianweekly.com/2018/04/24/what-were-the-main-causes-of-the-armenian-genocide/)).

The Ottoman Empire had a long history of ethnic and religious tensions. Armenians were treated as second-class citizens, facing legal and social restrictions, including prohibitions on bearing arms and limited access to justice ([Armenian Weekly, 2018](https://armenianweekly.com/2018/04/24/what-were-the-main-causes-of-the-armenian-genocide/)). This systemic discrimination created a volatile environment.

### The Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) and Nationalism

The ruling party during this period, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), also known as the Young Turks, sought to preserve the empire amid growing nationalist movements and territorial losses. The CUP leadership increasingly viewed Armenians as an existential threat, suspecting them of collaborating with the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire's enemy in World War I ([Wikipedia, Causes of the Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).

Historians emphasize that the genocide was not premeditated before World War I but was the result of a combination of long-term structural problems and wartime contingencies. The CUP's ideology was a mix of Ottomanism and Turkish nationalism, with the latter gaining prominence during the war ([Bloxham & Göçek, 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).

## Causes and Catalysts of the Genocide

### Multicausal Explanations

Modern historiography recognizes that the Armenian Genocide resulted from a complex interplay of factors rather than a single cause. These include:

| Factor                         | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nationalism and Ideology**   | The CUP's goal to create a homogeneous Turkish nation-state, viewing Armenians as obstacles.      |
| **Religious and Cultural Tensions** | Long-standing religious discrimination against Christian Armenians in a Muslim-majority empire. |
| **Economic Factors**           | Envy and resentment due to Armenian economic success relative to Muslim Turks.                    |
| **Territorial Losses and Refugee Crisis** | Losses in the Balkan Wars and fear of Armenian separatism.                                      |
| **Wartime Radicalization**     | World War I created conditions that allowed radical policies to be implemented.                   |
| **Paranoia and Security Concerns** | CUP leaders’ subjective paranoia about Armenian collaboration with Russia.                        |

These factors combined to create a "perfect storm" that culminated in genocide ([Wikipedia, Causes of the Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide); [Armenian Weekly, 2018](https://armenianweekly.com/2018/04/24/what-were-the-main-causes-of-the-armenian-genocide/)).

### The Role of World War I

The outbreak of World War I was a critical catalyst. The Ottoman Empire sided with the Central Powers, and the war intensified fears of internal dissent and separatism. The CUP leadership perceived Armenians as a fifth column that could aid the Russian enemy. This perception, though exaggerated, justified harsh measures against Armenians ([Bloxham & Göçek, 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).

## Execution of the Genocide

### Planning and Implementation

While early scholarship suggested that the genocide was pre-planned as early as the 1910 or 1911 CUP congresses, most contemporary historians reject this view. Instead, the genocide was a product of wartime contingencies and escalating radicalization ([Wikipedia, Causes of the Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).

The genocide began on April 24, 1915, with the arrest and execution of approximately 300 Armenian intellectuals, writers, and community leaders in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). This decapitation of Armenian leadership was followed by mass deportations and massacres ([DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-armenian-genocide)).

### Deportations and Death Marches

Armenians were forcibly removed from their homes and sent on death marches through the Syrian and Mesopotamian deserts. Many were stripped of possessions, starved, and subjected to brutal violence, including rape and murder. Those who survived the marches often faced concentration camps or outright execution ([UK Essays, 2017](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/human-rights/history-causes-and-impact-of-the-armenian-genocide-8258.php)).

### Scale and Impact

By 1922, the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire had been reduced from two million to fewer than 400,000. Approximately 1.5 million Armenians perished during the genocide ([Kifner, n.d.](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/timestopics/topics_armeniangenocide.html)).

## Debates and Interpretations

### Denial and Justifications

Armenian genocide denial remains a contentious issue. Some arguments used to deny or justify the genocide include:

- The "provocation thesis," which claims Armenians provoked the genocide through revolutionary activities, a claim widely discredited by historians ([Wikipedia, Causes of the Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).
- Exaggeration of international factors, such as European imperialism, to absolve the Ottoman government ([Wikipedia, Causes of the Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).
- Economic accusations that Armenians sided with European powers to the detriment of Muslim Ottomans, often ignoring contrary evidence ([Wikipedia, Causes of the Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).

### Historiographical Shifts

Research has evolved from simplistic, monocausal explanations to nuanced, multicausal analyses that consider both objective structural factors and subjective elements like paranoia among CUP leaders ([Der Matossian, 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Armenian_genocide)).

## Long-Term Consequences

### Armenian Diaspora and Recognition

The genocide led to a widespread Armenian diaspora, with survivors fleeing to various countries worldwide. Despite the scale of the atrocity, global recognition of the Armenian Genocide has been slow and remains politically sensitive ([UK Essays, 2017](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/human-rights/history-causes-and-impact-of-the-armenian-genocide-8258.php)).

### Influence on International Law

The Armenian Genocide was a foundational event in the development of the concept of genocide. Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term "genocide," was inspired by the Armenian massacres to advocate for legal protections against such crimes, culminating in the UN Genocide Convention of 1948 ([USHMM, n.d.](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-armenian-genocide-1915-16-overview)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The Armenian Genocide was the result of a complex combination of long-standing ethnic and religious tensions, nationalist ideologies, economic disparities, and the specific wartime context of World War I. It was not a spontaneous event but a systematically planned and executed campaign by the Ottoman government under the CUP leadership to eliminate the Armenian population as a political and social entity.

While the genocide was not premeditated years in advance, the CUP's radicalization during the war and their perception of Armenians as an existential threat led to the adoption of genocidal policies. The genocide's execution involved mass arrests, deportations, death marches, and massacres that resulted in the deaths of approximately 1.5 million Armenians.

Understanding the Armenian Genocide requires acknowledging the multicausal nature of its origins and the interplay between structural factors and human agency. Denial and distortion of the facts continue to hinder global recognition and reconciliation. It is imperative that the genocide be studied comprehensively to honor the victims and prevent future atrocities.
