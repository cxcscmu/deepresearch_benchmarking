## Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of Nursing Home Residents

Nursing home residents have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, not only in terms of physical health but also mental well-being. Up to one-third of nursing homes in the U.S. were directly affected by COVID-19 outbreaks, with over 10,000 resident deaths reported by late April 2020 ([American Psychological Association, 2020](https://www.apa.org/topics/covid-19/nursing-home-residents)). The pandemic-induced lockdowns and visitor restrictions have exacerbated social isolation, a pre-existing issue in long-term care facilities, leading to increased anxiety, depression, and accelerated cognitive and physical decline among residents ([Next Avenue, 2020](https://www.nextavenue.org/the-huge-emotional-toll-covid-19-is-taking-on-nursing-home-residents/)).

A survey conducted by the Altarum Institute in mid-2020 found that pandemic restrictions affected nearly every aspect of residents' lives, especially their mental health, with many confined to their rooms for months ([Next Avenue, 2020](https://www.nextavenue.org/the-huge-emotional-toll-covid-19-is-taking-on-nursing-home-residents/)). The mental health toll is compounded by staffing shortages and high turnover rates, which have escalated during the pandemic, further limiting the quality and consistency of care ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

## Prevalence and Nature of Mental Health Disorders in Nursing Homes

Before the pandemic, nursing homes already housed a high proportion of residents with significant mental health disorders. Estimates suggest that 65% to 91% of nursing home residents suffer from mood disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or other psychiatric conditions ([Happy2Thrive, 2020](https://happy2thrive.org/mental-health-care-in-nursing-homes/); [Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)). This prevalence has led experts to describe nursing homes as "psychiatric institutions" due to the concentration of mental health needs ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

The pandemic has intensified these challenges, with increased anxiety related to fear of infection, witnessing illness and death among peers and staff, and enforced isolation ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)). Depressive symptoms have also surged, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced mental health support.

## Challenges in Mental Health Care Delivery Post-COVID-19

### Barriers to Access and Care

Despite the clear need, mental health care availability in nursing homes remains limited. Social workers and psychologists face immense strain, and many facilities restrict access to outside mental health professionals due to infection control measures ([American Psychological Association, 2020](https://www.apa.org/topics/covid-19/nursing-home-residents)). Telehealth has emerged as a vital tool to bridge this gap, allowing psychologists to provide stress reduction interventions, normalize emotional symptoms, and facilitate connections with loved ones ([American Psychological Association, 2020](https://www.apa.org/topics/covid-19/nursing-home-residents)).

However, telehealth is not a panacea. It requires adequate technology infrastructure, staff training, and resident willingness to engage, which can be inconsistent across facilities. Furthermore, mental health care often remains reactive rather than proactive, with psychiatric consultations typically provided only as needed rather than integrated into routine care ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

### Staff Mental Health and Turnover

Staff members in nursing homes also face significant mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression related to fears of contracting COVID-19 and managing increased workloads amid staffing shortages ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)). High turnover rates disrupt continuity of care and exacerbate stress for both staff and residents.

## Strategies and Models for Improving Mental Health Care in Nursing Homes

### Multidisciplinary Team Approach and "Train the Trainer" Models

Research indicates that a multidisciplinary team approach combined with a "train the trainer" nurse specialist model is effective in improving mental health care in nursing homes. This model focuses on training nurses to identify and address mental health needs, leading to improved staff knowledge, performance, and reduced turnover ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)). Despite evidence supporting this approach, its implementation remains limited, with little change in care access or models over the past decade.

### Education and Training via Project ECHO

Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) offers virtual educational programs to nursing home staff, focusing on addressing pandemic-related social isolation and mental health challenges. These programs provide telementoring by expert teams to support direct care providers in intervening appropriately and preventing worse outcomes ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

### Integration of Behavioral and Medical Treatments

Experts emphasize the need to integrate behavioral health into medical care teams within nursing homes to address the complex mental health needs of residents effectively. This integration can improve quality of life and clinical outcomes by providing comprehensive, coordinated care ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

### Addressing Grief and Loss

Grief is a common experience among older adults, exacerbated by the pandemic due to losses of loved ones and social connections. Nursing homes are encouraged to implement grief counseling and psychosocial support to help residents cope with these losses ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

### Balancing Infection Control and Person-Centered Care

While infection control remains paramount, there is a growing recognition of the need to balance these measures with person-centered care to maintain residents' mental health. This includes ensuring meaningful interaction between staff and residents despite personal protective equipment barriers and avoiding reduced contact times that can worsen mental health ([International Psychogeriatrics, 2021](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-psychogeriatrics/article/covid19-it-is-time-to-balance-infection-management-and-personcentered-care-to-maintain-mental-health-of-people-living-in-german-nursing-homes/353DE999050FEA5B8CEF7126ED1D0C4C)).

## Evidence-Based Psychological Interventions

Although mental health nurses play a crucial role in delivering psychological interventions, there is a shortage of adequately trained staff in evidence-based therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) ([Nursing Times, 2001](https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/mental-health-nurses/evidence-based-psychological-interventions-in-mental-health-nursing-18-01-2001/)). Expanding training and capacity in these interventions is essential for improving mental health outcomes in nursing homes.

## The Role of Telehealth and Home-Based Activities

Telehealth has been instrumental during the pandemic in maintaining mental health services. Additionally, home-based activities such as exercise, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and listening to relaxing music have shown benefits in promoting mental wellness during COVID-19 and can be adapted for nursing home residents ([Puyat et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33270755/)).

---

## Vaccination and Mental Health

The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in nursing homes has been a critical step toward ending the pandemic's physical health crisis. However, vaccine availability alone does not resolve the widespread mental health challenges faced by residents and staff. Mental health issues remain under-recognized and require ongoing attention beyond vaccination efforts ([Psycom, 2021](https://pro.psycom.net/special_reports/covid-and-mental-health-long-term-care-residents)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled and intensified the mental health crisis within nursing homes. Residents face compounded challenges due to isolation, grief, and pre-existing psychiatric conditions, while staff endure heightened stress and turnover. Despite these challenges, nursing homes have begun adopting innovative strategies such as telehealth, multidisciplinary teams, and specialized training programs like Project ECHO to address mental health needs.

However, significant gaps remain. There is an urgent need for systemic changes, including:

- **Increased integration of behavioral health into routine nursing home care** to provide proactive, continuous mental health support.
- **Expanded training for nursing home staff** in evidence-based psychological interventions to improve care quality.
- **Enhanced support for staff mental health** to reduce turnover and improve care consistency.
- **Balanced infection control policies** that maintain necessary safety without sacrificing resident interaction and person-centered care.
- **Sustained mental health services post-pandemic**, recognizing that vaccination alone does not resolve mental health challenges.

Addressing these areas comprehensively will be essential to improving the quality of life and mental well-being of elderly nursing home residents in the post-COVID-19 era.
