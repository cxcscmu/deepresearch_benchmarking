# Why Climate is Changing: An In-Depth Analysis

Climate change is one of the most critical challenges facing humanity today. It refers to significant, long-term changes in the statistical properties of the climate system, including averages, variability, and extremes, typically observed over decades or longer. Understanding why the climate is changing requires a comprehensive examination of both natural and anthropogenic (human-induced) factors, supported by extensive scientific research and data. This report synthesizes current knowledge from trusted and recent sources to provide a detailed, objective, and evidence-based explanation of the causes of climate change.

## The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change

A vast majority of scientific studies—more than 99.9% of peer-reviewed papers—agree that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change ([Ramanujan, 2021](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change)). This consensus has strengthened over time, with earlier research (1991–2012) showing a 97% agreement, now updated to over 99% agreement based on a survey of 88,125 climate-related studies published between 2012 and 2020 ([Cornell University, 2021](https://phys.org/news/2021-10-humans-climate.html)). The overwhelming consensus confirms that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions—primarily carbon dioxide (CO₂) from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and land-use changes—are the dominant drivers of global warming and climate change.

## Anthropogenic Causes of Climate Change

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions

The principal driver of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, especially CO₂. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating the "greenhouse effect," which warms the Earth's surface. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes release large quantities of GHGs, disrupting the natural carbon cycle.

- **Fossil Fuel Combustion:** The largest source of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions.
- **Deforestation and Land Use Change:** Account for approximately 11% to 29% of global GHG emissions, depending on the source ([IPCC, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change); [REDD+, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_emissions_from_deforestation_and_forest_degradation)).

Forests act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO₂ during photosynthesis, but deforestation releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere, exacerbating warming. Tropical deforestation is particularly significant because it not only emits CO₂ but also affects other biophysical processes that influence climate, such as albedo and evapotranspiration ([Fearnside, 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

### Deforestation and Forest Degradation

Deforestation contributes substantially to climate change by releasing carbon stored in biomass and soil. It is estimated that deforestation and forest degradation contribute between 17% and 29% of global GHG emissions ([REDD+, n.d.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_emissions_from_deforestation_and_forest_degradation)). Efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation, such as the REDD+ mechanism, focus on slowing deforestation rates and promoting sustainable forest management to enhance carbon sequestration.

| Cause                          | Contribution to Global GHG Emissions (%) | Notes                                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Fossil Fuel Combustion         | Largest share (exact % varies by source) | Primary anthropogenic source                   |
| Deforestation & Land Use Change| 11%–29%                                  | Significant in tropical regions                |
| Industrial Processes           | Significant                              | Includes cement production, chemical processes|

### Industrial and Agricultural Activities

Industrial processes and agriculture also contribute to GHG emissions through methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and fluorinated gases. These gases have higher global warming potentials than CO₂, though they are present in smaller quantities.

## Natural Causes and Variability

While human activities dominate recent climate change, natural factors and variability also influence the climate system. Natural climate change has occurred throughout Earth's history due to various internal and external processes.

### Natural Climate Drivers

- **Solar Variability:** Changes in solar irradiance, including the 11-year solar cycle, affect Earth’s energy balance. Some studies estimate solar variability accounted for up to 50% of 20th-century warming but less in recent decades ([Scafetta & West, 2006](https://chandarren97.medium.com/the-evidence-for-anthropogenic-climate-change-f5c6f2a48b85)).
- **Volcanic Activity:** Volcanic eruptions inject aerosols into the atmosphere, temporarily cooling the planet by reflecting sunlight.
- **Orbital Cycles (Milankovitch Cycles):** Long-term changes in Earth's orbit influence glacial and interglacial periods.
- **Internal Climate Variability:** Oscillations such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) cause short- to medium-term climate fluctuations.

### Role of Natural Variability in Recent Warming

Natural variability can enhance or suppress warming trends. It is estimated that between 1880 and 2017, natural variability accounted for approximately 30% of observed warming, while anthropogenic emissions accounted for 70% ([Wu et al., 2019](https://chandarren97.medium.com/the-evidence-for-anthropogenic-climate-change-f5c6f2a48b85)). However, natural factors alone cannot explain the magnitude and patterns of recent global warming, especially the rapid temperature increases observed since the mid-20th century.

## Biophysical Feedbacks and Climate System Responses

Forests and other ecosystems influence climate not only through carbon storage but also through biophysical mechanisms such as surface albedo (reflectivity), evapotranspiration, and cloud formation. Tropical forests, for example, help cool the planet by more than 1°C through these processes ([IPCC, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

Large-scale deforestation in northern latitudes may cause net cooling, but tropical deforestation leads to substantial warming. Additionally, deforestation risks triggering tipping points in the climate system and forest ecosystem collapse, which would further exacerbate climate change ([IPCC, 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_and_climate_change)).

## Evidence Supporting Anthropogenic Climate Change

### Radiative Forcing and Carbon Isotopic Signatures

Radiative forcing measures the influence of factors (such as GHGs) on the energy balance of the Earth. Anthropogenic GHGs increase radiative forcing, leading to warming. Carbon isotopic analysis shows that the increase in atmospheric CO₂ is primarily from fossil fuel sources rather than natural sources ([Anderson et al., 2016](https://chandarren97.medium.com/the-evidence-for-anthropogenic-climate-change-f5c6f2a48b85)).

### Observed Climate Changes

- Rising global surface temperatures.
- Shrinking glaciers and snow cover.
- Retreating sea ice.
- Rising sea levels.
- Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (storms, droughts, wildfires).
- Changes in species distributions and phenology (timing of life cycle events).

These observed changes align with the expected impacts of increased GHG concentrations and are inconsistent with natural variability alone ([GlobalChange.gov, n.d.](https://www.globalchange.gov/climate-change/whats-happening-why)).

## Impacts of Climate Change

Climate change affects ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies. It threatens food and water security, health, and economic stability. For example:

- Increased heat exposure and spread of infectious diseases.
- Disruption of ecosystems and species extinction.
- More frequent and intense natural disasters.
- Loss of genetic diversity and altered life cycles of flora and fauna ([MakeChange, n.d.](https://makechange.aspiration.com/why-should-we-care-about-climate-change/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of current scientific literature and data, it is clear that climate change is primarily driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO₂ from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. While natural variability and external factors like solar cycles do contribute to climate fluctuations, their influence is significantly smaller and cannot explain the rapid warming observed in recent decades.

Deforestation plays a critical role by releasing stored carbon and disrupting biophysical climate mechanisms, making forest conservation and sustainable management essential components of climate mitigation strategies.

Given the overwhelming scientific consensus (over 99.9%) and the robust evidence supporting human-induced climate change, it is imperative to prioritize emission reductions and forest conservation to mitigate further warming and its associated impacts. Ignoring the principal role of human activities would undermine efforts to address this global crisis effectively.
