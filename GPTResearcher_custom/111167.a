# Report on Why Staff Are Leaving Higher Education

The higher education sector is currently facing significant challenges with staff turnover, particularly among faculty and administrative personnel. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors driving staff departures from higher education institutions, drawing on recent studies, surveys, and expert analyses. The report also offers a data-driven perspective on the implications of these trends and suggests areas for institutional response.

## 1. Overview of the Turnover Issue in Higher Education

Higher education institutions have experienced increased turnover rates, particularly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a Transamerica report, 35% of higher education institutions reported higher employee movement within their workforce during the pandemic, with 33% noting increased student-to-faculty ratios ([Umpierrez, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-burnout-pandemic/)). This turnover is not limited to non-tenured staff but includes a significant portion of tenured faculty, with 35% of tenured employees seriously considering leaving their careers or retiring early ([Fidelity Investments, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-burnout-pandemic/)).

## 2. Key Factors Driving Staff Turnover

### 2.1 Burnout and Mental Health Challenges

Burnout has emerged as a primary driver of turnover in higher education. Faculty and staff report increased workloads, emotional exhaustion, and deteriorating work-life balance. A Fidelity Investments survey found that 69% of faculty felt stressed in 2020, a significant increase from 32% in 2019, while 35% felt angry compared to 12% previously ([Fidelity Investments, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-burnout-pandemic/)). Similarly, Education Support’s national study revealed that 53% of academic staff showed probable signs of depression, and 78% believed their institutions prioritize productivity over psychological health ([Kinman & Wray, 2021](https://www.educationsupport.org.uk/resources/for-organisations/research/supporting-staff-wellbeing-in-higher-education/)).

Additional data from Personnel Today highlights that over a third (36%) of academic staff frequently neglect their personal needs due to work demands, and 59% fear that seeking mental health support would harm their careers ([Paton, 2021](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/burnout-and-mental-ill-health-rife-within-universities/)).

### 2.2 Increased Workload and Reduced Autonomy

The pandemic accelerated the shift to online education, increasing faculty workloads and administrative tasks. Nearly all university research leaders (97%) agreed that non-research workloads for academic staff have increased, and 95% noted that staff find it harder to allocate time for research, negatively impacting productivity ([Sastry, 2021](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2021/11/17/pressures-on-staff-are-the-greatest-concern-for-university-research-leaders-by-tom-sastry-of-research-england/)).

Faculty report a loss of autonomy and increased micromanagement, with some feeling their work is reduced to metrics and spreadsheets rather than professional judgment. One academic described the system as "chaotic" and felt judged unfairly due to heavy teaching loads and administrative pressures ([Fazackerley, 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/cut-throat-half-academics-stressed-thinking-leaving)).

### 2.3 Compensation and Financial Considerations

Although salary is not the sole factor, compensation plays a significant role in turnover decisions. Research indicates that low compensation or limited salary increases push employees to seek other opportunities ([Figueroa, 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285629263_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)). Even the perception of inequitable raises compared to peers can motivate departures.

Data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) also supports the importance of compensation, showing that higher pay correlates with better retention rates, especially among assistant and associate professors ([Ehrenberg, Kasper, & Rees, 1990](https://www.nber.org/papers/w3239)).

### 2.4 Work-Life Balance and Personal Responsibilities

Faculty and staff face challenges balancing professional demands with personal responsibilities such as childcare and eldercare. Debra Frey of Fidelity Investments notes that many employees are dealing with these pressures alongside a dramatically changing professional environment ([Frey, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-burnout-pandemic/)).

Institutions often lack sufficient support mechanisms such as backup childcare services, mental health resources, and flexible work arrangements, which could alleviate these pressures.

### 2.5 Organizational Culture and Collegiality

A lack of collegiality and feelings of isolation contribute to job dissatisfaction. Academics report a decline in camaraderie and an increase in competitive pressures, which exacerbate stress and mental health issues ([Guiney, 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/cut-throat-half-academics-stressed-thinking-leaving)).

Fear of stigma around mental health and inadequate managerial support further isolate staff, with many reluctant to seek help or discuss wellbeing concerns ([Paton, 2021](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/burnout-and-mental-ill-health-rife-within-universities/)).

## 4. Implications of Staff Turnover

The turnover of faculty and administrative staff has significant consequences for higher education institutions:

- **Loss of Talent:** Institutions risk losing experienced and diverse faculty, which can affect the quality of education and research.
- **Increased Costs:** Turnover leads to direct costs related to recruitment and training, as well as indirect costs such as decreased productivity among remaining staff ([Figueroa, 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285629263_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)).
- **Impact on Student Experience:** Higher student-to-faculty ratios and less experienced staff can diminish the student learning environment.
- **Mental Health Impact:** Remaining staff may experience a sense of shared loss and decreased morale, further exacerbating turnover ([Figueroa, 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285629263_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)).

## 5. Institutional Responses and Recommendations

To address turnover, institutions must adopt a holistic approach focusing on well-being, workload management, and compensation equity.

### 5.1 Enhancing Well-being Support

- Provide accessible mental health resources and reduce stigma around seeking support.
- Offer backup childcare and eldercare services to support work-life balance ([Frey, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-burnout-pandemic/)).
- Foster a culture of collegiality and recognition to improve morale ([Guiney, 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/cut-throat-half-academics-stressed-thinking-leaving)).

### 5.2 Managing Workload and Autonomy

- Reassess faculty workloads, especially non-research tasks, to allow time for core academic activities ([Sastry, 2021](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2021/11/17/pressures-on-staff-are-the-greatest-concern-for-university-research-leaders-by-tom-sastry-of-research-england/)).
- Increase flexibility in work arrangements, including part-time and remote options ([Kim, 2021](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/learning-innovation/3-reasons-why-higher-ed-people-who-can-afford-retire-keep-working)).

### 5.3 Addressing Compensation and Career Development

- Review compensation structures to ensure competitive and equitable pay.
- Provide clear pathways for career advancement and recognition to reduce frustration ([Figueroa, 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285629263_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)).

## 6. Conclusion

Staff turnover in higher education is driven by a complex interplay of burnout, increased workloads, compensation concerns, work-life balance challenges, and organizational culture issues. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these pressures, leading to higher rates of faculty and staff considering career changes or early retirement.

Institutions must prioritize mental health, workload management, and equitable compensation to retain talent and maintain the quality of education and research. Failure to address these issues risks further turnover, increased costs, and diminished institutional reputation.
