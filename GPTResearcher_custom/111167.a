# Report: Why Are Staff Leaving Higher Education?

## Introduction

Staff turnover in higher education institutions (HEIs) has become a significant concern, impacting organizational stability, financial resources, and educational quality. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the reasons why staff are leaving higher education, drawing on recent and relevant research. It synthesizes empirical findings, explores demographic and workload factors, and examines the exacerbating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report aims to present an objective and in-depth understanding of the multifaceted causes of turnover in higher education, supported by quantitative data and scholarly insights.

## Financial Factors

### Compensation and Pay Disparities

One of the primary drivers of staff turnover in higher education is low compensation or limited salary increases. Employees often consider leaving when their pay is not competitive or when they perceive inequities in raises relative to their peers within the institution ([Figueroa, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281269358_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)). Budgetary constraints frequently limit the ability of HEIs to offer regular or substantial pay raises, which fuels dissatisfaction and turnover intentions ([Banks, 2019](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335546543_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)).

Financial costs of turnover are substantial. For example, some universities incur over $60 million annually due to lost work time, hiring and training expenses, and loss of institutional knowledge ([Figueroa, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281269358_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)). The average cost of onboarding a new staff member is approximately 25% of the salary of the departing employee, and filling a vacancy takes an average of 17.2 days nationally ([Silva & Toledo, 2009](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281269358_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education)).

### Table 1: Financial Impact of Staff Turnover in Higher Education

| Factor                      | Statistic/Impact                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Annual turnover cost         | Over $60 million per university                   |
| Time to fill vacancy         | Average 17.2 days                                 |
| Onboarding cost             | ~25% of departing employeeâ€™s salary               |
| Impact on salary satisfaction| Low or inequitable raises increase turnover risk |

## Workload and Job Demands

### Increased Job Demands and Emotional Labor

Staff, particularly faculty and admissions officers, report increased job demands, especially during peak periods such as reading seasons. Heavy workloads with limited flexibility contribute to job stress and emotional exhaustion, leading to turnover intentions ([Figueroa, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281269358_The_Influences_Impacting_Staff_Turnover_in_Higher_Education); [Pantazes, 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348846157_Other_Duties_as_Assigned_Turnover_and_Turnover_Intentions_among_Early_Career_Undergraduate_Admissions_Officers_at_Selective_Higher_Education_Institutions)).

Burnout is a critical factor linked to workload. It manifests as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Faculty with higher workloads, including teaching large numbers of students and extensive grading responsibilities, are more susceptible to burnout ([Lackritz, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2004.07.002)).

### Burnout and Its Dimensions

- **Emotional Exhaustion:** Feeling drained and fatigued due to work demands.
- **Depersonalization:** Developing negative attitudes toward students or colleagues.
- **Reduced Personal Accomplishment:** Feeling ineffective or dissatisfied with achievements.

Approximately 20% of faculty experience high levels of burnout, with emotional exhaustion being more prevalent among female faculty, and depersonalization higher among male faculty ([Lackritz, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2004.07.002)).

### Table 2: Burnout Levels Among University Faculty

| Burnout Dimension       | Percentage Experiencing High Levels | Gender Differences                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Emotional Exhaustion     | ~27%                               | Higher in females                      |
| Depersonalization       | ~10%                               | Higher in males                        |
| Reduced Personal Accomplishment | ~19%                        | No significant gender difference      |

### Workload Correlations with Burnout

Burnout correlates positively with:

- Number of students taught (including graduate students)
- Teaching load and grading time
- Office hours and service activities
- Overall time spent as faculty

Research productivity does not significantly correlate with burnout, suggesting that teaching and service demands are more impactful on emotional exhaustion ([Lackritz, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2004.07.002)).

## Demographic and Institutional Factors

### Age and Career Stage

Younger faculty members are more prone to emotional exhaustion, potentially due to pressures associated with early career stages, such as tenure-track demands and balancing professional and personal life ([Lackritz, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2004.07.002)).

### Gender Disparities

Female faculty report higher stress and burnout levels, exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased caregiving responsibilities and workload increases ([Umpierrez, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-to-burnout-during-pandemic/)). Women constitute two-thirds of caregivers in the U.S., which has led many to leave the workforce ([BLS, 2020](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/women-leave-labor-force-due-to-pandemic.htm)).

### Tenure Status

Tenured and probationary faculty experience higher burnout than lecturers, possibly due to greater responsibilities in teaching, research, and service ([Lackritz, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2004.07.002)).

### Institutional Type and Resources

Turnover and burnout are more pronounced in low-resourced institutions such as small colleges and historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), where loss of institutional knowledge due to turnover severely hampers goal achievement ([Pantazes, 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348846157_Other_Duties_as_Assigned_Turnover_and_Turnover_Intentions_among_Early_Career_Undergraduate_Admissions_Officers_at_Selective_Higher_Education_Institutions)).

## Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

### Increased Burnout and Turnover

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified burnout across higher education, with faculty reporting doubled stress levels compared to pre-pandemic years ([Gewin, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00663-2)). The rapid pivot to online education tripled preparation time for lectures, increased workload, and disrupted professional networks.

### Gendered Impact

Female faculty were disproportionately affected, with 75% reporting stress and 82% reporting increased workloads during the pandemic, compared to 59% and 70% of male faculty, respectively ([Umpierrez, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-to-burnout-during-pandemic/)).

### Work-Life Balance and Caregiving

The deterioration of work-life balance, especially among women juggling caregiving and professional duties, contributed to early retirements and resignations. In September 2020 alone, 865,000 women left the workforce ([BLS, 2020](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/women-leave-labor-force-due-to-pandemic.htm)).

### Institutional Responses

Institutions are increasingly reassessing support mechanisms, including mental health resources, backup childcare, and flexible work arrangements to retain faculty ([Umpierrez, 2021](https://www.plansponsor.com/higher-ed-institutions-facing-increased-turnover-due-to-burnout-during-pandemic/)).

## Psychological and Social Factors

### Burnout as a Cyclical Phenomenon

Burnout may not be a one-time event but can occur in cycles throughout an academic career ([Lackritz, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2004.07.002)). Younger faculty may experience early burnout, while some senior faculty may face recurring episodes.

### Identity and Mission

Many higher education staff remain in their roles despite financial security due to strong identification with the mission of education and their professional identity ([Kim, 2021](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/learning-innovation/3-reasons-why-higher-ed-people-who-can-afford-retire-keep-working)). However, institutional rigidity limits flexible work arrangements, which could otherwise help retain experienced staff.

## Recommendations for Higher Education Institutions

- **Compensation Review:** Institutions should strive to offer competitive and equitable pay to reduce financial push factors.
- **Workload Management:** Reducing teaching loads and service demands can mitigate burnout.
- **Burnout Monitoring:** Regular assessment using validated instruments can help identify at-risk staff early.
- **Support for Caregivers:** Providing childcare support and flexible work options can retain female faculty disproportionately affected.
- **Flexible Work Arrangements:** Part-time, remote, or phased retirement options can retain experienced staff.
- **Mental Health Resources:** Enhanced access to counseling and wellness programs is critical.
- **Targeted Support for Early Career Faculty:** Mentoring and workload adjustments can prevent early burnout.

## Conclusion

Staff turnover in higher education is driven by a complex interplay of financial, workload, demographic, psychological, and pandemic-related factors. Burnout emerges as a central theme, exacerbated by increased job demands and insufficient institutional support. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these challenges, particularly for female faculty balancing caregiving responsibilities. Addressing turnover requires comprehensive strategies that encompass fair compensation, workload management, mental health support, and flexible work policies. Institutions that proactively engage with these issues are better positioned to retain talent, preserve institutional knowledge, and maintain educational quality.
