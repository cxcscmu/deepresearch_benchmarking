# Why Do People Commit Domestic Violence?  
## A Comprehensive Analytical Report  

Domestic violence (DV), also known as intimate partner violence (IPV), is a pervasive social issue characterized by abusive behaviors used by one partner to gain or maintain control over another. Understanding why people commit domestic violence is complex and multifaceted, involving psychological, social, economic, and cultural factors. This report synthesizes current research and theoretical perspectives to provide an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of the causes of domestic violence, drawing on trusted and recent sources to offer an objective and comprehensive understanding.

## 1. Introduction  

Domestic violence encompasses physical, sexual, psychological, and economic abuse within intimate relationships. It is primarily driven by the abuser’s desire for power and control over their partner. This report explores the underlying reasons why individuals engage in domestic violence, examining psychological traits, social learning, substance abuse, economic stressors, cultural norms, and other contributing factors. The report also addresses common misconceptions and false justifications used by abusers to rationalize their behavior.

## 2. Psychological Factors  

### 2.1 Power and Control as Core Motivators  

The primary objective of domestic abusers is to exert power and control over their victims. This need often stems from feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem, jealousy, and possessiveness. Abusers may have difficulties regulating anger and other strong emotions, which they manage through violence as a means to assert dominance ([UKEssays, 2017](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/social-work/theories-of-domestic-violence.php?vref=1)).

### 2.2 Personality Traits and Mental Health  

Certain personality traits and mental health disorders are associated with a higher risk of perpetrating domestic violence. These include manipulativeness, dependency on the victim, and psychological disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. However, it is critical to note that most individuals with mental illness are not violent, and mental illness alone does not cause domestic violence ([Psychology Today, n.d.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/domestic-violence)).

### 2.3 Cycle of Abuse and Denial  

Abusers often deny responsibility for their actions, blaming external factors or the victim. They may cycle through phases of tension building, violent outbursts, remorse, and promises to change, which perpetuates the abuse pattern. This cycle reinforces the abuser’s control and the victim’s confusion and helplessness ([Prieto, 2020](https://www.vanessaprietolaw.com/four-common-types-of-stalkers/)).

## 3. Social and Environmental Factors  

### 3.1 Social Learning Theory  

Domestic violence is often learned behavior, transmitted across generations through observation and modeling. Children who witness or experience abuse are more likely to become abusers or victims themselves, as violence becomes normalized within their worldview ([UKEssays, 2017](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/social-work/theories-of-domestic-violence.php?vref=1); Stover, 2005).

### 3.2 Economic Stress and Poverty  

Poverty and associated stress are significant contributors to domestic violence. Financial strain increases household tensions and conflicts, which can escalate into violence. Men who feel unable to fulfill traditional roles as economic providers may experience a crisis of masculine identity, leading to violence as an expression of power and control ([Jewkes, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08357-5)).

| Factor                  | Impact on Domestic Violence                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Poverty                 | Increases stress and conflict, heightens violence  |
| Economic inequality     | Triggers crises of male identity and control issues|
| Unemployment            | Reduces self-esteem, increases frustration         |
| Financial dependency    | Limits victim’s ability to leave abusive relationships |

### 3.3 Cultural Norms and Gender Roles  

Societies with strong patriarchal ideologies and acceptance of male dominance tend to have higher rates of domestic violence. Traditional beliefs that women are subordinate and should be controlled by men legitimize abusive behaviors. Women’s empowerment and education can be protective but may also temporarily increase risk during periods of social transition ([Jewkes, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08357-5)).

## 4. Substance Abuse  

### 4.1 Role of Alcohol and Drugs  

Substance abuse is a significant risk factor that exacerbates domestic violence but does not cause it directly. Alcohol and drugs impair judgment, reduce inhibitions, and increase impulsivity, making violent outbursts more likely in individuals predisposed to abuse. However, many substance abusers do not commit domestic violence, and many abusers do not have substance problems ([Tagliareni, 2021](https://www.drugrehab.com/domestic-violence-and-substance-abuse/)).

### 4.2 Substance Abuse as an Excuse  

Abusers often use intoxication as a justification for their violence, deflecting responsibility. Research shows that abusive men with severe alcohol problems are violent both when sober and intoxicated, indicating that substance use worsens but does not initiate abusive behavior ([UKEssays, 2017](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/social-work/theories-of-domestic-violence.php?vref=1)).

## 5. False Justifications and Misconceptions  

Abusers frequently rationalize their behavior by blaming external factors such as childhood abuse, stress, or substance use. However, research indicates:

- Most childhood abuse survivors do not become abusers.
- Stress alone does not cause violence; it is the choice to abuse that matters.
- Substance abuse exacerbates but does not cause domestic violence.
- Domestic violence is a deliberate choice to maintain control ([DrugRehab.com, 2021](https://www.drugrehab.com/domestic-violence-and-substance-abuse/)).

| **Substance Abuse**           | Alcohol/drugs increase impulsivity and reduce inhibition but do not cause abuse                 | Substance abuse exacerbates pre-existing violent tendencies                                    |
| **False Justifications**      | Abusers blame external factors to avoid responsibility                                         | Research disproves these excuses                                                                |

## 7. Conclusion  

Domestic violence is fundamentally about power and control, chosen by the abuser to dominate their partner. While psychological traits, social learning, economic stress, cultural norms, and substance abuse contribute to the risk and severity of abuse, none independently cause domestic violence. Rather, abuse is a deliberate behavior shaped by a complex interaction of individual, relational, and societal factors. Effective prevention and intervention require addressing these multiple dimensions, including challenging cultural norms, providing economic support, treating substance abuse, and empowering victims and communities.
