# Why Do People Commit Domestic Violence?  
A Comprehensive Report  

Domestic violence remains a pervasive and complex social issue worldwide, affecting millions of individuals regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status. Understanding why people commit domestic violence is essential for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. This report synthesizes current research and literature to provide an in-depth, evidence-based analysis of the factors contributing to domestic violence perpetration, emphasizing psychological, social, cultural, and substance-related causes.

## 1. Introduction  

Domestic violence is defined as a pattern of behavior in any relationship used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner. It encompasses physical, sexual, emotional, economic, and psychological abuse, as well as threats and coercive behaviors ([Ely, Dulmus, & Wodarski, 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229004597_Domestic_Violence_A_Literature_Review_Reflecting_an_International_Crisis)). This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind why individuals commit domestic violence, drawing on empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and statistical data.

## 2. Power and Control as Central Motivations  

The predominant and consistent theme in domestic violence research is that abusers seek power and control over their partners. The "Power and Control Wheel" model, widely used by domestic violence organizations, illustrates how abusers use various tactics—physical violence, emotional abuse, intimidation, economic control—to dominate their victims ([Jenesse Center, n.d.](https://jenesse.org/domestic-violence/dynamics-of-power-and-control/the-power-control-wheel/)).  

Abusers often feel insecure or powerless in other aspects of their lives and use violence as a means to assert dominance and control. This need for control may stem from unresolved childhood trauma, personality disorders, or low self-esteem ([Domestic Violence Objectives, n.d.](https://domesticviolence340.weebly.com/objectives.html)).  

### Psychological Dynamics  

- **Fantasy Bond:** Some abusers develop an unhealthy psychological bond with their partner, believing the relationship cannot survive separation, which can intensify controlling and violent behaviors ([Denver Criminal Defense, 2015](https://www.denvercriminaldefense.com/why-do-people-commit-domestic-violence-crimes/)).  
- **Denial and Justification:** Many perpetrators do not view themselves as abusers but rationalize their behavior as justified or as a response to provocation, often blaming the victim ([Verywell Mind, 2021](https://www.verywellmind.com/domestic-abuse-why-do-they-do-it-62639)).

## 3. Social Learning and Intergenerational Transmission  

Domestic violence is often learned behavior. The Social Learning Theory posits that individuals exposed to violence in their family of origin or community may internalize abusive behaviors as acceptable or normative ([Corvo, 2006](https://phdessay.com/literature-review-on-domestic-violence/)).  

- Children who witness or experience domestic violence are at increased risk of becoming perpetrators or victims themselves ([Hines & Saudino, 2002](https://phdessay.com/literature-review-on-domestic-violence/)).  
- Parental substance abuse and domestic violence increase the likelihood of children growing up to abuse substances or commit domestic violence ([HR Library, n.d.](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/svaw/domestic/link/alcohol.htm)).

## 4. Substance Abuse as an Exacerbating Factor  

While substance abuse is not a direct cause of domestic violence, it significantly exacerbates the severity and frequency of abuse. Alcohol and drugs impair judgment, reduce inhibitions, and may increase aggression, making violent outbursts more likely ([Addiction Resource, n.d.](https://www.addictionresource.net/substance-abuse-and-domestic-violence/)).  

### Key Statistics:  

| Statistic | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| 40-60% of domestic violence incidents involve substance abuse | American Society of Addiction Medicine (2014) ([Drug Rehab, n.d.](https://www.drugrehab.com/guides/domestic-abuse/)) |
| 61% of domestic violence offenders have substance abuse problems | Discovery NJ ([Discovery NJ, n.d.](https://www.discoverynj.org/correlation-domestic-violence-substance-abuse/)) |
| On days of heavy substance use, physical violence is 11 times more likely | Addiction Resource ([Addiction Resource, n.d.](https://www.addictionresource.net/substance-abuse-and-domestic-violence/)) |
| 92% of men who assaulted their female partner used substances on the day of assault | Addiction Resource ([Addiction Resource, n.d.](https://www.addictionresource.net/substance-abuse-and-domestic-violence/)) |

Despite these correlations, research emphasizes that substance abuse does not cause domestic violence but acts as a catalyst that worsens pre-existing violent tendencies ([DV Online Guide, n.d.](http://www.dvonlineguide.org/en/know-more/understanding-domestic-violence/204-know-more/domestic-violence-101/308-what-triggers-domestic-violence)).

## 5. Stress and Socioeconomic Factors  

Stress-related factors such as poverty, unemployment, lack of education, and financial insecurity increase the risk of domestic violence. These stressors can heighten tensions within the household and contribute to abusive behavior ([Ely, Dulmus, & Wodarski, 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229004597_Domestic_Violence_A_Literature_Review_Reflecting_an_International_Crisis)).  

- Living in large families or crowded conditions can also increase stress and conflict.  
- Jealousy and infidelity are common triggers that exacerbate domestic violence incidents.  

However, it is crucial to note that stress and socioeconomic hardship do not cause abuse; rather, abusers choose to use violence as a coping mechanism or a way to assert control ([DV Online Guide, n.d.](http://www.dvonlineguide.org/en/know-more/understanding-domestic-violence/204-know-more/domestic-violence-101/308-what-triggers-domestic-violence)).

## 6. Gender and Cultural Influences  

Gender bias and cultural norms play significant roles in domestic violence dynamics. Globally, violence against women and girls is recognized as a widespread epidemic involving physical, psychological, sexual, and economic abuse ([Ely, Dulmus, & Wodarski, 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229004597_Domestic_Violence_A_Literature_Review_Reflecting_an_International_Crisis)).  

- Patriarchal societies often perpetuate male dominance and entitlement, fostering environments where abuse is tolerated or ignored.  
- Cultural and ideological factors, including honor and dowry-related violence, contribute to domestic violence in some regions.  

Nonetheless, domestic violence also occurs in same-sex relationships and against men, indicating that power and control dynamics transcend gender alone ([Ananias Foundation, 2018](https://www.ananiasfoundation.org/controlling-behavior/)).  

---

## 7. Psychological and Physiological Factors  

Research has explored physiological predispositions to aggression, such as heightened heart rate responses to agitation, which may increase the likelihood of violent behavior in intimate relationships ([Lavinia et al., 2010](https://phdessay.com/literature-review-on-domestic-violence/)).  

Mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders, may contribute to abusive behavior but are not sole causes ([Domestic Violence Objectives, n.d.](https://domesticviolence340.weebly.com/objectives.html)).  

Importantly, most abusers do not exhibit diagnosable psychopathology, and the majority of individuals with serious mental illness are not violent ([DV Online Guide, n.d.](http://www.dvonlineguide.org/en/know-more/understanding-domestic-violence/204-know-more/domestic-violence-101/308-what-triggers-domestic-violence)).

## 8. The Cycle of Abuse and Behavioral Patterns  

Domestic violence often follows a cyclical pattern:  

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Build-Up Phase | Tension gradually increases in the relationship. |
| Stand-Over Phase | Verbal attacks and intimidation escalate. |
| Explosion Phase | Physical or severe emotional abuse occurs. |
| Remorse Phase | The abuser may apologize or justify their behavior. |

This cycle reinforces the abuser's control and the victim's entrapment, complicating efforts to leave abusive relationships ([Verywell Mind, 2021](https://www.verywellmind.com/domestic-abuse-why-do-they-do-it-62639)).

## 9. Summary and Opinion  

Based on the comprehensive review of the literature, it is evident that domestic violence is a multifactorial phenomenon primarily driven by an abuser's desire for power and control. While factors such as substance abuse, stress, socioeconomic hardship, cultural norms, and psychological predispositions can exacerbate or facilitate abusive behavior, none serve as direct causes. Instead, domestic violence is a conscious choice made by the abuser to dominate and control their partner.

Interventions must therefore address the underlying need for control, challenge learned behaviors, and provide support for substance abuse and mental health issues where present. Prevention efforts should also focus on changing cultural attitudes that tolerate abuse and empowering victims to break free from the cycle of violence.
