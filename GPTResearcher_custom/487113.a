# How Safe Are Casinos With the Virus?  
## A Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Safety in Casinos  

---

### Introduction  

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the hospitality and entertainment sectors, including casinos worldwide. Casinos, by their nature, involve close human interaction, shared surfaces, and indoor environments, all of which are factors that could potentially increase the risk of virus transmission. This report aims to provide an in-depth, evidence-based assessment of how safe casinos are during the ongoing presence of the COVID-19 virus, drawing on multiple sources including expert opinions, industry responses, and public health guidelines. The report will cover the risks associated with casinos, the mitigation measures implemented, expert risk assessments, and conclude with a reasoned opinion on the safety of visiting casinos during the pandemic.

### Understanding the Risks in Casinos  

Casinos present several inherent risks for COVID-19 transmission:  

- **High-touch surfaces:** Slot machines, gaming tables, chips, cards, and kiosks are frequently touched by many individuals.  
- **Indoor environment:** Casinos are typically large indoor spaces with many patrons in close proximity.  
- **Close interactions:** Table games involve players sitting close to each other and dealers, increasing proximity risks.  
- **Crowds and gatherings:** Casinos often attract large numbers of people, which can lead to crowding.  
- **Alcohol consumption:** Alcohol may reduce adherence to safety protocols such as mask-wearing and distancing.  
- **Smoking areas:** Smoking indoors can increase aerosol spread of the virus.  

These factors collectively contribute to a potential medium to high risk of virus spread if not properly managed ([Schult, 2020](https://www.pokernews.com/news/2020/06/covid-19-health-experts-claim-casinos-are-safer-than-church-37456.htm)).

### Expert Risk Assessments  

A group of public health experts ranked various activities by COVID-19 risk on a scale of 0 to 10, considering factors such as indoor/outdoor setting, proximity, exposure time, and personal risk. Casinos were rated at a risk level of **6**, which is higher than grocery shopping or walking but lower than gyms, amusement parks, sporting events, and church services (all rated 8). Drinking at bars and attending large concerts were rated the highest risk at 9 ([Schult, 2020](https://www.pokernews.com/news/2020/06/covid-19-health-experts-claim-casinos-are-safer-than-church-37456.htm)).

Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease expert at UCLA, categorized casinos as **low to medium risk** for coronavirus exposure, emphasizing that exposures are more likely indoors but that effective cleaning and sanitizing can reduce risks significantly ([Santos, 2020](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/infectious-disease-expert-casinos-low-to-medium-risk-coronavirus-exposure/)).

### Safety Measures Implemented by Casinos  

Casinos have adopted extensive health and safety protocols to mitigate COVID-19 risks, often exceeding local government requirements. Key measures include:

| Safety Measure                          | Description                                                                                      | Implementation Examples                                         |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Capacity Limits & Social Distancing** | Casinos operate at reduced capacity (e.g., 25% or more), with spacing between slot machines and table games. | Borgata limited capacity and installed plastic screens at tables ([Luparello, 2020](https://chilledmagazine.com/casinos-in-a-time-of-covid/)) |
| **Enhanced Cleaning & Disinfection**  | Frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces, including slot machines, chips, cards, and tables.     | Dealers disinfect cards and chips after every use ([Bauter, 2021](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3x9z/are-casinos-safe-during-covid-19-pandemic)) |

### Comparative Risk: Casinos vs Other Activities  

| Activity                 | Risk Level (0-10) | Notes                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Takeout Food             | 1                 | Safest activity evaluated.                                                                  |
| Playing Tennis           | 1                 | Outdoor, socially distanced.                                                                |
| Grocery Shopping         | 3-4               | Indoor but brief exposure and distancing possible.                                          |
| Casinos                  | 6                 | Indoor, crowded, but mitigated by safety protocols.                                         |
| Gyms, Amusement Parks    | 8                 | Higher risk due to exertion, crowds, and indoor settings.                                   |
| Church Services          | 8                 | Indoor with prolonged close contact and singing.                                           |
| Bars, Large Concerts     | 9                 | Highest risk due to crowds, loud talking, and alcohol consumption.                          |

This comparison highlights that while casinos are not the safest environment, they are generally safer than many other indoor social activities when proper protocols are followed ([Schult, 2020](https://www.pokernews.com/news/2020/06/covid-19-health-experts-claim-casinos-are-safer-than-church-37456.htm)).

### Observations from Casino Visits and Industry Feedback  

- **Varied Protocols by Location:** Different casinos implement varying degrees of safety measures. For example, Circa in Las Vegas had no partitions at tables, while The Venetian and ARIA installed plexiglass barriers ([Bauter, 2021](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3x9z/are-casinos-safe-during-covid-19-pandemic)).  
- **Smoking Policies:** Some casinos eliminated indoor smoking to reduce aerosol spread, while others designated specific non-smoking areas ([Bauter, 2021](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3x9z/are-casinos-safe-during-covid-19-pandemic)).  
- **Guest Compliance:** Most guests comply with mask-wearing and sanitizing, although vigilance is necessary to maintain safety ([Santos, 2020](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/infectious-disease-expert-casinos-low-to-medium-risk-coronavirus-exposure/)).  
- **Employee Vigilance:** Dealers and staff actively disinfect gaming equipment and monitor guest behavior to enforce protocols ([Santos, 2020](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/infectious-disease-expert-casinos-low-to-medium-risk-coronavirus-exposure/)).

### Limitations and Challenges  

- **Asymptomatic Transmission:** Temperature checks may not detect asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers ([Bauter, 2021](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3x9z/are-casinos-safe-during-covid-19-pandemic)).  
- **Enforcement Consistency:** Variation in enforcement of mask-wearing and distancing may affect overall safety.  
- **Air Circulation:** Despite HVAC upgrades, indoor air quality remains a concern in large, crowded spaces.  
- **Behavioral Risks:** Alcohol consumption and social behaviors can reduce adherence to safety measures.

### Conclusion and Opinion  

Based on the comprehensive review of available data, expert opinions, and industry practices, casinos can be considered **moderately safe environments** for visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic **provided** that they strictly adhere to and enforce robust health and safety protocols.  

The risk of virus transmission in casinos is inherently higher than many outdoor or low-contact activities due to the indoor setting, shared surfaces, and close interactions. However, casinos have demonstrated significant adaptability by implementing extensive cleaning regimens, social distancing, mask mandates, physical barriers, and air quality improvements. These measures effectively reduce the risk to a level comparable to or lower than other common indoor activities such as gyms and church services.

Visitors who are vaccinated, comply with mask-wearing, practice hand hygiene, and avoid crowded peak times further reduce their personal risk. Conversely, unvaccinated individuals or those unwilling to follow protocols face higher risks.

Therefore, **casinos are not risk-free but can be relatively safe destinations for entertainment during the pandemic when safety measures are diligently applied and followed**. Potential visitors should remain informed of local COVID-19 conditions, vaccination status, and specific casino protocols before deciding to visit.
