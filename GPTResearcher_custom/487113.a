# Safety of Casinos Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comprehensive Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted public spaces, including casinos, which are traditionally high-traffic venues involving close social interaction and shared surfaces. This report provides a detailed, evidence-based evaluation of the safety of casinos in the context of the COVID-19 virus, drawing from multiple authoritative sources and recent updates. It aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the risks involved and the mitigation strategies casinos have implemented to protect guests and staff.

## Overview of COVID-19 Risks in Casinos

Casinos present unique challenges for infection control due to the nature of their operations: enclosed indoor environments, frequent physical contact with shared surfaces (e.g., slot machines, cards, chips), and social interactions. However, infectious disease experts have assessed casinos as generally **low to medium risk** environments for coronavirus exposure when proper protocols are followed. Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease expert at UCLA, categorizes casinos as low to medium risk, emphasizing that indoor exposure and surface contact are key factors but can be mitigated effectively ([Santos, 2020](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/infectious-disease-casinos-low-risk-coronavirus-exposure/)).

A comparative risk assessment by health experts ranked casinos at a risk level of 6 on a 0-10 scale, where 10 represents the highest risk. This places casinos below gyms, amusement parks, sporting events, and church services (all rated 8), but above activities like walking or grocery shopping ([Schult, 2020](https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/25029-covid-19-health-experts-claim-casino-gambling-is-safer-than-schools-pools-and-even-church)).

## Mitigation Measures Implemented by Casinos

Casinos have adopted comprehensive health and safety protocols aligned with CDC, WHO, and local health authority guidelines to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk. These measures include:

### 1. Enhanced Cleaning and Disinfection

- **Frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces** such as slot machines, table games (dice, chips, cards), cashier counters, and dining areas.
- Use of **hospital-grade disinfectants** and cleaning products that meet or exceed CDC recommendations.
- Implementation of **new technologies** like automated alerts for cleaning machines immediately after use (e.g., Rolling Hills Casino's partnership with Acres Gaming) ([Rolling Hills Casino, 2022](https://rollinghillscasino.com/your-safety-matters/)).

### 2. Social Distancing Protocols

- Reconfiguration of casino floors, restaurants, and seating areas to maintain **at least six feet of distance** between guests.
- Limiting the number of players at table games and reducing capacity in venues.
- Installation of **plexiglass barriers** at point-of-sale locations and between gaming stations.
- Use of **floor decals and signage** to guide physical distancing ([Caesars Entertainment, 2022](https://www.caesars.com/health-and-safety)).

### 3. Mask Policies

- Mask-wearing is enforced **in compliance with local guidelines**, often required for unvaccinated individuals.
- Casinos provide masks to employees and encourage guests to wear **tight-sealing face masks** that cover nose and mouth snugly to maximize protection ([Fodor's, 2021](https://www.fodors.com/news/news/are-casinos-safe-during-the-pandemic-i-went-to-several-to-find-out)).

### 4. Hand Hygiene and Sanitization

- Installation of **numerous hand sanitizing stations** throughout the property, including entrances, gaming areas, and dining venues.
- Staff provide hand sanitizer at key interaction points such as check-in desks, table games, and cashier stations.
- Frequent reminders and signage encouraging **regular hand washing** and respiratory etiquette (covering coughs and sneezes) ([Caesars Entertainment, 2022](https://www.caesars.com/health-and-safety)).

### 5. Health Screening and Monitoring

- Temperature checks at entry points; guests with temperatures above 100Â°F are asked to return another day.
- Employees undergo routine temperature screenings and health checks.
- Guests exhibiting symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath are advised not to enter and to seek medical attention ([Emerald Queen Casino, 2022](https://www.emeraldqueen.com/covid-19/)).

### 6. HVAC and Air Quality Improvements

- Upgrading Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems to increase fresh air circulation.
- Use of **medical-grade air purifiers** and ozone ionizers to reduce airborne viral particles ([Ante Up Magazine, 2021](https://anteupmagazine.com/2021/05/13/are-casinos-now-safe-to-visit/); [Rolling Hills Casino, 2022](https://rollinghillscasino.com/your-safety-matters/)).

### 7. Operational Adjustments

- Limiting amenities and temporarily closing some areas to reduce crowding.
- Contactless payment options to minimize physical contact.
- Team members trained extensively on COVID-19 protocols and proper PPE use ([Caesars Entertainment, 2022](https://www.caesars.com/health-and-safety)).

## Effectiveness and Expert Opinions

### Expert Risk Assessment

- Casinos are considered **safer than many other indoor activities** such as bars, large concerts, and some religious services due to their ability to implement strict protocols and controlled environments ([Schult, 2020](https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/25029-covid-19-health-experts-claim-casino-gambling-is-safer-than-schools-pools-and-even-church)).
- The presence of **trained medical and security personnel** on-site enhances rapid response to potential COVID-19 cases ([Ante Up Magazine, 2021](https://anteupmagazine.com/2021/05/13/are-casinos-now-safe-to-visit/)).

### Real-World Observations

- Patrons report feeling relatively safe due to visible cleaning efforts, hand sanitizer availability, and mask usage ([Santos, 2020](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/infectious-disease-casinos-low-risk-coronavirus-exposure/)).
- Casinos' proactive communication and signage help maintain awareness and compliance with safety measures ([Emerald Queen Casino, 2022](https://www.emeraldqueen.com/covid-19/)).

### Limitations and Risks

- Despite precautions, **shared surfaces and indoor settings inherently carry some risk**.
- Compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing varies among guests.
- Casinos with buffets or large gatherings may present higher risks; many have kept buffets closed or modified service ([Schult, 2020](https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/25029-covid-19-health-experts-claim-casino-gambling-is-safer-than-schools-pools-and-even-church)).

## Recommendations for Casino Visitors

Based on the current evidence and expert guidance, individuals considering visiting casinos should:

- **Be fully vaccinated** to reduce personal risk and transmission potential.
- Wear **tight-fitting masks** indoors, especially in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.
- Maintain **physical distancing** whenever possible.
- Use **hand sanitizer frequently** and avoid touching the face.
- Avoid visiting if experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms.
- Consider **COVID-19 testing before and after visits** for added precaution ([Fodor's, 2021](https://www.fodors.com/news/news/are-casinos-safe-during-the-pandemic-i-went-to-several-to-find-out)).

## Conclusion

Casinos have evolved significantly in their approach to health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through rigorous cleaning protocols, social distancing measures, mask mandates, enhanced ventilation, and health screenings, casinos have substantially mitigated the risk of virus transmission. While inherent risks remain due to the indoor nature and shared surfaces, expert assessments place casinos at a **low to medium risk level**, generally safer than many other indoor social activities.

Visitors who adhere to recommended personal protective measures and respect casino protocols can reasonably expect a safer environment than early in the pandemic. However, the dynamic nature of COVID-19 variants and local infection rates necessitates ongoing vigilance and adaptability by both casinos and patrons.
