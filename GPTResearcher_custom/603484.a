## Introduction

In recent years, social media has transformed from a tool for social connection to a powerful platform influencing political discourse, public opinion, and social behavior. While it has democratized information dissemination, social media has also facilitated the rapid spread of conspiracy theories and extremist ideologies, which have been linked to an increase in domestic terrorism incidents. This report explores the mechanisms by which social media contributes to these phenomena, supported by empirical data and expert analyses.

## Social Media as a Vector for Conspiracy Theories

### FBI Assessment and Real-World Implications

The FBI’s 2019 report explicitly identifies conspiracy theories as "a new domestic terror threat," emphasizing their likelihood to "emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace," occasionally inciting criminal or violent acts ([FBI, 2019](https://libguides.monmouth.edu/c.php?g=1006881&p=7292479)). The 2016 #Pizzagate incident exemplifies how conspiracy theories can escalate from online misinformation to real-world violence, underscoring the dangers of unchecked conspiracy propagation on social media.

### Consequences of Conspiracy Theories Spread on Social Media

The rapid consumption and distribution of conspiracy theories via social media platforms result in several societal harms:

| Consequence                         | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass Manipulation of Public Opinion | Social media algorithms amplify sensational content, skewing public perceptions.            |
| Increase in Radicalized Behavior   | Exposure to extremist content fosters radicalization and violent tendencies.                 |
| Targeting of Individuals/Groups    | Conspiracy theories encourage harassment or violence against specific people or organizations. |
| Mainstreaming Fringe Ideas         | Debunked or pseudoscientific ideas gain legitimacy through repeated exposure.                |
| Societal Polarization              | Echo chambers deepen divisions, undermining social cohesion.                                |
| Undermining Public Trust           | Erosion of confidence in leaders and institutions due to misinformation.                     |

These outcomes are corroborated by studies such as Douglas and Uscinski (2019), which highlight the mainstreaming of fringe ideas through social media channels ([Douglas & Uscinski, 2019](https://libguides.monmouth.edu/c.php?g=1006881&p=7292479)).

## Social Media and Domestic Terrorism: Empirical Evidence

### Frequency and Nature of Social Media Use Among Extremists

The START consortium’s 2018 research brief analyzed the social media activities of 479 U.S. extremists radicalized between 2005 and 2016. It found that social media platforms play an increasingly important role in the radicalization and mobilization of both violent and non-violent extremists ([Jensen et al., 2018](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_PIRUS_UseOfSocialMediaByUSExtremists_ResearchBrief_July2018.pdf)). Key findings include:

- **Platform Usage:** Extremists utilize mainstream platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for broader outreach and less violent messaging, while platforms like Telegram and TikTok are used for sharing more extremist and alarmist content.
- **Purpose:** Social media is used for recruitment, propaganda dissemination, coordination of activities, and intelligence sharing.
- **Ideological Variation:** Different extremist ideologies show varying rates and methods of social media engagement.

### Case Studies: January 6 Capitol Attack and Militia Groups

The Digital Citizens Alliance and Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) investigation in 2021 revealed that domestic terrorists and militias exploited social media platforms to organize, recruit, and plan violent actions, including the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack ([Digital Citizens Alliance, 2021](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/domestic-terrorists-and-militias-hiding-in-plain-sight-on-social-media-platforms-to-recruit-organize-and-terrorize-301271203.html)).

- Groups such as the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, and Boogaloo Bois used platforms like YouTube, Telegram, and TikTok to spread violent ideologies.
- Militia groups strategically posted less violent content on mainstream platforms to avoid removal, while sharing extremist content on less regulated platforms.
- Hashtags like "SavetheChildren" and "Patriots" were hijacked to spread misinformation and radicalize followers.

### Public Perception and Platform Accountability

A survey of 1,353 Americans found:

| Survey Finding                                         | Percentage |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Platforms bear majority or some responsibility for Jan 6 attacks | 54%        |
| Platforms should do more to combat misinformation and hate speech | 67%        |
| Platforms should share information on bad actors across platforms | 61%        |
| Support prosecution of violent rioters                 | 81%        |

These data reflect public demand for stronger platform accountability ([Digital Citizens Alliance, 2021](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/domestic-terrorists-and-militias-hiding-in-plain-sight-on-social-media-platforms-to-recruit-organize-and-terrorize-301271203.html)).

## Challenges in Moderating Extremist Content

### Platform Limitations and Inconsistencies

Despite public commitments, social media companies face significant challenges:

- **AI Limitations:** Automated systems are often tricked by deceptive content; human moderators are needed for nuanced judgment.
- **Inconsistent Enforcement:** No industry-wide standards lead to uneven blocking of extremist content across platforms.
- **Platform Migration:** Extremists move to less regulated platforms when banned, complicating enforcement.

### The Free Speech Dilemma

Platforms like Gab, which market themselves as free speech havens, illustrate the tension between content moderation and free expression. Gab became a refuge for extremists after mainstream platforms increased policing but was temporarily shut down after the Pittsburgh synagogue attack due to hosting hateful content ([Hennigan, 2018](https://time.com/5434943/social-media-domestic-terrorism/)).

## Social Media’s Role in Radicalization and Terrorist Outcomes

### Empirical Patterns

- Far-right extremists have been responsible for nearly three times as many attacks as Islamist extremists in the U.S. since 9/11, with social media playing a crucial role in spreading their ideologies ([Hennigan, 2018](https://time.com/5434943/social-media-domestic-terrorism/)).
- Social media facilitates viral dissemination of hate speech, conspiracy theories, and extremist narratives, which often translate into real-world violence.
- The FBI is currently investigating approximately 5,000 terrorism cases nationwide, with around 1,000 involving domestic terrorism, underscoring the scale of the threat ([Hennigan, 2018](https://time.com/5434943/social-media-domestic-terrorism/)).

### Case Examples

- Robert Bowers (Pittsburgh synagogue shooter) used Gab to spread anti-Semitic misinformation.
- Cesar Sayoc (pipe bomber) posted right-wing conspiracy theories on Facebook and Twitter.
- Gregory Bush (Louisville shooter) shared racist content on social media prior to his attacks.

## Policy Recommendations and Mitigation Strategies

### Government and Independent Organization Roles

Sunstein and Vermeule (2009) advocate for aggressive rebuttal of conspiracy theories through independent organizations and public/private persuasion using factual counter-narratives ([Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009](https://libguides.monmouth.edu/c.php?g=1006881&p=7292479)).

### Digital Citizens Alliance and CSW Recommendations

| Recommendation               | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hire More Humans            | Employ trained human moderators to detect nuanced extremist content beyond AI capabilities.  |
| Consistent Platform Enforcement | Develop industry-wide standards to uniformly remove extremist content across all platforms.    |
| Congressional Action        | Enact specific penalties for domestic terrorism to strengthen legal deterrents.               |

These measures aim to reduce extremists' ability to hide in plain sight and disrupt their online coordination ([Digital Citizens Alliance, 2021](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/domestic-terrorists-and-militias-hiding-in-plain-sight-on-social-media-platforms-to-recruit-organize-and-terrorize-301271203.html)).

### Managing Post-Terror Attack Media Fallout

The "Minutes to Months" (M2M) report highlights the need for governments and law enforcement to manage social media narratives post-terror attacks to minimize hate crimes and misinformation spread ([Chermak et al., 2018](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/using-social-media-to-weaken-wrath-of-terrorist-attacks/)).

## Conclusion

The evidence presented clearly demonstrates that social media significantly contributes to the spread of conspiracy theories and the facilitation of domestic terrorism. Social media platforms serve as critical venues for radicalization, recruitment, and coordination of extremist activities. The rapid dissemination and amplification of misinformation and hate speech on these platforms exacerbate societal polarization and undermine public trust.

While social media companies have taken steps to moderate content, their efforts remain insufficient and inconsistent, often hindered by technological limitations and the complex balance between free speech and harmful content regulation. The public and experts alike call for enhanced human moderation, consistent enforcement across platforms, and legislative action to address these challenges effectively.

In summary, social media is not merely a passive channel but an active enabler of conspiracy propagation and domestic terrorism. Addressing this multifaceted threat requires coordinated efforts among social media companies, government agencies, independent organizations, and the public to foster a safer information environment and prevent violence.
