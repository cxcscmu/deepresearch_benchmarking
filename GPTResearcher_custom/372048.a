# Report on Business and Social Problems Caused by Data Center Power Consumption

## Introduction

Data centers are critical infrastructures that support the digital economy by hosting websites, cloud services, social media platforms, and large-scale data analytics. However, the rapid growth in data volume and computing demand has led to a significant increase in data center power consumption, raising both business and social concerns. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the business and social problems caused by data center power consumption, supported by relevant data and examples. It also offers a critical perspective on the implications of these issues.

## 1. Business Problems Caused by Data Center Power Consumption

### 1.1 High Operating Costs

One of the foremost business challenges posed by data center power consumption is the substantial operating cost associated with electricity usage. Data centers require continuous power not only to run servers but also to maintain cooling systems that prevent overheating. According to Ayala et al. (2012), the total electricity operating costs of all U.S. data centers exceeded $7 billion in 2010. This figure reflects the massive scale of energy consumption, which was estimated at 61 billion kilowatt-hours in 2006 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ([Ayala et al., 2012](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/12/8/10659)).

### 1.2 Infrastructure and Maintenance Costs

Data centers also face high capital expenditures for power delivery infrastructure, such as power delivery units and air conditioning systems. These components often account for a large fraction of total electricity consumption, further increasing costs (Chang et al., 2012). Additionally, maintaining and upgrading these systems to improve energy efficiency requires ongoing investment.

### 1.3 Impact on Business Competitiveness

High power consumption translates into increased operational expenses, which can affect a company’s competitiveness. Businesses that fail to manage energy efficiency may face higher costs than their competitors who adopt green computing strategies. Moreover, as environmental regulations tighten, companies with inefficient data centers may incur penalties or face reputational damage.

### 1.4 Resource Allocation and Scalability Challenges

The exponential growth in data—projected to increase from 33 zettabytes in 2017 to 175 zettabytes by 2025—fuels demand for more data center capacity and power (QTS, 2020). This growth challenges businesses to allocate resources effectively to scale their data centers without proportionally increasing power consumption and costs.

## 2. Social Problems Caused by Data Center Power Consumption

### 2.1 Environmental Impact and Carbon Footprint

Data centers contribute significantly to global electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, data centers consume about 3% of the electric supply and account for approximately 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions (QTS, 2020). The reliance on fossil fuels such as coal for electricity generation results in the emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to climate change (Steve Johnson, 2017).

### 2.2 Pollution and Toxic Waste

Power generation from coal-fired plants not only emits CO2 but also releases other pollutants harmful to human health and the environment. Nuclear power, another source for electricity, produces radioactive waste that is challenging to dispose of safely (Steve Johnson, 2017). These environmental externalities impose social costs on communities near power plants and contribute to broader ecological degradation.

### 2.3 Energy Resource Depletion

Hydroelectric power, while cleaner than coal, diverts water resources that could be used for agriculture or human consumption. The vast energy demands of data centers thus strain natural resources, raising concerns about sustainability and equitable resource distribution.

### 2.4 Social Equity and Public Health

The environmental degradation caused by data center power consumption disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, exacerbating social inequities. Air pollution from power plants can lead to respiratory diseases and other health problems, impacting community well-being.

## 3. Quantitative Overview of Data Center Power Consumption

| Metric                          | Value                       | Source/Year          |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| U.S. Data Center Electricity Consumption | 61 billion kWh             | EPA, 2006           |
| U.S. Data Center Electricity Cost       | $7 billion                 | Ayala et al., 2012  |
| Global Data Center Electricity Share     | ~3% of global electric supply | QTS, 2020           |
| Global Data Center GHG Emissions         | ~2% of total emissions      | QTS, 2020           |
| Projected Global Data Volume              | 175 zettabytes by 2025      | QTS, 2020           |

## 4. Analysis and Opinion

The business and social problems caused by data center power consumption are deeply intertwined. From a business perspective, the high cost of electricity and infrastructure maintenance directly impacts profitability and operational efficiency. Socially, the environmental consequences of power consumption contribute to climate change, pollution, and resource depletion, which have far-reaching effects on public health and social equity.

Given the scale and growth trajectory of data centers, these problems are unlikely to diminish without proactive measures. The data center industry must prioritize energy efficiency and sustainability not only to reduce costs but also to fulfill corporate social responsibility and meet increasing regulatory and societal expectations.

It is clear that ignoring these issues risks escalating environmental damage and financial burdens. Therefore, businesses should view investments in green data center technologies and practices as strategic imperatives rather than optional expenses.

## 5. Conclusion

Data center power consumption causes significant business challenges, primarily through high operating and infrastructure costs, and social problems, including environmental degradation and public health risks. The growing demand for data processing exacerbates these issues, necessitating urgent action.

Businesses must adopt energy-efficient designs, renewable energy sources, and innovative cooling technologies to mitigate these problems. Moreover, transparency and accountability through sustainability reporting can enhance public trust and drive industry-wide improvements.

In conclusion, addressing data center power consumption issues is essential for sustainable business growth and social well-being in the digital age.
