# Report on Racial Discrimination Against Black Veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

## Introduction

Racial discrimination within federal agencies, particularly those serving vulnerable populations such as veterans, has been a subject of increasing scrutiny. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), tasked with providing healthcare, disability compensation, and other benefits to millions of U.S. veterans, has faced allegations and evidence of systemic racial disparities affecting Black veterans. This report examines whether Black veterans face racial discrimination at the VA, drawing on recent lawsuits, government investigations, employee surveys, and official data. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based assessment of the extent and nature of racial discrimination against Black veterans within the VA system.

## Background and Context

The VA is the second-largest federal agency, employing approximately 400,000 people and serving over 9 million veterans nationwide. Black veterans constitute a significant portion of this population, with projections indicating that the proportion of Black veterans will increase from 12% in 2019 to 15% by 2045 ([Office of Health Equity, VA](https://www.va.gov/healthequity/racialethnicminorityveterans.asp)).

Despite the VA’s mission to provide equitable care and benefits, multiple sources indicate persistent racial disparities and discrimination against Black veterans. These include disparities in disability compensation rates, healthcare access and quality, and workplace discrimination within the VA itself.

## Evidence of Racial Discrimination Against Black Veterans

### 1. Disparities in Disability Compensation and Benefits

The Black Veterans Project (BVP) and the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress (NVCLR) filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking data on racial disparities in disability compensation and healthcare services. While some data released in 2018 showed that Black veterans receive disability compensation at a "significantly lower rate" than the overall veteran population, the plaintiffs argued that the information was incomplete and insufficient ([Morey, 2021](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-va/2021/07/08/black-veterans-group-sues-va-for-racial-disparity-data)).

The groups subsequently sued the VA for failing to provide comprehensive data, highlighting a lack of transparency and accountability in addressing racial disparities. The lawsuit names the Veterans Benefits Administration and Veterans Health Administration, emphasizing systemic issues in benefit administration and healthcare delivery.

### 2. Employee Surveys and Reports of Racism Within the VA

A nationwide survey conducted by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) in 2020 revealed that nearly 80% of VA employees believe racism is a serious and widespread problem within the agency. Key findings include:

| Survey Finding                                   | Percentage of Respondents |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Believe racism is a moderate to serious problem | 78%                       |
| Experienced racially charged actions at work    | 76%                       |
| Witnessed racial discrimination against veterans| 55%                       |

Black employees reported frequent use of racial slurs, barriers to career advancement, and fear of retaliation for reporting discrimination. Leadership representation disparities were stark, with 12.3% of White employees in leadership roles compared to only 3.8% of Black employees ([Major, 2020](https://www.theroot.com/almost-80-of-employees-say-veteran-affairs-has-a-racism-1844303016)).

### 3. Specific Incidents Highlighting Racial Insensitivity

At the Kansas City VA Medical Center, Black employees reported being made "living display" pieces during a Juneteenth event, portraying historical Black figures in period clothing. On the same day, a supervisor suggested serving stereotypical foods such as fried chicken and watermelon during the event, which was widely criticized as racially insensitive. These incidents underscore a hostile work environment and lack of cultural competence within some VA facilities ([Horton, 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/va-will-be-investigated-after-staggering-accounts-of-racism-sen-warren-says/2020/10/01/8a4b9b3a-04b6-11eb-b7ed-141dd88560ea_story.html)).

### 4. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Investigation

Following the AFGE survey and multiple reports of discrimination, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Brian Schatz requested a GAO investigation into systemic racism at the VA. The GAO agreed to audit the agency, focusing on whether racism impacts the quality of care for veterans of color, how allegations of racism are tracked and managed, and the effectiveness of anti-discrimination training ([Horton, 2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/va-will-be-investigated-after-staggering-accounts-of-racism-sen-warren-says/2020/10/01/8a4b9b3a-04b6-11eb-b7ed-141dd88560ea_story.html)).

### 5. Legislative Response and Presidential Action

In November 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bill mandating the Government Accountability Office to study racial and ethnic disparities in VA benefits administration, including compensation benefits, disability ratings, and the rejection of "fully developed claims." The bill aims to expose disparities and improve equity in VA services ([Kheel, 2021](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/11/30/racial-disparities-va-benefits-advocates-say-are-rampant-set-get-watchdog-probe.html)).

President Biden emphasized that disabilities and injuries do not discriminate based on race, and all veterans deserve equal dignity and treatment. The bill's passage reflects growing recognition at the federal level of systemic racial inequities within the VA.

### 6. Calls for Increased Representation of Black Veterans in VA Leadership

The Black Veterans Empowerment Council and other organizations have urged the Biden administration to diversify senior leadership within the VA, particularly in roles overseeing health and benefits. They argue that increased representation of Black veterans in leadership is essential to addressing systemic discrimination and improving outcomes for minority veterans ([King, 2021](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/27/black-veterans-group-calls-for-representation-at-va-462894)).

## Health Disparities and Outcomes

The VA Office of Health Equity (OHE) documents disparities in health outcomes among racial and ethnic minority veterans, including Black veterans. For example, Black veterans experience higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions compared to White veterans. These disparities are compounded by unequal access to quality care and social determinants of health ([Office of Health Equity, VA](https://www.va.gov/healthequity/racialethnicminorityveterans.asp)).

OHE initiatives include culturally sensitive health programs, workforce training on unconscious bias, and partnerships with external organizations to improve health equity. However, persistent disparities suggest systemic barriers remain.

## Analysis and Opinion

The evidence presented from multiple credible sources indicates that Black veterans do face racial discrimination at the VA in several critical areas:

1. **Benefit Administration**: The lower rates of disability compensation for Black veterans, combined with the VA’s failure to fully disclose data, suggest systemic inequities in how benefits are awarded. This disparity undermines the financial security and well-being of Black veterans and their families.

2. **Healthcare Access and Quality**: Health disparities documented by the VA’s Office of Health Equity show that Black veterans experience worse health outcomes for chronic conditions. While some of these disparities reflect broader societal inequities, the VA’s role as a healthcare provider necessitates proactive measures to ensure equitable care.

3. **Workplace Environment**: The high incidence of reported racism among VA employees, including racial slurs and barriers to advancement, points to an organizational culture that tolerates discrimination. This environment not only affects employees but also impacts the quality of care and services veterans receive.

4. **Leadership Representation**: The underrepresentation of Black employees in leadership positions limits the VA’s ability to address systemic racism effectively. Diverse leadership is crucial for developing policies and practices that promote equity.

5. **Government and Legislative Responses**: The initiation of GAO investigations and the passage of legislation mandating studies on racial disparities reflect acknowledgment at the highest levels of government that systemic racism exists within the VA. These actions are positive steps but require sustained commitment and transparency to effect meaningful change.

Given the convergence of data, employee testimony, legal actions, and government oversight, it is clear that racial discrimination against Black veterans at the VA is a documented and ongoing issue. Addressing these disparities requires comprehensive reforms, including improved data transparency, anti-racism training, equitable benefit administration, enhanced healthcare services tailored to minority veterans, and increased representation of Black veterans in leadership roles.

## Recommendations

- **Data Transparency**: The VA should fully comply with FOIA requests and proactively publish detailed data on benefits and healthcare outcomes disaggregated by race and gender.

- **Anti-Racism Training and Accountability**: Implement mandatory, evidence-based cultural competence and anti-bias training for all VA employees, coupled with clear accountability mechanisms for discriminatory behavior.

- **Leadership Diversification**: Prioritize the recruitment and promotion of Black veterans and employees into senior leadership positions to ensure diverse perspectives in decision-making.

- **Targeted Health Equity Programs**: Expand culturally sensitive health programs addressing conditions disproportionately affecting Black veterans, with ongoing evaluation of effectiveness.

- **Legislative Oversight**: Support and act on findings from the GAO’s investigation and other legislative reviews to implement systemic reforms.

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive evidence from lawsuits, employee surveys, government investigations, and official data, Black veterans face significant racial discrimination at the Department of Veterans Affairs. These disparities affect their access to disability compensation, healthcare quality, workplace environment, and representation in leadership. While recent legislative and governmental actions signal progress, substantial and sustained efforts are necessary to eliminate systemic racism within the VA and ensure equitable treatment for all veterans.
