# Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote work globally, raising critical questions about its impact on productivity, employee satisfaction, and organizational outcomes. Prior to the pandemic, working from home (WFH) was an emerging but limited practice, often met with skepticism regarding its effectiveness and potential for shirking. A landmark randomized controlled trial conducted by Bloom, Liang, Roberts, and Ying (2013) at CTrip, China’s largest travel agency, provides rigorous empirical evidence on the productivity and broader effects of WFH. This report presents a detailed analysis of this experiment, evaluating whether working from home truly works, based on the comprehensive data and findings from the Chinese experiment.

## Background and Context

CTrip, a NASDAQ-listed company with approximately 16,000 employees and a market capitalization of about $5 billion, operates large call centers handling hotel, flight, and tour reservations. In December 2010, CTrip initiated a nine-month randomized experiment to compare the productivity of call center employees working from home versus those working in the office. The study involved 249 qualified employees who volunteered and met criteria such as broadband internet access and an independent workspace at home.

Employees with even-numbered birth dates were assigned to the treatment group (WFH), working four days per week from home and one day in the office. Those with odd-numbered birth dates formed the control group, continuing to work exclusively in the office. Both groups maintained the same hours, wages, and supervision structure, with team leaders working in the office.

## Key Findings

### Productivity Gains

The experiment found that home workers increased their overall productivity by 13% compared to their office-based counterparts over the nine-month period. This increase was decomposed into two main components:

- **9.2% increase in minutes worked per shift**: Home workers took fewer breaks and sick days, partly because they saved an average of 80 minutes daily by not commuting. Employees reported that on days they felt unwell, they could still work from home, which reduced absenteeism.
- **3.3% increase in calls handled per minute**: The quieter home environment contributed to improved focus and efficiency, enabling employees to handle calls more quickly without sacrificing quality.

Importantly, there was no measurable difference in the quality of calls between the two groups, alleviating concerns that increased quantity might compromise service standards ([Bloom et al., 2013](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18871)).

### Employee Satisfaction and Turnover

Home workers reported higher job satisfaction, with a 16 percentage point increase in positive work attitudes and reduced work exhaustion. Attrition rates were halved in the WFH group, with 17% quitting during the study compared to 35% in the office group. Interviews suggested that home workers were less likely to quit because comparable home-working jobs were scarce, indicating a retention benefit for the firm.

### Promotion Rates and Visibility

Despite performance improvements, home workers experienced almost 50% lower promotion rates conditional on performance compared to office workers. This was attributed to reduced face-to-face interaction and visibility to managers, which may have limited access to informal training and advancement opportunities.

### Post-Experiment Rollout and Selection Effects

Following the experiment, CTrip expanded the WFH option to the entire airfare and hotel booking departments. Employees were allowed to choose between working from home or the office. Two-thirds of the original control group chose to remain in the office, while half of the original WFH group opted to return to the office, citing concerns about loneliness and lower promotion prospects.

Interestingly, this self-selection led to a near doubling of productivity gains among home workers, reaching 22%. This suggests that allowing employees to select their preferred work environment enhances the effectiveness of WFH policies by retaining those who are most productive in that setting ([Bloom et al., 2013](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18871)).

### Financial Impact

CTrip estimated that the productivity improvement was worth approximately $375 per employee per year. Additionally, office cost savings amounted to about $1,250 per employee annually due to reduced need for physical workspace. Reduced attrition saved the company another $400 per employee per year in training and lost productivity costs. Altogether, the firm saved roughly $2,000 per employee annually by implementing WFH.

|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Productivity Increase           | +13%                           | 9.2% from more minutes worked, 3.3% calls/min |
| Minutes Worked per Shift        | +9.2%                          | Due to fewer breaks and sick days          |

## Interpretation and Critical Analysis

The CTrip experiment provides robust, causal evidence that working from home can significantly enhance productivity in a call center environment. The 13% productivity boost is substantial, especially given the scale and rigor of the randomized controlled trial. The gains stem primarily from increased working time and improved efficiency per minute worked, facilitated by the elimination of commuting and a quieter work environment.

The reduction in attrition and increase in job satisfaction further underscore the benefits of WFH, contributing to a more stable and motivated workforce. These findings challenge the traditional skepticism about remote work leading to shirking or reduced output.

However, the experiment also reveals important caveats. The lower promotion rates for home workers highlight a potential downside: reduced visibility and informal networking may hinder career advancement. This suggests that organizations must develop new management practices and communication channels to ensure equitable opportunities for remote employees.

The post-experiment rollout and employee self-selection highlight the importance of flexibility and choice. Allowing employees to work where they are most productive maximizes benefits and mitigates drawbacks such as loneliness or lack of promotion. This dynamic selection effect nearly doubled productivity gains, indicating that a one-size-fits-all approach to WFH is suboptimal.

## Broader Implications and Relevance

While the CTrip study focused on call center workers with relatively routine tasks, its findings have broader implications. The experiment demonstrates that WFH can be a viable and beneficial work arrangement, particularly when employees have suitable home environments and the nature of work allows for remote execution.

Subsequent studies in other sectors, such as IT professionals, have shown mixed results, with some reporting productivity declines due to coordination challenges and reduced networking (Gibbs, Mengel, & Siemroth, 2021). Therefore, the success of WFH may depend on job characteristics, management practices, and the availability of technology to support remote collaboration.

Organizations considering WFH policies should weigh the productivity and satisfaction benefits against potential challenges in career development and team cohesion. Investing in managerial training, virtual communication tools, and hybrid work models may help address these issues.

## Conclusion

Based on the Chinese experiment at CTrip, working from home demonstrably works in improving employee productivity, satisfaction, and retention, while also reducing costs for the employer. The 13% productivity increase, driven by longer working hours and higher call handling efficiency, coupled with a significant reduction in attrition, presents a compelling case for WFH as a modern work practice.

However, the experiment also highlights the need for organizations to address promotion and visibility challenges for remote workers. Moreover, providing employees with the choice to work from home or the office can further enhance productivity gains through better alignment with individual preferences and work styles.

In sum, the evidence from this rigorous study supports the effectiveness of working from home, particularly when implemented thoughtfully with attention to employee needs and organizational structures.
