# Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment

The question of whether working from home (WFH) enhances or diminishes employee productivity and satisfaction has gained considerable importance in recent years, especially with the rise of remote work globally. A seminal study conducted at CTrip, China's largest travel agency, provides robust empirical evidence on this topic. This report presents a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the findings from the randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at CTrip, synthesizing data on productivity, employee satisfaction, attrition, and promotion outcomes. The evidence is drawn primarily from the study by Bloom, Liang, Roberts, and Ying (2015), which remains one of the most rigorously designed and influential investigations into the impact of WFH on employee performance.

## Background and Context

CTrip, a NASDAQ-listed travel agency with approximately 16,000 employees, operates call centers in Shanghai and Nan Tong, where employees handle hotel, flight, and tour reservations. In December 2010, CTrip initiated a nine-month randomized experiment to evaluate the effects of working from home on call center employees’ productivity and job satisfaction. The study involved 249 employees who volunteered and met eligibility criteria including having a stable broadband internet connection and a dedicated workspace at home.

Employees were randomly assigned based on birth dates: those with even-numbered birthdays worked from home four days per week and came to the office one day, while those with odd-numbered birthdays continued working in the office. This randomization ensured a reliable comparison between the treatment (WFH) and control (office) groups ([Bloom et al., 2015](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18871)).

## Key Findings

### Productivity Gains

The primary outcome of interest was productivity, measured by the number of calls handled, time spent working, and calls answered per minute. The experiment found a **13% increase in performance** among home workers compared to office workers over the nine-month period. This improvement was decomposed as follows:

- **9% increase** due to more minutes worked per shift. Home workers took fewer breaks and sick days, effectively increasing their total working time.
- **4% increase** due to higher calls answered per minute, attributed to a quieter and more convenient working environment at home.

The increase in minutes worked per shift was quantified as a **9.2% rise in minutes worked**, demonstrating that employees were more engaged and less distracted when working remotely ([Bloom et al., 2015](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18871)).

| Productivity Metric        | Increase for WFH Employees |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Total performance         | 13%                        |
| Minutes worked per shift  | 9.2%                       |
| Calls answered per minute | 4%                         |

### Quality of Work

Importantly, the quality of calls did not differ significantly between the two groups, indicating that the productivity gains were not achieved at the expense of service quality. This suggests that WFH can maintain or even improve output without compromising customer satisfaction.

### Employee Satisfaction and Attrition

Home workers reported **improved job satisfaction** and experienced a **halving of attrition rates** compared to their office counterparts. This reduction in turnover is significant for companies, as it reduces recruitment and training costs and retains experienced staff.

### Promotion Rates

Despite the positive productivity and satisfaction outcomes, the study found that the **promotion rate for home workers was lower conditional on performance**. This suggests potential biases or structural barriers in career advancement for remote employees, possibly due to reduced visibility or fewer informal interactions with management.

### Post-Experiment Rollout and Self-Selection

Following the experiment, CTrip extended the WFH option to the entire firm. Employees were allowed to choose their preferred work location. Notably:

- Two-thirds of the original control group (office workers) chose to remain in the office.
- Half of the original home workers elected to return to the office, citing concerns about loneliness and lower promotion prospects.

Due to this self-selection, many lower-performing home workers left the WFH group, which led to an increase in the average productivity gains for home workers, nearly **doubling to 22%** after the experiment ended ([Bloom et al., 2015](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep13/evidence-chinese-experiment-working-home)).

## Interpretation and Implications

### Productivity and Work Environment

The experiment clearly demonstrates that working from home can significantly increase employee productivity, primarily through increased working time and a better working environment. The quieter home setting reduces distractions, enabling employees to handle calls more efficiently.

### Employee Well-being and Retention

Improved job satisfaction and reduced attrition highlight the benefits of flexible work arrangements for employee well-being. These factors contribute to a more stable workforce and can enhance organizational performance over time.

### Challenges in Career Advancement

The lower promotion rates for remote workers underscore a critical challenge: while WFH boosts productivity and satisfaction, it may inadvertently hinder career progression. Organizations need to address potential biases and ensure equitable opportunities for remote employees.

### Importance of Choice and Fit

The post-experiment rollout revealed that allowing employees to choose their work location maximizes productivity gains. Not all employees prefer or thrive in a remote setting; some value the social aspects and visibility of office work. Tailoring work arrangements to individual preferences and roles is essential.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The study focused on call center employees, whose tasks are relatively standardized and measurable. Results may differ in other industries or job types requiring more collaboration or creativity.
- The experiment lasted nine months, and longer-term effects, including impacts on innovation and team dynamics, were not assessed.
- Cultural and organizational contexts in China may influence the generalizability of findings to other countries.

## Conclusion

The Chinese experiment at CTrip provides compelling, data-driven evidence that working from home can enhance productivity by approximately 13%, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover. These benefits are primarily driven by increased working time and a more conducive work environment. However, the study also highlights challenges, particularly regarding career advancement for remote workers and the importance of employee choice in work location.

Organizations considering WFH policies should weigh these factors carefully, implementing supportive measures to ensure remote workers receive equitable opportunities for promotion and social integration. The evidence suggests that, when managed thoughtfully, working from home is a viable and effective work arrangement that can yield substantial benefits for both employees and employers.
