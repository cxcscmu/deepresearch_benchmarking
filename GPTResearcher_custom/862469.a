# Report on the Prevalence of Late-Term Abortions in the United States

Late-term abortions, generally defined as abortions occurring at or beyond 20 to 21 weeks of gestation, remain a subject of significant public and political debate in the United States. Understanding the prevalence and context of these procedures requires careful examination of available data from reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Guttmacher Institute, and state health agencies. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how common late-term abortions are in the U.S., supported by detailed statistics and contextual information.

## Definition and Terminology of Late-Term Abortions

The term "late-term abortion" lacks a precise medical or legal definition but is commonly used to refer to abortions performed at or after 20 to 21 weeks of gestation. The CDC's abortion surveillance system uses a threshold of greater than or equal to 21 weeks of gestation (approximately 19 weeks post-fertilization) to categorize late-term abortions ([Charlotte Lozier Institute, 2019](https://lozierinstitute.org/late-term-abortion-stats/)).

Medical professionals often avoid the term "late-term" due to its imprecision and potential to mislead, as it may imply abortions occur near full-term pregnancy (37 weeks or later), which is not the case for most late-term abortions ([Washington Post, 2019](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/06/tough-questions-answers-late-term-abortions-law-women-who-get-them/)).

## Overall Frequency of Late-Term Abortions

### National Estimates

According to the CDC, late-term abortions (at or after 21 weeks) constitute approximately 1.0% to 1.3% of all reported abortions annually. For example, in 2018, the CDC reported 5,341 abortions at or after 21 weeks, representing about 1% of all abortions with known gestational age ([Live Action News, 2019](https://www.liveaction.org/news/cdc-report-later-abortions-often-public-believe/)).

Using the total number of reported abortions in 2018 (619,591), estimates suggest that approximately 6,196 abortions occurred at 21 weeks or greater. When considering the second trimester and beyond (14 weeks or later), estimates rise to nearly 50,000 abortions annually ([Live Action News, 2019](https://www.liveaction.org/news/cdc-report-later-abortions-often-public-believe/)).

The Johnston's Archive, which compiles state-level data from the CDC and other health agencies, estimates the number of late-term abortions (defined as >20 weeks gestation) in the U.S. as follows:

| Year | Estimated Number of Late-Term Abortions | Plausible Range          |
|-------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 2008  | 17,500                                | 13,800 to 23,000        |
| 2015  | 12,300                                | 9,600 to 16,400         |
| 2018  | 11,500                                | 9,100 to 15,400         |

These figures indicate a decline in late-term abortions over the past decade, although data gaps exist due to inconsistent reporting from several key states that account for approximately 30% of total U.S. abortions (California, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, and New Hampshire) ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

### Percentage of Late-Term Abortions Relative to All Abortions

The fraction of late-term abortions relative to all abortions has remained relatively stable over decades. CDC data show that for abortions with known gestational age:

- From 1970 to 1990, late-term abortions (>20 weeks) averaged 0.95%.
- From 1992 to 2004, this fraction increased to an average of 1.41%.
- From 2005 to 2015, it slightly declined to an average of 1.30% ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

This stability suggests that despite changes in abortion laws and access, the proportion of late-term abortions has not increased significantly.

## Gestational Age Breakdown Beyond 20 Weeks

While the CDC does not provide detailed national data for abortions beyond 20 weeks, some states report abortions at later gestational ages:

| Gestational Age | Estimated Number of Abortions (2018) | Plausible Range         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|
| >20 weeks       | 11,500                             | 9,100 to 15,400        |
| >24 weeks       | 900                                | 400 to 1,600           |
| >28 weeks       | 160                                | 50 to 260              |

These numbers reflect that abortions beyond 24 weeks are exceedingly rare, and those beyond 28 weeks are even more uncommon ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

State-specific data show variability, with some states reporting zero abortions beyond 24 weeks during certain periods. For instance, Alaska, Indiana, and Pennsylvania reported zero abortions at >24 weeks in some years, while Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota provided data on abortions beyond 28 weeks ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

## Reasons for Late-Term Abortions

Data from Arizona, Florida, and Utah indicate the following distribution of reasons for late-term abortions:

| Reason           | Percentage Range (%) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Elective (non-health related) | 30 – 80            |
| Fetal health issues           | 20 – 60            |
| Maternal health issues        | 3 – 10             |

These figures align with findings from Guttmacher Institute surveys and testimonies from abortion providers, suggesting that the majority of late-term abortions are either elective or due to fetal health concerns, with a smaller fraction related to maternal health ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

## Comparison with Early-Term Abortions

The vast majority of abortions occur early in pregnancy:

| Gestational Age       | Percentage of Total Abortions (2018) | Estimated Number of Abortions |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 9 weeks or less       | 77.7%                               | 481,422                      |
| 13 weeks or less      | 92.2%                               | 571,263                      |
| 14-20 weeks          | 6.9%                                | 42,752                       |
| 21 weeks or greater   | 1.0%                                | 6,196                        |

This distribution highlights that late-term abortions constitute a very small fraction of all abortions, with most occurring in the first trimester ([Live Action News, 2019](https://www.liveaction.org/news/cdc-report-later-abortions-often-public-believe/)).

## Trends Over Time and Reporting Challenges

The reporting of abortion data, especially late-term abortions, is inconsistent across states and years. Some states do not report gestational age data or do not report to the CDC at all, leading to uncertainty in national estimates. For example, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, and New Hampshire account for about 30% of all U.S. abortions but provide little or no gestational age data ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

Despite these data limitations, trends indicate that the proportion of late-term abortions has remained relatively stable, with no clear evidence that recent state restrictions on abortion have increased the fraction of late-term abortions ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

## Contextualizing Late-Term Abortion Numbers

Though late-term abortions constitute a small percentage of total abortions, the absolute numbers are not insignificant. For instance, in 2018, approximately 11,500 abortions occurred after 20 weeks gestation, with about 900 after 24 weeks. To put this in perspective, these numbers exceed many causes of death that individually account for less than 1% of total deaths annually in the U.S. ([Live Action News, 2019](https://www.liveaction.org/news/cdc-report-later-abortions-often-public-believe/)).

## Legal and Medical Considerations

Most states restrict abortions after 20 to 26 weeks of gestation, but exceptions exist, typically to save the mother's life or in cases of severe fetal anomalies. Late-term abortions are medically more complex and riskier, and few providers perform them. Some states permit abortion on demand through birth, but these are rare and represent a small fraction of all abortions ([Johnston’s Archive, 2020](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/late_term_abortion_usa.html)).

## Summary and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive review of available data, late-term abortions in the United States are relatively rare, constituting approximately 1% to 1.3% of all abortions annually. The absolute numbers, while small relative to total abortions, are significant in human terms, with an estimated 11,500 late-term abortions occurring in 2018 at greater than 20 weeks gestation.

The data indicate that the majority of late-term abortions occur for elective reasons or due to fetal health issues, with a smaller proportion related to maternal health. The fraction of late-term abortions has remained relatively stable over the past several decades, and there is no clear evidence that recent legislative restrictions have increased their incidence.

Data limitations, particularly inconsistent reporting from key states, introduce uncertainty into national estimates. However, the convergence of multiple data sources, including CDC reports, state health agency data, and independent analyses, supports the conclusion that late-term abortions are uncommon but persistent components of abortion care in the U.S.

Given the medical complexity and ethical considerations surrounding late-term abortions, their rarity underscores the importance of nuanced, evidence-based policy discussions rather than inflammatory rhetoric. Accurate data collection and transparent reporting remain essential for informed public understanding and policymaking.
