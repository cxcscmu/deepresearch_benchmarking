# Report on the Prevalence of Late-Term Abortions in the United States

## Introduction

Late-term abortion, commonly defined as abortion occurring after 20 weeks of gestation, is a subject of considerable public and political debate in the United States. Despite the contentious nature of the topic, accurate and comprehensive data on the incidence of late-term abortions are limited due to inconsistent reporting requirements and varying state policies. This report aims to provide a detailed, data-driven analysis of how common late-term abortions are in the U.S., drawing from multiple reliable sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Guttmacher Institute, and state health agencies. The report also addresses the reasons for late-term abortions, associated survival probabilities of fetuses at these gestational ages, and the economic impact of late-term abortion services.

## Definition and Data Challenges

Late-term abortions are generally defined as those performed after 20 weeks of gestation. However, some states use probable post-fertilization (PPF) age, which is approximately two weeks less than gestational age. This discrepancy complicates data comparison across states.

Abortion reporting in the U.S. is voluntary and inconsistent. The CDC relies on state-reported data, but some states do not report or have incomplete data, notably California, Maryland, Florida, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, which collectively account for about 30% of all U.S. abortions. The Guttmacher Institute supplements official data with provider surveys but reports data only every few years and estimates missing years through interpolation. These limitations create uncertainty in national estimates, especially for late-term abortions.

## Incidence of Late-Term Abortions

### National Estimates

According to the CDC and supplemented by state health data, the estimated number of late-term abortions (>20 weeks gestation) in the U.S. has been relatively stable over the past two decades. The Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) estimates for late-term abortions are as follows:

| Year | Estimated Number of Late-Term Abortions (>20 weeks) | Plausible Range |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2008  | 17,500                                      | 13,800 – 23,000 |
| 2015  | 12,300                                      | 9,600 – 16,400  |
| 2018  | 11,500                                      | 9,100 – 15,400  |

These figures represent approximately 1.3% to 1.4% of all abortions in those years ([Johnston, 2019a](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

The Guttmacher Institute's 2017 data aligns with this, reporting that 1.3% of abortions occurred at or after 21 weeks gestation, out of approximately 862,320 total abortions ([Jones et al., 2019](https://www.guttmacher.org)).

### Gestational Age Breakdown Beyond 20 Weeks

Data on abortions beyond 24 and 28 weeks are more limited but indicate a steep decline in numbers as gestational age increases:

| Gestational Age | 2008 Estimate | 2015 Estimate | 2018 Estimate | Plausible Range (2018) |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| >24 weeks       | 1,400         | 1,100         | 900           | 400 – 1,600           |
| >28 weeks       | 270           | 190           | 160           | 50 – 260              |

This exponential drop-off reflects both medical practice and legal restrictions in many states ([Johnston, 2019a](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

### State-Level Variation

Late-term abortion rates vary significantly by state, influenced by state laws, availability of providers, and interstate travel for services. States are grouped as follows based on late-term abortion fractions:

| Group | States Included (Examples)                                  | Late-Term Abortion Percentage (Approx.) |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| High  | California, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington | ~2.5%                                   |
| Medium| Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin | 0.5% – 1.4%                             |
| Low   | Remaining states plus D.C. (excluding Florida and New Hampshire) | 0.2% – 0.5%                             |

For example, New Mexico has a notably high late-term abortion fraction, reaching 7.44% in 2015, reflecting its role as a regional provider for late-term abortions ([Johnston, 2019a](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

### Comparison with Total Abortions

Late-term abortions constitute a small fraction of total abortions. The vast majority occur before 13 weeks gestation, with over 90% of abortions performed by this time. Abortions after 20 weeks represent roughly 1.3% of all abortions, indicating that late-term abortions are rare relative to earlier procedures ([CDC, 2018](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr)).

## Reasons for Late-Term Abortions

Contrary to some public perceptions, a significant proportion of late-term abortions are elective rather than strictly for maternal or fetal health reasons. Data from Arizona, Florida, and Utah illustrate this:

| State   | Number of Late-Term Abortions | Maternal Health (%) | Fetal Health (%) | Elective (%) |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Arizona | 714                           | 3                  | 18               | 79           |
| Florida | 230                           | 6–13               | 39               | 39–55        |
| Utah    | 134                           | 6–26               | 63               | 2–28         |

Studies by Foster and Kimport (2013) and Foster et al. (2012) further support that most women seeking later abortions do so for reasons other than fetal anomaly or life endangerment, often citing logistical challenges such as difficulty accessing providers or financial constraints ([Foster & Kimport, 2013](https://www.guttmacher.org)).

Testimonies from abortion providers performing partial-birth abortions in the 1990s also indicated that a large majority of such procedures were elective ([Johnston, 2007](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net)).

## Survival Potential of Fetuses in Late-Term Abortions

The viability of fetuses at gestational ages beyond 20 weeks has improved with medical advances. Survival rates reported by Rysavy et al. (2015) are:

| Gestational Age | Survival Rate (%) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 22 weeks        | 5.1               |
| 23 weeks        | 23.6              |
| 24 weeks        | 54.9              |
| 25 weeks        | 72.0              |
| 26 weeks        | 81.4              |

Assuming 10–50% of aborted fetuses have health issues reducing survival likelihood, it is estimated that annually between 800 and 2,100 babies aborted after 20 weeks could have survived if carried to term ([Johnston, 2019a](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

## Economic Impact of Late-Term Abortions

Late-term abortions are significantly more expensive than early abortions. Cost estimates adjusted to 2018 dollars include:

| Study                  | Reported Cost (Median or Mean) | Year(s)      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Jones & Kooistra       | Mean $1,822                   | 2008         |
| Foster & Kimport       | Mean $2,359                   | 2008–2010    |
| Jerman & Jones         | Median $1,477                 | 2011–2012    |
| Jones et al.           | Median $1,268                 | 2014         |
| Anecdotal (3rd Trimester) | >$5,000                     | Recent       |

Applying these costs to the estimated number of late-term abortions yields an estimated annual revenue of $12 million to $40 million for late-term abortion services, accounting for approximately 5% of the total abortion industry revenue, which is near half a billion dollars annually ([Johnston, 2019a](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

## Policy Context and International Comparison

As of early 2019, seven U.S. states and the District of Columbia permit abortion on demand at any point in pregnancy, including through birth: Alaska, Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and D.C. Eighteen other states allow abortion through viability, often defined subjectively by providers.

This makes the U.S. an outlier globally, with only a few countries such as Canada, North Korea, and Vietnam having similarly permissive late-term abortion policies. Most other developed countries restrict late-term abortions to cases involving fetal or maternal health issues ([Baglini, 2014](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

## Trends Over Time

The fraction of late-term abortions in the U.S. has been relatively stable for decades, averaging about 1.3% of all abortions. Some fluctuations are linked to changes in state reporting practices rather than actual incidence. There is no evidence supporting claims that recent abortion restrictions have increased the proportion of late-term abortions ([Johnston, 2019a](https://lozierinstitute.org)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Late-term abortions in the United States are relatively rare, constituting approximately 1.3% of all abortions annually, with an estimated 11,500 such procedures performed in 2018. The majority of abortions occur well before 20 weeks gestation. Despite political rhetoric suggesting otherwise, late-term abortions are not commonly performed "moments before birth," and the number of abortions at very late gestational ages (>24 or >28 weeks) is even smaller.

Data indicate that a significant portion of late-term abortions are elective rather than strictly for maternal or fetal health reasons, although the reasons for these abortions are complex and often involve barriers to earlier access.

Given the limitations in reporting and data collection, these estimates carry uncertainty, but the convergence of multiple sources supports the conclusion that late-term abortions are uncommon relative to total abortions.

From a public health perspective, understanding the true incidence and reasons for late-term abortions is essential for informed policy-making. The data suggest that efforts to reduce barriers to early abortion access and improve reproductive health services could reduce the need for later abortions.
