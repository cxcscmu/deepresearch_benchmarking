# The Decline in the Velocity of Money: Causes and Implications

The velocity of money, defined as the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period, has been a critical economic indicator for assessing the health and dynamism of an economy. It is typically calculated as the ratio of nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the money supply (V = PQ/M), where P is the price level, Q is the quantity of goods and services produced, and M is the money supply. A higher velocity indicates more transactions per unit of money, suggesting robust economic activity, whereas a declining velocity often signals economic stagnation or contraction.

Over the past two decades, and particularly since the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic, the velocity of money in the United States has experienced a pronounced and sustained decline. This report aims to provide a detailed, comprehensive, and data-supported analysis of why the velocity of money has declined, drawing on multiple reputable sources to offer an objective understanding of the phenomenon.

## Overview of the Decline in Money Velocity

The velocity of both M1 and M2 money supplies in the U.S. has been declining for over a decade, reaching historic lows. Specifically, the velocity of M1 money stock is at its lowest level since 1975, and the velocity of M2 money stock is at its lowest since data recording began in 1959 ([Disruptive Investor, 2015](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3066146-why-money-velocity-continues-to-decline)).

The decline has been steady over the past 20 years, with a sharp acceleration during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The pandemic-induced economic shock, combined with expansive monetary and fiscal policies, has created an environment where money supply has grown exponentially, yet the velocity of money has plummeted ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).

## Key Causes of the Decline in Money Velocity

### 1. **Expansionary Monetary Policy and Increased Money Supply**

A primary driver of declining velocity is the robust increase in the money supply (M1 and M2), which has outpaced nominal GDP growth. The Federal Reserve's disinflationary policies, including quantitative easing and near-zero interest rates, have significantly increased the money supply. For example, in 2020, the U.S. money supply grew by over 23% year-on-year, nearly double the prior peak growth rate ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).

According to the quantity theory of money, if the money supply grows faster than nominal GDP, the velocity of money will decline because there is more money circulating relative to the volume of transactions. This inverse relationship is a fundamental reason for the observed decline.

### 2. **Economic Uncertainty and Increased Savings**

The COVID-19 pandemic heightened economic uncertainty, leading consumers and businesses to increase their savings and reduce spending. This behavioral shift means that money is held longer and changes hands less frequently, directly reducing velocity. During peak COVID-19 lockdowns, core inflation actually fell by 0.4%, and headline inflation was negative at -1.1%, reflecting subdued spending despite increased money supply ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).

### 3. **Shift from Cash to Digital Payments and Changes in Payment Behavior**

The decline in the velocity of M1 money can be partly explained by the shift away from cash to cards and online payments. Digital payments, while increasing transaction efficiency, have altered the nature of money circulation. Banks and fintech companies have seen a transformation in payment behaviors, with more consumers adopting mobile wallets and online banking, especially accelerated by the pandemic ([The Financial Brand, 2020](https://thefinancialbrand.com/96502/coronavirus-covid-19-changing-banking-payments-digital-behavior-trends/)).

While this shift increases transaction volume in some respects, it also reduces the need for holding physical cash, which traditionally circulates faster. The net effect is a complex alteration of velocity dynamics, often contributing to lower measured velocity.

### 4. **Lack of Viable Investment and Spending Opportunities**

Despite the increase in money supply, much of the additional liquidity has remained in bank reserves rather than being actively deployed in the economy. This is due to a lack of viable uses for the cash, as economic growth opportunities have been limited by structural factors such as stagnation in conventional oil production and diminishing returns on capital investments ([D J Sims, 2016](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/10843/implications-of-declining-money-velocity)).

This liquidity glut has led to a situation where money sits idle, reducing the frequency of transactions and thus velocity.

### 5. **Demographic and Structural Economic Changes**

Long-term demographic trends, including aging populations, have contributed to more conservative spending and investment behaviors. Older populations tend to save more and spend less, which reduces the velocity of money. Additionally, structural changes in the economy, such as increased automation and shifts toward service-based industries, may also affect the velocity by changing transaction patterns and the nature of economic exchanges.

## Detailed Analysis of Monetary Policy and Velocity

The Federal Reserve's policies over the past two decades have aimed to stimulate economic growth through increased liquidity. However, the velocity of money has declined steadily, suggesting that the additional money has not circulated rapidly through the economy.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis notes that if velocity declines rapidly during an expansionary monetary policy period, it can offset the increase in money supply and even lead to deflation instead of inflation ([Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2014](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2014/september/what-does-money-velocity-tell-us-about-low-inflation-in-the-us)).

This phenomenon has been observed in the post-2008 period and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased money supply has largely been absorbed as excess reserves in banks rather than fueling consumer spending or investment. This dynamic has contributed to the low velocity despite high liquidity.

## The Role of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The pandemic has been a critical accelerant of the velocity decline. The unprecedented fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion increased money supply sharply, but lockdowns and economic uncertainty led to reduced consumer spending and increased savings.

The velocity of money fell to a modern low of 1.1 during the pandemic, reflecting a sharp deceleration in economic transactions despite strong M2 growth ([Brusuelas, 2020](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/velocity-of-money-pandemic-induced-slowing/)).

This situation suggests that the economy may face slow growth even after reopening, with risks skewed toward disinflation or deflation in the near to medium term.

## The Shift to Digital Payments and Its Impact

The transition from cash to digital payments has altered the velocity landscape. Digital payments increase transaction efficiency but reduce the physical exchange of money, which traditionally contributed to higher velocity.

Banks and fintech companies are adapting to this shift, but the reduced reliance on cash means that traditional measures of velocity may not fully capture the new dynamics of money circulation ([The Financial Brand, 2020](https://thefinancialbrand.com/96502/coronavirus-covid-19-changing-banking-payments-digital-behavior-trends/); [BCG, 2017](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/banks-thrive-digital-payments-grow)).

## Conclusion

The decline in the velocity of money in the United States is a multifaceted phenomenon driven primarily by:

- Expansionary monetary policy increasing money supply faster than nominal GDP,
- Economic uncertainty leading to higher savings and reduced spending,
- Structural shifts in payment methods from cash to digital,
- Lack of viable investment opportunities causing liquidity to remain idle,
- Demographic and structural economic changes influencing spending behavior.

This decline signals weaker real economic activity and challenges the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools. While it suppresses inflationary pressures in the short term, it also raises concerns about economic growth and the potential for disinflation or deflation.

Policymakers must consider these dynamics when designing fiscal and monetary interventions, recognizing that increasing the money supply alone may not stimulate economic activity without addressing the underlying causes of low velocity.
