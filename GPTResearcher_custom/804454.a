# Report on the Decline in the Velocity of Money in the United States

## Introduction

The velocity of money, a critical economic indicator, measures the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period. It is commonly expressed as the ratio of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the money supply (M1 or M2). Over the past two decades, the United States has witnessed a persistent decline in the velocity of both M1 and M2 money supplies, reaching historic lows. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the causes behind this decline, explores its implications, and offers an informed opinion based on trusted and recent economic analyses.

## Understanding Money Velocity

Money velocity (V) is mathematically defined as:

\[
V = \frac{GDP}{M}
\]

where \(GDP\) is the gross domestic product (nominal) and \(M\) is the money supply (M1 or M2). A higher velocity indicates that money circulates rapidly through the economy, implying robust economic activity and spending. Conversely, a decline in velocity suggests that money changes hands less frequently, potentially signaling economic stagnation or increased saving behavior.

## Observed Trends in the U.S. Money Velocity

The velocity of M1 money stock has fallen to its lowest level since 1975, while the velocity of M2 is at its lowest since data recording began in 1959 ([Disruptive Investor, 2015](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3046576-why-money-velocity-continues-to-decline)). The decline has been steady over the past 20 years, with an accelerated drop during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconomicsreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).

## Causes of the Decline in Money Velocity

### 1. Robust Increase in Money Supply Relative to GDP Growth

One of the primary reasons for the decline in velocity is the significant expansion of the money supply (both M1 and M2) relative to the pace of GDP growth. Post the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury injected trillions of dollars into the economy through monetary easing and fiscal stimulus programs.

- M1 and M2 money stock surged dramatically after the financial crisis and again in 2020, with M2 growing over 23% year-on-year from 2019 to 2020 ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconomicsreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).
- Despite this surge, GDP growth remained comparatively slower, causing the ratio \( \frac{GDP}{M} \) to fall, and thus velocity declined.

This dynamic indicates that more money is required to sustain a unit of GDP, reflecting a decoupling of money supply growth from real economic output.

### 2. Increased Saving and Reduced Spending Behavior

During periods of economic uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers tend to increase savings and reduce spending. This behavior reduces the frequency of monetary transactions, directly lowering the velocity of money.

- Savings rates in the U.S. rose to as high as 13.1% in early 2020 ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconomicsreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).
- Lockdowns and economic uncertainty led to fewer transactions and subdued demand across many sectors.

This shift in consumer behavior results in money sitting idle in bank accounts rather than circulating through the economy.

### 3. Monetary Policy and Excess Bank Reserves

The Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policies have led to a buildup of excess reserves held by banks, which has constrained the flow of liquidity into the real economy.

- Banks have been conservative and risk-averse, holding large excess reserves with the Fed rather than lending aggressively ([Disruptive Investor, 2015](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3046576-why-money-velocity-continues-to-decline)).
- This behavior restricts credit growth and reduces the velocity of money, as funds do not circulate through loans and investments as robustly as expected.

### 4. Structural Changes in Payment Methods and Financial Technology

The velocity of M1 money has also been affected by changes in payment methods, such as a shift from cash to cards and online payments, which may alter the measurement of velocity but do not necessarily reflect a decline in economic activity ([Comptonburger, 2016](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/18206/implications-of-declining-money-velocity)).

### 5. Economic Stagnation and Sectoral Constraints

Some analyses suggest that the stagnation in key sectors, such as conventional oil production, has limited the potential for further economic growth despite monetary injections ([Comptonburger, 2016](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/18206/implications-of-declining-money-velocity)).

## Implications of Declining Money Velocity

### Economic Activity and Growth

While a declining velocity traditionally signals weakening economic activity, recent evidence suggests a more nuanced interpretation:

| Aspect                                | Interpretation                                           |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Decline in velocity with GDP growth | Indicates slower GDP growth relative to money supply    |
| Decline in velocity with stable GDP | Suggests increased money supply without proportional output growth |
| Decline in velocity with rising savings | Reflects consumer caution and liquidity preference      |

Thus, the decline in velocity does not necessarily mean the economy is contracting but may highlight inefficiencies in money utilization and shifts in spending behavior.

### Inflationary Pressures

According to the quantity theory of money, inflation occurs when money supply growth outpaces real output growth. The inverse relationship between increasing money supply and declining velocity raises concerns about future inflation:

- The surge in money supply during the pandemic, coupled with low velocity, has not immediately triggered inflation due to suppressed demand.
- However, as economic recovery progresses and spending rebounds, inflationary pressures may emerge if money supply growth remains elevated ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconomicsreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).

### Interest Rates and Credit Markets

Declining velocity correlates with lower interest rates, influenced by:

- Increased liquidity and excess reserves in the banking system.
- Reduced demand for credit due to diminished investment incentives amid low returns on capital ([Comptonburger, 2016](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/18206/implications-of-declining-money-velocity)).

This environment fosters a supply-demand imbalance in credit markets, with ample liquidity but subdued borrowing.

### Policy Considerations

The Federal Reserveâ€™s response to declining velocity includes:

- Maintaining accommodative monetary policies to support economic growth.
- Monitoring inflation and adjusting balance sheet operations to prevent overheating ([Demsher, 2021](https://usceconomicsreview.com/2021/04/15/the-u-s-decline-in-money-velocity/)).
- Recognizing that velocity is a dynamic measure, sensitive to economic cycles and consumer confidence.

| Payment Method Shifts          | Transition from cash to electronic payments affecting M1 velocity measurement              | Alters velocity measurement, may lower M1 velocity |
| Sectoral Economic Constraints  | Stagnation in key sectors limiting output growth                                           | Limits GDP growth, lowering velocity    |

## Opinion and Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive review of the data and analyses, the decline in the velocity of money in the United States is primarily attributable to a combination of structural and cyclical factors:

- The unprecedented growth in money supply post-2008 and during the COVID-19 pandemic has outpaced GDP growth, mechanically reducing velocity.
- Consumer behavior shifts towards higher savings and cautious spending during uncertain times have further suppressed velocity.
- Banking sector conservatism, reflected in excess reserves, has restrained the transmission of monetary expansion into real economic activity.
- While the decline signals subdued circulation of money, it does not unequivocally indicate a severe economic contraction but rather a complex interplay of liquidity preference, monetary policy, and economic confidence.

Looking forward, the velocity of money is expected to remain low until consumer confidence and spending recover sustainably. Policymakers must balance supporting growth with vigilance against inflationary risks as the economy normalizes.
