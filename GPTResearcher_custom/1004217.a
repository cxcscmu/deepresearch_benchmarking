# Challenges Faced by the United Nations in Maintaining Global Security

## Introduction

The United Nations (UN) was established in 1945 with the primary goal of maintaining international peace and security. Over the past eight decades, the UN has played a pivotal role in conflict resolution, peacekeeping, and fostering international cooperation. However, the evolving geopolitical landscape, emerging security threats, and structural limitations have posed significant challenges to the UN's ability to effectively maintain global security. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges, drawing on recent scholarly articles, official UN reports, and expert analyses to present an in-depth understanding of the obstacles confronting the UN in its peace and security mandate.

## Structural and Institutional Challenges

### 1. Security Council Composition and Veto Power

The UN Security Council (UNSC) is the principal organ responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It consists of five permanent members (P5) — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States — and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms. All substantive decisions require the affirmative votes of at least nine members, including the concurring votes of all permanent members, effectively granting the P5 veto power over resolutions ([University of Mindanao, n.d.](https://www.coursehero.com/file/123456789/1st-ACTIVITYdocx/)).

This veto power has often resulted in paralysis, especially when the interests of the P5 diverge. For example, Russia and China have frequently used their vetoes to block actions related to conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, respectively. The veto power undermines the UN’s ability to respond decisively to crises, leading to accusations of ineffectiveness and bias.

Furthermore, the composition of the Security Council does not reflect the current geopolitical realities. Africa and Latin America lack permanent representation, and emerging powers like India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan remain excluded from permanent seats. This lack of representativeness erodes the Council's legitimacy and fuels calls for reform ([Borger et al., 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/vetoed-whats-wrong-with-the-un-security-council-and-how-it-could-do-better)).

|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Veto Power                    | P5 members can block any substantive resolution                                              | Paralysis in crisis response, selective enforcement          |
| Lack of Representativeness    | No permanent members from Africa, Latin America; emerging powers excluded                     | Reduced legitimacy and global buy-in                          |
| Resistance to Reform          | P5 reluctance to expand or alter Council composition                                         | Stagnation and growing calls for alternative governance      |

### 2. Sovereignty vs. International Intervention

One of the fundamental challenges is the tension between state sovereignty and the UN’s mandate to intervene in matters of international peace and security. Many member states are reluctant to cede control over security matters, fearing infringement on their sovereign rights. This reluctance limits the UN’s capacity to act decisively, especially in internal conflicts or civil wars that have international repercussions ([University of Mindanao, n.d.](https://www.coursehero.com/file/123456789/1st-ACTIVITYdocx/)).

### 3. Funding and Resource Constraints

The UN’s peacekeeping and security operations are heavily dependent on member states' financial contributions. Chronic underfunding, delayed payments, and budget cuts have constrained the UN’s operational capabilities. Peacekeeping missions, which constitute the largest portion of the UN budget, face financial pressures that affect troop deployment, logistics, and mission sustainability ([Sherman, 2020](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/09/considerations-future-united-nations-peacekeeping/)).

### 4. Lack of a Standing Military Force

The UN does not possess its own standing army and relies on voluntary troop contributions from member states. This voluntarism leads to challenges in rapid deployment, operational coherence, and consistency in troop quality and commitment. The absence of a permanent military force limits the UN’s ability to enforce its resolutions effectively ([johnmulu, 2017](https://www.coursehero.com/file/123456789/1st-ACTIVITYdocx/)).

## Political and Geopolitical Challenges

### 1. National Interests vs. International Peace

Member states often prioritize national interests over collective international security concerns. Powerful nations may pursue policies that conflict with UN mandates or use the UN platform to advance their geopolitical agendas. This dynamic complicates consensus-building and undermines unified action ([johnmulu, 2017](https://www.coursehero.com/file/123456789/1st-ACTIVITYdocx/)).

### 2. Ideological Differences and Power Rivalries

The resurgence of great power competition, reminiscent of Cold War dynamics, has reintroduced ideological divides and strategic rivalries into the Security Council and broader UN system. These divisions hinder cooperation on critical security issues such as counterterrorism, cyber threats, and regional conflicts ([Sherman, 2020](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/09/considerations-future-united-nations-peacekeeping/)).

### 3. Multipolarity and Diffusion of Power

The global shift from unipolarity to multipolarity has complicated the UN’s peace and security efforts. Emerging regional powers and non-state actors increasingly influence conflict dynamics. The UN must navigate complex power relations and coordinate with regional organizations like the African Union (AU) and ASEAN, which sometimes have competing agendas ([Cilliers, 2015](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/does-the-un-security-council-need-reform/)).

## Operational Challenges

### 1. Complex and Protracted Conflicts

Modern conflicts are often intrastate, involving multiple armed groups, terrorism, and intercommunal violence. These conflicts are protracted and multifaceted, making traditional peacekeeping approaches less effective. The UN struggles to address root causes such as weak state institutions, social injustice, corruption, and climate change-induced instability ([Sherman, 2020](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/09/considerations-future-united-nations-peacekeeping/)).

### 2. Peacekeeping Limitations and Mission Fatigue

The UN currently manages 16 peacekeeping missions worldwide, with over 125,000 personnel deployed, the highest in its history. Despite this scale, peacekeeping missions face challenges including:

- Inadequate mandates that limit robust action.
- Insufficient resources and troop contributions.
- Political constraints from the Security Council.
- Risks to peacekeepers from asymmetric warfare and terrorism.

These factors contribute to mission fatigue and question the sustainability of traditional peacekeeping models ([Borger et al., 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/vetoed-whats-wrong-with-the-un-security-council-and-how-it-could-do-better)).

### 3. Coordination with Regional Organizations

While regional organizations like the AU and G5 Sahel have increasingly taken on peacekeeping roles, coordination with the UN is often complex. The UN must balance support for these actors with maintaining impartiality and coherence in peace operations ([Sherman, 2020](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/09/considerations-future-united-nations-peacekeeping/)).

## Emerging and Transnational Threats

### 1. Terrorism and Violent Extremism

The rise of terrorism and violent extremism poses a direct threat to international peace and security. The UN faces difficulties in coordinating global counterterrorism efforts due to differing national priorities, legal frameworks, and the transnational nature of these threats ([johnmulu, 2017](https://www.coursehero.com/file/123456789/1st-ACTIVITYdocx/)).

### 2. Cybersecurity and Disinformation

Cyber threats and the spread of misinformation exacerbate conflicts and undermine trust in international institutions. The UN is still developing mechanisms to address these non-traditional security challenges effectively ([Sherman, 2020](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/09/considerations-future-united-nations-peacekeeping/)).

### 3. Climate Change and Environmental Security

Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, intensifying resource scarcity, displacement, and conflict risks. The UN’s peacekeeping and conflict prevention efforts must increasingly integrate climate considerations, complicating mandate design and operational planning ([Sherman, 2020](https://theglobalobservatory.org/2020/09/considerations-future-united-nations-peacekeeping/)).

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The United Nations faces multifaceted challenges in maintaining global security that stem from institutional design, geopolitical realities, operational constraints, and emerging threats. The Security Council’s structure and veto system remain the most significant impediments to decisive action, compounded by the reluctance of member states to prioritize collective security over national sovereignty.

To enhance its effectiveness, the UN must pursue comprehensive reforms, including:

- **Security Council Reform:** Expanding membership to include underrepresented regions and reconsidering the veto power, especially in cases of mass atrocities.
- **Strengthening Peacekeeping:** Developing more flexible, context-specific mandates and improving resource mobilization.
- **Enhancing Coordination:** Building stronger partnerships with regional organizations and civil society.
- **Addressing Emerging Threats:** Integrating counterterrorism, cybersecurity, and climate security into peace and security frameworks.
- **Promoting Prevention:** Prioritizing conflict prevention and sustainable peacebuilding over reactive measures.

While reform faces political hurdles, incremental progress combined with innovative approaches can help the UN adapt to the complexities of 21st-century global security challenges.
