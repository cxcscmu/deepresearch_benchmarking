# Why Managers Might Act Against Their Own Ethical Values: An In-Depth Analysis

Managers in organizations often face complex situations where their actions may conflict with their personal ethical values. Understanding why managers might engage in behavior that contradicts their own ethical standards is crucial for developing effective ethics management programs and fostering organizational integrity. This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind such conflicts, drawing on psychological theories, organizational pressures, and environmental factors. The analysis is grounded in recent and reliable sources, prioritizing comprehensive insights and practical implications.

## Psychological and Cognitive Factors

### Moral Dissonance and Cognitive Dissonance

One of the central psychological explanations for why managers act against their ethical values is the concept of **moral dissonance**, a specific form of cognitive dissonance related to ethical conflicts. Cognitive dissonance, as defined by Festinger (1962), occurs when individuals experience psychological discomfort due to holding two conflicting cognitions or when their behavior contradicts their beliefs. Moral dissonance arises when a manager’s actions are inconsistent with their ethical standards, leading to discomfort that they seek to reduce through justification or rationalization ([Lowell, 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0931-9)).

Managers often employ **moral rationalization** strategies such as blaming the victim, self-affirmation, or minimizing the unethical nature of their actions to reduce this dissonance. These justifications allow them to maintain a self-image of being ethical despite engaging in unethical behavior. This psychological mechanism creates a feedback loop where unethical behavior leads to dissonance, which is then resolved by rationalization, potentially resulting in more unethical decisions ([Lowell, 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0931-9); [Walden University, n.d.](https://www.waldenu.edu/online-bachelors-programs/bs-in-psychology/resource/understanding-ethical-dissonance)).

### Personality and Situational Factors

The extent to which managers experience and respond to moral dissonance depends heavily on **personality traits** and **situational factors**. Some managers may have a higher tolerance for ethical ambiguity or a propensity for self-justification, while others may be more sensitive to ethical breaches. Situational pressures, such as organizational culture and external stimuli, also influence their ethical decision-making processes ([Lowell, 2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0931-9)).

## Organizational and Environmental Pressures

### Performance Pressure and Business Objectives

A significant driver of unethical managerial behavior is the intense pressure to meet business objectives and deadlines. According to a global survey by the American Management Association, **business objectives and deadlines** are the top factors leading to unethical corporate behavior, followed by career advancement and job security concerns ([Studymode, n.d.](https://www.studymode.com/essays/Ethical-Versus-Unethical-Behavior-269205.html)).

Managers may feel compelled to prioritize short-term results over ethical considerations, especially when organizational rewards and performance metrics emphasize outcomes over processes. This pressure can create ethical dilemmas where managers must choose between adhering to ethical standards or achieving financial and strategic goals ([Bizfluent, n.d.](https://bizfluent.com/info-12296154-causes-ethical-dilemma-conducting-business.html)).

### Conflicting Values and Limited Resources

Ethical dilemmas often arise from **conflicting values** within the organization. For example, one manager may prioritize product quality, while another emphasizes cost savings, leading to disagreements over supplier choices or production methods. Without a shared culture of ethical values, the organization risks approving decisions that favor less ethical options ([Bizfluent, n.d.](https://bizfluent.com/info-12296154-causes-ethical-dilemma-conducting-business.html)).

Additionally, **limited resources** can force managers to make compromises that conflict with their ethical beliefs. Scarcity of time, money, or personnel can lead to shortcuts or unethical practices to meet demands ([Bizfluent, n.d.](https://bizfluent.com/info-12296154-causes-ethical-dilemma-conducting-business.html)).

### Lack of Accountability and Poor Leadership

A lack of enforcement of ethical guidelines and poor leadership contribute to unethical behavior. When superiors ignore unethical actions or fail to hold employees accountable, managers may feel justified in bending rules, especially if doing so benefits their team or personal interests. This phenomenon is exacerbated when managers’ bonuses or evaluations are tied to team performance, creating a conflict of interest ([Bizfluent, n.d.](https://bizfluent.com/info-12296154-causes-ethical-dilemma-conducting-business.html); [Saraval Industries, 2019](https://www.saravalindustries.com/what-are-the-major-drivers-of-unethical-managerial-behavior/)).

Poor internal communication and lack of management support also foster environments where unethical behavior can flourish due to unclear expectations and insufficient ethical guidance ([Ethics Officers Association, n.d.](https://www.slideshare.net/arunvsriram/cause-of-unethical-behaviour-43247409)).

## Personal Gain and Motivations

### Profit, Prestige, and Power

Managers may engage in unethical behavior driven by **personal gain**, including financial incentives, prestige, and power. Some managers seek to increase their compensation through unethical means, such as manipulating financial results or taking undue credit for others’ work. Others pursue promotions or enhanced status within the organization by demonstrating results, even if achieved unethically ([Saraval Industries, 2019](https://www.saravalindustries.com/what-are-the-major-drivers-of-unethical-managerial-behavior/)).

The desire for power can also motivate unethical actions, especially when managers use their authority to punish or reward employees unfairly to assert control or prove a point ([Saraval Industries, 2019](https://www.saravalindustries.com/what-are-the-major-drivers-of-unethical-managerial-behavior/)).

### Ambition and Greed

Ambition and greed are fundamental drivers of unethical behavior. Managers may prioritize their career advancement or financial gain over ethical considerations. Such self-interest can override moral reflection, especially when organizational cultures implicitly reward results regardless of the means ([Slideshare, n.d.](https://www.slideshare.net/arunvsriram/cause-of-unethical-behaviour-43247409)).

## Organizational Culture and Structural Variables

### Culture of Shared Values

An organization’s culture significantly influences managerial behavior. A culture lacking in shared ethical values or one that tolerates unethical practices can lead managers to rationalize unethical decisions as normative or necessary. Conversely, strong ethical cultures guide managerial decisions and shape employee behavior positively ([Coursehero, n.d.](https://www.coursehero.com/file/p675li6/35-Factors-That-Determine-Ethical-and-Unethical-Behavior-cont-Lets-have-a-game/)).

### Reward and Recognition Systems

The presence or absence of reward systems aligned with ethical behavior is critical. Organizations that recognize and reward ethical conduct encourage managers to uphold standards. Conversely, when rewards are tied solely to performance metrics without ethical considerations, managers may feel incentivized to compromise ethics for results ([UK Essays, n.d.](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/business/factors-in-the-failure-of-ethics-management-business-essay.php)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Managers act against their own ethical values primarily due to a complex interplay of psychological mechanisms, organizational pressures, and personal motivations. The psychological need to resolve moral dissonance through rationalization allows managers to maintain a positive self-image despite unethical actions. Organizational factors such as intense performance pressures, conflicting values, poor leadership, and lack of accountability exacerbate this tendency. Additionally, personal ambitions for profit, prestige, and power further motivate unethical behavior.

To mitigate such conflicts, organizations must foster strong ethical cultures, enforce accountability, and align reward systems with ethical behavior. Training managers to recognize ethical dilemmas and equipping them with decision-making frameworks can reduce reliance on rationalization. Ultimately, understanding these drivers is essential for designing interventions that promote ethical managerial conduct and protect organizational integrity.
