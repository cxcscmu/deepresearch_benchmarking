# Why Might Managers Do Things That Conflict with Their Own Ethical Values?  
## A Comprehensive Analysis

---

### Introduction

Managers often face complex situations where their decisions impact various stakeholders, including employees, customers, shareholders, and society at large. Despite personal ethical values, managers may engage in behaviors or decisions that conflict with these values. Understanding why this occurs is crucial for organizations aiming to foster ethical cultures and prevent misconduct. This report explores the multifaceted reasons behind such conflicts, drawing on empirical cases, psychological insights, organizational dynamics, and ethical theories.

### 1. Pressure to Achieve Results and Conflicting Obligations

Managers operate under multiple pressures: meeting performance goals, adhering to company policies, satisfying customer needs, and following directives from superiors. These often conflicting demands create ethical dilemmas, where managers must weigh short-term results against long-term ethical considerations.

- **Performance Pressure:** The intense pressure to deliver results can lead managers to prioritize outcomes over ethical processes. For example, a sales manager might resort to questionable sales tactics to meet targets, despite personal reservations ([Techwalla](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-an-ethical-dilemma-in-conducting-business)).

- **Conflicting Obligations:** Managers must balance company vision, ethical codes, and stakeholder interests. When these conflict, ethical values may be compromised to satisfy immediate business needs or superior directives ([New Era Management](https://www.neweramanagement.com/)).

### 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis and Rationalization

Managers often engage in a cost-benefit analysis that weighs the risks and benefits of unethical actions. When the perceived benefits (e.g., profits, market share) outweigh the costs (e.g., legal penalties, reputational damage), managers might justify unethical behavior.

- **Ford Pinto Case:** Ford’s leadership knowingly accepted the risk of injury due to a design flaw because maintaining the production schedule was deemed more beneficial than the cost of potential lawsuits ([Techwalla](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-an-ethical-dilemma-in-conducting-business)).

- **Rationalizations:** Saul W. Gellerman (1986) identifies four common rationalizations that managers use to justify unethical conduct:
  1. Belief that the activity is not “really” illegal or immoral.
  2. Belief that it is in the individual’s or corporation’s best interests.
  3. Belief that it will never be discovered.
  4. Belief that the company will condone or protect such behavior ([Gellerman, 1986](https://hbr.org/1986/07/why-good-managers-make-bad-ethical-choices)).

These rationalizations create cognitive dissonance relief, allowing managers to act against their ethical values without feeling personal guilt.

### 3. Organizational Culture and Incentive Structures

The culture and reward systems within organizations significantly influence managerial behavior.

- **Misaligned Incentives:** When rewards focus solely on short-term metrics like profit or market penetration, managers may feel compelled to cut corners or engage in unethical practices to meet targets. The Wells Fargo scandal exemplifies this, where employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts due to pressure from unrealistic sales goals ([Sinek, 2021](https://www.shortform.com/blog/simon-sinek-ethical-fading/)).

- **Lack of Accountability:** Managers may act unethically if superiors overlook or tacitly approve such behavior, especially when personal bonuses are tied to team performance. This “ignorance is bliss” phenomenon reduces enforcement of ethical codes ([Techwalla](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-an-ethical-dilemma-in-conducting-business)).

- **Ethical Fading:** Simon Sinek (2021) describes ethical fading as a gradual erosion of ethical standards due to poorly designed incentives, rationalization, and reliance on impersonal structures rather than enlightened leadership. This leads to a toxic environment where unethical behavior becomes normalized ([Sinek, 2021](https://www.shortform.com/blog/simon-sinek-ethical-fading/)).

### 4. Conflicting Values and Limited Resources

Ethical dilemmas often arise from conflicting values within organizations or limited resources forcing difficult choices.

- **Conflicting Values:** Different managers may prioritize values such as quality versus cost-saving, leading to compromises that conflict with personal ethics. For example, choosing a cheaper supplier may save money but reduce product quality, harming customers ([Techwalla](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-an-ethical-dilemma-in-conducting-business)).

- **Limited Resources:** Scarce resources can force managers to make decisions that leave some stakeholders disadvantaged, such as promoting one employee over another equally qualified candidate. This can cause moral conflict and ethical compromise ([Techwalla](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-an-ethical-dilemma-in-conducting-business)).

---

### 5. Psychological and Social Factors

- **Rationalization and Self-Deception:** Managers often use euphemisms, blame systems or customers, and minimize the perceived harm of their actions to justify unethical behavior ([Sinek, 2021](https://www.shortform.com/blog/simon-sinek-ethical-fading/)).

- **Fear of Retaliation:** Employees and managers may fear losing their jobs or damaging their careers if they resist unethical directives or report misconduct ([Ethics and Compliance Initiative, 2020](https://www.ethics.org/resources/free-toolkit/)).

- **Groupthink and Echo Chambers:** Leaders surrounded by like-minded subordinates may fail to see ethical issues, reinforcing unethical decisions ([McLaverty & McKee, 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/01/what-you-can-do-to-improve-ethics-at-your-company)).

### 6. Case Studies Illustrating Managerial Ethical Conflicts

| Case Study               | Ethical Conflict                                    | Causes and Rationalizations                                   | Outcome                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Manville Corporation** | Concealed asbestos risks to save costs             | Cost-benefit analysis, company condonation, rationalization    | Bankruptcy, lawsuits, loss of trust          |
| **Continental Illinois Bank** | Risky loans to meet growth targets               | Ambitious goals, neglect of controls, lack of oversight        | Insolvency, government bailout               |
| **E.F. Hutton**          | Fraudulent use of uncollected funds                 | Rationalization, belief of company condonation                 | Guilty plea, fines, reputational damage      |
| **Wells Fargo**          | Fake accounts to meet sales targets                  | Misaligned incentives, pressure to perform, ethical fading     | Scandal, fines, leadership changes           |

These cases demonstrate how external pressures, organizational culture, and rationalizations lead managers to act against their own ethical values ([Gellerman, 1986](https://hbr.org/1986/07/why-good-managers-make-bad-ethical-choices); [Sinek, 2021](https://www.shortform.com/blog/simon-sinek-ethical-fading/)).

### 7. The Role of Leadership and Tone at the Top

Strong ethical leadership is critical in preventing ethical conflicts.

- **Tone from the Top:** Organizations with leaders who visibly commit to ethics experience significantly less pressure on employees to bend rules ([Ethics and Compliance Initiative, 2020](https://www.ethics.org/resources/free-toolkit/)).

- **Accountability and Enforcement:** Ethical codes and policies are ineffective without enforcement by authorized personnel. Leaders must actively monitor and sanction unethical behavior ([Techwalla](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-an-ethical-dilemma-in-conducting-business)).

- **Encouraging Ethical Courage:** Managers must be encouraged and supported to speak up against unethical practices without fear of retaliation ([McLaverty & McKee, 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/01/what-you-can-do-to-improve-ethics-at-your-company)).

### Conclusion and Opinion

Managers may act against their own ethical values due to a complex interplay of external pressures, organizational culture, incentive structures, psychological rationalizations, and leadership failures. The predominant driver is often the pressure to achieve short-term results within environments that reward outcomes over ethical processes. Rationalizations and a lack of accountability further enable such behavior.

To mitigate these conflicts, organizations must:

- Design incentive systems that reward ethical behavior and long-term success.
- Foster a culture of shared values and ethical awareness.
- Ensure strong ethical leadership and enforcement mechanisms.
- Provide safe channels for reporting unethical conduct.
- Encourage self-reflection among managers about the broader impact of their decisions.

Only by addressing these root causes can organizations reduce the frequency with which managers compromise their ethical values.
