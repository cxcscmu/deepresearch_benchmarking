# Causes of IPO Underpricing: New Evidence from China’s SME Market

Initial Public Offering (IPO) underpricing, the phenomenon where the IPO offer price is set below the market price on the first day of trading, has been a widely observed anomaly in global capital markets. However, this phenomenon is particularly pronounced in China’s market, especially among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This report provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the causes of IPO underpricing in China’s SME market, drawing on recent empirical evidence and policy reforms, particularly the transition from an approval-based to a registration-based IPO system.

## Introduction

IPO underpricing represents a significant cost to issuing firms, as it implies leaving substantial money “on the table” that could otherwise be raised for corporate development. In China, IPO underpricing has historically been extraordinarily severe. For instance, Qian et al. (2021) documented an average underpricing of 170% in China during 1990-2018, compared to only 16.8% in the United States ([Li & Li, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102623)). This vast discrepancy has attracted considerable academic and regulatory attention.

The Chinese IPO market has undergone significant reforms, most notably the transition from an approval-based IPO system to a registration-based system. This reform aimed to make the IPO process more market-oriented and efficient. However, recent studies reveal that while some aspects of the IPO market have improved, the reform has not unequivocally reduced IPO underpricing and may have even exacerbated it in certain contexts ([Li & Li, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102623); [Zhou, Zhou & Lu, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/su132011365)).

## Background: IPO Underpricing and Regulatory Environment in China

### Approval-Based IPO System and Its Constraints

The traditional approval-based IPO system in China imposed two major constraints:

1. **Selective IPO Approval:** Firms could only go public if regulators deemed them to perform well, purportedly to protect retail investors. This led to an imbalance between IPO supply and demand, artificially limiting the number of firms able to list domestically.

2. **Mechanical Pricing Rule:** IPO offer prices were set using a rigid 23-times Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio rule, which did not reflect market demand or firm fundamentals adequately.

These constraints contributed to severe IPO underpricing by creating artificial scarcity and suppressing offer prices, incentivizing speculative demand in the aftermarket. High-potential firms often chose to list overseas, as seen with Alibaba and Tencent, due to these restrictions ([Li & Li, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102623)).

### Market-Oriented IPO Reforms

In recent years, China introduced a registration-based IPO system, which:

- Removed the prior approval requirement, allowing firms to list if they meet disclosure and regulatory requirements.
- Allowed market forces to play a greater role in IPO pricing, moving away from the fixed PE multiple.

The reform aimed to increase IPO supply, improve pricing efficiency, and reduce underpricing. However, empirical evidence shows mixed outcomes.

## Empirical Evidence on Causes of IPO Underpricing in China’s SME Market

### 1. Regulatory Impact on Underpricing

Several studies have linked IPO underpricing in China to regulatory factors:

- **Heavy-Handed Regulations:** Cheung et al. (2009) found that IPO underpricing decreased during 1992-2006, a period marked by gradual market-oriented reforms in IPO pricing, suggesting that stringent regulations were a key driver of underpricing.

- **Supply Scarcity and Price Caps:** Tian (2011) argued that scarcity of IPO supply and price caps were critical in driving underpricing, as limited IPO opportunities heightened demand and suppressed offer prices.

- **Policy Fluctuations:** Deng et al. (2021) documented that initial returns dropped from 130% (1999-2009) to 37% (2009-2012) when the IPO market was fully marketized, but rebounded to over 300% after 2014 due to stricter IPO restrictions.

These findings highlight that regulatory environment and IPO policy shifts significantly influence underpricing levels.

### 2. Effect of Registration-Based IPO Reform

Using difference-in-differences methodology, Li and Li (2021) analyzed the impact of the registration-based reform specifically on the ChiNext market (China’s SME-focused board). Their key findings include:

| Metric                         | Before Reform | After Reform | Change          |
|-------------------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Number of IPOs                 | 68            | 152          | +124%           |
| Average Price-to-Book (PB) Ratio | 2.16          | 2.47         | +14.4%          |
| Average Price-to-Earnings (PE) Ratio | 21.93         | 29.08        | +32.6%          |
| Average Net Proceeds Raised (million RMB) | 469           | 725          | +54.6%          |

Despite these improvements in pricing relative to fundamentals and proceeds raised, the reform **did not reduce underpricing**. In fact, the estimated net effect on initial returns (underpricing) was significantly positive (coefficient 0.9469, t-value 2.92), indicating an **increase** in underpricing post-reform ([Li & Li, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102623)).

### 3. Speculation and Market Sentiment

The registration-based reform, by relaxing IPO constraints and increasing supply, may have inadvertently amplified speculative trading in newly listed stocks. This heightened speculation can inflate aftermarket prices, increasing underpricing measures despite better pricing mechanisms.

Furthermore, IPO policy changes signal regulatory attitudes, which influence market-wide sentiment and speculator behavior. This dynamic complicates the relationship between policy reforms and underpricing ([Li & Li, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102623)).

### 4. Other Contributing Factors

- **Information Asymmetry:** Underpricing compensates investors for information asymmetry between insiders and the market.

- **Underwriter Certification Role:** Studies (Su & Bangassa, 2011; Su & Brookfield, 2013) suggest underwriters’ reputation and certification can mitigate underpricing by reducing information asymmetry.

- **Market Sentiment and Investor Attention:** Sentiment traders and investor attention spikes can drive initial returns higher (Clarke et al., 2016).

- **IPO Supply-Demand Imbalance:** Artificial scarcity of IPOs under approval-based system increased demand pressure, fueling underpricing (Tian, 2011).

## Discussion: Interpretation and Implications

The evidence from China’s SME market indicates that IPO underpricing is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by regulatory frameworks, market mechanisms, and investor behavior.

- The **approval-based system** created artificial scarcity and rigid pricing, directly causing severe underpricing.

- The **registration-based reform** improved pricing efficiency and increased proceeds for firms but did **not reduce underpricing**; it may have even increased it due to amplified speculation.

- **Speculation and sentiment** are critical drivers of underpricing in the post-reform environment, suggesting that market forces alone do not guarantee efficient pricing.

- The reform’s positive impact on firm financing (higher offer prices relative to book value and earnings, more proceeds) indicates progress towards a more market-oriented IPO system.

- However, **regulators should be cautious** about the speculative risks introduced by deregulation and consider complementary measures to stabilize aftermarket pricing.

## Conclusion

IPO underpricing in China’s SME market is primarily caused by regulatory constraints that distort supply and pricing, information asymmetry, and speculative investor behavior. The shift from an approval-based to a registration-based IPO system has increased IPO supply, improved pricing relative to fundamentals, and enhanced firms’ capital raising ability. Nevertheless, this reform has not mitigated underpricing; instead, it may have exacerbated it by fostering speculation.

Therefore, while market-oriented reforms are necessary for sustainable equity market development, they must be accompanied by regulatory oversight targeting speculative behavior and enhanced transparency to truly reduce IPO underpricing.
