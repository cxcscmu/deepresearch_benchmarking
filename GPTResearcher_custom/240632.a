## Overview of the School Bus Driver Shortage

School bus drivers are essential to the daily operation of K-12 education, with approximately 55% of all K-12 students (about 25 million children) relying on school buses for transportation annually. The U.S. has roughly 500,000 school buses, operated by both public school districts (60%) and private contractors (40%) ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/)).

Despite the critical role they play, school bus driver shortages have become a chronic issue, traditionally peaking at the start of each school year. However, the severity of the shortage in recent years, especially post-pandemic, is unprecedented. Surveys indicate that around 81% of school districts report difficulty in recruiting enough drivers, with over half describing the shortage as “severe” or “desperate” ([Kamenetz, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033105004/national-survey-finds-severe-and-desperate-school-bus-driver-shortage)).

## Causes of the School Bus Driver Shortage

The shortage is driven by a combination of structural, economic, demographic, and pandemic-related factors, which are detailed below.

### 1. **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**

- **Health Risks and Retirements:** The pandemic has disproportionately affected older workers, who make up a large portion of school bus drivers. The average school bus driver is 56 years old, significantly older than the median U.S. worker. Older drivers face higher COVID-19 mortality risks and many have retired early or left the profession due to health concerns ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/); [Deliso, 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-districts-nationwide-facing-bus-driver-shortages/story?id=79335687)).

- **Furloughs and Job Changes:** During school closures in 2020, many drivers were furloughed or laid off. With schools shifting to remote learning, demand for bus drivers plummeted, prompting many to seek other employment opportunities, some of which offer better pay or more stable hours ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com/why-is-there-a-school-bus-driver-shortage-in-the-us-5189247)).

- **Vaccination and Safety Concerns:** Drivers are concerned about safety given that children under 12 were initially ineligible for vaccination, and buses are enclosed spaces with higher transmission risks. This has led to voluntary resignations and reluctance to return to work ([Kamenetz, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033105004/national-survey-finds-severe-and-desperate-school-bus-driver-shortage)).

### 2. **Low Wages and Poor Working Conditions**

- **Inadequate Compensation:** The median hourly wage for school bus drivers nationally is approximately $16.80, with some states paying less than $12 per hour. Annual earnings are low due to the seasonal nature of the job (about 180 school days per year), lack of pay during summers and holidays, and absence of benefits such as paid time off ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/); [American Bus Sales, 2021](https://www.americanbussales.com/blog/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-school-bus-drivers/)).

- **Split Shifts and Limited Hours:** Drivers typically work split shifts (morning and afternoon), which complicates holding second jobs or side hustles. The short daily hours and inconsistent schedule reduce the job’s attractiveness ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/)).

- **Job Stress:** Drivers face behavioral challenges from students, including bullying and vandalism, and often perform unpaid duties such as cleaning buses, adding to job dissatisfaction ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/)).

### 3. **Licensing and Training Barriers**

- **Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) Requirements:** New drivers must obtain a CDL, a process that can take up to 12 weeks and cost thousands of dollars. During the pandemic, many Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices closed or limited services, delaying licensing and renewal processes ([Kamenetz, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033105004/national-survey-finds-severe-and-desperate-school-bus-driver-shortage)).

- **Experience Requirements:** Many employers prefer drivers with prior experience, limiting entry for new applicants. This creates a bottleneck in recruitment ([American Bus Sales, 2021](https://www.americanbussales.com/blog/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-school-bus-drivers/)).

### 4. **Competition from Other Industries**

- **Higher Paying Driving Jobs:** Drivers’ skills are transferable to other driving jobs, such as truck driving or delivery services, which often offer higher wages and year-round employment. For example, Amazon offers $16.50+ per hour for delivery drivers, compared to starting wages of $14.57 per hour for some school bus drivers ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/)).

- **Gig Economy Appeal:** Some drivers prefer gig economy jobs like Amazon Flex for flexible schedules and consistent pay, despite additional costs for vehicle maintenance ([Crockett, 2021](https://thehustle.co/why-america-has-a-school-bus-driver-shortage/)).

### 5. **Labor Market and Demographic Trends**

- **Reduced Labor Force Participation:** The U.S. labor force has contracted due to over 700,000 COVID-19 deaths, early retirements, and ongoing health concerns. Many potential drivers have not re-entered the workforce ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com/why-is-there-a-school-bus-driver-shortage-in-the-us-5189247)).

- **Non-Unionized Jobs:** Many school bus driver positions are non-unionized, limiting collective bargaining power for better wages and benefits ([Oberoi, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com/why-is-there-a-school-bus-driver-shortage-in-the-us-5189247)).

## Consequences of the Shortage

- **Disrupted Transportation:** Many districts have reduced or suspended bus routes, leaving thousands of students without reliable transportation. For example, Savannah-Chatham County Public School System in Georgia was down over 30% of needed drivers, affecting 5,000 students ([Deliso, 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-districts-nationwide-facing-bus-driver-shortages/story?id=79335687)).

- **Increased Burden on Families:** Parents are forced to arrange alternative transportation, which may be impractical for working families.

- **Safety Concerns:** Alternative transportation methods may not be as safe as school buses, which are designed with child safety in mind ([Deliso, 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/US/school-districts-nationwide-facing-bus-driver-shortages/story?id=79335687)).

## Conclusion

The shortage of school bus drivers in the U.S. is a complex issue rooted in structural labor market challenges, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Low wages, poor working conditions, licensing hurdles, and competition from other industries have collectively contributed to a workforce crisis that threatens the safe and reliable transportation of millions of schoolchildren. While short-term measures such as pay increases and recruitment drives offer some relief, sustainable solutions require systemic changes in compensation, working conditions, and regulatory frameworks. Without addressing these underlying causes, the shortage is likely to persist, posing ongoing challenges for education systems and families nationwide.
