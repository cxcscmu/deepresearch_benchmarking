## Overview of the School Bus Driver Shortage

School bus drivers are a critical component of the U.S. education system, facilitating the daily transportation of approximately 55% of K-12 students, which translates to about 25 million children annually (Crockett, 2021). The nation’s 13,800 school districts collectively spend around $22 billion per year on student transportation, underscoring the scale and importance of this sector (Crockett, 2021).

Historically, school bus driver shortages have been a recurring issue, typically peaking at the start of each school year. However, the shortage intensified dramatically in 2020 and 2021, reaching crisis levels in many regions. Some districts report having 30% to 50% fewer drivers than needed, forcing drastic measures such as route suspensions, hiring of non-traditional drivers (e.g., teachers and coaches), and even deployment of National Guard personnel to operate buses (Crockett, 2021; Deliso, 2021).

## Key Causes of the Shortage

### 1. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The pandemic triggered widespread school closures and a shift to remote learning in 2020, which led to the furlough or layoff of many school bus drivers. With schools closed, demand for bus drivers plummeted, and many drivers sought alternative employment in other sectors. When in-person learning resumed, districts struggled to rehire these drivers, many of whom had permanently left the profession (Macysyn, 2021; Oberoi, 2021).

Additionally, health concerns related to COVID-19, especially with the emergence of variants and the lack of vaccination for children under 12, have made some drivers reluctant to return to work due to safety fears (WeAreTeachers, 2021).

### 2. Low Wages and Seasonal Employment

A structural issue predating the pandemic is the relatively low pay for school bus drivers. The median annual salary is approximately $35,421, with hourly wages averaging around $16, which is often insufficient to attract or retain workers, especially when compared to other driving jobs such as truck driving, which offer higher wages and more consistent work (American Bus Sales, 2021; NPR, 2021; Oberoi, 2021).

Moreover, school bus driving is a seasonal job tied to the academic calendar, resulting in periods without pay during school breaks. This lack of year-round income stability discourages many potential drivers from entering or remaining in the field (Oberoi, 2021).

### 3. Lengthy and Complex Hiring Process

New hires must obtain a commercial driver’s license (CDL), which requires passing road tests and meeting regulatory requirements. The pandemic caused many Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs) to reduce hours or close temporarily, delaying licensing and road tests. This bottleneck has slowed the onboarding of new drivers significantly (Macysyn, 2021; WeAreTeachers, 2021).

### 4. Competition from Other Driving Jobs

The skill set of school bus drivers overlaps with other commercial driving roles, such as truck driving and delivery services. These alternative jobs often offer higher wages, better benefits, and more hours, attracting potential and former school bus drivers away from the profession (Oberoi, 2021).

### 5. Workforce Demographics and Retirements

Some drivers retired during the pandemic or chose to leave the profession due to health risks and job dissatisfaction. The aging workforce and lack of younger replacements exacerbate the shortage (Macysyn, 2021; WeAreTeachers, 2021).

## Regional and National Impacts

The shortage has led to widespread disruptions in student transportation:

- **Route Suspensions:** Some districts, like those in Metro Detroit, have suspended bus routes due to lack of drivers (WeAreTeachers, 2021).
- **Alternative Transportation:** Schools have resorted to hiring party buses or asking teachers and coaches to drive buses (Crockett, 2021).
- **Financial Incentives:** Some districts offer families payments to opt out of bus service to reduce demand (Crockett, 2021).
- **Government Intervention:** Governors in Massachusetts deployed National Guard members to drive buses; similar measures are planned in Ohio and South Carolina (Crockett, 2021).

These measures highlight the severity of the crisis and its impact on families, students, and school operations.

## Structural vs. Pandemic-Driven Factors

While the pandemic has intensified the shortage, the underlying structural problems are critical to understanding its persistence:

| Factor                      | Structural Problem | Pandemic-Driven Problem |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Low wages                   | Yes                | Exacerbated             |
| Seasonal employment         | Yes                | No                     |
| Licensing delays            | No                 | Yes                    |
| Health and safety concerns  | No                 | Yes                    |
| Competition from other jobs | Yes                | Exacerbated             |
| Driver retirements          | Yes                | Increased               |
| Furloughs and layoffs       | No                 | Yes                    |

The pandemic acted as a catalyst that magnified pre-existing issues, making the shortage more acute and widespread.

## Outlook and Potential Solutions

### When Will the Shortage Improve?

Experts suggest that improvement depends on both pandemic control and addressing structural issues. Increased COVID-19 vaccinations and easing of health concerns may encourage some drivers to return. However, without addressing low wages and job conditions, the shortage is likely to persist (Oberoi, 2021).

### Recommended Measures

- **Increase Compensation:** Raising wages and offering year-round employment opportunities could attract and retain drivers.
- **Streamline Licensing:** Expanding DMV hours and simplifying CDL acquisition processes would reduce hiring delays.
- **Improve Working Conditions:** Unionization and better benefits may improve job satisfaction.
- **Recruitment Campaigns:** Multi-agency efforts targeting licensed drivers and offering incentives can help fill vacancies.
- **Alternative Staffing:** Temporary use of non-traditional drivers (e.g., teachers) can mitigate short-term shortages.

## Conclusion

The shortage of school bus drivers in the U.S. is a multifaceted problem rooted in structural challenges such as low pay, seasonal employment, and competition from other driving jobs, which the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated. The shortage has reached crisis levels in many districts, disrupting student transportation and forcing emergency measures. While pandemic-related factors may ease with time, sustainable solutions require addressing the fundamental issues of compensation, working conditions, and hiring processes. Without these changes, the shortage is likely to remain a persistent challenge for the education system.
