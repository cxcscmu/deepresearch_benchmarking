# Strategic Management: Involvement of Long-Term and Short-Term Activities

Strategic management is a critical discipline within business administration, encompassing a broad spectrum of activities aimed at guiding an organization toward its goals. A fundamental question often posed is whether strategic management involves long-term or short-term activities. Based on an extensive review of contemporary literature and authoritative sources, this report provides a detailed, comprehensive, and nuanced answer to this question. The analysis reveals that strategic management inherently involves both long-term and short-term activities, which are interdependent and essential for organizational success.

## Defining Strategic Management

Strategic management is broadly defined as the process by which organizations formulate, implement, and evaluate decisions that enable them to achieve long-term objectives and sustain competitive advantage. According to the Association of Strategic Planning (ASP), strategic management includes continuous planning, executing, monitoring, analyzing, and assessing activities necessary to meet organizational goals and objectives aligned with a future direction (LBL Strategies Team, 2017). It integrates decision-making processes that have wide ramifications and a long time perspective, involving the effective use of resources to respond to opportunities and threats in a changing environment (Johnson, Scholes, & Whittington, 2010).

## Long-Term Activities in Strategic Management

### Nature and Scope

Long-term activities in strategic management focus on setting the vision, mission, and overarching goals that define where the organization wants to be in the future, typically looking three to five years ahead, and in some cases extending up to 25 years for large corporations with stable environments (Gleeson, 2019). These activities involve:

- **Strategic Planning and Formulation:** Developing a roadmap based on extensive analysis of external factors such as market trends, competition, political and economic conditions, and internal capabilities (Gleeson, 2019; DifferenceBetween, 2011).
- **Setting Long-Term Objectives:** These objectives are complex, tactical, and aligned with the company’s mission and vision, often involving significant capital expenditures, market expansion, product development, and brand positioning (Indeed Career Advice, n.d.; DifferenceBetween, 2011).
- **Strategic Decision Making:** Long-term goals guide strategic decisions that shape the company’s direction, such as sustainability initiatives, innovation, and competitive positioning (SmallBusiness.Chron, 2019).

### Importance of Long-Term Focus

Long-term strategic management ensures organizational stability, growth, and sustainability. It allows companies to anticipate future challenges and opportunities, align resources effectively, and maintain a competitive edge. However, it requires balancing visionary goals with practical benchmarks to avoid losing sight of immediate operational needs (Gleeson, 2019).

## Short-Term Activities in Strategic Management

### Nature and Scope

Short-term activities in strategic management concentrate on immediate or near-term concerns, typically within a one-year timeframe. These activities include:

- **Operational and Tactical Planning:** Addressing day-to-day operations, resource allocation, and problem-solving related to internal issues such as employee training, customer complaints, and equipment maintenance (DifferenceBetween, 2011; Ceopedia, 2017).
- **Setting Short-Term Objectives:** These are straightforward, measurable goals aimed at improving financial performance, cash flow, productivity, and other operational metrics that support long-term strategies (BizFluent, n.d.; Indeed Career Advice, n.d.).
- **Performance Monitoring and Adjustment:** Short-term plans involve continuous evaluation and adjustments to ensure alignment with long-term goals, including quarterly financial targets and operational benchmarks (Gleeson, 2019; SmallBusiness.Chron, 2019).

### Role in Strategic Management

Short-term activities serve as stepping stones toward achieving long-term objectives. They provide the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing environments and ensure that the organization remains on track through frequent reviews and tactical adjustments (DifferenceBetween, 2011). Short-term planning also mitigates risks by addressing immediate threats and operational inefficiencies.

## Interrelationship Between Long-Term and Short-Term Activities

Strategic management is not exclusively long-term or short-term but a dynamic integration of both. The relationship can be summarized as follows:

| Aspect                     | Long-Term Activities                                  | Short-Term Activities                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Time Horizon**           | Typically 3-5 years, up to 25 years in some cases  | Less than 1 year, often quarterly or monthly         |
| **Focus**                  | Vision, mission, strategic goals, market positioning| Operational efficiency, immediate problem-solving   |
| **Complexity**             | Complex, tactical, broad                             | Straightforward, specific, tactical                   |
| **Examples**               | Market expansion, brand building, capital investment| Cash flow management, employee training, quality control |
| **Role in Strategy**       | Defines direction and long-term success             | Implements and supports long-term strategy           |
| **Flexibility**            | Less flexible, requires consensus                    | Highly flexible, requires frequent adjustments       |

The long-term strategic plan sets the direction and defines the desired future state of the organization. Short-term plans break down this vision into actionable steps and milestones, ensuring progress is measurable and manageable (Gleeson, 2019; DifferenceBetween, 2011). Without short-term planning, long-term strategies risk becoming disconnected from operational realities, while short-term planning without a long-term vision may lead to a lack of direction.

## Strategic Management Phases and the Emphasis on Long-Term Objectives

The strategic management process typically includes phases such as environmental assessment, strategy formulation, strategic planning, implementation, and performance management (LBL Strategies Team, 2017). Long-term objectives are especially critical during the **formulation phase**, where the organization defines its vision and strategic goals (Study.com, n.d.). Subsequent phases translate these long-term objectives into tactical and operational plans, emphasizing the importance of integrating both time horizons.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Balancing Short-Term Pressures and Long-Term Vision

One of the key challenges in strategic management is managing the tension between short-term pressures, such as quarterly financial results demanded by boards and investors, and the pursuit of long-term strategic goals (Gleeson, 2019). Companies that focus excessively on short-term gains risk undermining their long-term viability, while those that ignore short-term realities may fail to execute their strategies effectively.

### Adaptability and Continuous Monitoring

Given the dynamic nature of business environments, strategic management requires continuous monitoring and the ability to revise plans as necessary. This involves setting mid-term benchmarks and integrating feedback loops that connect short-term performance with long-term objectives (Gleeson, 2019; DifferenceBetween, 2011).

## Conclusion

Strategic management inherently involves both long-term and short-term activities. Long-term activities focus on setting the vision, mission, and strategic goals that define the future direction of the organization, typically spanning three to five years or more. Short-term activities break down these strategic goals into actionable, measurable steps that address immediate operational needs and facilitate progress toward long-term objectives.

The integration of long-term and short-term planning is essential for effective strategic management. Short-term plans serve as the tactical means to achieve long-term goals, while long-term strategies provide the necessary direction and stability. Successful strategic management balances these horizons, ensuring adaptability, resource alignment, and sustained competitive advantage.
