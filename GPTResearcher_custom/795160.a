Drawing upon multiple trusted historical sources, this report aims to provide a comprehensive, well-structured, and factual account of her escape from slavery, supported by relevant data and contextual information.

## Early Life and Enslavement

Isabella Baumfree was born into slavery on the estate of Colonel Johannes Hardenbergh in Swartekill, Ulster County, New York. Her parents, Elizabeth and James Baumfree, were slaves, and she had approximately 10 to 12 siblings ([Pettinger, 2016](https://www.biographyonline.net/people/sojourner-truth.html); [KidsKonnect, 2019](https://kidskonnect.com/people/sojourner-truth/)).

At the age of 9, after the death of her first master, Charles Hardenbergh, Isabella was sold at auction to John Neely for $100, a price that included a herd of sheep. She only spoke Dutch until this point and was severely beaten for not understanding English commands. She was sold multiple times thereafter, enduring harsh treatment and abuse, including physical violence and sexual assault ([World History Edu, 2021](https://worldhistoryedu.com/major-facts-about-sojourner-truth/)).

## Context of Slavery Abolition in New York

New York State began legislating the abolition of slavery starting in 1799, with full emancipation scheduled for July 4, 1827. However, this emancipation was gradual and did not immediately free all enslaved people. Many were required to serve as bound servants until their mid-twenties ([SoftSchools, n.d.](https://www.softschools.com/timelines/sojourner_truth_timeline/57/)).

Isabella’s last owner, John Dumont, promised to free her on July 4, 1826, a year before the official emancipation date, conditional on her good behavior. However, after she suffered a hand injury that reduced her productivity, Dumont reneged on this promise ([KidsKonnect, 2019](https://kidskonnect.com/people/sojourner-truth/)).

## The Escape: Circumstances and Execution

### Decision to Escape

Feeling betrayed by Dumont’s broken promise and restless for freedom, Isabella made the decision to escape slavery. On an early morning in 1826, she left Dumont’s estate with her infant daughter, Sophia. She did not run away impulsively but walked away, believing it was the right thing to do, reflecting her strong moral and religious convictions ([KidsKonnect, 2019](https://kidskonnect.com/people/sojourner-truth/); [Pettinger, 2016](https://www.biographyonline.net/people/sojourner-truth.html)).

### Seeking Refuge

After escaping, Isabella wandered and prayed for direction. She eventually found refuge with Isaac and Maria Van Wagenen, an abolitionist family who lived nearby. When Dumont came to reclaim her and her infant daughter, she refused to leave. The Van Wagenens paid Dumont $20 to secure her freedom. Isabella remained with the Van Wagenens until the state emancipation law took effect on July 4, 1827 ([KidsKonnect, 2019](https://kidskonnect.com/people/sojourner-truth/); [SoftSchools, n.d.](https://www.softschools.com/timelines/sojourner_truth_timeline/57/)).

### Legal Battle for Her Son

Despite New York’s emancipation, Isabella’s five-year-old son, Peter, had been illegally sold by Dumont to a slave owner in Alabama, where slavery was still deeply entrenched. With the assistance of the Van Wagenens, she took Dumont to court to recover her son. This legal battle lasted several months, but Isabella won, becoming the first black woman to win a court case against a white man. Peter was returned to her, marking a landmark victory in the fight against slavery and for African-American rights ([KidsKonnect, 2019](https://kidskonnect.com/people/sojourner-truth/); [SoftSchools, n.d.](https://www.softschools.com/timelines/sojourner_truth_timeline/57/)).
