# Are Diabetics Clinically Vulnerable? An In-Depth Analysis

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It affects millions worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The question of whether individuals with diabetes are clinically vulnerable—especially in the context of infectious diseases such as COVID-19—has been a critical concern for healthcare providers, policymakers, and patients alike. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the clinical vulnerability of people with diabetes, drawing from recent and authoritative sources.

## Defining Clinical Vulnerability in Diabetes

Clinical vulnerability refers to an increased risk of adverse health outcomes due to underlying medical conditions or risk factors. In the context of diabetes, vulnerability can manifest as a higher susceptibility to infections, complications, and poorer outcomes following illness.

The UK Government and Diabetes UK classify people with diabetes as “clinically vulnerable” but not necessarily “clinically extremely vulnerable” under COVID-19 guidance. This distinction has important implications for access to support and protective measures ([Diabetes UK, 2020](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news/coronavirus-new-guidance-response)).

## Diabetes and Increased Risk Factors

### COVID-19 and Diabetes

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of people with diabetes. Epidemiological data indicate that diabetes is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes:

- Prevalence of diabetes in severe COVID-19 cases ranges from 22.2% to 26.9%, compared to 11.6% in the general Chinese adult population ([Zhu et al., 2020](https://drc.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001343)).
- Patients with diabetes and severe COVID-19 are older, exhibit more severe inflammatory responses, and have higher rates of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality.
- The hazard ratio for mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 and diabetes was 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30), indicating a 53% increased risk of death compared to non-diabetic patients ([Zhu et al., 2020](https://drc.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001343)).

These findings underscore that diabetes, particularly when combined with other risk factors such as age, obesity, ethnicity, and poor glycemic control, elevates clinical vulnerability.

### Other Risk Factors Amplifying Vulnerability

- **Age:** Older adults with diabetes have compromised glucose counter-regulation and hormone responses, increasing risks of hypoglycemia and other complications ([Scarpellini et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475321004567)).
- **Obesity:** Each unit increase in BMI is associated with a 5-15% excess risk of severe COVID-19, and obesity often coexists with diabetes, compounding risk ([Ball, 2021](https://www.diabetesincontrol.com/ada-2021-are-patients-with-obesity-or-diabetes-at-increased-risk-for-severe-covid-19/)).
- **Ethnicity:** South Asian and African descent populations with diabetes show higher vulnerability to severe COVID-19 outcomes ([Ball, 2021](https://www.diabetesincontrol.com/ada-2021-are-patients-with-obesity-or-diabetes-at-increased-risk-for-severe-covid-19/)).
- **Glycemic Control:** Higher blood glucose levels correlate with increased risk of poorer outcomes in infections ([Diabetes UK, 2020](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news/coronavirus-new-guidance-response)).

## Clinical Guidelines and Vulnerability Recognition

### UK Government and Diabetes UK Guidance

The UK Government’s classification of clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) individuals includes those on dialysis and with stage 5 chronic kidney disease but excludes most people with diabetes, who are categorized as clinically vulnerable. Diabetes UK criticizes this as insufficient protection for many diabetics who have additional risk factors such as age, weight, ethnicity, and poor glycemic control ([Diabetes UK, 2020](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news/coronavirus-new-guidance-response)).

This exclusion has practical consequences:

- People with diabetes not classified as CEV may not access financial support if unable to work safely.
- They face the dilemma of risking health or livelihood.
- Diabetes UK urges the government to implement individualized risk assessments to identify high-risk diabetics for better support.

### Canadian and Australian Guidelines

- **Canada:** Diabetes Canada recommends screening every 3 years for individuals ≥40 years or younger with risk factors, emphasizing early detection to prevent complications ([Diabetes Canada, 2018](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines/diabetes)).
- **Australia:** The Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK) includes lifestyle and biomedical risk factors to identify vulnerability ([Australian Government Department of Health, n.d.](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mbsprimarycare_mbsitem_type2diabetes)).

These guidelines highlight the importance of tailored risk assessment and management, recognizing the heterogeneity in diabetes vulnerability.

## Diabetes Complications and Vulnerability

Diabetes is associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications that increase clinical vulnerability:

| Complication               | Impact on Vulnerability                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Diabetic Kidney Disease   | Increased risk of severe COVID-19; included in CEV category                                              |
| Diabetic Retinopathy      | May complicate overall health status                                                                    |
| Cardiovascular Disease    | Major contributor to morbidity and mortality; worsened by diabetes and hypoglycemia                      |
| Hypoglycemia              | Severe episodes increase risk of hospitalization and mortality, especially in older adults              |
| Malnutrition              | Underrecognized in diabetes, leading to poor healing and outcomes                                        |

These complications contribute to increased risk of hospitalization, poorer recovery, and mortality ([Diabetes Canada, 2018](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines/diabetes); [Scarpellini et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475321004567); [Independent Nurse, 2012](https://www.independentnurse.co.uk/clinical-article/diabetes-patients-at-risk-of-malnutrition/63547/)).

## Evidence-Based Diabetes Care and Clinical Vulnerability

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) in diabetes care aims to reduce practice variation and improve outcomes by integrating clinical expertise with the best available evidence.

- The American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides graded recommendations for diabetes care, emphasizing individualized treatment plans, especially for vulnerable populations such as older adults, children, and those with comorbidities ([Herman, 2002](https://diabetesjournals.org/clinical/article/20/1/22/751/Evidence-Based-Diabetes-Care); [ADA, 2016](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/39/Supplement_1/S4/28767/Standards-of-Medical-Care-in-Diabetes-2016-Summary)).
- Tailored strategies address food insecurity, cognitive dysfunction, mental illness, and disparities related to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, all factors influencing vulnerability ([ADA, 2016](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/39/Supplement_1/S4/28767/Standards-of-Medical-Care-in-Diabetes-2016-Summary)).

## Summary and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive evidence reviewed, it is clear that:

- **People with diabetes are clinically vulnerable**, with increased risk of severe illness and complications, particularly in infectious diseases like COVID-19.
- Vulnerability is **not uniform**; it is amplified by factors including age, obesity, ethnicity, glycemic control, and presence of diabetes-related complications.
- Current governmental classifications, such as in the UK, **do not fully capture the spectrum of vulnerability** among people with diabetes, potentially leaving many at risk without adequate support.
- **Individualized risk assessment tools** are essential to identify high-risk individuals within the diabetic population, enabling targeted interventions and protections.
- Evidence-based diabetes care models emphasize personalized management, addressing the multifaceted nature of vulnerability.

Therefore, diabetics should be considered clinically vulnerable, with recognition that a subset of this population—those with additional risk factors or complications—may warrant classification as clinically extremely vulnerable. This nuanced understanding should inform policy, clinical practice, and patient education to optimize outcomes and equity in care.
