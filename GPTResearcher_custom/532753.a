# Understanding Why Some People Are Transgender: A Comprehensive Review

The question of why some people are transgender has been the subject of extensive scientific, psychological, and sociocultural inquiry. Transgender individuals are those whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. This report synthesizes current research findings, emphasizing biological, psychological, and environmental factors, to provide a detailed and evidence-based understanding of transgender identity. The report also offers a reasoned perspective based on the available data.

## Biological Foundations of Gender Identity

### Evidence for a Biological Etiology

Recent scientific literature increasingly supports the view that gender identity has a biological basis. A comprehensive review by researchers at Boston University Medical Center concluded that current data suggest a biological etiology for transgender identity. This conclusion is drawn from studies examining disorders of sexual development (e.g., penile agenesis), neuroanatomical differences (grey and white matter variations), and genetic factors related to sex hormone receptors ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

Joshua D. Safer, MD, FACP, the corresponding author of the review, emphasized that this paper represents the first comprehensive scientific evidence that gender identity is a biological phenomenon. He advocates for medical providers to develop transgender medicine skills to improve care for transgender individuals ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

### Genetic and Hormonal Influences

Genetic studies suggest a mild to moderate effect on transgender development. For example, research by Vilain and colleagues (2009) points to genes associated with sex hormone receptors as potentially influential. Moreover, prenatal hormone exposure, especially fetal exposure to certain chemicals, has been linked to brain development patterns associated with gender role behavior ([American Psychological Association, 2013](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/biology)).

The endocrine system, particularly the hypothalamus, plays a crucial role in sexual development and differentiation. Hormones such as androgens, estrogens, and progestins influence human behavior but do not solely determine gender identity. Instead, the interaction of these hormones with brain structures is significant in shaping gender identity ([Samploon, n.d.](https://samploon.com/gender-identity-nature-or-nurture/)).

### Neuroanatomical Differences

Neuroimaging studies have identified structural brain differences between transgender and cisgender individuals. Differences in grey and white matter volumes and patterns have been observed, suggesting that brain anatomy may align more closely with experienced gender rather than natal sex. These findings support the biological underpinnings of gender identity ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

## Psychological and Environmental Factors

### Interaction of Nature and Nurture

While biology plays a significant role, environmental and social factors also contribute to the development of gender identity. Researchers acknowledge that both genetic and environmental variables may influence transgender development. For example, socialization, cultural norms, and family dynamics shape how individuals express and understand their gender ([American Psychological Association, 2013](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/biology); [R4 DN, 2021](https://r4dn.com/how-does-nurture-influence-gender-identity/)).

Children typically develop a sense of gender identity between ages two and four, influenced by both biological predispositions and social learning. Social factors include gender role expectations conveyed by family, peers, media, and broader cultural contexts ([R4 DN, 2021](https://r4dn.com/how-does-nurture-influence-gender-identity/)).

### Case Studies and Historical Evidence

The John/Joan case, a well-known example, involved a boy whose genitalia was damaged during circumcision and who was subsequently raised as a girl. Despite being nurtured in a female role, the individual later identified as male, suggesting that gender identity may be deeply rooted in biology rather than solely shaped by upbringing ([Samploon, n.d.](https://samploon.com/gender-identity-nature-or-nurture/)).

## Sociocultural Context and Medical Implications

### Resistance to Medical Care

Historically, medical care for transgender individuals, including hormonal and surgical treatments, faced resistance due to misconceptions that gender identity could be changed through psychiatric treatment. However, growing evidence of a biological basis is shifting perspectives, encouraging more affirming and medically appropriate care ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

### Benefits of Gender-Affirming Treatments

Studies indicate that transgender individuals who receive gender-affirming treatments, such as facial feminization surgery or hormone therapy, report improved psychosocial health and mental well-being. Adolescents who begin hormone therapy earlier tend to experience fewer psychological problems compared to those who start treatment in adulthood ([ScienceDaily, 2022](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/07/220706112317.htm); [LiveAbout, 2018](https://www.liveabout.com/what-causes-a-transgender-identity-1415725)).

## Reasoned Perspective

Based on the reviewed evidence, it is clear that transgender identity is predominantly rooted in biological factors. Genetic, hormonal, and neuroanatomical data provide compelling support for this conclusion. However, environmental and social factors also play a significant role in shaping how individuals experience and express their gender identity.

The interplay between nature and nurture is complex, but the preponderance of scientific evidence leans heavily towards biology as the foundational element. This understanding has critical implications for medical care, social acceptance, and policy-making, underscoring the importance of affirming and supportive environments for transgender individuals.

## Conclusion

The question of why some people are transgender cannot be answered by a single factor. Rather, it is the result of a multifaceted interaction between biological predispositions and environmental influences. Current research strongly supports a biological basis for gender identity, with genetics, prenatal hormone exposure, and brain structure differences playing central roles. Social and cultural contexts further influence gender expression and identity development.

Recognizing transgender identity as a biological phenomenon can help reduce stigma, improve medical care, and foster greater societal acceptance. Future research should continue to explore specific biological mechanisms while also considering the social dimensions of gender identity.
