# Why Are Some People Transgender?  
A Comprehensive Review of Biological and Environmental Factors

---

## Introduction

The question of why some people are transgender—meaning their gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth—has been a subject of scientific inquiry, social debate, and personal reflection. Understanding the origins of transgender identity is crucial for improving medical care, social acceptance, and legal protections for transgender individuals. This report synthesizes current scientific evidence from neurobiology, genetics, endocrinology, and psychosocial studies to explore the biological and environmental factors contributing to transgender identity. It aims to provide an objective, evidence-based perspective grounded in recent research, while acknowledging ongoing uncertainties and complexities.

## Defining Transgender Identity

Transgender individuals identify with a gender different from their natal sex. Disorders of gender identity affect approximately 1 in 100 people, highlighting the significance of this phenomenon in the population ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)). The distinction between gender identity and sexual orientation is critical: gender identity relates to one’s internal sense of self as male, female, or another gender, whereas sexual orientation concerns the gender(s) one is attracted to ([Herman, 2011](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/some-transgender-people-are-not-gay_b_886192)).

## Biological Evidence for Transgender Identity

### Neuroanatomical Differences

Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have identified structural brain differences between transgender and cisgender individuals. For example, research from the University of São Paulo found that transgender women exhibit variations in the volume of the insula—a brain region involved in body image and self-awareness—compared to cisgender women and men ([Renner, 2019](https://www.studyfinds.org/study-shows-differences-in-brain-structure-between-transgender-cisgender-people/)). The insula volume in transgender women was similar to cisgender men but reduced relative to cisgender women, suggesting a neuroanatomical pattern aligned more closely with gender identity than biological sex.

Other studies have reported differences in regions such as the putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, and pre- and postcentral gyri, with some brain structures in transgender individuals resembling those of their identified gender ([Clemens et al., 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8058421/)). However, findings are heterogeneous, and brain structure varies greatly among individuals, making it difficult to define a "typical" male or female brain ([Spizzirri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524090614.htm)).

### Genetic Factors

Genetic studies suggest a mild to moderate hereditary component to transgender identity. A 2019 multicenter study analyzing DNA from transgender women and cisgender men found significant associations between gender dysphoria and genetic variants related to sex hormone signaling ([Balend, 2020](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/transgender-biology-why-i-dont-fear-biological-evidence-8e5a2e5a1b3f)). This points to an oligogenic model, where multiple genes may contribute to the development of gender dysphoria.

### Hormonal Influences

Prenatal exposure to sex hormones, particularly androgens and estrogens, plays a critical role in sexual differentiation of the brain. Studies indicate that variations in fetal hormone levels or receptor sensitivity can influence gender identity development ([Swaab, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306452204000753)). For example, individuals with disorders of sexual development or altered hormone exposure in utero sometimes exhibit gender identities that do not align with their natal sex, supporting a biological basis.

## Environmental and Psychosocial Factors

While biological factors are significant, environmental influences also contribute to gender identity development. The interplay of nature and nurture is complex:

- **Socialization and Family Environment:** Early childhood experiences, parental relationships, and cultural norms can shape gender expression and identity development. However, no evidence supports that upbringing alone can change innate gender identity ([Glicksman, 2013](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/biology)).

- **Stress and Trauma:** Some research links childhood abuse or trauma with later gender dysphoria, but causality is unclear. These factors may exacerbate distress but do not appear to cause transgender identity ([Bartleby, n.d.](https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Development-Across-the-Life-Span-Nature-Versus-Nurture-FKZJQ4R6T)).

- **Chemical Exposure:** Fetal exposure to certain chemicals may affect brain development related to gender role behavior, suggesting environmental toxins as a potential influence ([Vilain, 2013](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/biology)).

## Integrative Perspectives: The Biosocial Model

Most experts agree that transgender identity arises from a combination of biological predispositions and environmental factors. This biosocial approach posits that genetic, hormonal, and neuroanatomical factors create a vulnerability or predisposition, while social and psychological experiences influence the expression and recognition of gender identity ([Glicksman, 2013](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/biology)).

## Implications of Biological Research

### Medical Care and Treatment

Understanding the biological basis of transgender identity supports the legitimacy of gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapy and surgery. Resistance to such treatments often stems from misconceptions that gender identity can be changed through psychiatric intervention alone ([Boston University Medical Center, 2015](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm)).

### Social Acceptance and Rights

Biological evidence challenges arguments that transgender identities are "unscientific" or purely social constructs, potentially reducing stigma and discrimination. However, some within the transgender community express concern that biological research could lead to increased gatekeeping or attempts to "cure" transgender identities ([Balend, 2020](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/transgender-biology-why-i-dont-fear-biological-evidence-8e5a2e5a1b3f)).

## Conclusion

The preponderance of scientific evidence indicates that being transgender has a substantial biological basis involving neuroanatomical, genetic, and hormonal factors, complemented by environmental influences. While the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood, the biological model provides a robust framework for understanding transgender identity as a natural variation of human diversity rather than a mental illness or purely social phenomenon.

This knowledge should guide medical practice toward affirming care and inform public discourse to foster acceptance. Continued research is essential, especially with larger sample sizes and inclusive of nonbinary identities, to deepen understanding and improve outcomes for transgender individuals.
