## 1. Overview of Public Opinion on Roe v. Wade

Before delving into the reasons for wanting to overturn *Roe*, it is important to understand the public opinion landscape. Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans oppose overturning *Roe v. Wade*, but there is also substantial support for certain abortion restrictions and for returning abortion regulation to the states.

For example, a 2021 Gallup poll found that 58% of Americans opposed overturning *Roe*, while 32% favored it ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx)). Similarly, a 2019 Pew Research Center survey reported that 70% of Americans did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn *Roe* ([Pew Research Center, 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/08/29/u-s-public-continues-to-favor-legal-abortion-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/)).

However, support varies significantly by political affiliation and ideological leanings. Republicans tend to be more divided, with about half favoring overturning *Roe* and half opposing it, while Democrats overwhelmingly oppose overturning the decision. Additionally, many Americans who oppose overturning *Roe* also support certain abortion restrictions, such as bans after fetal heartbeat detection or waiting periods ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx); [FiveThirtyEight, 2021](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-dont-want-roe-v-wade-repealed-but-many-also-support-restrictions-on-abortion/)).

## 2. Legal and Constitutional Arguments Against Roe v. Wade

### 2.1 Roe’s Legal Foundation is Considered Indefensible

One of the primary reasons cited for overturning *Roe* is the belief that the decision lacks a solid constitutional foundation. Critics argue that *Roe* was a judicial overreach that created a constitutional right to abortion without clear textual or historical basis in the Constitution. For instance, legal scholars Carter Snead and Richard Garnett describe *Roe* as "indefensible," emphasizing that it established a right that has no basis in the Constitution ([LifeNews, 2021](https://www.lifenews.com/2021/12/16/five-reasons-why-the-supreme-court-should-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

Furthermore, the legal basis for *Roe* has already been altered by subsequent Supreme Court rulings, such as *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which shifted the rationale from privacy rights to liberty rights. This shift is seen by some as evidence that *Roe* was unstable and ripe for reconsideration ([The Imaginative Conservative, 2021](https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2021/10/eight-reasons-overturn-roe-v-wade-thomas-ascik.html)).

### 2.2 Roe is Outdated and Out of Step with Modern Legal Standards

Critics argue that *Roe* was decided in a very different social and legal context and that many of its premises no longer hold. For example, the role of women in society has dramatically changed since 1973, with women achieving significant political and professional milestones that challenge the assumptions underlying *Roe* ([LifeNews, 2021](https://www.lifenews.com/2021/12/16/five-reasons-why-the-supreme-court-should-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself criticized *Roe* for venturing too far and presenting an incomplete justification for its action, suggesting that the decision was legally and constitutionally flawed even from a liberal judicial perspective ([The Imaginative Conservative, 2021](https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2021/10/eight-reasons-overturn-roe-v-wade-thomas-ascik.html)).

### 2.3 The Principle of Federalism and State Sovereignty

Another core argument is that *Roe* improperly removed abortion regulation from the states, imposing a federal constitutional mandate that overrides state laws. Advocates for overturning *Roe* argue that abortion policy should be decided by individual states, reflecting the preferences of their populations rather than a one-size-fits-all federal standard ([LifeNews, 2021](https://www.lifenews.com/2021/12/16/five-reasons-why-the-supreme-court-should-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

This view holds that returning abortion regulation to the states respects the constitutional principle of federalism and allows for more democratic and localized decision-making.

## 3. Moral and Ethical Considerations

### 3.1 The Moral Status of the Unborn Child

A fundamental reason for opposing *Roe* is the belief that life begins at fertilization and that abortion constitutes the taking of an innocent human life. This moral perspective is central to the pro-life movement and underpins many arguments for overturning *Roe* ([Daily Signal, 2021](https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/12/01/why-these-21-americans-say-supreme-court-should-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

Opponents of *Roe* argue that the decision pits mothers against their unborn children, creating an untenable moral conflict. They contend that the law should protect the dignity and rights of both women and their unborn children, rather than prioritizing one at the expense of the other ([LifeNews, 2021](https://www.lifenews.com/2021/12/16/five-reasons-why-the-supreme-court-should-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

### 3.2 The Impact of Roe on Society and Public Morality

Critics also argue that *Roe* has had a corrosive effect on American society by normalizing abortion on demand and undermining respect for human life. They claim that the decision has polarized the country and hindered meaningful public debate on abortion, leaving legislatures uncertain about how to regulate the practice ([The Imaginative Conservative, 2021](https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2021/10/eight-reasons-overturn-roe-v-wade-thomas-ascik.html)).

## 4. Public Misunderstanding and Media Influence

### 4.1 Misconceptions About What Roe v. Wade Actually Permits

Polls indicate that many Americans who say they support *Roe* do so without fully understanding the scope of the decision. *Roe* established a constitutional right to abortion up until the moment before birth, a position supported by only about 18% of the public according to a Marist/NPR poll ([AEI, 2020](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/actually-most-people-dont-support-roe-v-wade/)).

This misunderstanding leads to a paradox where many Americans support *Roe* in principle but also support significant abortion restrictions, such as bans after the first trimester or waiting periods ([Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx)).

### 4.2 The Role of Media and Political Narratives

The media and political actors often portray *Roe* as a settled right that enjoys overwhelming public support. However, some commentators argue this narrative is misleading and serves to stifle honest debate. They contend that the framing of *Roe* as a pro-abortion decision masks the complexity of public opinion and the nuances of abortion policy ([AEI, 2020](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/actually-most-people-dont-support-roe-v-wade/)).

## 5. Practical and Policy Considerations

### 5.1 Support for Abortion Restrictions

While many Americans oppose overturning *Roe*, there is widespread support for certain abortion restrictions. For example, majorities support laws requiring a 24-hour waiting period, ultrasound viewing before abortion, and bans after fetal heartbeat detection ([AEI, 2020](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/actually-most-people-dont-support-roe-v-wade/); [Gallup, 2021](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx)).

This suggests that many people favor a middle ground that limits abortion access without completely outlawing it.

### 5.2 The Desire for Clearer Legal Standards

Proponents of overturning *Roe* argue that the decision has created legal confusion and inconsistent abortion laws across states. They believe that overturning *Roe* would allow states to enact clearer, more consistent policies that reflect their populations' values ([LifeNews, 2021](https://www.lifenews.com/2021/12/16/five-reasons-why-the-supreme-court-should-overturn-roe-v-wade/)).

## 7. Conclusion

The desire to overturn *Roe v. Wade* is driven by a complex interplay of legal, moral, political, and practical considerations. Legally, many argue that *Roe* was an overreach lacking constitutional grounding and that abortion regulation should return to the states. Morally, the belief that life begins at fertilization and that abortion is the taking of innocent life is a powerful motivator. Additionally, public misunderstanding about what *Roe* entails, combined with media narratives, complicates the discourse.

While a majority of Americans oppose overturning *Roe*, many simultaneously support significant abortion restrictions, reflecting a nuanced and divided public opinion. Advocates for overturning *Roe* argue that doing so would restore democratic control to states, clarify legal standards, and better align abortion laws with moral and constitutional principles.

In sum, the push to overturn *Roe v. Wade* is not merely about opposing abortion but is rooted in fundamental disagreements about constitutional interpretation, the moral status of the unborn, the role of the judiciary, and the proper locus of abortion policymaking in American society.
