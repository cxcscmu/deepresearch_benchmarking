# Report: Why People Voted to Leave the European Union in the 2016 Brexit Referendum

## Introduction

The 2016 United Kingdom (UK) referendum on European Union (EU) membership, commonly known as Brexit, resulted in a narrow majority (51.9%) voting to leave the EU. This outcome surprised many observers and contradicted pre-referendum polls that had predicted a Remain victory. Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind the Leave vote is crucial for interpreting the political, social, and economic dynamics that influenced the referendum and for anticipating future developments in UK-EU relations and European integration.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the underlying factors that motivated the Leave vote, drawing on extensive research, survey data, and academic studies. It aims to present an objective, evidence-based account of the motivations and concerns of Leave voters, integrating demographic, economic, social, and political perspectives.

## Demographic and Socioeconomic Profile of Leave Voters

### Age and Turnout

Older voters were significantly more likely to vote Leave, while younger voters predominantly supported Remain. For instance, nearly 75% of 18-24-year-olds voted Remain, compared to 60% of those aged 65 and over who voted Leave ([Britton & Van Goubergen, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/publications/voting-leave-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html)). Moreover, voter turnout was higher among older age groups, with 90% turnout for those over 65 compared to 64% for 18-24-year-olds, amplifying the impact of older voters on the referendum outcome.

### Education and Social Class

Educational attainment was a strong predictor of voting behavior. A majority of university graduates (57%-68%) voted Remain, whereas those with only secondary education or lower predominantly voted Leave (up to 70%) ([Britton & Van Goubergen, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/publications/voting-leave-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html)). Similarly, social class correlated with voting patterns: the AB social group (upper-middle and middle class) mostly voted Remain, while the C2DE group (skilled and unskilled manual workers, pensioners, unemployed) largely voted Leave.

### Regional Differences

Geographically, London and Scotland voted strongly to Remain, while much of England and Wales voted Leave, especially economically marginalized regions affected by deindustrialization ([Britton & Van Goubergen, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/publications/voting-leave-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html)). These regional disparities reflect underlying economic and social divides.

### Identity and Ethnicity

White voters favored Leave (53%), whereas Asian (67%) and Black (73%) voters predominantly supported Remain ([Britton & Van Goubergen, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/publications/voting-leave-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html)). Identity concerns, particularly related to English and white identity, played a role in shaping Leave voters' attitudes.

## Key Motivations Behind the Leave Vote

### Immigration and Sovereignty

Immigration was repeatedly cited as the primary motivation for voting Leave. Concerns about uncontrolled immigration, pressure on public services, and loss of national sovereignty were central themes in the Leave campaign and resonated with many voters ([Goodwin, 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/15/why-immigration-was-key-to-brexit-vote)).

Despite official data showing that migration flows were responsive to economic conditions and that EU nationals contributed positively to the labor market, perceptions of immigration were often exaggerated. For example, the UK population overestimated the proportion of EU-born residents, with Leave voters particularly prone to this misperception ([Britton & Van Goubergen, 2019](https://www.kbc.com/en/publications/voting-leave-what-were-the-underlying-factors-behind-the-brexit-vote.html); [Ipsos MORI, 2016](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/perils-perception-and-eu)).

The Leave campaign's slogan "Take Back Control" effectively harnessed these immigration fears and sovereignty concerns, appealing emotionally to voters who felt disempowered by EU membership ([Clarke, Goodwin, & Whiteley, 2017](https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/70/3/439/2366274)).

### Economic Considerations

Economic arguments were prominent in the Remain campaign, emphasizing the risks and costs of leaving the EU, including potential GDP losses, job insecurity, and trade disruptions. However, many Leave voters prioritized other concerns over these economic warnings, often due to feelings of economic marginalization and distrust of experts ([Goodwin, 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/15/why-immigration-was-key-to-brexit-vote)).

Research indicates that voters who felt "left behind" economically were more likely to support Leave, as they perceived fewer benefits from EU membership and were less concerned about potential economic risks ([Becker, Fetzer, & Novy, 2016](https://voxeu.org/article/fundamental-factors-behind-brexit-vote)).

### Emotional and Identity Factors

Emotions and identity played a significant role. Negative feelings towards the EU, fear of cultural change, and a sense of loss of national identity motivated many Leave voters. Nostalgia for a perceived better past and resentment towards political elites and "establishment" figures also contributed ([Goodwin, 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/15/why-immigration-was-key-to-brexit-vote); [Vasilopoulou, 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.12258)).

The Leave vote was also influenced by cues from charismatic leaders like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, who effectively communicated the Leave message to different voter segments ([Clarke, Goodwin, & Whiteley, 2017](https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/70/3/439/2366274)).

### Political Discontent and Distrust

A broader context of political discontent, distrust of experts, and feelings of powerlessness influenced the Leave vote. Many voters felt disconnected from mainstream political parties and institutions, perceiving that their concerns were ignored ([Vasilopoulou, 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.12258); [British Election Study, 2016](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/what-mattered-most-to-you-when-deciding-how-to-vote-in-the-eu-referendum/#.XalUZ3duIy9)).

## Conclusion

The decision of the UK electorate to vote Leave in the 2016 EU referendum was the result of a complex interplay of demographic, economic, social, emotional, and political factors. While immigration and sovereignty concerns were paramount and emotionally charged motivators, economic considerations, identity, and political discontent also played significant roles.

Older, less-educated, and economically marginalized voters, particularly in regions outside London and Scotland, were more inclined to vote Leave. Misperceptions about immigration levels and the impact of EU membership, amplified by effective Leave campaign messaging and leadership, contributed to the outcome.

Economic arguments warning of Brexit risks were insufficient to sway many Leave voters who felt "left behind" and distrusted establishment figures and experts. Emotional appeals and identity concerns, combined with a desire for greater national control, ultimately tipped the balance.

Understanding these multifaceted motivations is essential for policymakers, scholars, and the public to grasp the challenges and opportunities facing the UK post-Brexit and to address the underlying social and political divides revealed by the referendum.
