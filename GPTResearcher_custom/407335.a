# The Effect of Increased Automation on the Service Desk Practice: An In-Depth Analysis

The service desk is a critical component of IT service management (ITSM), acting as the primary interface between users and IT services. With the rapid advancement of automation technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation (RPA), and chatbots, the service desk practice is undergoing significant transformation. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of increased automation on the service desk practice, drawing on multiple authoritative sources and recent industry insights.

## 1. Introduction

Automation in the service desk context refers to the use of technology to perform tasks that were traditionally manual, repetitive, or low-level. These include incident logging, password resets, ticket routing, and initial troubleshooting. The adoption of automation aims to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall user experience.

## 2. Core Effects of Increased Automation on the Service Desk

### 2.1 Greater Focus on Customer Experience

One of the most significant effects of increased automation is the enhanced ability of service desk personnel to focus on customer experience, particularly when personal contact is necessary. Automation reduces the volume of routine, low-level tasks such as password resets and simple incident logging, which are increasingly handled through self-service portals and chatbots. This shift allows service desk agents to dedicate more time and attention to complex issues requiring human empathy, judgment, and communication skills.

> "With increased automation, the impact on service desks is reduced phone contact, less low-level work, and a greater ability to focus on excellent customer experience when personal contact is needed" (CertifQ, 2021).

This transition aligns with ITIL 4 guiding principles, which emphasize optimizing and automating processes to enhance value delivery and customer satisfaction.

### 2.2 Reduction in Low-Level Work and Phone Contact

Automation significantly decreases the volume of low-level, repetitive tasks handled by service desk agents. Common issues such as password resets, account access problems, and software provisioning are increasingly resolved through automated workflows and AI-powered chatbots. This leads to a reduction in phone contact and manual ticket handling.

> "Service desks are moving to provide more self-service logging and resolution through online portals and mobile applications, resulting in less low-level work and reduced phone contact" (CertifQ, 2021).

This reduction not only improves operational efficiency but also allows service desk teams to manage their workload more effectively, focusing on higher-value activities.

### 2.3 Enhanced Self-Service Capabilities

Automation drives the expansion of self-service options for end-users. AI and RPA technologies enable users to log incidents, request services, and resolve common issues independently without direct interaction with service desk staff.

According to Gartner, automation can resolve approximately 30% of service desk tickets, highlighting the significant impact of self-service capabilities on ticket volumes and resolution times (Milestone, n.d.).

### 2.4 Improved Productivity and Cost Efficiency

Automation leads to increased productivity by accelerating issue resolution and reducing manual effort. The availability of 24/7 automated support through omni-channel platforms ensures continuous service availability, which is critical in hybrid and remote work environments.

> "Automation can increase business ROI threefold through increased capacity, reduced effort, and faster resolution" (Milestone, n.d.).

This cost-effectiveness is essential for organizations facing budget constraints while needing to maintain high service levels.

### 2.5 Support for Hybrid and Distributed Workforces

Automation tools enable service desk operations to be more flexible and scalable, supporting geographically dispersed teams and hybrid work models. Automated systems and AI-driven tools facilitate consistent service delivery regardless of location, time zone, or language barriers.

Milestone’s global service desk platform, for example, incorporates enhanced natural language processing (NLP) features to handle multilingual queries and multi-location support seamlessly (Milestone, n.d.).

## 3. Strategic and Operational Implications

### 3.1 Shift-Left Strategy and Incident Swarming

Automation supports the adoption of a shift-left strategy, where simpler issues are resolved at lower levels or by end-users themselves, reducing the burden on higher-level support teams. This approach improves cost efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Additionally, automation facilitates incident swarming—a collaborative approach where multiple experts work together on critical incidents—helping to reduce ticket backlogs and improve resolution times (Info-Tech Research Group, n.d.).

### 3.2 Integration of People, Process, and Technology

While automation enhances service desk capabilities, it is crucial to recognize that technology alone does not guarantee improved outcomes. The integration of skilled personnel and optimized processes remains vital.

> "As technology alone does not improve service desk operations, people and process are the other two important factors" (Info-Tech Research Group, n.d.).

Training, knowledge sharing, and process standardization complement automation to deliver superior service desk performance.

### 3.3 Data-Driven Continual Improvement

Automation generates rich data on service desk activities, which can be leveraged for continual improvement. Accurate data analytics enable fact-based decision-making, helping organizations identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and enhance service quality.

ITIL 4 emphasizes the importance of relevant data sources and skilled analytics to support continual improvement initiatives (CertifQ, 2021).

## 5. Challenges and Considerations

### 5.1 Maintaining Human Touch

Despite automation’s benefits, maintaining a human touch for complex and sensitive issues is essential. Automation should augment, not replace, human interaction to preserve service quality and customer trust.

### 5.2 Skill Development and Change Management

Service desk staff must adapt to evolving roles that emphasize problem-solving, communication, and customer engagement. Organizations need to invest in training and change management to facilitate this transition.

### 5.3 Technology Integration and Data Privacy

Integrating automation tools with existing ITSM platforms requires careful planning to ensure seamless workflows and data security. Compliance with privacy regulations is critical when deploying AI and automation solutions.

## 6. Conclusion

Increased automation profoundly impacts the service desk practice by reducing low-level manual work, enabling self-service, and allowing service desk personnel to focus on delivering superior customer experiences where personal contact is necessary. Automation enhances productivity, cost efficiency, and service availability, particularly in hybrid and distributed work environments.

However, successful automation adoption depends on the balanced integration of technology, people, and processes. Organizations must prioritize training, process optimization, and data-driven continual improvement to fully realize automation’s benefits.

The evidence indicates that automation is not a panacea but a powerful enabler that, when implemented thoughtfully, transforms service desk operations into more agile, efficient, and customer-centric functions.
