# Report on Public Perceptions and Emotional Responses to Climate Change

## Introduction

Climate change is widely recognized as one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with profound implications not only for the environment but also for human health, societal stability, and psychological well-being. This report synthesizes findings from multiple large-scale studies and surveys conducted globally, focusing on how people—particularly young people—feel about climate change. It explores the emotional, psychological, and behavioral responses to climate change, the role of government action or inaction, and the implications for public engagement and policy support.

## Emotional and Psychological Impact of Climate Change

### Climate Anxiety and Psychological Distress in Youth

A landmark global study surveying 10,000 young people aged 16-25 across 10 countries revealed widespread psychological distress linked to climate change anxiety. Key findings include:

- **45%** of youth reported that climate anxiety and distress affect their daily lives and functioning.
- **75%** believe "the future is frightening," with higher percentages in countries like Portugal (81%) and the Philippines (92%).
- **58%** feel betrayed by governments, and **64%** believe governments are not doing enough to prevent climate catastrophe.
- Over half of respondents experienced feelings of fear, sadness, anxiety, anger, powerlessness, helplessness, and guilt.
- **55%** expect fewer opportunities than their parents.
- **65%** feel governments are failing young people, and **61%** feel unprotected by government climate policies.
- Nearly half who discuss climate change feel ignored or dismissed.

These findings indicate a profound sense of institutional betrayal and abandonment by political leaders, which exacerbates mental health challenges among youth ([University of Bath, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00278-3)).

### Differential Emotional Responses: Eco-Anxiety, Eco-Depression, and Eco-Anger

Research differentiates between various eco-emotions and their distinct impacts:

| Eco-Emotion    | Description                               | Impact on Mental Health          | Impact on Climate Action           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Eco-Anxiety    | Anxiety and fear related to climate threats | Associated with increased anxiety and stress; may inhibit collective action | Predicts lower collective action engagement |
| Eco-Depression | Feelings of sadness and misery about climate | Strongly linked to depression and stress; may reduce motivation | Associated with some collective action but also disengagement |
| Eco-Anger      | Frustration and anger about climate inaction | Linked to lower depression and anxiety; potentially protective | Strongly predicts both personal and collective climate action |

Eco-anger emerges as a uniquely adaptive response, motivating engagement and action, whereas eco-anxiety and eco-depression may be debilitating and reduce participation in climate solutions ([Stanley et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2021.100003)).

### Hope and Doubt in Climate Change Engagement

Hope and doubt play critical roles in shaping public attitudes and behaviors toward climate change:

- **Constructive Hope**: Belief that humans can and will address climate change effectively, linked to increased policy support and activism.
- **False Hope**: Belief that external forces (e.g., technology, nature, or divine intervention) will solve climate change without human action, associated with disengagement.
- **Constructive Doubt**: Skepticism about whether people will act sufficiently, which can motivate political engagement.
- **Fatalistic Doubt**: Belief that nothing can be done, leading to apathy and reduced engagement.

An interaction between constructive hope and doubt predicts higher political behavioral intentions, suggesting that a balanced recognition of challenges alongside optimism fosters mobilization ([Marlon et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2019.00020)).

## Public Perceptions of Government and Institutional Responses

### Perceived Government Inaction and Betrayal

Surveys consistently show that many people, especially youth, perceive governments as failing to adequately address climate change:

- **65%** of young people globally feel governments are failing them on climate change.
- Only about **31%** trust their governments on climate issues.
- Feelings of betrayal and dismissal by political leaders are common, contributing to psychological distress.
- In some countries, such as Portugal and the Philippines, these sentiments are particularly acute.

This perception of institutional betrayal is linked to increased climate anxiety and mental health risks among youth, and has led to legal actions arguing that government inaction violates human rights ([University of Bath, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00278-3); [BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58578470)).

### Public Willingness to Act vs. Skepticism of Government Efficacy

While a majority of people express concern and willingness to change their lifestyles to mitigate climate change, there is skepticism about the effectiveness of government and international actions:

- Between **60% and 90%** in advanced economies express concern about personal harm from climate change.
- At least **70%** in most countries are willing to make lifestyle changes.
- However, many doubt their governments' ability or willingness to implement effective policies.
- Confidence in international cooperation varies, with some countries showing low trust in global efforts.

This gap between individual willingness and institutional trust highlights the need for policy-level action to complement personal behavior changes ([Pew Research Center, 2021](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/09/14/global-views-on-climate-change/)).

## Behavioral Responses and Climate Activism

### Youth Mobilization and Legal Actions

Young people have become prominent climate activists worldwide, organizing protests, strikes, and legal challenges:

- Activists like Greta Thunberg have galvanized global youth movements.
- Youth-led lawsuits argue that government failure to act on climate change violates their human rights.
- Despite activism, many young people report feelings of helplessness and exhaustion due to slow policy progress.

These movements reflect both the psychological impact of climate change and the desire for systemic change ([University of Bath, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00278-3); [ABC News, 2021](https://abcnews.go.com/US/young-people-experiencing-widespread-psychological-distress-government/story?id=79938067)).

### Influence of Emotions on Pro-Climate Behaviors

The type of emotional response influences engagement:

- Eco-anger correlates with increased personal and collective pro-climate behaviors.
- Eco-anxiety may lead to avoidance or disengagement.
- Eco-depression is linked to some collective action but also poorer mental health.

Effective climate communication may benefit from fostering constructive anger and hope, while mitigating debilitating anxiety and false hope ([Stanley et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2021.100003)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

The evidence portrays a complex and deeply emotional public response to climate change, especially among young people who face the prospect of inheriting a degraded planet. The pervasive climate anxiety and distress are not mere irrational fears but rational responses to perceived governmental inaction and institutional betrayal. This psychological burden is compounded by feelings of powerlessness and skepticism about political efficacy.

Importantly, the differentiation of eco-emotions reveals that while anxiety and depression may hinder engagement, eco-anger can be a powerful motivator for personal and collective climate action. Similarly, constructive hope coupled with a realistic acknowledgment of challenges (constructive doubt) fosters political engagement, whereas false hope and fatalistic doubt undermine it.

Given these insights, it is imperative that governments and institutions not only implement robust climate policies but also actively rebuild trust and address the mental health impacts of climate change anxiety. Climate communication strategies should emphasize constructive hope and empower eco-anger to mobilize action, while providing clear, credible information to counter false hope and fatalism.

In sum, public feelings about climate change are characterized by high concern and willingness to act, but also by significant psychological distress and distrust in government responses. Addressing these emotional and institutional dimensions is critical to fostering effective climate action and safeguarding both planetary and human health.
