# Public Perceptions and Emotional Responses to Climate Change: A Comprehensive Analysis

Climate change is increasingly recognized not only as an environmental and economic challenge but also as a profound social and psychological issue. This report synthesizes findings from multiple reputable sources, including global surveys and scientific studies conducted between 2015 and 2021, to provide an in-depth understanding of how people around the world feel about climate change. The analysis covers public concern levels, emotional impacts, perceptions of government responses, and demographic variations in attitudes.

## 1. Global Concern and Awareness of Climate Change

### Rising Concern Worldwide

Data from several large-scale surveys indicate that concern about climate change has reached historically high levels globally. For example, a 2021 GlobeScan poll conducted across 31 countries found that 63% of respondents in 17 consistently tracked countries believe climate change is a "very serious" issue, marking the highest recorded concern since tracking began in 1998 ([GlobeScan, 2021](https://globescan.com/2021/10/27/global-poll-cop26-growing-support-governments-take-strong-action-climate-change/)).

Similarly, Pew Research Center's 2018 survey revealed that majorities in most surveyed countries view climate change as a major threat to their nation, with some countries like Greece reporting as high as 90% concern ([Pew Research Center, 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/18/a-look-at-how-people-around-the-world-view-climate-change/)). The upward trend is notable; concern has increased significantly since 2013 in numerous countries, with France and Mexico seeing increases of 29 and 28 percentage points, respectively ([Pew Research Center, 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/18/a-look-at-how-people-around-the-world-view-climate-change/)).

### Demographic Variations

Education, gender, and age influence climate change perceptions. Generally, individuals with higher education levels express greater concern. Women tend to be more worried than men in several countries, and younger people often show higher levels of concern than older adults. For instance, in the United States, 71% of those aged 18 to 29 consider climate change a threat compared to 50% of those aged 50 and above ([Pew Research Center, 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/18/a-look-at-how-people-around-the-world-view-climate-change/)).

## 2. Emotional Impact and Climate Anxiety, Especially Among Youth

### Prevalence of Climate Anxiety

One of the most striking findings from recent research is the high prevalence of climate anxiety, particularly among young people aged 16 to 25. A landmark global study surveying 10,000 young people across 10 countries found that nearly 60% reported feeling "very worried" or "extremely worried" about climate change ([Nature, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02582-8)). Negative emotions such as sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, and powerlessness were commonly reported.

Moreover, 45% of these young respondents indicated that their feelings about climate change adversely affect their daily lives and functioning. The study also found that 75% of young people believe "the future is frightening," with 56% agreeing that humanity is doomed ([BBC News, 2021](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-58549373)).

### Geographic and Socioeconomic Disparities

Young people in poorer countries, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, report even higher levels of worry and greater impairment in daily functioning due to climate anxiety. For example, 92% of youth in the Philippines expressed that the future is frightening, compared to 72% in the UK ([The Ecologist, 2021](https://theecologist.org/2021/sep/14/crisis-youth-climate-anxiety)). This disparity is attributed to the disproportionate impact of climate-related disasters on these regions.

### Government Inaction as a Source of Distress

A significant contributor to climate anxiety among youth is the perceived failure of governments to adequately address climate change. Approximately 65% of young people surveyed across multiple countries felt their governments were failing them on climate change, and 60% believed governments were dismissing citizens' distress ([NPR, 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/14/1037023551/climate-change-children-young-adults-anxious-worried-study)). This sense of betrayal exacerbates feelings of helplessness and moral injury.

## 3. Public Evaluation of Government Responses

### Importance of Government Action

Across countries, a majority of people rate government responses to climate change as an important policy area. For example, in Australia, 80% of respondents consider government climate policy important, yet only 39% express satisfaction with their government's response ([Climate Catalyst, 2021](https://climatecatalyst.net/)).

A global poll ahead of COP26 found that 61% of respondents believe governments hold "a great deal" of responsibility to address climate change, surpassing the perceived responsibility of companies (57%), international bodies like the UN (54%), and individuals (36%) ([GlobeScan, 2021](https://globescan.com/2021/10/27/global-poll-cop26-growing-support-governments-take-strong-action-climate-change/)).

### Expectations for Leadership

The same poll revealed that an average of 56% across 31 countries want their governments to play a leadership role in setting ambitious climate targets, with another 36% favoring a more moderate approach. Only 8% oppose climate deals or are uncertain ([GlobeScan, 2021](https://globescan.com/2021/10/27/global-poll-cop26-growing-support-governments-take-strong-action-climate-change/)).

Notably, expectations for government leadership have increased since the 2015 Paris Agreement, rising from 43% to 58% in 18 tracked countries, including major emitters such as China, India, and the USA.

### Satisfaction Levels by Country

Citizens' satisfaction with their governments' climate responses varies by country. A ranking from the Climate Catalyst study shows:

| Rank | Country       | Satisfaction (%) |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 1     | New Zealand   | 56               |
| 2     | Canada        | 48               |
| 3     | United States | 42               |
| 4     | United Kingdom| 40               |
| 5     | Australia     | 39               |

This table illustrates a general trend of moderate dissatisfaction or ambivalence, even in countries with relatively high concern about climate change ([Climate Catalyst, 2021](https://climatecatalyst.net/)).

## 4. Psychological and Social Dimensions

### Emotional Burden and Mental Health

The psychological impact of climate change extends beyond anxiety to include feelings of grief, despair, anger, and shame. These emotions are compounded by perceptions of inadequate governmental action, leading to what some researchers term "moral injury" among youth ([BPS Research Digest, 2021](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/29/young-people-around-the-world-report-high-levels-of-climate-anxiety/)).

The mental health implications are significant, with climate anxiety contributing to stress and impairing daily functioning for a substantial portion of young people globally ([Nature, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02582-8)).

### Coping and Hope

Despite the prevalence of negative emotions, some young people also express hope and optimism, though these positive feelings are less common. Psychologists emphasize the importance of fostering hope and agency through effective climate policies and communication to mitigate the mental health burden ([JSTOR Daily, 2021](https://daily.jstor.org/coping-with-climate-anxiety/)).

## 5. Summary and Opinion

The evidence from multiple high-quality sources paints a clear picture: global concern about climate change is widespread and intensifying, with particularly acute emotional and psychological impacts on young people. The pervasive feelings of worry, fear, and helplessness are closely linked to perceptions of insufficient government action, which many young people interpret as a betrayal.

Public expectations for government leadership on climate change are high and growing, yet satisfaction with governmental responses remains relatively low. This gap between expectation and perceived performance contributes to climate anxiety and undermines public trust.

Given these findings, it is imperative that governments not only implement ambitious climate policies but also communicate transparently and empathetically with their citizens, particularly youth, to address both the environmental and psychological dimensions of the crisis. Failure to do so risks exacerbating mental health challenges and social unrest.
