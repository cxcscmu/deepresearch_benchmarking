# Report: The Genetic and Environmental Influences on Intelligence

## Introduction

The question of whether intelligence is primarily determined by genetics or environmental factors has been a longstanding and contentious debate in psychology and behavioral genetics. Intelligence, often operationalized through IQ (intelligence quotient) scores, is a complex trait influenced by multiple factors. This report aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences on intelligence, drawing from a wide range of empirical studies, meta-analyses, and theoretical models. The goal is to present an objective synthesis of current knowledge, supported by quantitative data and critical evaluation of methodologies.

## Defining Intelligence and Heritability

Intelligence is broadly defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. IQ tests are commonly used to measure general cognitive ability, although they are not without limitations. Heritability, in this context, refers to the proportion of variance in IQ scores within a population that can be attributed to genetic variation ([Devlin, Daniels, & Roeder, 1997](https://www.nature.com/articles/41319)).

Heritability estimates range from 0 (no genetic contribution) to 1 (entirely genetic). It is crucial to understand that heritability applies to populations, not individuals, and does not imply immutability of traits.

## Genetic Influences on Intelligence

### Twin and Adoption Studies

Twin studies have been instrumental in estimating the genetic contribution to intelligence. Identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins share approximately 50%. The higher correlation of IQ scores among MZ twins compared to DZ twins suggests a significant genetic component.

| Relationship                  | IQ Correlation |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| Same person (test-retest)    | 0.95           |
| Identical twins reared together | 0.86           |
| Identical twins reared apart  | 0.76           |
| Fraternal twins reared together | 0.55           |
| Fraternal twins reared apart  | 0.35           |
| Biological siblings reared together | 0.47           |
| Biological siblings reared apart | 0.24           |
| Unrelated children reared together | 0.30           |
| Adoptive parent-child living together | 0.19           |

These data indicate that genetics accounts for a substantial portion of IQ variance, with heritability estimates for adults commonly reported between 0.7 and 0.8 ([Bouchard & McGue, 2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/neu.10160)).

### Polygenic Nature of Intelligence

Intelligence is polygenic, influenced by many genes each exerting small effects. Over 500 genes have been linked to intelligence, with no single "intelligence gene" identified ([New Scientist, 2018](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224641-found-more-than-500-genes-that-are-linked-to-intelligence/)). Molecular genetic studies confirm that individual genetic variants explain only a small fraction of IQ variance, necessitating large sample sizes for reliable detection ([Chabris et al., 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611435528)).

### Genetic Stability and Age Effects

Heritability of IQ increases with age, from about 0.2 in infancy to 0.8 in adulthood ([Bouchard, 2013](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/wilson-effect-the-increase-in-heritability-of-iq-with-age/)). This is hypothesized to result from gene-environment correlation, where individuals seek environments that reinforce their genetic predispositions.

### Genetic Effects and Cognitive Disorders

Certain genetic mutations cause intellectual disabilities (e.g., phenylketonuria), demonstrating direct genetic effects on intelligence ([Meisenberg, 2005](https://www.mankindquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Genes-for-Intelligence-A-Review-of-Recent-Progress.pdf)). However, these are rare and distinct from normal IQ variation.

## Environmental Influences on Intelligence

### Shared and Non-Shared Environment

Environmental factors include shared family environment (e.g., socioeconomic status, parenting style) and non-shared environment (e.g., peer groups, unique experiences). Shared environment accounts for approximately 25-35% of IQ variance in childhood but diminishes by late adolescence ([Neisser et al., 1996](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-04241-001)).

Non-shared environmental factors contribute to individual differences even among siblings raised together ([Plomin et al., 2001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/070674370104600302)).

### Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Intelligence

SES is a powerful environmental predictor of IQ. Children from higher SES families score on average 6 IQ points higher at age 2, with this gap tripling by age 16 ([von Stumm & Plomin, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.10.002)).

A latent growth curve analysis of 14,853 British twins showed that SES influences both the starting point and growth trajectory of IQ across childhood and adolescence (see Figure 1).

| SES Level | IQ at Age 2 | IQ at Age 16 |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| High      | ~106        | ~115         |
| Medium    | ~100        | ~105         |
| Low       | ~94         | ~98          |

This suggests that environmental advantages accumulate over time, amplifying initial differences.

### Nutrition and Prenatal Factors

Breastfeeding for 12 months or longer is associated with an IQ increase of approximately 3.7 points at age 30 ([Cherry, 2021](https://www.verywellmind.com/genetic-and-environmental-influences-on-intelligence-2795398)). Prenatal exposure to harmful substances (e.g., maternal smoking, malnutrition) negatively affects cognitive development ([Mortensen, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2004.11.002)).

### Educational and Social Environment

School attendance and quality of education significantly impact IQ scores ([Cherry, 2021](https://www.verywellmind.com/genetic-and-environmental-influences-on-intelligence-2795398)). First-born children tend to have higher IQs, possibly due to more parental attention and higher expectations ([Cherry, 2021](https://www.verywellmind.com/genetic-and-environmental-influences-on-intelligence-2795398)).

### Flynn Effect

The Flynn effect describes the observed rise in average IQ scores over the 20th century, about 7 points between 1940 and 1979 across 20 countries ([Neisser, 1998](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-06602-000)). This rapid increase cannot be explained by genetics alone and points to environmental improvements such as nutrition, education, and cognitive stimulation.

## Gene-Environment Interaction and Correlation

The interaction between genetics and environment is complex. For example, Turkheimer et al. (2003) found that in impoverished families, shared environment accounted for 60% of IQ variance, with genetics near zero, whereas in affluent families, genetics accounted for 60% and environment less ([Turkheimer et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.01462)).

This suggests that genetic potential may only fully manifest in supportive environments. Conversely, genetic predispositions can influence the environments individuals seek (gene-environment correlation).

## Critical Evaluation and Opinion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports that intelligence is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Heritability estimates of IQ in adulthood are high (approximately 70-80%), indicating a strong genetic component. However, environmental factors, particularly socioeconomic status, education, and nutrition, significantly shape cognitive development, especially in early life.

The dynamic nature of heritability across the lifespan and the Flynn effect underscore that intelligence is malleable and responsive to environmental conditions. The gene-environment interplay further complicates simplistic nature versus nurture dichotomies.

Given the data, it is neither accurate nor scientifically supported to claim intelligence is predominantly genetic or environmental. Instead, intelligence results from a complex, interactive system where genetics set potential limits and environmental factors influence the degree to which this potential is realized.

## Conclusion

Intelligence is a polygenic and multifactorial trait shaped by both inherited genetic factors and environmental influences. Genetic factors account for a substantial proportion of individual differences in IQ, especially in adulthood, but environmental factors such as socioeconomic status, education, nutrition, and prenatal conditions play critical roles in cognitive development and can modulate genetic expression.

The interaction between genes and environment means that intelligence is not fixed but can be enhanced or hindered by life circumstances. Policies and interventions aimed at improving early childhood environments, education quality, and nutrition can have meaningful impacts on cognitive outcomes.
