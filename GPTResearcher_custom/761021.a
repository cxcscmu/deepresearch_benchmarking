# Report: Benefits of Adding Internet Channels to Traditional Store-Based Retailers

## Introduction

The retail landscape has undergone a profound transformation over the past decade, accelerated by technological advancements and shifting consumer behaviors. Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, once solely dependent on physical stores, have increasingly integrated internet channels into their operations. This integration has not only become essential for survival but also offers significant competitive advantages. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how traditional store-based retailers have benefitted by adding internet channels to their operations, drawing on recent data, case studies, and industry insights.

## The Imperative of Internet Channels for Traditional Retailers

The COVID-19 pandemic starkly highlighted the necessity of ecommerce for brick-and-mortar retailers. With physical stores forced to close temporarily, retailers without an online presence faced severe revenue losses. For example, Tin Pot Creamery, a California-based ice cream shop, experienced a drastic shift as 95% of its sales were traditionally in-store. The pandemic accelerated their ecommerce adoption, enabling nationwide sales and creating a sustainable long-term revenue channel ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).

Ecommerce sales have shown robust growth globally, with a 27.6% increase in 2020 reaching $4.28 trillion and a projected 14.3% growth in 2021 ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)). In the U.S., online retail sales are expected to exceed $476 billion by 2024, underscoring the critical market opportunity for traditional retailers to expand online.

## Key Benefits of Adding Internet Channels

### 1. Expanded Market Reach and Customer Base

Internet channels enable retailers to transcend geographical limitations inherent in physical stores. By selling online, retailers can reach a national or even global audience, significantly expanding their potential customer base. This was evident in the case of Lammes Candies, which leveraged ecommerce to complement its five physical locations and tap into a broader market ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).

### 2. Increased Sales and Revenue Streams

Integrating online channels creates additional revenue streams that supplement in-store sales. Omnichannel customers—those who engage with multiple channels—tend to spend more. A study of 46,000 shoppers revealed that omnichannel customers spend 4% more per store visit and 10% more online compared to single-channel shoppers. Moreover, customers using four or more channels spent 9% more in-store than those using only one channel ([Sopadjieva, Dholakia, & Benjamin, 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/01/a-study-of-46000-shoppers-shows-that-omnichannel-retailing-works)).

### 3. Enhanced Customer Insights and Data Utilization

Ecommerce platforms provide rich data on customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. Retailers can track metrics such as product page views, time spent on site, and conversion rates in real time. Integrating these insights with physical store data through unified POS systems allows for more informed decision-making, personalized marketing, and inventory optimization ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).

### 4. Improved Customer Experience and Convenience

Internet channels offer customers flexibility in how they shop, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty. Features such as Buy Online, Pick Up In Store (BOPIS), curbside pickup, and home delivery cater to diverse preferences. Mobile-optimized ecommerce sites and apps further enable convenient shopping on the go, as demonstrated by Starbucks, where 17% of orders in early 2020 were placed via mobile app ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).

### 5. Competitive Differentiation and Brand Loyalty

Retailers that successfully integrate online and offline channels provide seamless, frictionless shopping experiences that differentiate them from pure-play online competitors. Omnichannel strategies foster higher customer retention and advocacy; omnichannel shoppers logged 23% more repeat store visits within six months and were more likely to recommend the brand ([Sopadjieva et al., 2017](https://hbr.org/2017/01/a-study-of-46000-shoppers-shows-that-omnichannel-retailing-works)).

### 6. Operational Efficiency and Inventory Management

Using a single integrated system for both online and offline sales helps synchronize inventory, reducing the risks of overselling or stockouts. Retailers can leverage physical store inventory to fulfill online orders (ship-from-store), optimizing stock utilization and reducing shipping times and costs ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).

## Strategies for Effective Integration of Internet Channels

### Unified Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems

Implementing a real-time, automated POS system that integrates online and offline sales channels is crucial. This system ensures accurate inventory tracking and streamlined accounting, preventing customer dissatisfaction due to stock discrepancies.

### Expansion to Multiple Online Channels

Beyond their own ecommerce sites, retailers benefit from presence on social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) and online marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, Walmart). This multi-channel approach increases visibility and customer acquisition opportunities.

| Channel Type          | Examples                    | Benefits                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Social Media          | Instagram, Facebook, TikTok | Brand storytelling, direct shopping features  |
| Online Marketplaces   | Amazon, eBay, Walmart       | Access to large customer bases, trust signals  |
| Comparison Engines    | Google Shopping, Shopzilla  | Price comparison, increased product exposure   |

### Digital Enhancements in Physical Stores

Incorporating digital technologies such as interactive kiosks, digital signage, RFID-enabled smart mirrors, and contactless checkout enhances in-store experiences and bridges the online-offline gap ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).

### Mobile Optimization and Apps

Ensuring ecommerce platforms are mobile-friendly or developing dedicated apps improves accessibility and convenience, capitalizing on the growing trend of mobile commerce, which accounted for 44% of total ecommerce sales in the U.S. in 2020 ([BigCommerce, 2022](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/brick-and-mortar-retailers/)).
