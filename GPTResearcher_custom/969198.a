# How New Police Officers Enter the Police Subculture: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The police subculture represents a distinct set of values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors that characterize members of law enforcement agencies. Understanding how new police officers enter and become part of this subculture is critical for comprehending the dynamics of policing, officer behavior, and institutional culture. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the process through which new officers are socialized into the police subculture, drawing from scholarly research, empirical studies, and authoritative sources. The report also offers a critical perspective on the mechanisms of socialization, the role of training and field experience, and the implications for police culture and organizational behavior.

## Defining Police Subculture

Before exploring the entry process, it is essential to define what constitutes the police subculture. Subculture refers to a cultural practice within a group that has beliefs or behaviors distinct from the larger society (codedmog101, 2020). Police subculture specifically encompasses the shared values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that develop among law enforcement officers, often shaped by the unique demands and challenges of police work. These include solidarity, suspicion of outsiders, loyalty to fellow officers, and a distinctive worldview shaped by frequent exposure to crime and danger (Drummond, 1976).

## Entry into the Police Subculture: Socialization Process

### Socialization as the Primary Mechanism

The consensus among researchers is that new police officers enter the subculture primarily through a process of socialization rather than formal admission or application. Socialization refers to the gradual internalization of the subculture's norms and values through interaction and experience within the police organization (codedmog101, 2020; Drummond, 1976).

- **Recruit Training:** Socialization begins during police academy training, where recruits receive instruction on laws, procedures, and tactics. However, academy training is limited in its ability to simulate the complexities of real-world policing (Tulini, 2019).
- **Field Training Officer (FTO) Programs:** The critical phase of socialization occurs during the field training period, where new officers are paired with experienced Field Training Officers (FTOs). FTOs serve as role models, demonstrating not only technical skills but also attitudes, behaviors, and coping mechanisms that define the subculture (Tulini, 2019).

### Role of Field Training Officers (FTOs)

The influence of FTOs is profound and multifaceted. According to Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977), individuals learn behaviors by observing and imitating models. In policing, new officers closely observe their FTOs and emulate their conduct, both on and off duty.

- FTOs transmit departmental norms, including what policies are important and which can be flexibly interpreted.
- They model interactions with the community, fellow officers, and superiors.
- They influence new officers' attitudes toward use of force, discretion, and ethical boundaries.
- Negative behaviors or deviance tolerated by FTOs can be perpetuated by new officers, creating a cycle that sustains the subculture (Getty, 2014; Tulini, 2019).

### Acceptance and Peer Influence

Beyond formal training, acceptance by peers is a powerful motivator for new officers to conform to the subculture. Officers often develop a worldview characterized by mistrust of the public and reliance on fellow officers for support and survival in a high-stress environment (codedmog101, 2020). This peer pressure reinforces conformity to subcultural norms.

## Stages and Factors in Socialization

| Stage                      | Description                                                                                     | Key Influences                              |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Recruitment and Selection** | Entry into the police force based on educational, cultural, and attitudinal characteristics.   | Departmental standards, applicant traits    |
| **Academy Training**          | Formal instruction on laws, procedures, and tactics.                                           | Curriculum, instructors                      |
| **Field Training**            | On-the-job training with FTOs, translating academy knowledge into street knowledge.            | FTO behavior, departmental culture          |
| **Probationary Period**       | Continued evaluation and socialization into the department's norms and expectations.           | Peer acceptance, supervisory feedback       |
| **Full Integration**          | Officer becomes a full member of the subculture, adopting shared values and behaviors.         | Peer group, organizational environment      |

## Empirical Evidence and Research Findings

- **Drummond (1976)** emphasized that socialization begins with selection and continues through training and initial field assignments, where recruits face strong pressure to emulate senior officers and conform to typical police attitudes.
- **Tulini (2019)** highlighted that FTOs are the primary agents of socialization, shaping new officers' professional identities and cultural attitudes. The quality and values of FTOs directly impact the perpetuation or reform of police culture.
- **Getty (2014)** found that problematic FTOs correlate with higher citizen complaints against rookies, indicating the transmission of negative cultural traits.
- **Charman (2017)**, through a longitudinal study, showed that new recruits develop a "new breed" identity influenced by evolving departmental cultures but still deeply shaped by early socialization experiences.

## Implications for Police Culture and Reform

The process of entering the police subculture has significant implications:

- **Cultural Persistence:** Because socialization is heavily influenced by FTOs and peer groups, existing cultural norms—both positive and negative—tend to persist over time.
- **Resistance to Change:** Attempts to reform police culture must address the socialization process, particularly the selection and training of FTOs, to effect meaningful change.
- **Ethical and Professional Development:** Emphasizing ethical behavior and professionalism during socialization can foster a culture that values accountability and community engagement.
- **Recruit Support:** Providing recruits with support mechanisms that encourage critical reflection and resilience may reduce conformity to negative subcultural elements.

## Conclusion

New police officers enter the police subculture primarily through a process of socialization that begins with recruitment and academy training but is most profoundly shaped during field training under the guidance of Field Training Officers. This socialization involves adopting shared values, beliefs, and behaviors that define the police subculture. The role of FTOs is pivotal, as they serve as role models whose attitudes and behaviors are emulated by rookies, thereby perpetuating or challenging the existing culture. Peer acceptance and organizational pressures further reinforce conformity to subcultural norms. Understanding this process is essential for developing strategies to influence police culture positively and promote ethical, professional policing.
