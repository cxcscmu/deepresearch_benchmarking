# How Does Music Influence Mood and Behaviour?  
## A Comprehensive Scientific Report

---

## Introduction

Music is a universal human experience that has been part of societies for millennia. Its profound impact on human mood and behaviour is widely acknowledged, yet the underlying mechanisms have only been rigorously studied in recent decades. Advances in neuroscience, psychology, and physiology have begun to elucidate how music affects emotional states, cognitive functions, and social behaviours. This report synthesizes current scientific evidence to provide an in-depth understanding of how music influences mood and behaviour, emphasizing neurochemical pathways, psychological processes, and physiological responses.

## 1. Psychological Functions of Music Listening

### 1.1 Primary Reasons for Listening to Music

A 2013 psychological survey identified three main reasons people listen to music:

- Regulating mood and stress (arousal)
- Achieving self-awareness
- Expressing social relatedness

The first two reasons—mood regulation and self-awareness—were found to be more important than social expression. Music is often used as a personal tool for motivation, focus, and stress relief, either in the foreground or as background sound ([The Psychological Functions of Music Listening, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00511/full)).

### 1.2 Cross-Cultural Emotional Perception

Studies show that listeners across diverse cultures can identify basic emotional valences in unfamiliar music. For example, Western listeners could discern happiness or sadness in Navajo, Kyrghistani, and Hindustani music, while a remote tribe in Cameroon identified happiness or sadness in Western music. Common features such as tempo and volume (slow/soft = sadness; fast/jaunty = happiness) appear universal in emotional interpretation ([Science Museum Blog, 2018](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/how-music-affects-mood)).

## 2. Neurochemical and Neuroanatomical Mechanisms

### 2.1 Dopamine and the Reward System

Music activates the brain's reward system, particularly the mesocorticolimbic pathway involving the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and prefrontal cortex. Dopamine release in these regions correlates with pleasurable experiences induced by music ([Salimpoor et al., 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2726)).

- **Anticipation vs. Experience:** Dopamine release occurs in the caudate nucleus during anticipation of peak emotional moments and in the NAc during the experience of peak pleasure.
- **Physical Indicators:** Listening to favorite music triggers dilated pupils, increased blood pressure, faster pulse, and activation of motor-related brain areas, explaining why music often induces movement ([Victor Bailey, 2016](https://victorbailey.com/how-different-genres-of-music-affect-your-mood/)).

### 2.2 Opioid System and Musical Pleasure

Endogenous opioids, particularly beta-endorphins, are implicated in the hedonic aspects of musical pleasure. Blocking opioid receptors with antagonists like naloxone reduces the intensity of "chills" or thrills experienced during music listening, suggesting opioids mediate the "liking" aspect of musical reward ([Chanda & Levitin, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.02.007)).

### 2.3 Stress Hormones and Arousal Modulation

Music influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, modulating stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Relaxing music generally lowers cortisol levels and sympathetic nervous system activity, while stimulating music can increase these markers ([Nilsson, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689513/)).

## 3. Physiological and Psychological Effects

### 3.1 Autonomic Nervous System Responses

Music modulates autonomic functions:

| Music Type      | Sympathetic Activity | Parasympathetic Activity | Physiological Effects                        |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Stimulating     | Increases            | Decreases               | Elevated heart rate, blood pressure, respiration |
| Relaxing        | Decreases            | Increases               | Lowered heart rate, blood pressure, respiration |

For example, Stravinsky’s "The Rite of Spring" provoked sympathetic arousal, while Satie’s "Gymnopédie No. 1" increased parasympathetic activity, correlating with psychological states of alertness and relaxation, respectively ([Stevenson et al., 2017](https://aurora.auburn.edu/handle/11200/5003)).

### 3.2 Emotional Perception and Top-Down Processing

Music affects emotional perception via "top-down" cognitive processes, where the brain interprets emotions not inherently present in stimuli but constructed based on context and expectation. This explains why music can alter perception of neutral facial expressions, biasing them towards happy or sad interpretations ([Jolij & Meurs, 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00511/full)).

### 3.3 Mood Improvement and Intentional Listening

Studies show that listening to upbeat music intentionally to improve mood results in greater mood elevation than passive listening. For instance, participants instructed to focus on happiness while listening to positive music reported higher mood improvements ([The Journal of Positive Psychology, 2013](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2012.743520)).

## 4. Music’s Influence on Behaviour

### 4.1 Cognitive Performance and Creativity

Moderate ambient noise (~70 dB) or music without lyrics can enhance creativity and productivity by providing optimal arousal without distraction. However, louder noise reduces creativity due to increased distraction ([Mehta et al., 2012](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/39/5/1137/1829140)).

### 4.2 Social Affiliation and Oxytocin

Music fosters social bonding through synchronized activities like group singing or drumming, which increase oxytocin levels—a neuropeptide linked to trust and social affiliation. Elevated oxytocin during musical activities correlates with feelings of social connection and reduced stress ([Nilsson, 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.02808.x)).

### 4.3 Behavioural Regulation and Emotional Expression

Different genres of music can evoke or regulate specific behaviours and emotions. For example:

- **Rap and R&B:** Can calm or empower listeners, influencing mood and sometimes aggressive behaviour depending on lyrical content ([Slaton et al., 2012](https://prezi.com/)).
- **Classical and Jazz:** Often used for relaxation and focus.
- **Upbeat Pop/Rock:** Enhances motivation and energy, useful in exercise or work contexts ([British Band Instrument Company, 2017](https://britishband.co.uk/)).

## 6. Critical Analysis and Opinion

The evidence strongly supports that music influences mood and behaviour through complex neurochemical pathways involving dopamine, endogenous opioids, stress hormones, and oxytocin. The dual role of dopamine in both anticipation and consummation phases of musical pleasure highlights music's unique capacity to engage reward systems similarly to primary rewards like food or social contact.

However, individual differences such as personality traits, locus of control, and cultural background significantly modulate these effects. Self-selected music tends to be more effective in mood regulation than experimenter-selected music, emphasizing the importance of personal agency.

While many studies demonstrate promising results, methodological limitations such as lack of standardized musical stimuli, inadequate control conditions, and small sample sizes temper the conclusiveness of findings. Future research should employ rigorous experimental designs with appropriate controls to isolate music's unique effects from confounding factors like distraction or social interaction.

In practical terms, music is a powerful, non-invasive tool for mood regulation, stress reduction, social bonding, and cognitive enhancement. Its accessibility and low cost make it an attractive adjunct in therapeutic, educational, and occupational settings.
