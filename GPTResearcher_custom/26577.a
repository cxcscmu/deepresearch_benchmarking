# The Purpose of 9/11: A Comprehensive Analysis

The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, commonly referred to as 9/11, represent a pivotal moment in modern history. Understanding the purpose behind these attacks requires an in-depth examination of the motivations of the perpetrators, the geopolitical context, and the subsequent responses by the United States and the international community. This report synthesizes information from authoritative sources to provide a detailed, objective, and comprehensive analysis of the purpose of 9/11.

## Overview of the 9/11 Attacks

On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 militants associated with the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda hijacked four commercial passenger airplanes. Two planes were flown into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, one crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the fourth crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to regain control ([Wikipedia, 9/11 Commission Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report)). The attacks resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in history.

## The Purpose of the 9/11 Commission

The United States government established the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the 9/11 Commission, on November 27, 2002. The commission's purpose was to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including the nation's preparedness and immediate response. Additionally, the commission was mandated to provide recommendations to prevent future terrorist attacks ([National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, 2004](https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/index.htm)).

The commission interviewed over 1,200 individuals across 10 countries and reviewed more than two and a half million pages of documents, including classified materials. Its final report, released on July 22, 2004, provided a detailed narrative of the events leading up to and following the attacks, as well as policy recommendations ([Wikipedia, 9/11 Commission Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report)).

## Motivations Behind the 9/11 Attacks

### Ideological and Religious Motivations

The attacks were orchestrated by al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, who declared a holy war (jihad) against the United States in the 1990s. Bin Laden and al-Qaeda issued fatāwā (Islamic legal rulings) in 1996 and 1998, which sharply criticized the U.S. government's financial and military involvement in the Arab world, particularly its support for Israel and the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia ([Wikipedia, Motives for the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, in their book *The Age of Sacred Terror*, argue that the 9/11 attacks were primarily religious acts, intended as a sacrament to restore a moral order perceived as corrupted by the enemies of Islam. This perspective frames the attacks not as political or strategic maneuvers but as acts of redemption aimed at humiliating and slaughtering those who defied divine authority ([Wikipedia, Motives for the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

Furthermore, researcher Raymond Ibrahim highlights a dichotomy in al-Qaeda's messaging: Western-directed communications emphasized grievances and retaliation, while Arabic communications contained theological motivations without explicit references to Western actions. This suggests a complex interplay of religious and political motives ([Wikipedia, Motives for the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### Political and Geopolitical Motivations

Bin Laden's grievances included:

- The presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, considered sacred Islamic land, which he viewed as a violation of religious law ([Wikipedia, Planning of the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_of_the_September_11_attacks)).
- U.S. sanctions against Iraq, which he argued caused suffering to Muslim populations.
- U.S. support for Israel in its conflicts with Palestinians and other Muslim groups.
- Military interventions and support for regimes in Somalia, Lebanon, Kashmir, and the Philippines ([Brainly.com](https://brainly.com/question/13496143)).

Bin Laden's "Letter to America" (November 2002) explicitly outlined these motives, blaming the U.S. for supporting Israel and oppressing Muslims worldwide. He justified the attacks as a "holy war" and defended the killing of civilians by arguing that in a democracy, state actions reflect the will of the people ([History for Kids](https://historyforkids.org/9-11-attacks-facts-information-for-kids/)).

### Strategic Goals

The strategic objectives of the 9/11 attacks included:

- Inflicting maximum casualties and psychological trauma on the American population.
- Damaging the U.S. economy, particularly by targeting symbols of economic power such as the World Trade Center.
- Provoking the U.S. into military engagements in Muslim-majority countries, which al-Qaeda hoped would galvanize further support for their cause ([Brainly.com](https://brainly.com/question/13496143)).

Osama bin Laden described the attacks as a means to "bleed America to the point of bankruptcy," aiming to weaken its global influence and military presence ([History for Kids](https://historyforkids.org/9-11-attacks-facts-information-for-kids/)).

## Impact and Consequences

The attacks had profound immediate and long-term effects, including:

- The deaths of nearly 3,000 people and extensive property damage estimated at over $10 billion ([History for Kids](https://historyforkids.org/9-11-attacks-facts-information-for-kids/)).
- The creation of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to enhance airport security ([Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/182790764/september-11-2001-flash-cards/)).
- The initiation of the U.S.-led "War on Terror," including military operations in Afghanistan and later Iraq.
- Widespread changes in U.S. domestic and foreign policy, including anti-terrorism legislation and increased surveillance ([Wikipedia, Reactions to the September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_September_11_attacks)).

## Critical Perspectives on the 9/11 Commission Report

While the 9/11 Commission Report is the official account of the attacks, it has faced criticism. Some analysts argue that the report evades critical examination of leadership failures and does not fully educate the public on the qualities necessary for crisis management ([Wikipedia, 9/11 Commission Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report)).

## Conclusion

The purpose of the 9/11 attacks was multifaceted, combining religious zealotry, political grievances, and strategic objectives aimed at undermining the United States' global standing and provoking a broader conflict. Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda sought to punish the U.S. for its foreign policies, particularly its military presence in the Middle East and support for Israel, while simultaneously aiming to inflict maximum human and economic damage.

The establishment of the 9/11 Commission reflected the U.S. government's commitment to understanding the failures that allowed the attacks to occur and to preventing future terrorism. Despite criticisms of the commission's report, it remains the most comprehensive official account.

In my assessment, the 9/11 attacks were a calculated act of asymmetric warfare designed to exploit the vulnerabilities of a superpower, driven by a complex interplay of ideological, political, and strategic factors. Understanding these motivations is crucial for developing effective counterterrorism policies and preventing similar tragedies in the future.
