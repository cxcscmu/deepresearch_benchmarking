# The Purpose of 9/11: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

The September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks represent a pivotal moment in modern history, characterized by the coordinated hijacking of four commercial airplanes by 19 militants associated with the Islamist extremist group al-Qaeda. These attacks resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths and profound global political, social, and military consequences. Understanding the purpose behind the 9/11 attacks requires an in-depth examination of al-Qaeda's stated motives, the geopolitical context, and the ideological framework that drove the perpetrators. This report synthesizes information from authoritative sources, including the 9/11 Commission Report, al-Qaeda's own communications, and scholarly analyses, to provide a detailed and objective account of the motivations behind the attacks.

## Background: The 9/11 Attacks

On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four passenger planes:

- **American Airlines Flight 11**: Crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 AM.
- **United Airlines Flight 175**: Crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:03 AM.
- **American Airlines Flight 77**: Crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 AM.
- **United Airlines Flight 93**: Crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03 AM after passengers attempted to regain control.

The attacks were unprecedented in scale and impact, leading to the collapse of the Twin Towers and significant damage to the Pentagon, marking the deadliest terrorist act on U.S. soil ([9/11 Commission Report, 2004](https://9-11commission.gov/report/)).

## Al-Qaeda's Stated Motives

Al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, issued several proclamations before and after the attacks that elucidate their motivations. Key documents include the 1996 and 1998 fatāwā (Islamic legal rulings), and bin Laden's 2002 "Letter to America."

### 1. Opposition to U.S. Support for Israel

Bin Laden explicitly cited U.S. support for Israel as a primary grievance, condemning the expansion of Israel as a "great crime" and accusing the U.S. of enabling what he described as oppression and occupation of Muslim lands. This theme recurs in al-Qaeda's rhetoric, linking U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East to the justification for attacks ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### 2. Presence of U.S. Military in Saudi Arabia

Following the 1991 Gulf War, approximately 5,000 U.S. troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. Bin Laden and al-Qaeda viewed this as a desecration and a provocation, interpreting Islamic teachings as forbidding the permanent presence of non-Muslim forces in the Arabian Peninsula. This military presence was a central issue in al-Qaeda's calls for jihad against the U.S. ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### 3. Sanctions Against Iraq

The U.S.-led sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War were characterized by al-Qaeda as a form of mass slaughter, particularly of children. Bin Laden described these sanctions as a "greatest mass slaughter of children mankind has ever known," framing them as justification for violent retaliation ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### 4. Opposition to U.S. Support in Conflicts Affecting Muslims

Al-Qaeda cited U.S. support for military actions and governments perceived as oppressive toward Muslims in Somalia, Chechnya, Kashmir, Lebanon, and the Philippines. These regional conflicts were used to frame the U.S. as an aggressor against the Muslim world ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### 5. Critique of American Morality and Culture

Bin Laden's communications also attacked what he saw as the moral decay of American society, including issues such as fornication, homosexuality, gambling, and materialism, framing the attacks as a response to perceived cultural and spiritual corruption ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

## Inferred and Strategic Motives

Beyond explicit statements, analysts have inferred additional motives based on al-Qaeda's strategic objectives.

### 1. Provocation of War to Incite a Pan-Islamist Revolution

Scholars like Michael Scott Doran and Peter Bergen argue that al-Qaeda aimed to provoke the U.S. into a military response that would galvanize Muslims worldwide against Western powers, potentially sparking revolutions and the establishment of conservative Islamic governments in the Middle East ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### 2. Global Symbolism and Psychological Impact

The attacks were designed as a "global symbolic event" to demonstrate al-Qaeda's reach and to challenge U.S. dominance. Targeting iconic symbols like the World Trade Center and the Pentagon had a profound psychological effect on the American public and the world ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

### 3. Religious Motivation

Some scholars view the attacks as religiously motivated acts of "redemption" intended to restore a moral order according to al-Qaeda's interpretation of Islam. This perspective emphasizes the sacramental nature of the attacks rather than purely political objectives ([Motives for the September 11 attacks, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motives_for_the_September_11_attacks)).

## The 9/11 Commission Report's Findings on Motives

The 9/11 Commission Report corroborates many of the above motives, emphasizing al-Qaeda's intent to attack the U.S. as retaliation for its policies in the Middle East, particularly the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and support for Israel. The report also highlights al-Qaeda's desire to provoke a U.S. military response that would further their ideological goals ([9/11 Commission Report, 2004](https://9-11commission.gov/report/)).

## Conclusion: An Objective Assessment

Based on the comprehensive evidence, the purpose of the 9/11 attacks was multifaceted, combining ideological, political, religious, and strategic objectives:

- **Ideological and Religious**: To wage a declared jihad against what al-Qaeda perceived as a corrupt and oppressive U.S. presence in Muslim lands and to restore a moral order aligned with their interpretation of Islam.

- **Political and Strategic**: To retaliate against U.S. foreign policies, including military presence in Saudi Arabia, support for Israel, sanctions on Iraq, and involvement in conflicts affecting Muslims.

- **Provocative**: To provoke the U.S. into military actions that would inflame anti-American sentiment, potentially uniting Muslims under al-Qaeda's vision and destabilizing pro-Western regimes.

- **Symbolic**: To deliver a powerful psychological blow by attacking iconic symbols of American power and influence.

This analysis aligns with al-Qaeda's own statements and the findings of the 9/11 Commission, supported by scholarly interpretations. The attacks were not random acts of violence but calculated actions grounded in a complex web of grievances and strategic goals.
