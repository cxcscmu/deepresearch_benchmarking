# Report on Whether the Use of CAFOs Compromises Ben & Jerry’s Mission

Ben & Jerry’s, a globally recognized ice cream brand, has built its reputation not only on the quality of its products but also on a strong commitment to social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and progressive values. This report examines whether the use of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in sourcing dairy ingredients compromises Ben & Jerry’s mission. The analysis draws on a broad range of sources, including corporate statements, third-party assessments, and critiques from consumer advocacy groups, to provide a comprehensive and objective evaluation.

## Understanding Ben & Jerry’s Mission and Values

Ben & Jerry’s mission is multifaceted, encompassing product quality, social justice, environmental stewardship, and economic sustainability. The company’s **three-part mission statement** includes:

- **Product Mission:** To make, distribute, and sell the finest quality all-natural ice cream using wholesome ingredients.
- **Social Mission:** To actively recognize the role of business in society by promoting social justice, peace, and environmental sustainability.
- **Economic Mission:** To operate on a sound financial basis that supports growth and creates opportunities for stakeholders ([Ben & Jerry’s, n.d.](https://www.benjerry.com/values/our-progressive-values)).

Their social mission explicitly seeks to **meet human needs and eliminate injustices** locally, nationally, and internationally, integrating these concerns into daily business activities. The company also emphasizes **fair trade, GMO labeling, climate justice, animal welfare, and peacebuilding** as core issues they support ([Mountaintop Creative Group, 2020](https://mountaintopcreativegroup.com/ben-jerrys-a-model-of-social-responsibility/)).

## What Are CAFOs and Why Are They Controversial?

CAFOs, or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, are large-scale industrial agricultural facilities where animals are confined and raised in high-density conditions. These operations are often criticized for:

- **Animal welfare concerns:** Limited space, unnatural living conditions, and routine use of antibiotics.
- **Environmental impact:** Significant water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste management challenges.
- **Economic effects:** Undermining family farms and local economies by prioritizing cheap, mass-produced inputs.

Given these concerns, CAFOs are often viewed as incompatible with sustainable and ethical food production practices.

## Evidence of CAFO Use in Ben & Jerry’s Supply Chain

Despite Ben & Jerry’s public commitment to social and environmental responsibility, the **Organic Consumers Association (OCA)** filed a lawsuit against the company in 2018, alleging **“deceptive labeling, marketing and sale”** of products that suggest high animal welfare standards while sourcing dairy from conventional CAFOs ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/consumer-watchdog-slams-ben-jerrys-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)).

The OCA claims that Ben & Jerry’s **sources dairy ingredients from factory-style farming practices**, which contradicts the company’s marketing term “Caring Dairy.” They argue that these practices contribute to **water pollution in Vermont** and are not socially or environmentally responsible. The OCA further highlights that Unilever, Ben & Jerry’s parent company, spends heavily on advertising to create a perception of commitment to animal welfare and environmental care that is not fully supported by their sourcing practices ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/consumer-watchdog-slams-ben-jerrys-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)).

## Ben & Jerry’s Position on Animal Welfare and Dairy Sourcing

Ben & Jerry’s has historically taken stands against the use of **recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH)** and promotes the use of milk from family farms that do not treat cows with synthetic hormones ([Ben & Jerry’s, 2014](https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2014/corporate-social-responsibility-history)). The company’s **Product Mission** emphasizes natural ingredients and business practices that respect the earth and environment ([Ben & Jerry’s, n.d.](https://bjsocialresponsibility.weebly.com/)).

However, the company does not explicitly state a full avoidance of CAFOs in its supply chain. The **“Caring Dairy” program** is designed to promote better animal welfare and environmental practices among dairy suppliers, but critics argue that it still allows sourcing from large-scale conventional farms that resemble CAFOs in many respects ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/consumer-watchdog-slams-ben-jerrys-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)).

## Alignment of CAFO Use with Ben & Jerry’s Mission

### 1. **Social Mission and Animal Welfare**

Ben & Jerry’s social mission includes **eliminating injustices and promoting quality of life** for communities and animals alike. CAFOs are widely criticized for poor animal welfare conditions, which conflicts with the company’s stated values of respect and care for living beings. The use of CAFOs undermines the company’s commitment to **“contented cows make the best ice cream”**, a phrase they have used to support family farming and humane treatment ([Ben & Jerry’s, 2014](https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2014/corporate-social-responsibility-history)).

### 2. **Environmental Stewardship**

Ben & Jerry’s strives to **minimize negative environmental impacts** and promote sustainable production methods ([Ben & Jerry’s, n.d.](https://www.benjerry.com/values/our-progressive-values)). CAFOs contribute significantly to environmental degradation, including water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The OCA lawsuit highlights that sourcing from CAFOs has led to a **water pollution crisis in Vermont**, directly contradicting Ben & Jerry’s environmental goals ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/consumer-watchdog-slams-ben-jerrys-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)).

### 3. **Economic Justice and Support for Family Farms**

Ben & Jerry’s has a history of supporting **family farms and local economies** through its sourcing policies and social initiatives ([Ben & Jerry’s, 2014](https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2014/corporate-social-responsibility-history)). CAFOs, by contrast, often displace small farms and concentrate economic power in large agribusinesses. This economic model conflicts with Ben & Jerry’s mission to **advance new models of economic justice** that are sustainable and replicable ([Ben & Jerry’s, n.d.](https://www.benjerry.com/values/our-progressive-values)).

## Corporate Governance and Accountability

Ben & Jerry’s is a **Certified B Corporation** with an overall B Impact Score of 110, significantly above the median score of 50.9 for ordinary businesses ([B Corporation, n.d.](https://www.bcorporation.net/find-a-b-corp/company/ben-and-jerrys/)). This certification reflects the company’s commitment to social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.

However, the **governance score (16.7)** and specific critiques regarding supply chain transparency suggest room for improvement, especially concerning the sourcing of dairy ingredients and the use of CAFOs ([B Corporation, n.d.](https://www.bcorporation.net/find-a-b-corp/company/ben-and-jerrys/)).

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the evidence, the use of CAFOs in Ben & Jerry’s dairy supply chain **does compromise the company’s mission** to a significant extent. The core values of Ben & Jerry’s—social justice, environmental sustainability, and economic fairness—are fundamentally at odds with the practices and impacts associated with CAFOs. 

While Ben & Jerry’s has made strides in promoting animal welfare and environmental stewardship through programs like “Caring Dairy” and by rejecting rBGH, the reliance on conventional dairy sources linked to CAFOs undermines these efforts. The **discrepancy between Ben & Jerry’s marketing and actual sourcing practices** has been highlighted by consumer advocacy groups and legal challenges, indicating a gap between mission and practice.

To fully align with its mission, Ben & Jerry’s would need to **phase out sourcing from CAFOs**, increase transparency, and strengthen commitments to truly sustainable and humane dairy farming practices. This would reinforce its position as a leader in corporate social responsibility and maintain consumer trust.
