# Report on Whether the Use of CAFOs Compromises Ben & Jerry’s Mission

## Introduction

Ben & Jerry’s is widely recognized not only for its premium ice cream but also for its strong commitment to social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare. The company’s mission explicitly states a dedication to using innovative methods to make the world a better place, supporting causes like fair trade, GMO labeling, peacebuilding, and climate justice, and ensuring ethical and green supply chains ([Mountaintop Creative Group, 2020](https://mountaintopcreativegroup.com/ben-jerrys-a-model-of-social-responsibility/)). However, allegations and concerns have been raised regarding Ben & Jerry’s sourcing of dairy ingredients from conventional dairy operations, including factory-style farming practices such as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). This report examines whether the use of CAFOs compromises Ben & Jerry’s mission by analyzing the company’s stated values, the nature of CAFOs, and the implications for animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility.

## Overview of Ben & Jerry’s Mission and Practices

Ben & Jerry’s mission is deeply rooted in social and environmental responsibility. Key components include:

- **Caring Dairy Program**: Supports farmers in Vermont, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK to improve farming practices with a focus on animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and fair treatment of farmworkers. This includes adherence to humane cage-free egg policies and incentives for sustainable agriculture ([Ben & Jerry’s Caring Dairy](https://www.benjerry.com/values/how-we-do-business/caring-dairy)).

- **Fair Trade and Non-GMO Commitment**: The company supports fair trade initiatives, ensuring small-scale farmers receive fair compensation, and maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy on GMO ingredients in its supply chain ([Mountaintop Creative Group, 2020](https://mountaintopcreativegroup.com/ben-jerrys-a-model-of-social-responsibility/)).

- **Environmental Initiatives**: Ben & Jerry’s actively reduces carbon emissions through partnerships like the Green Dream Farm Methane Reduction project, helping small farms implement manure treatment technologies to reduce greenhouse gases ([NativeEnergy, 2017](https://nativeenergy.com/ben-jerrys-social-responsibility/)).

- **Social Justice Campaigns**: The company openly supports progressive social causes such as racial justice, climate justice, and LGBTQ equality, often integrating these values into its branding and community engagement ([Mountaintop Creative Group, 2020](https://mountaintopcreativegroup.com/ben-jerrys-a-model-of-social-responsibility/)).

## Understanding CAFOs and Their Impacts

CAFOs are large-scale industrial farming operations that confine animals in high densities for extended periods. They are characterized by:

- **Animal Welfare Concerns**: Animals in CAFOs often endure cramped, barren environments with limited ability to express natural behaviors. Practices such as tail docking, beak clipping, and restricted movement are common. Scientific studies show pigs in CAFOs suffer from joint problems, stress, immunological defects, and abnormal behaviors like tail biting ([Tallboy et al., 2016](https://wuwm.com/post/opposition-flares-around-supersize-pig-farm-proposed-northern-wisconsin#stream/0)).

- **Environmental Harm**: CAFOs produce enormous quantities of waste, often stored in open manure lagoons, which can leak into groundwater and pollute ecosystems. They contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, including methane from manure, which is a potent climate pollutant ([McNerney, 2016](https://owlcation.com/stem/The-Problem-with-CAFOs-Why-They-Are-an-Unsustainable-System-for-Raising-Livestock)).

- **Public Health Risks**: Routine use of antibiotics in CAFOs to prevent disease in crowded conditions leads to antibiotic-resistant bacteria ("superbugs"), posing risks to human health ([Tallboy et al., 2016](https://wuwm.com/post/opposition-flares-around-supersize-pig-farm-proposed-northern-wisconsin#stream/0)).

- **Economic and Social Issues**: CAFOs often undermine small family farms by consolidating production, leading to economic and community impacts ([Tallboy et al., 2016](https://wuwm.com/post/opposition-flares-around-supersize-pig-farm-proposed-northern-wisconsin#stream/0)).

## Analysis: Does the Use of CAFOs Compromise Ben & Jerry’s Mission?

### 1. **Animal Welfare**

Ben & Jerry’s emphasizes animal welfare through its Caring Dairy program, which requires farmers to meet third-party standards for humane treatment, including cage-free eggs and healthy cows. However, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) alleges that Ben & Jerry’s sources dairy from conventional operations that include factory-style farming practices, which are often synonymous with CAFOs ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/ben-jerrys-slammed-by-consumer-group-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)).

Given the documented negative impacts of CAFOs on animal health and behavior, sourcing from such operations contradicts Ben & Jerry’s stated commitment to high animal welfare standards. The company’s marketing around "Caring Dairy" creates consumer expectations of ethical treatment, which may not be fully met if CAFOs are part of the supply chain.

### 2. **Environmental Sustainability**

Ben & Jerry’s actively pursues environmental stewardship, including carbon offset projects and sustainable farming practices. CAFOs, however, are major contributors to environmental degradation through methane emissions, water pollution, and excessive waste production.

While Ben & Jerry’s supports small farms in Vermont with manure treatment projects to reduce emissions, the reliance on conventional dairy farms that use CAFO methods undermines these efforts. The environmental harm caused by CAFOs conflicts with the company’s mission to use renewable and sustainable production methods.

### 3. **Social Responsibility and Transparency**

Ben & Jerry’s positions itself as a socially responsible company advocating for progressive causes and transparency. The OCA lawsuit accuses Ben & Jerry’s of deceptive marketing by implying higher animal welfare standards than those practiced, which raises questions about transparency and social responsibility ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/ben-jerrys-slammed-by-consumer-group-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)).

Moreover, the company’s public stance on issues like fair trade and environmental justice contrasts with the realities of sourcing from CAFOs, which often have negative social and environmental externalities.

### 4. **Corporate Response and Challenges**

Ben & Jerry’s acknowledges the presence of trace levels of herbicides like glyphosate in its products, attributing this to widespread contamination rather than direct sourcing issues ([FoodIngredientsFirst, 2018](https://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/ben-jerrys-slammed-by-consumer-group-over-deceptive-dairy-advertising.html)). The company also emphasizes its Caring Dairy program and partnerships to improve sustainability.

However, the complexity of completely eliminating CAFO-sourced ingredients from a large-scale supply chain presents challenges. Small farms may lack resources to meet demand or implement all sustainable practices immediately.

| Practical Challenges       | Supporting small farms; gradual improvements                 | CAFOs provide large-scale, cost-effective supply    | Partial alignment: Economic realities vs. mission goals |

## Conclusion and Opinion

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the use of CAFOs in Ben & Jerry’s supply chain does compromise the company’s mission to a significant extent. The documented negative impacts of CAFOs on animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility stand in direct contradiction to Ben & Jerry’s stated values and commitments.

While Ben & Jerry’s has taken commendable steps through programs like Caring Dairy and partnerships to reduce environmental impact, the reliance on conventional dairy operations that include CAFO practices undermines these efforts and raises questions about transparency and authenticity in their marketing.

To fully align with its mission, Ben & Jerry’s should intensify efforts to phase out CAFO-sourced ingredients, increase support for small-scale and regenerative farms, and enhance supply chain transparency. This transition, though challenging, is essential to maintain the integrity of the brand and fulfill its social and environmental responsibilities authentically.
