Alright, so I need to talk about how theories of development and educational frameworks influence current practice. Hmm, that sounds a bit broad, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, what are theories of development? I think these are psychological and educational theories that explain how people grow and learn over time. Like Piaget's stages of cognitive development or Vygotsky's social learning theory. These theories try to explain how kids make sense of the world and how their thinking develops as they get older.

Educational frameworks, on the other hand, are like structures or guidelines that schools and teachers use to organize their teaching and learning activities. Things like curriculum standards, lesson plans, and assessment methods fall under this category. So, these frameworks are more about the practical aspects of education.

Now, how do these theories influence current practice? Well, I imagine that educators and policymakers look to these theories to inform how they design their educational systems. For example, if a theory suggests that children learn best through hands-on experiences, then schools might incorporate more experiential learning activities into their curriculum.

Let me think about some specific examples. Piaget's theory emphasizes that children go through distinct stages of cognitive development, and that teaching should be tailored to the child's stage. So, in practice, this might mean that teachers adjust their instruction methods based on the age and developmental level of their students. For instance, using more concrete materials for younger children and introducing abstract concepts as they get older.

Vygotsky's theory focuses on the role of social interaction in learning. He introduced the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, which is the difference between what a learner can do without help and what they can achieve with guidance and encouragement from a skilled partner. This has led to teaching practices like scaffolding, where teachers provide support to students as they learn new skills, gradually removing that support as students become more competent.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is another theory that influences education. It suggests that before students can engage in learning, their basic needs like safety and belonging must be met. So, schools might focus on creating a positive and supportive environment where students feel safe and valued.

In terms of educational frameworks, curriculum standards are a big influence. These standards outline what students should know and be able to do at each grade level. They guide what teachers teach and how they assess student learning. For example, the Common Core State Standards in the U.S. specify learning objectives in math and language arts from kindergarten through high school.

Assessment methods are also crucial. Theories about how students learn can inform how they are evaluated. For instance, if a theory emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, assessments might include problems that require analysis and synthesis rather than just memorization.

Moreover, educational technologies are increasingly influencing practice. Theories about how people learn with technology can shape how digital tools are integrated into the classroom. For example, constructivist theories might lead to the use of educational software that allows students to explore and discover concepts on their own.

I should also consider how these theories and frameworks interact with real-world constraints. Schools have limited resources, varying student populations, and different cultural contexts. So, while theories provide ideals, practitioners have to adapt them to fit their specific situations.

Perhaps I should look up some current educational practices and see how they align with these theories. For example, project-based learning is gaining popularity. This approach emphasizes learning through doing, which aligns with constructivist theories like those of Piaget and Vygotsky. Students work on projects that require them to apply knowledge and skills to real-world problems, promoting deeper understanding and engagement.

Another example is the flipped classroom model, where students watch lectures at home and do homework in class. This approach is influenced by theories that suggest students learn better when they can discuss and apply concepts in a social setting, like Vygotsky's social learning theory.

I should also consider the role of standardized testing, which is a significant aspect of many educational frameworks. Some theories might critique this practice, arguing that it doesn't capture the full range of student abilities or that it narrows the curriculum to tested subjects. However, policymakers often use test scores to measure school effectiveness and allocate resources.

Maybe I should consider how these influences play out in different subjects. For example, in language education, theories of second language acquisition inform teaching methods. The communicative approach, which focuses on meaningful communication over grammatical perfection, is based on theories that emphasize the importance of interaction in language learning.

In science education, inquiry-based learning is popular, which aligns with theories that stress the importance of active exploration and discovery in understanding scientific concepts.

It's also interesting to think about how these theories and frameworks affect teacher training. Prospective teachers learn about these theories in their education courses and are taught methods that are aligned with them. So, the influence starts right from the beginning of a teacher's career.

Moreover, ongoing professional development encourages teachers to stay updated with the latest research and theories, further shaping their practices.

I should probably look into some recent studies or articles to see what experts are saying about this topic. Maybe there are new developments or debates in the field that I should be aware of.

Explain how the theories and frameworks influence current practice
Theories of development are very important as these theories and frameworks can heavily influence current practice and help us to understand the complexities of children‚Äôs behaviours their reactions and can also help us figure out different and new ways of learning. Starting with the constructivist approach (piaget). Piaget worked on intelligence testing and during this period he realised that children would consistently give wrong answers to certain questions so he began to consider and review why this was.

He used his own children in the testing and his theory was often referred to as a constructivist approach as he suggested children constructed thoughts according to the experiences around them. Piaget‚Äôs beliefs helped people understand why children‚Äôs thinking is sometimes different from our own. The belief was seen to be that as the children develops so does there way of thinking. Piaget‚Äôs work has been seen to influence hands on approach to teaching children and also to create a specific teaching plan for an individual child dependent on their way of thinking and learning.
Explain how the theories and frameworks influence current practice Essay Example
This is something that Priors Court School does engage in their approach to teaching the children we look after. Freud‚Äôs theory was one of personality / psychoanalytic, Freud is famous for his psychosexual theory of development which is used to explain unconscious thoughts or actions. Freud‚Äôs theories suggested that there were three parts that made up our personality. The ‚Äúid‚Äù the ‚Äúego‚Äù and the ‚Äúsuper-ego‚Äù. The id is the instinctive part of a child‚Äôs personality, this is said to be the child knowing what it needs in regards to the body, hunger or finding pleasure.
A child will be born with its id and once its needs are met ie being hungry and then getting fed is known as gratification. Then the ego works out the best way to meet the id needs of the child. The ego is often seen as the common sense part of our personality and usually starts in the first few months of living. Freud‚Äôs theories are generally seen as useful within professional circles and have been criticised for not standing up against scientific scrutiny. Freud‚Äôs theory is a good one to look at in relation to the teaching of children but not on to necessarily taken as fact.
Next Maslow, Maslow‚Äôs theory was one of motivation and personality, often known as the humanist approach saying that motivation and personality are linked to our basic needs being met. The conclusion of Maslow‚Äôs theory was that people have certain fundamental needs which need to be met before they could fill their full potential ‚Äúself ‚Äìactualisation‚Äù This was demonstrated in Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of needs pyramid. The way in which this links to current practice is that when working with children and young people it is essential that their needs are met.
Professionals working with children need to strive to create a stimulating environment for children and form strong relationships with them. Bandura social learning theory was a behaviourist approach that suggests that people learn from watching others. This is often referred to as observational learning. This links in with current practice due to the fact that children will often learn a lot of social behaviours by the way in which people act around them.
In Priors Court School for example we make sure that we are good role models to our students by being polite and showing positive behaviours. Operant conditioning is a theory that was pioneered by Skinner, and it is a theory that is based on the type of consequence that is given following a particular behaviour. Skinner divided the consequences of actions into three groups, positive rein forcers, negative reinforcers and punishers. Skinner looked at what would happen to behaviour if giving positive reinforcers at different intervals.
Most professionals and practitioners will use this theory in one way or another such as giving rewards for good behaviour or sanctions for bad behaviour so the theory is well used in today‚Äôs frameworks and practices. To conclude, the professionals that have looked at the theories of development have greatly helped the framework and current practice of looking after children and young people. And in my opinion helped and improved the practitioners and professionals capability to look after autistic children.

2.3 Explain how theories of development and frameworks to support development influence current practice.
You will need to read up on various development theories and give brief summaries on each
Humanist: Maslow
Cognitive: Jerome Bruner, Jean Paiget
Operant Conditioning: Skinner
Psychoanalytic: Fraud
Child development that occurs from birth to adulthood was largely ignored throughout much of history. Children were often viewed simply as small versions of adults and little attention was paid to the many advances in cognitive abilities, language usage, and physical growth. Interest in the field of child development finally began to emerge early in the 20th-century, but it tended to focus on abnormal behavior.
An understanding of child development is essential, allowing us to understand the cognitive, emotional, physical, social and educational growth that children go through from birth and into early adulthood. Some of the major theories of child development are known as grand theories; they attempt to describe every aspect of development, often using a stage approach. Others are known as mini-theories; they instead focus only on a fairly limited aspect of development, such as cognitive or social growth.
The following are just a few of the many child development theories that have been proposed by theorists and researchers. More recent theories outline the developmental stages of children and identify the typical ages at which these growth milestones occur.
Psychoanalytic Child Development Theories
Sigmund Freud
The theories proposed by Sigmund Freud stressed the importance of childhood events and experiences, but almost exclusively focused on mental disorders rather that normal functioning.
According to Freud, child development is described as a series of 'psychosexual stages.' In "Three Essays on Sexuality" (1915), Freud outlined these stages as oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital. Each stage involves the satisfaction of a libidinal...

How theories of development and frameworks to support development influence current practice
Theories of development and frameworks to support development are incredibly important to us working with children and young people. They help us to understand children, how they react to things/situations, their behaviour and the ways they learn. Different theories and ways of working with children have come together to provide frameworks for children‚Äôs care, such as Early year‚Äôs foundation stage (EYFS) which is used within all child care settings. This encourages us to work together, help and check the development of babies, children and young people, to keep them healthy and safe. It promotes teaching and learning to ensure a child is ready for school etc. Some of the theorists and their theories that have a huge influence in current practice (where elements are also included and used within the EYFS) are: Ivan Pavlov ‚Äì behaviourist
Pavlov believed in ‚Äòconditioning‚Äô his research started with dogs who salivated when their food was put down for them. He noted that whilst ringing a bell when the dogs‚Äô food was put down resulted eventually in the dogs still salivating at the sound of the bell ringing even if no food was put appeared. This is because he had conditioned them to do so. Gradually after a while of just the bell ringing the dogs‚Äô conditioned response to salivate weakened until they finally did not react ‚Äì called ‚Äòextinction‚Äô. This is a useful theory to help us understand the reasoning/behaviour of a child for example, having a phobia of going to the toilet in a new/strange place. Since he/she has been conditioned not to like the new/strange place and may refuse to go inside. This is where the conditioning is linked to an irrational fear and it is best to try to get him/her not to link the two and ‚Äòun-condition‚Äô him/her.

The Essay on Classical Conditioning Dog Conditioned Pavlov
When ever the bell rings in any school in any nation you are guaranteed to see students and teachers file into the hallway. This automatic response comes from something that has been around for a long time called classical conditioning. Classicalconditioning was discovered and researched by Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist. His famous experiment with his dog is known to nearly everyone who has  ...
B.F Skinner ‚Äì behaviourist
Skinner suggested that humans and animals learn from exploring their
environment then drawing conclusions based upon consequences of their behaviour. He divided the consequences into three groups. Positive reinforcers- Likely to repeat their behaviour when they get something they desire. He suggested this was the most effective way of encouraging new learning. Positive reinforcers for children include gaining adult attention, praise, stickers, sweets and treats. Negative reinforcers- Likely to make people repeat behaviour as well but the behaviour is being repeated to stop something from happening i.e. children who are going down the slide too quickly will learn to use their hands to stop themselves as they are unhappy about the speed. Punishers- Likely to stop behaviour from being repeated i.e. staying away from the plug socket after receiving an electric shock.
Albert Bandura ‚Äì social learning
Bandura suggested children learn from watching adults ‚Äì referred to as ‚ÄòBobo doll experiment‚Äô. Three groups of children watched a film of a variation in behaviour in adults towards a doll. Group A ‚Äì saw the adult behave aggressively towards the doll. Group B ‚Äì saw the adult behaving aggressively towards the doll and then rewarded by sweets from another adult. Group C ‚Äì saw the adult being aggressive but then told off by another adult. After the film the children were observed in a playroom with toys and the bobo doll. Group A and B were similar, this telling they was not influenced by the reward but more influenced by the telling off. Afterwards they were all asked to imitate what happened to the doll and they could all copy the adult‚Äôs actions. Therefore adults within a setting are expected to act and behave in an appropriate and healthy manner, speaking politely to children and to each other and to generally act as a good role model, as the children will learn a lot of their social behaviour through observation of the adults around them.

The Essay on How communication skills support children‚Äôs learning
Speech, Language and Communication skills can support a child‚Äôs learning, emotions, behaviour and socialisation massively, and these are just a few examples. Language Language can support learning Speech, Language and Communication skills in many ways and one of these ways that they can do this is by using and making different sounds and symbols, spoke as well as signed language. This then has  ...
Jean Piaget ‚Äì constructivist
Piaget was a zoologist who became interested in children‚Äôs development after working on intelligence tests. He noted that children often gave similar wrong answers to some questions. He used his own children to do observations. He suggested that children constructed or built up their thoughts according to their experiences of the world around them. He felt¬†that their learning was an ongoing process and that children may have to adapt their ideas if new information contradicted their conclusion or ‚Äòschema‚Äô a term Piaget used. An example of his work was, a group a toddlers receive milk in a blue beaker and become to think that milk is just served in blue beakers, until one day they are given juice in a blue beaker, then they have to reconsider and realise juice, milk and other things come in blue beakers. Stages of learning in Piaget‚Äôs theory are: Assimilation ‚Äì the child constructs a theory (schema)
Equilibrium ‚Äì the child experiences to date fit everything (so everything balances) Disequilibrium ‚Äì an experience occurs that casts doubt on the schema (things don‚Äôt add up) Accommodation ‚Äì the child changes the original schema to fit in the new piece of experience or information.
Lev Vgotsky ‚Äì constructivist
Vgotsky believed children‚Äôs social environment and experiences are very important. He saw children as apprentices learning and gaining understanding through being with others (scaffolding).
He also suggested that maturation was an important element in children‚Äôs development and parent/carers should extend children‚Äôs learning so they can use emerging skills and concepts. He used the term ‚Äòzone of proximal development‚Äô or ‚Äòpotential‚Äô He said that people working will children need to extend and challenge their thoughts so that their zone of proximal development can emerge. He also stressed the importance of social interaction and the need of adults to work alongside children. He thought direct teaching was important and that children should be active in their learning. Vgotsky‚Äôs theory has been extremely influential in the current practise. Children are encouraged to interact and have a ‚Äòhands on‚Äô approach to learning. Children and quite often given and carry out tasks together or to generally help each other out.

Sigmund Freud
Freud suggested our personalities are made up of three parts, the id, ego and superego. Not all parts are present at both, only the id, but develop through childhood. The id ‚Äì the instinctive part of the personality. Governed by drives and needs of body such as, hunger or finding pleasure.
The id does not consider how meeting desires and wants will affect others and is thought of as quite selfish, i.e. a baby crying and crying until it gets what it wants (food) not considering the need of the mother, needing sleep maybe. The ego ‚Äì has a planning role. Works out how to meet the id‚Äôs needs and desires in the best way i.e. the baby may learn that smiling in some situations will get what he/she wants and in other situations it may be better to cry. The ego is the common sense part of the personalities and sometimes make the id wait for its demands like waiting to be offered a cake rather than snatching one as they may have it taken from them this is ‚Äòdeferred gratification‚Äô. Superego ‚Äì develops later in childhood. It tries to control the go. It comprises of the conscience and the ego-ideal. The conscience will punish the ego if it misbehaves. This is where guilt comes from. The ego-ideal will reward the ego if it shows good behaviour. This is a source of pride and confidence. Freud‚Äôs theory has been criticised, however his theory is still useful to consider when observing a child‚Äôs link between our un-conscience actions and our minds.
Abraham Maslow ‚Äì humanist
Maslow looked at people‚Äôs motivation and needs. He suggested that people had certain fundamental needs that had to met before they could fulfil their full potential or ‚Äòself-actualisation‚Äô. Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem then self-actualisation. If a child‚Äôs ‚Äòbasic needs‚Äô were not met then this would cause a deficiency in that person. These needs are hierarchical but all have to met before the person can achieve self-actualisation. This is certainly influenced with current practise and extremely important and crucial whilst working with children and young people that we make sure we think about the environment around them and forming positive supportive relationships and recognising that a child needs warmth and shelter, food and love and the promoting of self-esteem for them to fulfil their full potential or ‚Äòself-actualisation‚Äô.

3 EXPLAIN HOW THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORKS TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT INFLUENCE CURRENT PRACTICE.
Theories of development offer insights into the forces guiding childhood growth and what can affect them.
Each offers insight but each has limitations, which is why developmental scientists use more than one theory to guide their thinking about the growth of children.
Current practice is based on many years of knowledge and experience. This helps us to understand children learning, development and behavior.
Research is ongoing and new information becomes available all the time. This means it is important that we keep our knowledge up to date and use new ideas in practice.
Research into child development is an ongoing process. It is continuously influenced by new ideas which are based on established theory.
Some of psychology‚Äôs best known theorists have developed theories to help explore and explain different aspects of child development. Today we can draw on a variety of theories and perspectives in order to understand how children grow, behave and think.
There have been several theorists who have given many different theories that we know and use today. These theories try to explain how children develop and at what rate or pattern. This gives us a framework for understanding the process of development. Working with just one framework could stop us from exploring other views, so it is important that we look at and learn from theories from several different areas -
* Cognitive theories focus on internal states such as motivation, problem solving, decision making and attention. * Social learning theories focus on how children learn and acquire new knowledge. * Behavioural theories, also known as behaviourism are theories based upon the idea that all behaviours are acquired through conditioning. Today behavioural techniques are used in therapeutic settings to help children learn new skills and behaviours. * Psychoanalytical theorists

2:3 Research the following theories of development; explain how the theories and frameworks influence current practice.
Theories of development are:
1. Cognitive (e.g. Piaget).
2. Psychoanalytic (e.g. Freud).
3. Humanist (e.g. Maslow).
4. Social learning ( e.g. Bandura).
5. Operant conditioning (e.g. skinner).
6. Behaviourist (e.g. Watson).
Frameworks to support development are:
1. Social pedagogy.


Theories of development are very important as these theories and frameworks can heavily‚Ä¶
Piaget‚Äôs theory of learning for cognitive development says children create a schema based on their experiences, when something unexpected happens to the child, the child will adapt the schema to include the new information. Based on this theory early years schools have a child centred teaching approach. Teachers will look at the children‚Äôs needs and plan activities accordingly. Piaget‚Äôs theory has also influenced the way professionals manage children‚Äôs behaviour. For example the rewards or incentives‚Ä¶
are different views about the way in which psychological and physical development continue throughout our life span. In addition to individual differences, development psychologists agree that development occurs in an orderly way and in different areas at the same time. However it is clear that this can happen continually or discontinually.

Theories of development can influence current practice into childcare as they show us how to understand a child‚Äôs developmental processes. It can help us to identify‚Ä¶
us different types of experiments and factors about the development of the individuals children‚Äôs behaviour, reactions and ways of learning.
Theories of development including:
‚Ä¢ Cognitive (e.g. Piaget)
‚Ä¢ Psychoanalytic (e.g. Freud)
‚Ä¢ Humanist (e.g. Maslow)
‚Ä¢ Social Learning (e.g. Bandura)
‚Ä¢ Operant conditioning (e.g. Skinner)
‚Ä¢ Behaviourist (e.g. Watson)

How theories of development and frameworks to support development influence current practice

Theories of development and frameworks to support development are incredibly important to us working with children and young people. They help us to understand children, how they react to things/situations, their behaviour and the ways they learn. Different theories and ways of working with children have come together to provide frameworks for children‚Äôs care, such as Early year‚Äôs foundation‚Ä¶

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they say.

First, there's a mention of various development theories like Piaget's cognitive development, Freud's psychoanalytic theory, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Bandura's social learning theory, Skinner's operant conditioning, and Vygotsky's social learning theory. Each of these theories offers a different perspective on how children grow and learn.

Piaget's theory, for example, suggests that children go through distinct stages of cognitive development, and educators should tailor their teaching methods to match the child's stage. This has led to more age-appropriate curricula and teaching strategies in schools.

Freud's psychoanalytic theory, though controversial, has influenced how professionals understand children's behaviors and emotional development. ItÂº∫Ë∞É‰∫ÜÊó©ÊúüÁªèÂéÜÂØπ‰∫∫Ê†ºÂΩ¢ÊàêÁöÑÈáçË¶ÅÊÄßÔºåÂ∞ΩÁÆ°ÂÖ∂Êüê‰∫õËßÇÁÇπÂèóÂà∞ÊâπËØÑÔºå‰ΩÜÊï¥‰Ωì‰∏äÂØπÂøÉÁêÜÊ≤ªÁñóÂíåÂÑøÁ´•ËæÖÂØºÂÆûË∑µ‰∫ßÁîü‰∫ÜÂΩ±Âìç„ÄÇ

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is another influential theory that emphasizes the importance of meeting basic physiological and safety needs before higher-level needs like self-esteem and self-actualization can be addressed. In educational settings, this translates to creating a safe and supportive environment where students feel secure and valued, which is essential for their learning and development.

Bandura's social learning theory suggests that people learn by observing others, particularly role models. This has implications for how teachers and caregivers model behavior, as children are likely to imitate what they see. Therefore, positive role modeling becomes a key strategy in education and childcare.

Skinner's operant conditioning theory focuses on how behavior is shaped by consequences, such as rewards and punishments. This theory has been applied in educational settings through behavior modification techniques, where desired behaviors are reinforced and undesirable ones are discouraged.

Vygotsky's social learning theory emphasizes the role of social interaction in learning. His concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) highlights the importance of scaffolding, where more knowledgeable others provide support to help learners achieve tasks they couldn't do alone. This has led to collaborative learning approaches and the use of peer tutoring in classrooms.

In addition to these theories, educational frameworks like curriculum standards and assessment methods also play a crucial role in shaping educational practices. For instance, the Common Core State Standards in the United States outline specific learning objectives for each grade level in math and language arts, guiding what teachers teach and how student progress is measured.

Moreover, educational technologies are increasingly influencing teaching methods. Theories about how technology can facilitate learning have led to the integration of digital tools and resources in classrooms, such as interactive whiteboards, educational software, and online learning platforms.

However, it's important to note that real-world constraints can affect how these theories and frameworks are implemented. Factors like resource availability, diverse student needs, and cultural contexts must be considered when applying theoretical principles in practice.

Looking back at the search results, one document mentions project-based learning and the flipped classroom model as examples of how these theories are applied in current educational practices. Project-based learning aligns with constructivist theories by encouraging active exploration and application of knowledge, while the flipped classroom model supports Vygotsky's ideas about learning in a social context.

Another point raised is the role of standardized testing in educational frameworks. While theories may suggest alternative assessment methods, the reliance on standardized tests persists due to policy decisions and accountability measures.

Furthermore, the influence of these theories extends to teacher training and professional development. Educators are trained to understand these theories and incorporate them into their teaching practices, ensuring that the latest research and ideas inform their work.

In conclusion, theories of development and educational frameworks significantly influence current educational practices. They provide the foundational knowledge and guidelines that shape how teachers teach, how students learn, and how educational systems are structured. By staying informed about these theories and frameworks, educators can better support the holistic development of their students.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Theories of development and educational frameworks profoundly influence current educational practices by shaping teaching methods, curriculum design, assessment strategies, and overall educational approaches, ensuring that educators can effectively support students' cognitive, social, and emotional growth.}} \]
