Alright, so I need to figure out what caused the Glorious Revolution. I don't remember a lot about it, but I know it happened in England, and it was called "Glorious" because it was relatively peaceful compared to other revolutions. But beyond that, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think I should start by understanding what the Glorious Revolution was and then dig into what led up to it.

First things first, I should probably define what the Glorious Revolution is. From what I recall, it was a period in English history around the late 17th century where there was a transition in monarchs, and it somehow avoided a lot of the bloodshed that other revolutions had. I think it involved James II being replaced by William and Mary. But why did that happen? What were the issues that led to his replacement?

I think I need to look into the events leading up to the Glorious Revolution to understand its causes. Maybe it had something to do with religious conflicts, political power struggles, or perhaps social unrest. Perhaps a combination of these factors. Let me try to piece this together step by step.

Starting with the monarchs involved, James II was king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was a Catholic monarch in a predominantly Protestant nation, and that might have been a significant issue. I think there were concerns about his religious affiliation affecting the governance of the country, maybe even fears that he was trying to restore Catholicism as the state religion.

Was there any legislation or actions taken by James II that alarmed the Protestant establishment? I seem to recall that he suspended certain laws that imposed restrictions on Catholics, which might have raised eyebrows among the Protestants who held power in Parliament. This could have been seen as an attempt to strengthen Catholic influence in England.

Moreover, James II had a son, which changed the line of succession. Before his son's birth, the next in line was his daughter Mary, who was Protestant and married to William of Orange, a staunch Protestant. But with a male heir, who would likely be raised Catholic, there was a worry that the Catholic dynasty would continue, which might have been unacceptable to the Protestant majority.

So, the fear of a permanent Catholic monarchy could have been one of the main causes. But I also think there were broader political issues at play. There was a struggle between the monarchy and Parliament over who held ultimate authority. The English Bill of Rights, which was enacted after the Glorious Revolution, established parliamentary sovereignty and certain rights and liberties, suggesting that there were disputes over power before the revolution.

Maybe James II was seen as too autocratic or absolutist in his rule, similar to Louis XIV of France, and this went against the growing desire for a constitutional monarchy in England. If that's the case, then the Glorious Revolution could be seen as a move to limit the powers of the monarch and enhance the role of Parliament.

Another factor might have been foreign policy. William of Orange was from the Netherlands, and there were likely geopolitical considerations. Perhaps inviting him to take the throne was strategic to counter the influence of France, which was a major rival at the time.

I also recall that there were previous events, like the English Civil War and the Restoration, that set the stage for the Glorious Revolution. Maybe the lessons learned from those periods influenced the course of the Glorious Revolution.

To get a better grasp of this, I think I should look up some key dates and events surrounding the Glorious Revolution. Let me see... James II ascended to the throne in 1685, and the Glorious Revolution took place in 1688, so it was a short reign. In that time, what did James II do that provoked such a reaction?

I think I need to do some research to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. Maybe look for reputable sources that can provide a clear overview of the causes of the Glorious Revolution.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{The Glorious Revolution was caused by a combination of factors including religious tensions due to James II's Catholicism, concerns over his alleged attempts to restore Catholicism, the struggle for power between the monarchy and Parliament, and fears of a permanent Catholic dynasty after the birth of James II's son.}} \]
