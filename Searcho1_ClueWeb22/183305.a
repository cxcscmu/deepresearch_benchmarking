So I have this question: "How does music influence mood and behavior?" Hmm, that's an interesting topic. I've noticed that different types of music can make me feel different ways. For example, when I listen to upbeat songs, I feel more energetic and happy, but when I hear slower, softer tunes, I feel more relaxed or even sad sometimes. I wonder if this is just me or if there's actually science behind it.

I think to answer this properly, I need to understand a few things. First, what is mood exactly? Mood is like a general feeling or emotional state that persists over some time, right? It's not as intense as emotions, which can be more fleeting. Behavior, on the other hand, is how we act or conduct ourselves. So, how does music affect these two aspects?

I recall that music can trigger certain responses in our brain. Maybe it's related to the way our brains process different frequencies or rhythms. There might be some neurological explanations here. Also, cultural factors could play a role. What one culture considers happy music might be different from another culture's perspective.

Maybe I should start by looking up some studies or research papers on this topic. It would be helpful to see what experts have to say. I can try searching for "music influence on mood and behavior" or something similar. Let me think about the best way to phrase my search query to get relevant results.

Alright, let's try this: <|begin_search_query|>impact of music on mood and behavior<|end_search_query|>

Everyone feels emotion and everyone has different ways of dealing with or expressing their emotions.  Many people use music to do such things.  Music can evoke extreme feeling in people.  It can also affect the behavior of people.  Most music listeners find music that soothes them or heeds to their emotion although sometimes the music can control the emotion of the listener.

Rap Music
This type of music plays a major role with our emotions and mood.  Music in general but especially R&B  music has been know to calm and rationalize someone in a way that other things cannot.  Some types of  R&B music are listened to because they give someone a sense of power. Usually, a person picks music based on the mood they are in.“ R&B  music has a calming effect.  It can bring mental relief and healing to someone in distress. “
Music has the ability to elicit emotion from its listeners: happiness, sadness, relaxation, frustration and aggression are feelings conjured up by music. Our research showed  that the violent and sexist lyrics found in rap music is a stimulus for aggressive behavior. Since music drives emotion the violent angry lyrics presented by rap music elicits an aggressive attitude. These songs activate awareness of sexist beliefs that already existed in the listeners brain and thus evoke a mental association between rap music and sexist attitudes.

Almost all the subjects of my study agreed that music affect them in many ways. When they listen to sad music they respond in same manner. And when they listen to happy music they feel themselves happy
It has also been proven through the research that people enjoy more when they listen to familiar music or their favorite one. I think the power of music to induce positive emotions may be a reason why one listens to a piece of music again and again. Music is increasingly being used to enhance well-being, reduce stress and distract patients from unpleasant symptoms

How Music Affects the Mood: The Science, Research, and Facts
Home> music psychology> mood
How Music Affects the Mood
Music has been part of human society for millennia. It has long been understood that music impacts our feelings and mood, but the reasons for that impact have not been studied until very recently.
Now, brain scans and psychological research are discovering the mechanisms that lead to mood changes or mood regulation that are associated with music. This includes why listening to different kinds of music improves focus, helps to manage mood during stress, or improves mood during times of sadness.
Why Do We Listen to Music?
In a psychological survey conducted in 2013 examining the reasons why people listen to music, analysis found that listed reasons included:
Regulating mood and stress (arousal)
Achieving self-awareness
Expressing social relatedness
The first two reasons in this list were found to be more important than the third. Music was reported to be deeply personal, often used in the foreground as a way of improving motivation or focus, or used in the background as a means of regulating mood and easing stress. Using music as a method of relating to friends or family, identifying culturally, or expressing oneself to one’s peers was less common.
Most psychological studies involving music have been conducted on people in the westernized world, but some cross-cultural studies have found that unfamiliar music from other cultures can still be interpreted in similar ways. For example, Western listeners could tell whether a song was intended to be happy or sad even when it was from an unfamiliar culture like Navajo Native American, Kyrghistani, or Hindustani. A survey conducted of people in a remote tribe living in Cameroon found that most listeners easily identified when Western music was happy or sad.
For example, listeners agreed that when songs were soft or slow, they were supposed to reflect sadness; jaunty and fast-paced music at a moderate volume was interpreted as happy.
It seems that, across cultures, certain features of music are common to all experiences, suggesting that they developed in similar ways to regulate or inspire similar emotional experiences.
How the Reward System and Dopamine Relate to Music
One of the first studies in the emotional association with music was conducted by Leonard Meyer in 1956. Meyer analyzed the fifth movement in Beethoven’s masterpiece, String Quartet in C-sharp major, Op. 131. After examining the tonal changes and measures, Meyer concluded that creating unfulfilled expectations caused suspense and tension in the listener, which leads to the emotional response to fulfilled expectations.
Listening to music triggers physical changes indicating emotional arousal.
Listening to our favorite songs will make us happy, which is indicated by the following:
Dilated pupils
Rising blood pressure
Faster pulse
Lowered electrical conductance on the skin
Activation of areas of the brain involved in physical movement
The cerebellum is highly activated by our favorite songs, triggering increased blood flow to the legs. This may be part of why dance is so closely associated with nearly every genre of music. The region of the brain most impacted by almost every type of music in the world is also the area that makes us want to move, even if this is just tapping our feet or bobbing our heads.
One study conducted by Montreal researchers closely examined the brains of 217 volunteers, looking for people who experienced “chills” when listening to music. They narrowed the group down to 10 study subjects, then watched that group’s brains as they listened to playlists of their favorite songs. Though the group was small, the playlists stretched across dozens of genres, representing a wide range of music taste. Images from the brains of these 10 participants found that favorite music releases dopamine in two places in the brain, the dorsal and ventral striatum. These areas typically light up from pleasurable stimuli, whether it is a hug or a drug; however, the team concluded that music could effectively trigger this release as well.
The Montreal research team also found that listening to favorite music caused an “anticipatory effect,” similar to a Pavlovian response of excitement. This effect occurred during familiar, expected, but enjoyed swells or changes in the songs. This anticipation effect was also found in people who were unfamiliar with the song, but who expected certain patterns in the music that did not pay off until later or even at the end of the song.
Emotional Perception When Listening to Music
In 2012, a research team at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands found that music deeply impacted what the listeners perceived were their emotions. The two lead psychologists asked participants to rank their happiness or sadness using emoticons. They found that, while listening to music, participants rarely used the neutral facial expression response even when no smiling emoticon was shown as an option.
They concluded that this represented a “top-down process” in the brain, when the mind interprets something about the world that is not inherently there.
The most common example of this is when you interpret something about your surroundings based on what you see. The 2012 research found that there was an emotional top-down process, similar to the visual top-down process, which occurred when examining one’s own emotions.
Another study compared songbirds experiencing bird songs to humans experiencing music. They found that both birds and humans experienced changes in their amygdala with some kinds of music. For birds, the songs were discordant while for humans, the music was categorized as “melancholy” or about “unrequited love.” Songs that triggered a rush of limerence or new love tapped into the mesolimbic reward system in both humans and birds.
Yet another 2012 study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, reported that ambient noise at a moderate volume of about 70 decibels, which is about the volume of a vacuum cleaner, could improve creativity. Listening to louder noise than that, however, reduced creativity through distraction. Music without lyrics could be a form of ambient, soothing noise to improve not just mood, but also productivity and creativity.
A study conducted in 2013 reported that people who listened to upbeat music improved their moods and happiness, for the long-term, within two weeks. The first of two listed studies found that listening to 12 minutes of music associated with positive mood intentionally elevated mood compared to a group who listened to any music without focusing on improving their mood.
In the second study, participants were instructed to listen to music with a happy valence. One group was told to intentionally improve their mood while listening, and the other group was not given other instructions. Those in the second study who were told to focus on being happier while listening to happy music reported greater elevation in mood compared to the other group.
Music Ignites Passion and Imagination
Most people in the modern world listen to several genres of music thanks to the ease of access to hundreds of radio stations, streaming music services, in-store music, and subscription downloads. Listening to music is a much more private experience than ever before, and finding one musical genre that you love is easier than ever before. However, certain aspects of music work on almost all of us, which means that music can be used in a variety of settings to ease stress, inspire confidence, and increase productivity.

How Music Affects Your Behaviour, Mood and Personality

Music remains one of the most magical, inexplicable, and fulfilling aspects of the human experience. It can be a simple distraction or a work of art, but the science behind it remains the same. Music is sound, a vibration, organized over time.
From work to school, mental health research to developmental studies, music has proven to have a profound impact on humans. This article will explore how music affects your behaviour, mood and personality.
HOW MUSIC AFFECTS YOUR BEHAVIOUR
Listening to Music in the Workplace
Similar to working out, music can help you stay focused and active, even when you’re carrying out mundane or repetitive tasks.
Teresa Lesiuk, an assistant professor, working on a music therapy program at the University of Miami, researches the effect of music in the workplace. She studied various information technology specialists who listened to music while completing some task. She found that those who listened to music completed certain tasks more quickly and produced more creative ideas than others. Lesiuk believes that a large part of this is due to how music affects one’s mood.
In a survey conducted by PRS, seventy-three percent of workers were more productive when background music was being played, sixty-five percent of businesses say music in the workplace makes them more productive.
While many of the research remains anecdotal, it still signifies the power music can have on distancing one’s self from the chaos of reality and finding a rhythm and structure to doing one’s task. It can enhance focus and efficiency.
Always remember that songs that you like can be very helpful in getting your work done. However, here is a list that can help you concentrate when doing a task:
Flying lotus – Flotus
Jon Hopkins – Lost in Thought
Slowly Drifting – Chris Russell
Baroque Classical – Serenade in G Major
Blue in Green – Miles Davis
Music Can Help You Learn
With all the positive effects of music on your brain and body, it is not difficult for people to draw the connection between music and its effect on learning new concepts or ideas.
One of the most popular theories is the “ Mozart Effect ”, which claims that playing the compositions of the classical composer, Amadeus Mozart, can raise the IQ of those listening. Researchers from both Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin have conducted tests that suggest music can raise one’s overall IQ by about ten percent. These studies’ findings remain disputed however.
Whether the Mozart Effect is real or just an urban legend, we have already discussed the ability of music to allow its listener greater control over their cognitive abilities. The same goes for learning in a classroom or a library- music can block out the external world while helping the student remain concentrated on whatever they are studying.
Recommended Music to Help You Study
Dr. Georgi Lozanov spent over 30 years of studying how music affects memory and learning. These pieces are proven by Dr. Lozanov to help you concentrate in your studying.
Here are some of the pieces of classical music you can play:
Concerto in D Major of Beethoven
Concerto No. 7 in D major of Mozart
Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor for Piano and Orchestra of Tchaikovsky
Concerti Grossi No. 2, 5, 8 and 9 of Corelli, Op. 6
Symphony No. 67 in F major and Symphony No.69 in B. Major of Haydn
Music Can Affect Your Driving
In a survey carried out by the London Metropolitan University, the pace of music played in a car can affect how the driver performs and how fast they drive. They found that mid-tempo music, such as The Scientist by Coldplay or Cry Me a River by Justin Timberlake were the safest songs to drive to.
Hip-hop music resulted in the most dangerous or risky driving, while metal resulted in the fastest driving from the male participants. The researchers believe that setting a medium paced song will best assist drivers.
HOW MUSIC AFFECTS YOUR MOOD AND PERSONALITY
Rather unsurprisingly, one’s mood can be affected significantly by the music they listen to. But in a study published in PLOS ONE by Durham University in the UK and the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, listening to sad music was able to elicit both joyful and melancholy sentiments.
Another study published in the Journal of Consumer Research suggested that people tend to listen to sad music when they are going through a painful loss or breakup because music can have a comforting and reassuring feeling.
People tend to connect to music most when it tends to highlight their particular situation or express the emotion they are attempting to achieve. So if someone is trying to stay relaxed and calm, playing a slow and soft song can be more appropriate. On the other hand, if you want to feel self-confident and hyped up, playing hip-hop and rock music can make you feel more energized.

How Music Affects Mood
We’ve all experienced an emotional connection with music. A good song can make us feel happy or sad, in love or angry. In recent years, scientific studies have confirmed the connection between music and mood.
Some studies have found that listening to music you enjoy may increase the release of pleasure-causing substances in the brain like norepinephrine and melatonin. It may also decrease stress-causing hormone production in the body. As a result, music therapy has the power to do the following:
Reduce stress/ease anxiety
Improve sleep
Lessen depressed mood
Create positive mood
Boost self-confidence
Increase energy
Keep in mind, clinical depression is a serious disorder that should be addressed by a mental health professional, who can help you develop an individualized treatment program.

Music and Disease: What’s the Connection?
Music has also been shown to help relieve depressed feelings associated with conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
People suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or dementia may be able to uncover some memories through music therapy. Scientists believe music stimulates areas inside the brain responsible for both emotion and long-term memory, allowing for the recovery of memories.
In the short-term, vibroacoustic therapy, or physical treatment using sound vibrations, has been shown to ease symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and fibromyalgia. During the therapy, sound vibrations at a low frequency are absorbed through the body. Researchers have found that the technique improves Parkinson’s symptoms, including reducing tremors. Studies are ongoing to determine the long-term effects of the therapy.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me go through them one by one to see what they say about how music influences mood and behavior.

First document is from Prezi, created by Kalyna Slaton in 2012. It's about how music affects mood and behavior. It mentions that music can evoke extreme feelings in people and can affect behavior. It specifically talks about rap and R&B music, saying that rap music can elicit aggressive behavior due to its violent and sexist lyrics, while R&B music can have a calming effect and provide mental relief. So, this suggests that different genres of music can have different impacts on mood and behavior.

Second document is a research paper from SSRN by Nawaz Ahmad and Afsheen Rana titled "Impact of Music on Mood: Empirical Investigation." The abstract says that their research aimed to examine listeners' responses to music and found that people believe music has a strong impact on their mood and behavior. The research indicates that music can influence people positively and negatively. So, this seems like a more general study showing that music does affect mood and behavior, but it doesn't specify how.

Third document is from CloudCoverMusic.com, discussing how music affects mood, backed by science and research. It mentions that music has been part of human society for millennia and has long been understood to impact feelings and mood. The article talks about how music can regulate mood and stress, help manage mood during stress, or improve mood during sadness. It also mentions that music can be used to enhance well-being, reduce stress, and distract patients from unpleasant symptoms.

The article references a 2013 psychological survey that found people listen to music mainly to regulate mood and stress, achieve self-awareness, and express social relatedness. It seems that regulating mood and stress is particularly important. The article also notes that music can be deeply personal and is often used in the foreground to improve motivation or focus, or in the background to regulate mood and ease stress.

Moreover, the article discusses cross-cultural studies showing that unfamiliar music from other cultures can still be interpreted similarly in terms of emotions like happiness and sadness. For example, Western listeners can identify whether a song from a different culture is meant to be happy or sad based on characteristics like tempo and volume.

The article delves into the science behind music's emotional impact, mentioning the reward system and dopamine release in the brain. It refers to a study where listening to favorite songs led to physical changes indicating emotional arousal, such as dilated pupils, rising blood pressure, faster pulse, and lowered skin conductance. It also mentions activation of brain areas involved in physical movement, suggesting a connection between music and motor functions.

Another point is that listening to favorite music releases dopamine in the dorsal and ventral striatum areas of the brain, which are associated with pleasurable stimuli. The article also mentions an "anticipatory effect" similar to a Pavlovian response, where listeners experience excitement in anticipation of familiar and enjoyable parts of a song.

Furthermore, the article cites a 2012 study from the University of Groningen that found music deeply impacted listeners' perception of their own emotions, leading them to rarely choose neutral facial expressions when rating their emotions while listening to music.

Another study compared the brain responses of songbirds to music and found similarities in how both humans and birds respond to certain types of music, with changes in the amygdala in response to discordant music in birds and melancholic music in humans.

Additionally, a 2012 study in the Journal of Consumer Research suggested that ambient noise at a moderate volume can improve creativity, but louder noise can be distracting and reduce creativity. Music without lyrics can serve as ambient noise to improve mood, productivity, and creativity.

Lastly, a 2013 study reported that listening to upbeat music can improve mood and happiness over two weeks. The study found that intentionally trying to improve mood while listening to happy music was more effective than just listening without that intention.

So, this article provides a wealth of information about how music affects mood through various neurological and psychological mechanisms.

Fourth document is from BBICO.com, titled "How Music Affects Your Behaviour, Mood and Personality." It discusses the impact of music in different settings, such as the workplace, learning environments, and while driving.

In the workplace, the article mentions that music can help stay focused and active, especially during mundane tasks. It references a study by Teresa Lesiuk at the University of Miami, who found that IT specialists who listened to music completed tasks more quickly and generated more creative ideas than those who didn't. Lesiuk attributes this to music's impact on mood.

A survey by PRS found that 73% of workers are more productive when background music is played, and 65% of businesses say music in the workplace makes them more productive. The article emphasizes that preferred music can enhance focus and efficiency.

Regarding learning, the article mentions the "Mozart Effect," which suggests that listening to Mozart's music can temporarily boost IQ. While this claim is disputed, the article acknowledges that music can help block out distractions and aid concentration.

The article recommends specific classical music pieces for studying, based on research by Dr. Georgi Lozanov, who studied the effects of music on memory and learning.

In terms of driving, the article cites a survey by London Metropolitan University that found the pace of music can affect driving behavior. Mid-tempo music like "The Scientist" by Coldplay or "Cry Me a River" by Justin Timberlake was considered safest for driving, while hip-hop led to riskier driving, and metal caused faster driving among male participants.

This suggests that the tempo and genre of music can influence driving behavior.

Fifth document is from UPMC HealthBeat, titled "How Music Improves Our Mood and Health." It discusses the connection between music and health, both physical and psychological.

The article notes that music can bring people together and has been shown to prompt real improvements in health. It mentions that listening to music you enjoy may increase the release of pleasure-causing substances in the brain, like norepinephrine and melatonin, and decrease stress-causing hormones.

As a result, music therapy can:

- Reduce stress and ease anxiety

- Improve sleep

- Lessen depressed mood

- Create a positive mood

- Boost self-confidence

- Increase energy

The article emphasizes that while music can help with mood, clinical depression requires professional treatment.

Moreover, music has been shown to help relieve depressed feelings associated with conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.

For Alzheimer's patients, music can stimulate areas of the brain related to emotion and long-term memory, potentially helping to recover memories.

Vibroacoustic therapy, which uses low-frequency sound vibrations, has been shown to ease symptoms of Parkinson's disease and fibromyalgia, reducing tremors in Parkinson's patients.

The article concludes by highlighting the connection between music and mood, and how improved mood can lead to better overall health, including better physical health, lifestyle decisions, and relationships.

So, summarizing all this information:

- Music affects mood and behavior through various neurological and psychological mechanisms.

- Different genres and tempos of music can elicit different emotional responses and behavioral changes.

- Listening to music can release dopamine, a feel-good neurotransmitter, and influence mood-regulating hormones.

- Music is used therapeutically to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, and to improve sleep and overall well-being.

- In specific contexts like the workplace and learning environments, music can enhance focus, productivity, and creativity.

- The type of music listened to can influence behavior, such as driving habits.

- Cross-cultural studies show that certain musical elements universally convey emotions like happiness and sadness.

Given all this, it's clear that music has a profound impact on both mood and behavior, with applications in therapy, education, and everyday life.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Music influences mood and behavior through neurological and psychological mechanisms, affecting emotions, stress levels, cognitive functions, and even physical responses. Different genres and tempos evoke varying emotional reactions and can be utilized in therapeutic settings, workplaces, and educational environments to enhance well-being, productivity, and learning.}} \]
