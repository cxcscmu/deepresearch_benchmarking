So I have this question: "How has 9/11 changed America?" It's a big topic, and I know that 9/11 was a really significant event in U.S. history. I need to think about the different ways it impacted the country.

First off, I remember that on September 11, 2001, there were terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Nearly 3,000 people died in these attacks, and it was a huge shock to the nation. So, one way it changed America is through the loss of life and the sense of vulnerability that came from an attack happening on U.S. soil.

I think about how security measures increased after 9/11. For example, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the implementation of the Patriot Act. These were measures aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks, but they also raised concerns about civil liberties and privacy. So, there's a trade-off between security and personal freedoms that became a ongoing debate in American society.

Another area where changes occurred was in foreign policy. The U.S. launched the War on Terror, invaded Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, who were harboring al-Qaeda, and later invaded Iraq based on the belief that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorism, although that turned out not to be true. These wars have had lasting impacts on the regions and on U.S. relations with other countries.

Economically, 9/11 had an impact too. The attacks led to a recession, and the costs of the wars and increased security measures have been substantial. Additionally, the travel industry was heavily affected, with many people being hesitant to fly or travel internationally.

Culturally, 9/11 has left a mark on American society. It's a day that's etched in memory for many people who lived through it. There are memorials, like the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York, that serve as reminders of the event and its victims. Also, the way Americans view their place in the world might have changed; there's perhaps a greater awareness of global issues and terrorism.

I should also consider how 9/11 affected political discourse in the U.S. It probably intensified partisan divisions, with debates over immigration, Islamophobia, and national security becoming more prominent.

Moreover, the way media covers events has changed. There's now a heightened sensitivity to reporting on terrorism and national security issues. The 24-hour news cycle and social media have also played roles in how information about such events is disseminated.

I think another aspect is the increase in security at public venues, airports, government buildings, etc. Security checks are more rigorous, and there's a greater presence of law enforcement and military personnel in certain areas.

Also, the concept of homeland security became a major focus, leading to the development of new agencies and protocols for responding to domestic threats.

In terms of personal behavior, many Americans may have altered their daily routines or attitudes towards travel and safety.

I should probably look up some specific statistics or examples to support these points. Maybe see what experts have said about the long-term effects of 9/11 on America.

Let me try searching for some information.

September 11, 2001 is known to be one of the most devastating days in history. To this day, September 11 has been the largest terrorist attack in the United States with 2,996 deaths and over 6,000 wounded. They not only crashed the Twin Towers but the crashed them with our planes. Due to the crash, it “...resulted in a dramatic change in our nation’s attitudes and concerns about safety and vigilance” (Green, 2016).  The impact left behind after the attack changed the United States tremendously. Although there were many dramatic impacts that followed the crash, I found two in which seemed to have the biggest impact on the United States. Surveillance has increased tremendously since the crash resulting in the loss of privacy rights. The article How 9/11 Changed America it states “...the the National Security Agency alone.. violated privacy laws thousands of times per year since 2008” (Green, 2016). This shows that we have lost our privacy rights due terrorist attack.
Another major impact that occurred was that it started ongoing wars. Not even a complete month passed when U.S. troops invaded Afghanistan in an attempt to dismantle al-Qaeda, the terrorist group presumed to have attacked the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. Later on, in 2003, the United States invaded Iraq to remove President Saddam Hussein, even when he took no part in the attack of September 11. They accused him of creating and distributing weapons that were used in the terrorists attack, although none were ever

TEACHERS: Your students are too young to have lived through the 9/11 attack, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t impacted their lives. The Perspectives Youth Media Challenge offers them a chance to tell their stories. Maybe they have a parent, older sibling or cousin who served in Afghanistan. Maybe they have seen anti-Muslim sentiment in their own communities. Invite them to share how 9/11 has affected their lives with the Perspectives Challenge. (Preview the curriculum here .)
Updated Sept. 9, 2021
Twenty years ago, the United States wasn't officially engaged in any wars. Few of us had ever heard of al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, and ISIS didn't even exist.
We deported half the number of people we do today. Our surveillance state was a fraction of its current size. And — perhaps hardest to believe — we didn't have to take off our shoes to go through airport security.
America’s involvement in the War on Terror — prompted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks — resulted in a dramatic change in our nation's attitudes and concerns about safety, vigilance and privacy.
It ushered in a new generation of policies like the USA Patriot Act, prioritizing national security and defense, often at the expense of civil liberties.

Lasting impacts of 9/11 lesson plan (PDF)
These changes continue to have ripple effects across the globe, particularly in the Middle East, where American-led military operations helped foment rebellions and ongoing warfare throughout the region.
Below are four of the many dramatic impacts — nationwide and in California — resulting from the events of that one tragic day.
I. ‘Forever Wars’
Less than a month after 9/11, U.S. troops invaded Afghanistan in an attempt to dismantle al-Qaeda — the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the attacks — and remove the Taliban government harboring it. Two years later, in March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq and deposed President Saddam Hussein. Although not directly linked to the terrorist attacks, Hussein was suspected of producing weapons of mass destruction (none were ever found). The invasion was a key part of America's newly launched War on Terror, under the leadership of President George W. Bush.
Our military involvement in Afghanistan — which just ended calamitously in August, with the Taliban reclaiming control of the country — was the longest war in American history.
9/11:  Lessons Learned | The New York Times
Watch on
In December 2011, remaining U.S. troops were pulled out of Iraq, leaving that nation in a far more volatile state than when military operations first began in 2003. But the U.S. soon after resumed intermittent air strikes following the emergence of the Islamic State extremist group, which sprouted from the chaos of war and terrorized the region.
In 2002, the Bush Administration also opened the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, where it began sending suspected enemy combatants. Held indefinitely, prisoners were denied access to trials or legal representation, and were subject to brutal interrogation techniques. There were more than 650 foreign inmates at the facility by 2003.
Critics have long pushed to shut down the Guantanamo facility, calling it a gross violation of basic human rights and a stain on America's image abroad. And although early in his first term, Obama vowed to close it — and significantly reduced the population — he failed to completely shut it down. Former President Donald Trump was intent on keeping it open, and even sought, unsuccessfully, to refill it. Today, Guantanamo has fewer than 40 prisoners, but still remains operational.
After 9/11, budgets for defense-related agencies skyrocketed: Homeland Security's discretionary budget jumped from about $16 billion in 2002 to more than $43 billion in 2011. Meanwhile, the budgets of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration and Border Patrol have all more than doubled since 2001.
Over the last 20 years, millions of young U.S. soldiers have been deployed overseas, thousands have been killed and many have returned home with debilitating physical and mental injuries.
Since the start of post-9/11 U.S. military operations, some 7,000 American troops have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the latest figures from the U.S. Department of Defense. That marks just a tiny fraction of total casualties in the two conflicts, which have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians, as well as contractors, journalists, allied troops and opposition fighters.
Meanwhile, more than 52,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq have been wounded in action over the last 20 years. And many more have returned home physically intact but suffering from severe long-term mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and psychological ailments linked to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Thousands of veterans of the two conflicts have taken their own lives.
California impact
California is second only to Texas in its contribution of recruits to the U.S. military.
As of this year, 776 men and women from across the state have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, accounting for 11% of total U.S. casualties — more than any other state — according to an LA Times database.
As the Times reports, “Nearly 20% of California’s war dead were old enough to die for their country but too young to buy a drink. They left behind 453 children.”
Four of the 13 U.S. troops killed In the Aug. 26 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport gate were Marines from California. Occurring just days before the official end of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, the attack also killed dozens of Afghan civilians — one of the deadliest bombings in the almost two decades since the U.S.-led invasion.
This Week: The 9/11 Generation Comes of Age
Watch on
II. Immigration and Deportation
The Bush Administration created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, a cabinet-level office that merged 22 government agencies. The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service -- both formerly part of the Department of Justice -- were consolidated into the newly formed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The agency has overseen a massive increase in deportations; they have nearly doubled since 9/11.
According to the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, there were roughly 200,000 annual deportations a year between 1999 and 2001. While that number dropped slightly in 2002, it began to steadily climb the following year. In the first two years of the Obama Administration (2009 - 2010), deportations hit a record high: nearly 400,000 annually. About half of those deported during that period were convicted of a criminal offense, although mostly low-level, non-violent crimes.
Sponsored
The Secure Communities program, established in 2008 and officially phased out in 2014, allowed local law enforcement to check the immigration status of every person booked in a county or local jail -- even if not ultimately convicted of a crime -- by comparing fingerprints against federal immigration records. The program resulted in numerous instances of undocumented immigrants entering deportation proceedings after being stopped for minor infractions (like not using a turn signal while driving).
By 2014, when Obama announced plans to phase out the program, ICE had established Secure Communities partnerships with every single law enforcement jurisdiction in the nation (all 3,181 of them).
California impact
In 2009, Jerry Brown — then California’s Attorney General — agreed to implement the Secure Communities. As of 2012, ICE reported it had taken nearly 48,000 “convicted criminal aliens” in California into custody. Almost half of them were deported, even though less than a quarter had been convicted of offenses considered “serious or violent.”
California is the primary destination for foreign nationals entering the country, and home to a quarter of America's immigrant population. Of the nearly 10 million immigrants (both naturalized and undocumented) residing in the state, an estimated 4.3 million are Mexican, 28% of whom are naturalized, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.
The Effect of 9/11 on Immigration
Watch on
III. The Friendly-ish Skies
Long airport lines, full body scans, the occasional pat-down (for the lucky ones). It's all par for the course when you fly these days. But not so long ago, it wasn't unusual to show up at the airport a half-hour before a domestic flight, keep your shoes tied tight, and skip through the metal detector while sipping a Big Gulp, all without ever having to show an ID.
Before the advent of color-coded security threat warnings, pat downs were rare, liquids were allowed, and the notion of having to go through full-body scanners was the stuff of science fiction. Heck, prior to 9/11, some airport security teams even allowed passengers to take box cutters aboard (the supposed weapon used by the 9/11 hijackers). Any knife with a blade up to four inches long was permitted. And cigarette lighters? No problem!
In the wake of the terrorist attacks, airport security underwent a series of major overhauls. And a service that was once largely provided by private companies is now primarily overseen by the massive Transportation Security Administration.
Created in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the TSA is tasked with instituting new security procedures and managing screenings at every commercial airport checkpoint in the country (although, private contractors still operate at some airports). It marks the single largest federal start-up since the days of World War II. The agency is authorized to refer to watch lists of individuals who could pose flight safety risks.
Although advocates argue that the changes have made air travel safer, the additional security steps have also tacked on a significant amount of travel time for the average passenger, while sometimes infringing on privacy rights and, in many instances, increasing scrutiny of minority travelers, particularly those of Middle Eastern descent.
How 9/11 changed air travel
Watch on
IV. Big surveillance
The U.S. intelligence state boomed in the wake of 9/11. The growth resulted in a marked increase in government oversight, primarily through a vast, clandestine network of phone and web surveillance.
Classified documents that were leaked in 2013 by former government contractor Edward Snowden detail the expansion of a colossal surveillance state that's seeped into the lives of millions of ordinary Americans. The exponential growth of this apparatus -- armed with a $52.6 billion budget in 2013 -- was brought to light when the Washington Post obtained a "black budget" report from Snowden, detailing the bureaucratic and operational landscape of the 16 spy agencies and more than 107,000 employees that now make up the U.S. intelligence community.
Further audits reveal that the National Security Agency alone has annually scooped up as many as 56,000 emails and other communications by Americans with no connection to terrorism, and in doing so, had violated privacy laws thousands of times per year.

Conclusion - 9/11
Conclusion
9/11 was a turning point in American history because it had a major effect on our society. Our economy plunged into debt following the attacks. There was no money left for politics and many people increased their drug and alcohol use. The way we travel on airplanes will never be the same. We are subject to severe surveillance before entering onto a plane and subject to harsh carry-on regulations. We may never have a more costly attack ever again. This has shaped our economy and will continue to shape it in years to come.

5 Ways September 11 Changed America
The attacks of 9/11 shocked the nation—and led to changes that altered U.S. government, travel and culture.

September 11, 2001 is an inflection point—there was life before the terrorist attacks and there is life after them. Nearly 3,000 Americans were killed on that clear, sunny morning when two hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, another plowed into the Pentagon and a fourth was brought down in a crash on a Pennsylvania field by heroic passengers who fought back against terrorists.
“This was an attack unprecedented in the annals of terrorism in terms of its scale,” says Brian Michael Jenkins, a senior advisor to the president of the RAND Corporation and author of numerous reports and books on terrorism, including Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?. “It was the largest attack by any foreign entity on U.S. soil.”
READ MORE: 9/11: A Timeline of the Attacks
The shock and horror of September 11th wasn’t confined to days or weeks. The attacks cast a long shadow over American life from which the nation has yet to fully emerge. What was once implausible and nearly unthinkable— a large-scale attack on American soil —became a collective assumption. The terrorists could very well attack again, perhaps with biological or nuclear weapons, and steps must be taken to stop them.
“Terrorism is aimed at carrying out acts of violence that will cause people to exaggerate the strength of the terrorist and the importance of their cause,” says Jenkins.
Consumed by fear, grief and outrage, America turned to its leaders for action. Congress and the White House answered with an unprecedented expansion of military, law enforcement and intelligence powers aimed at rooting out and stopping terrorists, at home and abroad.
“After the 9/11 attacks, the combination of fear and a recognition of various intelligence failures led to a range of policy changes that included restrictions on immigration, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and the expansion of the ‘no fly list’ from a very small number of people to thousands,” says David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at New America who studies terrorism and violent extremism.
And that was just the beginning. Here are five significant ways that America was changed by 9/11.
WATCH: 9/11 Documentaries on HISTORY Vault
1. The War on Terror Began

When President George W. Bush addressed Congress and the nation on September 20, 2001, he made a case for a new kind of military response; not a targeted air strike on a single training facility or weapons bunker, but a wide-ranging global War on Terror.
“Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there,” said Bush. “It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.”
When American troops invaded Afghanistan less than a month after September 11th, they were launching what became the longest sustained military campaign in U.S. history. The fight in Afghanistan had support from the American people and the backing of NATO allies to dismantle al Qaeda, crush the Taliban and kill Osama bin Laden, the murderous mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.
American support for the War on Terror became mixed as the campaign continued for years in an effort to target multiple terrorist cell and rogue regimes across the world. Thousands of American troops were killed in the first two decades of the War on Terror and many more returned home with physical and psychological wounds. Yet the ever-present shadow of 9/11, Jenkins says, kept U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan and elsewhere for nearly 20 years.
“What’s made it so difficult to back out of these conflicts is that fear that if we leave, we will leave behind a vacuum,” says Jenkins. “And in that vacuum the terrorists will return.”

2. Air Travel Was Transformed
One of the most disturbing aspects of the 9/11 attacks was that 19 al Qaeda hijackers were not only able to board commercial aircraft with crude weapons but also force their way into the cockpit. It was clear that 9/11 was both a failure of America’s intelligence apparatus to identify the attackers and a failure of airport security systems to stop them.
Even though there had already been a handful of high-profile hijackings and bombings of commercial planes, including the tragic 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, security was not a high priority for airlines before 9/11, says Jeffrey Price, a professor of aviation and aerospace science at Metropolitan State University and a noted aviation security expert.
“Airports had security departments and employees wore badges and they did screenings, but none of it was nearly at the level of what we do today,” says Price.
Before 9/11, people didn’t have to have a ticket to wander around the airport or wait at the gate. No one checked passengers' IDs before boarding the plane. And the only item people had to remove when passing through security was loose change from their pockets. Price says that most airports didn’t bother running background checks on their employees, and checked baggage was never scanned.
LISTEN: Blindspot: The Road to 9/11
All of that changed with the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, an entirely new federal agency authorized by Congress in November of 2001.
“It was an extraordinary undertaking,” says Price. “They tried to create the ultimate aviation security system from scratch. Within a year, TSA had well over 50,000 employees.”
In addition to an army of blue-uniformed screeners, TSA introduced U.S. travelers to extensive new security protocols. Tickets and photo IDs became required to get through the screening area. Laptop computers and electronics had to be removed from carry-on bags. Shoes were taken off. Liquids were restricted to three-ounce containers. And conventional X-ray machines, which only detected metal objects, were eventually replaced with full-body scanners.
TSA officers were also trained in “behavior detection" to recognize a list of actions considered suspicious—gripping baggage tightly, appearing confused and disoriented, signs of a recently shaved beard—that would flag a traveler for additional screening. Behind the scenes, the FBI’s new Terrorist Screening Center compiled a Terrorist Watch List of hundreds of thousands of individuals, around 6,000 of whom were placed on a “No Fly” list, including 500 Americans.
3. Anti-Muslim Violence Grew

Just four days after the 9/11 attacks, a gunman in Mesa, Arizona went on a shooting rampage. First, he shot and killed Balbir Singh Sodhi, a gas station owner of Indian descent. Sodhi was Sikh, so he wore a turban. The gunman assumed he was Muslim. Minutes later, the gunman shot at another gas station clerk of Lebanese descent, but missed, and then shot through the windows of an Afghan-American family.
Even as politicians and law enforcement repeatedly stated that Islam was a peaceful religion whose true teachings had been twisted by terrorist extremists, many people in America and around the world still equated the 9/11 attacks with Islam and sought vengeance on anyone that even looked Muslim.
In the year 2000, there were only 12 anti-Muslim assaults reported to the FBI. In 2001, that number skyrocketed to 93. As civil liberties organizations criticized the TSA and law enforcement for the racial profiling of Arab and Muslim men, hate crimes against Muslims persisted. Statistics from the FBI showed there were 91 reported aggravated or simple assaults motivated by anti-Muslim bias in 2015 and in 2016, that figure surpassed 2001 numbers, reaching 127.

4. Surveillance Increased
WATC H HERE: Why the Patriot Act Is So Controversial
The Patriot Act was passed just six weeks after 9/11 as lawmakers scrambled to fix the intelligence failures that allowed known terrorists to enter the United States and execute the deadliest plot in American history. The controversial act authorized sweeping changes in how domestic intelligence agencies like the FBI conducted surveillance. Long-standing rules meant to protect Americans from “unreasonable search and seizure” were loosened or thrown out in the name of national security.
The fear, again, was that the 9/11 attacks were just the beginning, and that more terrorist cells were active in American cities and awaiting orders to strike. In order to find these “ terrorists among us ,” Congress gave the FBI and NSA new abilities to collect and share data. For example, the Patriot Act gave intelligence agencies the power to search an individual’s library records and internet search history with little judicial oversight. Agents could search a home without notifying the owner, and wiretap a phone line without establishing probable cause.
While civil liberties groups fought back against what they saw as unconstitutional breaches of privacy under the Patriot Act, an even more controversial law was passed in 2008, the FISA Amendments Act. This law gave the NSA nearly unchecked authorities to eavesdrop on American phone calls, text messages and emails under the premise of targeting foreign nationals suspected of terrorism.
5. America Became Safer, But Altered

In the years since 9/11, Americans inspired by jihadist ideology have killed 107 people in domestic terrorist attacks (as of September 2020). Almost half those deaths occurred in one horrific shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, but there have been no large-scale terrorist attacks on U.S. cities like the ones many believed would inevitably follow September 11th.
“If anyone had said this is what they expected the threat to be the day after 9/11, they probably would have been laughed at,” says Sterman. “That would have seemed hopelessly naive.”
The security measures put in place after 9/11 appear to have foiled or discouraged another ambitious plot by foreign agents on American soil. But in the process, says Jenkins, the country has faced an “endless” War on Terror that has indelibly altered the fabric of American life.

On September 11, 2001-a day that will never be forgotten- the United States experienced one of the worst terrorist attacks. 19 radicalist associated with al-Qaeda carried out a suicide attack at the world trade center, pentagon and pennsylvania killing approximately 3,000 people. (9/11 attack) Out of the three attacks, the planes that flew into the twin towers at the world trade center in New York City was the most destructive. The whole nation was in a state of shock as many watched the horrific event happening on live television. The smoke coming out of the buildings, people jumping out of windows in desperate hopes of escaping the fire, and people crying on the streets as they watch everything happen. It called for a time of togetherness and support for one another. Although it is its 16th year anniversary, we can still see its effect today. Americans perspective changed on muslims, creation of homeland security and the constant war on terror are some of the long lasting effects the 9/11 attack had on America.
It’s no question that 9/11 changed Americans perspective on muslims in a negative way. According to Ohio State University’s nation poll, about 20% of americans said they are unwilling to have a muslim friend (Sirota). It increased by more than double from previous poll which was 9%. They have also concluded more Americans are likely to oppose restrictions on muslim Americans. Although the dictionary definition of terrorism is “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims, its connotation has changed. Now people think of terrorism as a violent act that is committed by muslims. For example the travel ban, also known as the muslim ban, is a bill that allows the president to stop “certain groups of people from six majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States” (Lind). According to Jennifer Williams, “Between 2001 and 2015, more Americans were killed by homegrown right-wing extremists than by Islamist terrorists”,( Lind) This shows that we automatically associate muslims with terrorists activities but when an American does a horrific act we usually oversee it as a mental issue. According to polls conducted by Reuters/Ipsos, with nearly a majority of the poll, 49 percent “strongly” or “somewhat” agreed with the ban, while 41 percent “strongly” or “somewhat” disagreed and ten percent of them were undecided (Giaritelli). More people decide for it than against it which shows Americans view on muslims and their civil liberties.
Like the travel ban, the U.S has many agencies and bills that help with the overall safety and security of the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are amongst the 22 agencies under Homeland Security which was created in 2002 under president Bush. Homeland security was created as a direct aftermath of the terrorist attack. These agencies have become a part of an everyday American lives when traveling, dealing with cyber security issues or simply a natural disaster. According to Homeland security’s yearbook of immigration statistics, after 9/11 deportation doubled, from 200,000 before the attack to 400,000 (Green). The transportation Security Administration has changed the way people traveled forever. Before 9/11 and homeland security was created, liquid was allowed on flights and full body scanners were like science fiction. Now, we have occasional pat-downs, full body scans, thorough search on people and their belongings. That used to be done by private companies of the airport but now that is a federal responsibility. Now it has grown so much that not only do they try to prevent terrorist attacks but they also prepare for any man-made or natural disasters.
The most important long lasting effect of 9/11 is how the war on terror affected the country in many aspects. In 2001, same year as the attack, President Bush declared war in Afghanistan to find justice on Osama Bin Laden. A year later, he declared war on Iraq for mass destruction. This has been one of the longest wars as it only came to an end in 2011. According to a study by “The Balance”, U.S economy section, the cost of the two wars for homeland security is approximately $1.146 trillion under Bush, 807 billion under Obama, and budgeted 156 billion under Trump (Amadeo). In total it was $ 2.126 trillion, a big increase in spending, which resulted in the U.S debt crisis increase. This war on terror is still an ongoing fight as terrorism seems to be never ending. In may of 2011 the leader of the Al-Qaeda group that was behind the attack, Osama bin Laden, was confirmed dead. The U.S SEALS six team under President Obama, were able to successfully find and kill the terrorist leader. The countries deep involvement in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq have created an even bigger problem like ISIS.
ISIS stands for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The creators of ISIS focused mainly on the unwanted involvement of the U.S in the middle east. They have made propaganda videos saying just that and have been able to recruit many including American citizens. According to research from the New America foundation, ISIS has claimed 7 attacks in the U.S that lead to 82 deaths. The director of counterterrorism, Nick Rasmussen, expressed his concern about the growing number of recruited ISIS American members and stated according to the U.S intelligence “150 American citizen and residents have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria’s foreign fighters”(Alfred). It’s not only people who travel to Syria that have become a concern but especially those who living on U.S soil and fully support the beliefs of ISIS. Myre of the two-way breaking news stated “Virtually all the deadly attacks since Sept. 11, 2001, have been carried out by homegrown extremists”. Now the effort is not just war on terror in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq but also to stop Americans from joining or committing such an act.
One thing we can’t forget, the soldiers. Because of this long war on terror, there have been thousands dead and many suffering physical or mental issues. In total, there were 2 million deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. According to U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations, 6,000 soldiers were dead and 44,000 were wounded. (Green) From those 18% of them suffered from Post Traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD) and about 20% suffered from Traumatic brain injury(TBI). The war on terror would not just affect the veterans but their families too.
Many would have never imagined that the 9/11 attacks would still affect everyday lives 16 years later but it surely is. President Bush handled the attack well by taking action and creating Homeland Security and declaring war on terror in efforts to protect the country in the future. Security has become so much tighter at so many places especially when traveling. Many places around the country have emergency preparedness plans in place for all types of disasters because of the agencies under Homeland Security. A big accomplishment was made on Bush’s war on terror when the SEAL 6 successfully killed Osama Bin Laden under president Obama. The war on terror has been ongoing ever since the 9/11 attack and will continue until terrorism is stopped. The war on terror affected the economy negatively, changed America’s perspective on muslims and caused physical and mental injuries to many soldiers. The biggest problem it created is ISIS which doesn’t like U.S involvement in the middle east. Although 9/11 had many negative impacts, it did not break the country but unite and make it stronger.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can gather from these documents to answer the question about how 9/11 changed America.

From Doc 1, it seems like the social impact of 9/11 was significant. It mentions increased surveillance leading to a loss of privacy rights and the starting of ongoing wars, like in Afghanistan and Iraq. That aligns with what I thought earlier about security measures and foreign policy changes.

Doc 2 provides a more structured look at four major lasting impacts: the 'Forever Wars,' changes in immigration and deportation, transformations in air travel, and the expansion of surveillance. This seems comprehensive. Let me note these down.

1. **Forever Wars:** The invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, leading to prolonged military engagements and the establishment of the Guantanamo Bay detention center. The war efforts have cost lives and resources, and have had lasting effects on U.S. military involvement abroad.

2. **Immigration and Deportation:** The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the increase in deportations, with a focus on national security. There's also mention of the Secure Communities program and its impact on immigrant populations, particularly in California.

3. **Air Travel:** Significant changes in airport security procedures, including the establishment of the TSA, stricter screening processes, and increased surveillance at airports. This has altered the travel experience for Americans and raised concerns about privacy and civil liberties.

4. **Surveillance:** The expansion of the U.S. intelligence state post-9/11, leading to increased government oversight and surveillance, as revealed by leaks from Edward Snowden. This has raised questions about the balance between security and privacy.

Doc 3 is a bit brief but reiterates the economic impact and changes in air travel security, emphasizing that the way we travel has been permanently altered.

Doc 4 from History.com echoes some of these points, focusing on five ways 9/11 changed America: the beginning of the War on Terror, transformation of air travel, increase in anti-Muslim violence, expansion of surveillance, and the overall sense of insecurity that persists.

Doc 5 appears to be an essay discussing how 9/11 changed people's lives in the U.S., touching on similar themes like changed perspectives on Muslims, the creation of Homeland Security, and the ongoing War on Terror.

From these documents, it's clear that 9/11 had profound and lasting impacts on American society, politics, and culture. Let me try to synthesize this information to form a coherent answer.

Firstly, in terms of national security, the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security and the passage of the Patriot Act expanded government powers to monitor and control potential threats. This led to increased surveillance and stricter immigration policies, which have been subjects of ongoing debate regarding civil liberties.

Secondly, the War on Terror, initiated in response to the attacks, led to military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, with lasting consequences for those countries and for U.S. foreign policy. The war efforts have been costly in terms of both finances and human lives, and have shaped American perceptions of global terrorism.

Thirdly, the way Americans travel has been fundamentally changed. Airport security measures have been significantly tightened, affecting the travel experience and raising questions about privacy and convenience.

Fourthly, there has been a noticeable rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and discrimination in the U.S., fueled by the perception of Muslims as potential threats. This has led to increased incidents of hate crimes and prejudice against Muslim Americans.

Lastly, the event has had a lasting psychological impact on the nation, fostering a sense of vulnerability and heightening awareness of potential terrorist threats. This has influenced public policy, media coverage, and everyday behaviors.

In conclusion, 9/11 served as a catalyst for significant changes in American society, impacting areas such as national security, foreign policy, civil liberties, and social attitudes. Its legacy continues to be felt in various aspects of American life.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{9/11 led to significant changes in American society, including the expansion of national security measures, initiation of the War on Terror, transformation of air travel security, rise in anti-Muslim sentiment, and lasting psychological impacts on the nation's perception of security and vulnerability.}} \]
