So I've been asked why Republicans distrust the media. Now, I'm not an expert in politics, but I do know that there's been a lot of talk about political bias in the media, especially in recent years. I think it's important to approach this question with an open mind and try to understand both sides of the issue.

First off, I should probably define what I mean by "the media." When people talk about the media, they're usually referring to major news outlets like CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, and newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post. These are traditional sources of news that have been around for a while.

Now, from what I've observed, there seems to be a perception among many Republicans that these mainstream media outlets have a liberal or Democratic bias. I've heard them complain that the media often portrays Republicans in a negative light or highlights scandals involving Republican politicians more than those involving Democrats.

I remember during the last presidential election, there was a lot of discussion about how different media outlets were covering the candidates. Some Republicans argued that the media was unfairly critical of their candidate and gave more favorable coverage to the Democratic candidate.

But is there any truth to these claims? Maybe I should look into some studies or reports that assess media bias. Maybe there are some academic studies or think tanks that have analyzed this issue.

Let me consider doing a search to find some information on this. Maybe I can find some articles or studies that discuss media bias from a non-partisan perspective.

Politico's media bias rating is featured on the AllSides Media Bias Chart™.
Politico has a Lean Left AllSides Media Bias Rating™.
Politico displays a Lean Left bias primarily through an overall tilt in coverage that focuses more on issues of importance to people on the political left. In other cases, it's harder to identify Politico's bias or political leaning, such as when it has covered negative angles about President Joe Biden that other Lean Left-rated sources did not.
As of November 2020, our audience agreed with Politico's Lean Left bias rating, according to an AllSides Blind Bias Survey in which the average rating for Politico across all respondents was Lean Left.

Nov. 2020 Blind Survey Affirms Lean Left Rating
After analyzing the results of our November 2020 Blind Bias Survey, in which 2,285 people across the political spectrum blindly rated Politico’s content, AllSides found our Media Bias Rating™ of Lean Left for Politico was affirmed.
The results signified near universal agreement of Politico’s bias on average. The average rating for Politico across all respondents was a firm Lean Left. The average rating for Politico from each bias group — people who identified themselves as Left, Lean Left, Center, Lean Right, or Right — was also Lean Left.
A plurality of respondents across all bias groups rated Politico as Lean Left. The second most common response across all groups was Left — except for people who rated their own bias as Left. For this group, the second most common response for Politico was Center.

... Observational learning is a route through which cognitive biases are inculcated and exacerbated. Judgmental bias can be amplified by observing fellow group members (Norton, Cooper, Monin, & Hogg, 2003), and through exposure to social media content shared by others that confirms people's polarized and stereotyped beliefs (Del Vicario et al., 2016;Del Vicario, Zollo, Caldarelli, Scala, & Quattrociocchi, 2017; DellaVigna & Kaplan, 2008; Mocanu, Rossi, Zhang, Karsai, & Quattrociocchi, 2015). Observational learning leads people to conform to the biased behavior of other people due to automatic and deliberate forms of social influence (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004;Huh, Vosgerau, & Morewedge, 2014), and through other social learning mechanisms such as social signaling and culture (e.g., Bollinger & Gillingham, 2012;Maddux et al., 2010;Miyamoto & Kitayama, 2002).  ...

Q&A — Economist David Strömberg
Making sense of media bias
Just how partisan is the press, and should the public be worried?

From anonymous online commenters up to the highest levels of American leadership, public discourse is awash today in accusations that the media are politically slanted. But to what extent is that true and how does it affect politics?
To explore those questions, Knowable Magazine turned to political economist David Strömberg of Stockholm University, who researches media influence on politics and policy. Strömberg examined media bias around the globe and through history in a 2015 article in the Annual Review of Economics. His findings are counterintuitive, revealing that ideological bias may have less impact than we expect. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How long have researchers studied media bias?
Researchers started thinking about these things because of the rise of fascism in Europe in the 1930s, which was also around the time radio was introduced. People saw that the Nazis and fascists in Europe were using radio a lot for propaganda. This raised fears from onlooking nations that their own citizens could be brainwashed with propaganda. And so the first studies set out to test that.
Some early research interviewed U.S. voters before a presidential election, looked at the news material they consumed, and asked whether their opinions shifted based on whatever news material they had been exposed to. They found that people’s ideological or political standpoints rarely changed. The reason for that was that Republicans were reading Republican newspapers and Democrats were reading Democratic papers, so people were basically just becoming more firm in whatever belief they had before.
How do the media function when everything is working?
The ideal role of the media is to provide information. It’s almost impossible for people to inform themselves about what politicians are doing directly, and it’s just boring to many people. Media is a very effective way of having a few big actors with lots of resources finding stories of interest and presenting them to voters. This makes politicians much more accountable.
And what does damaging bias look like?
The way that economists have defined damaging bias, it typically means that you’re misrepresenting the facts, suppressing facts or just lying. This would be different than, let’s say, a conservative newspaper endorsing a Republican candidate — this kind of ideological bias is not necessarily suppressing any information or lying.
Today we’re hearing a lot of concern that many media outlets in the U.S. are ideologically biased. What does research tell us — are these concerns well-founded?
Researchers look at things like what candidates and ballot propositions newspapers endorse and what kind of think tanks they cite, and then compare newspapers to members of Congress and Supreme Court judges. There has been an increase in the polarization of U.S. media, to the left and right. But if you look at empirical studies of how biased the U.S. media are, on average it’s been pretty close to centrist.
>k_subscribe_ad<>/k_subscribe_ad<
These studies look at a large set of U.S. newspapers. There are, of course, extreme cases where outlets are ideologically biased. But if you’re thinking about the average influence of the media, you should consider the average position of the media.
What about more implicit measures, like a 2014 survey that found that, while most American journalists identified as independent in 2013, four times as many identified as liberal than identified as conservative?
There’s been a long discussion of slants of different important actors in the newsmaking process. Typically, journalists are left of center, whereas advertisers and owners may be more right of center. Of course, the end output that we care about is what is in the newspapers. Typically, studies find that nowadays in the U.S., newspapers are slightly to the left of center, but still moderate compared to other actors like politicians and Supreme Court judges.
On February 17, 1898, Joseph Pulitzer’s paper, The New York World, featured the unverified claim that the explosion of the U.S.S. Maine was the result of enemy fire. William Randolph Hearst ran similarly dubious claims of “Spanish treachery” in his competing paper, The New York Journal. The heated rivalry between the two papers fueled the production of sensational, and sometimes disreputable, news — and led to the term “Yellow Journalism.” Strӧmberg characterizes such misrepresentation of facts as a damaging form of media bias.

Is this the first time the U.S. has been dealing with media bias?
No. If you go back to the late 1800s, most newspapers had a party affiliation and their content was much more slanted. Around the 1890s to 1920s, the share of newspapers who had strong party affiliations dropped drastically, though even then there were newspapers with some Republican or Democratic leaning.
What caused the shift away from explicit party affiliations?
People have speculated. There is some evidence that advertising revenue and competition between papers may be what was driving the change. As it became more profitable to write stories that interested people, biases fell. One study found that in areas where ad revenues were higher, the slant was less.
And since then, it’s been standard for media outlets to strive for balance in their coverage?
Actually, that’s really an American norm. In Europe, that shift didn’t happen — most newspapers have a clear political affiliation. But that doesn’t mean that they were incredibly slanted — certainly not biased in the sense of producing fake news. It just means that they have a standpoint that’s transparent.
When a news outlet has an ideological bias, how much power does it have to carry that over to its audience?
It’s always been the dream of researchers to find big effects of media on how people are voting. I mean these are the hypotheses the studies in the ’40s started with. But one of the consistent findings all the way back to the first big studies is that it’s very difficult to change people’s voting intentions — for example, what political party they prefer. If you are a right-wing person and you get left-wing media, or vice versa — first of all, you just don’t read it. And even if you were exposed to some news that is not aligned with your ideological positions, you just wouldn’t take it in.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean it doesn’t affect election results, because it could be that the media increase voter turnout by energizing voters.

Two classic books for history buffs
“ Voting: A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign ” and “ The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign ,” both first published in the 1940s. Written by researchers, they describe early studies on the effect of the media on politics.
You argue in your review article that this tendency of voters to seek out media that are aligned with their own biases might, counterintuitively, be good for voters. How?
Political accountability works best if voters don’t make mistakes. By mistake, I mean voting for a candidate that is not the better candidate for you. If you have a media source that has the same exact preference as you do, and you just follow their endorsement, for example, you would never make a mistake.
So it can benefit voters to seek out news sources that share their views. But are there drawbacks to that as well?
One drawback is that ideological media outlets polarize the electorate by reaffirming voters’ pre-held positions. This means that the media are likely to make the Democratic voters support Democrats more strongly and the Republican voters support the Republicans more strongly.
And a very polarized electorate is not good for political accountability, because strongly partisan voters will not be very responsive to important nonpartisan factors. A politician might be slightly corrupt or not be very efficient in policymaking, but very few voters care — because they only care about his strong ideological positions on, let’s say, abortion.
What happens when slant crosses into damaging bias — not just ideological, but misrepresenting facts, suppressing facts or lying? Can the media harm society?
Some evidence exists that the media could provide worse outcomes for society, but this comes mainly from totalitarian states where there’s little media competition — there’s just one media outlet and the rulers use it to implement terrible actions. One example was how radio was used by the Rwandan government in the 1990s to, basically, tell people to commit genocide. One study found that where there was better radio reception, there were more civilian deaths. Another study from 2013 shows that the Nazi control over radio broadcasts increased support for anti-Semitic policies in places where there was a prior history of rioting and attacks targeting Jewish communities. But these are extreme examples that don’t tend to happen in democracies with a free press.
What do negative media effects look like in democracies with a free press?
There are instances of people being misguided by the media. For example, in the run-up to the Iraq War, much of the mainstream U.S. media coverage uncritically supported the government line that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Outlets like the New York Times later apologized for mistakes in their reporting.
“Because we are emotionally outraged by media bias, we tend to think about it a lot and forget about newspaper deaths and journalist layoffs.”
But the negative effects of media in democracies usually have more to do with influencing politicians to focus on the “wrong” issues. Obviously, some issues are intrinsically more newsworthy, like plane crashes or volcanic eruptions as opposed to events like traffic accidents, famines or endemic hunger, which are just constant problems — not “news.” News coverage puts a spotlight on certain issues and incentivizes politicians to work on them.
In democracies with a free press, what should people do if they’re worried their news is biased?
It’s like with any other business: Consumers apply pressure by what they consume. So you have to switch to a different media source if you don’t like what another source is doing.
How does media bias compare to other issues facing journalism today?
Because we are emotionally outraged by media bias, we tend to think about it a lot and forget about newspaper deaths and journalist layoffs. But there is much less evidence that media bias matters significantly. There is quite a bit more evidence that the volume of news matters more for making democracy work.
The media market in the U.S. is very mature, and there are many newspapers. And even consumers of the most biased media news sites often consume other news. So in a media market like the U.S., if you add one additional news source with a Republican or Democratic slant to the many others, it makes little difference.
And even newspapers with strong Republican or Democratic news slants are typically still covering their in-party corruption scandals. So it’s much more important that you have a local newspaper than if it has slant one way or the other.
Of course, if you go someplace like Russia where they don’t have many media outlets, then media slant matters much more. If you go from zero opposition television stations to one, it makes a huge difference.
And a higher volume of financially viable presses means the press is harder to silence.
How so?
A theoretical argument is that you have to silence each and every outlet in order for information not to get out. You can shut down outlets and throw journalists in jail — like we’ve seen happening in Turkey — or bribe the press, or hire editors more politically aligned with leadership. But if even one news outlet covers a piece of information, then the news will be out.
A clear example is a paper that looked at bribery by leadership in Peru. In the 1990s, Peru’s secret police chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, paid out many bribes and he recorded it all — all the bribes paid to different branches of government and the press to keep them silent about corruption. One important finding in that paper is that it was much more costly to silence the media than to silence judges and legislators. Typical bribes to TV channels were about 100 times more than bribes to politicians.
Strömberg says that maintaining political accountability is an important role of the news media. Yet some survey respondents said they felt that criticism in the news can keep politicians from doing their jobs. This sentiment tends to flip-flop along party lines, depending on who is in power.

You wrote your review in 2015. Have there been important changes since then?
There are two big ones — falling advertisement revenues and social media. I think social media is changing the media landscape both in countries like the U.S., but even more so in countries like China that don’t have a mature and independent press and media market. It’s much more difficult to censor millions of users than it is to censor a few media outlets.
But leaders in dictatorial regimes can also use social media for surveillance, paying firms to look for posts that predict protests and other similar events before they happen. This is a big industry in China, where calls for protests have been picked up by politicians, and then they take measures like making work days on the weekend, and forcing students to be in school, to prevent a protest.
And what about the spread of false information on social media?
There’s two obvious reasons why you see this kind of fake news on social media. One is that those who post fake news want to influence an election, or something else. The other is that it’s profitable. We have these fake news-producing sites in Macedonia who know nothing about U.S. politics but they know how to write a news article or post that will get many clicks. The thing that makes social media conducive to fake news is there’s much less of a reputational concern for users on Facebook or Twitter. They can write something crazy and then just open up another account, and write something crazy. A media outlet in the U.S., like a local newspaper, cannot do that. Reputation is what makes people pay for their articles.
And what is the impact of falling ad revenues?
Falling advertisement revenues is a major issue now in the media industry, leading to a less financially viable press. So we have to think about if we need to start having government subsidize the media. There’s an economic argument for this, based in economic theories about behaviors that affect other people. If you are better informed, then the politicians will become less corrupt — this is good for you and good for everyone else. Just as you might put a tax on something that is bad, like polluting, you want to have a subsidy on something that is good, like getting informed.
But the effects of government subsidies on bias are not clear. It’s a topic for future research.

Political Bias in the Media
Fewer See Political Bias
Overall, the public sees less political bias in news coverage today than it did a decade ago. Although a solid majority — 69% — of Americans see news coverage as containing at least a fair amount of political bias, that percentage has decreased from 76% in 1989. At the same time, however, the percentage of people saying news coverage contains a great deal of bias has increased seven points from 25% in 1989 to the current 32%.
In addition, while news coverage is seen as containing political bias, it is not necessarily viewed as favoring either party. When asked which political party news organizations are biased toward in this year’s presidential election, a plurality (48%) say there is no partisan bias. However, those who see a great deal of political bias are much more likely to perceive a Democratic bias in presidential coverage than a Republican bias (34% vs. 16%).
Rather than one party being favored more than another, the public may be concerned about other forms of bias that can skew political coverage. In a September 1999 Pew Research Center survey, for example, 45% said that news organizations are too tough on female presidential candidates and 40% considered the media too hard on those far behind in the race. In the same poll, 42% said close scrutiny by news organizations is not worth it because too many good people are discouraged from running for president, up from 32% in 1987.
Republicans, especially those with close ties to the party, consider the media more politically biased than do Democrats. Four-in-ten Republicans see a great deal of political bias in news coverage, whereas only 27% of Democrats agree. And 54% of Republicans who have donated money to political candidates see a high degree of bias in news coverage; 30% of Democrats who have made campaign contributions agree. Among activist Republicans — registered voters who have attended a political party or meeting — half notice a great deal of bias, compared to 27% of activist Democrats.
When asked about coverage of the presidential campaign, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that the media favors the opposite party. Among all Republicans, 37% see a Democratic bias, as do 46% of the GOP who disapprove of Bill Clinton. By contrast, 19% of Democrats see a GOP bias in news coverage. Independents divide fairly evenly: 16% see a bias toward Democrats, while 13% say the slant is Republican.
Blacks tend to see more Republican bias than whites. Almost a quarter (24%) of blacks say the media favors Republicans, compared to 12% of whites. A majority (52%) of blacks, however, say there’s no partisan bias.
C-SPAN Most Objective
When asked to rate the objectivity of a wide range of news sources, C-SPAN comes out on top, while daily newspapers are viewed as the most biased. More than a third (35%) of Americans say C-SPAN is completely objective, the highest percentage of any source tested. In contrast, only 18% consider their daily newspapers to be completely objective.
Even among those who see a great deal of bias in overall news coverage, 31% consider C-SPAN to be completely objective. But only 13% of this group considers their daily newspaper to be completely objective.
Judgments of objectivity and bias vary somewhat according to party affiliation. For example, 31% of Democrats say morning television shows such as the Today Show and Good Morning America are completely objective, compared to 19% of Republicans.
Among those who say newspapers are very biased, four-in-ten are Democrats and 28% are Republicans. However, of those who see nightly network news as very biased, 38% are Republicans while 29% are Democrats.
Men tend to see bias more than women. Fully 60% of those who perceive nightly network news as very biased are men, compared to 40% who are women. Of those who say cable news is very biased, 57% are men and 43% are women.
Few Swayed by Endorsements
The vast majority of Americans say that endorsements by celebrities, local newspapers, religious leaders, or union officials would not influence their votes. Although Colin Powell is the most influential of the 17 individuals or institutions tested, 62% say his endorsement would make no difference in their choice of a presidential candidate.
The impact of an endorsement, however, varies significantly among demographic groups. For instance, 39% of men age 50 and older say an endorsement by Powell would make them more likely to vote for that candidate, compared to 24% of women in the same age group. And 35% of senior citizens say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Jimmy Carter; only 13% of those under age 30 agree.
The amount of influence endorsements have also depends on a person’s partisanship. Fully 33% of Republicans say Powell’s support of a presidential candidate would make them more likely to vote for that person compared to 20% of Democrats. About a third (32%) of Democrats would be influenced by Carter’s endorsement compared to only 17% of Republicans.
Some personalities or entities tested have a negative influence on people’s voting choices. For example, 5% say they would be more likely to vote for someone endorsed by Newt Gingrich but 24% would be less inclined to vote for Gingrich’s choice; 67% say Gingrich’s endorsement would make no difference in their support of a presidential candidate.

Alright, so I've got this information from AllSides about Politico and PolitiFact. It seems like both are rated as Lean Left by AllSides. That might give some insight into why Republicans distrust the media. Maybe they feel that mainstream media outlets have a liberal bias, which affects their reporting.

But I need to look into this more broadly. Republicans might not just be talking about specific outlets like Politico or PolitiFact. They could be referring to a wider range of media sources that they perceive as having a liberal slant.

Maybe I should look for studies or articles that discuss overall media bias from a political perspective. Perhaps there are surveys or analyses that show how different media outlets lean politically.

Also, it's important to consider that media bias is a complex issue. There might be different types of bias—like selection bias in choosing which stories to cover, or bias in how stories are framed or presented. So, understanding these different dimensions could help in grasping why Republicans might distrust the media.

Moreover, it's essential to recognize that distrust in media isn't unique to Republicans. Democrats might also have issues with certain media outlets they perceive as having a conservative bias. So, perhaps looking at this from a broader perspective could provide more context.

I think I should look for some general studies on media bias and political perception. Maybe something that surveys both Republicans and Democrats about their trust in media.

Alternatively, perhaps there are studies that analyze the actual content of news reports to determine if there is a systematic bias towards one political ideology.

Wait, in one of the documents, there was a mention of a Pew Research Center study from 2000 about political bias in the media. That might be outdated, but it could still provide some historical context.

Maybe I should see if Pew or other reputable research organizations have more recent data on this topic.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand what constitutes media bias. Is it in the selection of stories? The tone in which they're reported? The sources that are quoted? All of these could potentially contribute to a perception of bias.

Second, I need to consider that different people might define bias differently. What one person sees as balanced reporting, another might see as biased, depending on their own political leanings.

Third, it's important to look at how media consumption has changed over time, especially with the rise of social media and cable news channels that cater to specific political ideologies.

Fourth, perhaps there are specific instances where the media has been perceived as biased by Republicans, which have contributed to their overall distrust.

Fifth, it's worth considering whether this distrust is reciprocal—that is, whether Democrats also distrust certain media outlets they perceive as biased towards Republicans.

Let me try to structure my thoughts:

1. Define media bias and how it's perceived.

2. Look at studies or surveys that measure public trust in media across different political spectrums.

3. Examine specific examples where Republicans feel the media has been biased against them.

4. Consider the role of social media and echo chambers in reinforcing these perceptions.

5. Think about potential solutions or steps that could be taken to rebuild trust.

Starting with defining media bias: Media bias can refer to the tendency of media outlets to report news in a particular way, favoring one viewpoint over another. This can manifest in various ways, such as selective reporting, framing stories in a certain light, or choosing sources that support a particular narrative.

Now, regarding studies on public trust in media: I recall that Pew Research Center regularly publishes reports on this topic. Maybe I can find a recent one that breaks down trust in media by political affiliation.

Let me consider performing another search to find more current data on public trust in media among Republicans and Democrats.

Indicators of news media trust
A Gallup/Knight Foundation Survey
Published September 11, 2018 by Knight Foundation

The news media, like many other major U.S. institutions, has suffered from a decline in public confidence in recent years. A key question for the future of the news media, as well as for U.S. democracy, is whether that trust is lost for good. In this report, part of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation’s Trust, Media and Democracy initiative, Gallup asked a representative sample of U.S. adults to discuss key factors that make them trust, or not trust, news media organizations.
The report relies on a variety of research approaches — open-ended questions, closed- ended importance ratings and an experiment — and finds:
Most U.S. adults, including more than nine in 10 Republicans, say they personally have lost trust in the news media in recent years. At the same time, 69% of those who have lost trust say that trust can be restored.
Asked to describe in their own words why they trust or do not trust certain news organizations, Americans’ responses largely center on matters of accuracy or bias. Relatively few mentioned a news organization’s partisan or ideological leaning as a factor.
Accuracy and bias also rank among the most important factors when respondents rate how important each of 35 potential indicators of media trust are to them. Transparency also emerges as an important factor in the closed-ended ratings of factors that influence trust: 71% say a commitment to transparency is very important, and similar percentages say the same about an organization providing fact-checking resources and providing links to research and facts that back up its reporting.
An experimental approach not only showed the importance of accuracy, bias and transparency, but also revealed a complex relationship between partisanship and media trust. Both Republicans and Democrats were less likely to trust news sources with a partisan reputation that opposes their own. However, they did not express much greater trust in news sources that have a reputation for a partisan leaning consistent with their own.
These results indicate that attempts to restore trust in the media among most Americans may be fruitful, particularly if those efforts are aimed at improving accuracy, enhancing transparency and reducing bias. The results also indicate that reputations for partisan leaning are a crucial driver of media distrust, and one that may matter more for people themselves than they realize.

DETAILED FINDINGS
AMERICANS ARE LOSING TRUST IN THE NEWS MEDIA BUT BELIEVE IT CAN BE RESTORED
Gallup has documented an erosion of trust in the news media over time. Between 2003 and 2016, the percentage of Americans who said they have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in the media fell from 54% to 32% before recovering somewhat to 41% in 2017 as trust among Democrats rebounded.
Consistent with the trend toward declining trust, 69% of U.S. adults in the current survey say their trust in the news media has decreased in the past decade. Just 4% say their trust has increased, while 26% indicate their trust has not changed.
Republicans (94%) and political conservatives (95%) are nearly unanimous in saying their trust in the media has decreased in the past decade. However, declining trust is not just confined to the political right — 75% of independents and 66% of moderates indicate they are less trusting than they were 10 years ago.
U.S. adults on the left of the political spectrum are less likely to say they have lost trust inthe media, but at least four in 10 Democrats (42%) and liberals (46%) say they have done so. Democrats and liberals are about as likely to say their trust in the media has not changed as to say it has decreased.
Other subgroup differences in reports of decreased trust in the media largely reflect those groups’ political leanings. More men (76%) than women (64%), more whites (72%) than nonwhites (63%) and more noncollege graduates (73%) than college graduates (61%) say they have less trust in the media than they did a decade ago. There are, however, no meaningful age differences.
Attention to the news is also related to reports of declining trust. Eighty-two percent of those who indicate they pay little or no attention to national news say they have less trust in the media now, compared with 74% who say they pay a moderate amount of attention and 62% who say they pay a great deal of attention.
While the loss of trust in the news media is concerning in a democratic society, a more encouraging sign is that most of those who have lost trust believe it can be regained. Specifically, 69% of U.S. adults who say they have lost trust in the news media over the past decade say their trust can be restored. But a rather substantial 30% of those who have lost trust — equivalent to 21% of all U.S. adults — say their trust in the media cannot be restored.
Majorities of all key subgroups say their decreased trust in the media can be restored. There is little difference by gender, age, education and race. However, Democrats and liberals who have lost trust in the media are more optimistic that their trust can be restored than are independents, moderates and especially Republicans and conservatives. While at least six in 10 Republicans and conservatives say their decreased trust in the media can be recovered, 39% and 36%, respectively, say it cannot. In other words, about one-third of those on the political right have lost faith in the media and expect that change to be permanent.
FEW TRUST ALL, BUT MOST TRUST SOME NEWS ORGANIZATIONS
Americans appear to differentiate the trustworthiness of news organizations — 67% say they trust only some news media organizations, but not others. Meanwhile, 1% say they trust all news media organizations, 17% say they trust most and 16% say they do not trust any. The question did not distinguish perceived partisanship of specific news sources; rather, it focused on news organizations in general.
The majority of Republicans (75%), independents (63%) and Democrats (64%) say they trust some news organizations, but not others. Where party groups differ most is in their tendency to trust most or no news media organizations. More than one-third of Democrats, 35%, say they trust all or most news organizations, compared with 13% of independents and 3% of Republicans. In contrast, 21% of Republicans and 25% of independents but just 2% of Democrats say they do not trust any news organizations.
Trust in News Organizations
Now, thinking broadly about all of the various news organizations you are familiar with, including newspapers, TV and cable news stations, news websites, radio news, and local, national and international news organizations. Which best describes you —
Nearly four in 10 U.S. adults who are inattentive to national news (39%) say they do not trust any news organizations. That compares with 17% of those who pay a moderate amount of attention to national news and 8% who are highly attentive. Although these data indicate a strong relationship between attention to news and trust in the news media, they cannot shed light on cause and effect. That is, are some people so distrustful of the media that they cannot bring themselves to follow the news, or are people who do not follow the news distrustful because they do not see the media in action?
DETAILED FINDINGS
ISSUES OF ACCURACY, BIAS KEY TO AMERICANS’ DISTRUST AND TRUST
After assessing their current state of trust in the news media, the survey asked respondents to say, in their own words, why they trust — or do not trust — particular news organizations.
REASONS PEOPLE DISTRUST NEWS ORGANIZATIONS
When asked for reasons why they do not trust news organizations, Americans’ top categories of answers largely focus on inaccuracy and bias. The most commonly expressed thoughts in response to the open-ended question were about inaccurate or misleading reporting, lies, alternative facts or fake news (45%) and biased, slanted or unfair reporting (42%).
Bias and inaccuracy are underlying themes in many of the other comments as well. Twenty three percent say that one-sided, unbalanced or incomplete reporting causes them to distrust news organizations. Sixteen percent say “news” grounded in opinions or emotions and 14% say politically or partisan-focused coverage causes them to lose trust in news organizations.
Less common were responses that gave a clear direction of bias that troubled respondents. Seven percent mention a pro-liberal or anti-conservative bias specifically. Meanwhile, 5% say negative stories about President Donald Trump and 3% say news organizations that protect or support him cause them to lose trust.
In all, three-quarters of respondents mentioned bias-related reasons at least once in their comments as a reason they did not trust news organizations, and two-thirds mentioned accuracy-related reasons at least once.
Thinking now about some of the news media organizations you DO NOT trust, what are some of the reasons why you DO NOT trust those news organizations? [OPEN-ENDED]
Respondents could give multiple reasons. The figures are the percentage mentioning each reason in their responses. The percentages in the table total more than 100% due to multiple responses.
Thinking now about some of the news media organizations you DO NOT trust, what are some of the reasons why you DO NOT trust those news organizations? [OPEN-ENDED] Cont’d.
Republicans, Democrats and independents are about equally likely to bring up inaccuracy as a reason they distrust certain news organizations. Republicans (36%) are somewhat less likely than Democrats (43%) and independents (49%) to raise the bias issue in general terms, though 17% of Republicans, compared with 3% of independents and 1% of Democrats, more specifically mention liberal or anti-conservative bias.
Young adults (aged 18 to 34) are twice as likely as older adults (aged 55 and up) to say politically focused or partisan bias is a factor in their lack of trust in news media organizations, 18% to 9%, respectively. Young adults (47%) and middle-aged adults (47% of those aged 35 to 54) are also more likely than older adults (34%) to mention biased, slanted or unfair reporting more generally.
A little more than half of Americans who pay a great deal of attention to national news, 52%, cite inaccurate reporting or fake news as a reason for not trusting certain media organizations. That compares with 41% of those who pay a moderate amount of attention to national news and 35% who pay little or no attention to it.
REASONS PEOPLE TRUST NEWS ORGANIZATIONS
Matters of bias and accuracy are also the dominant themes discussed when people say why they trust certain news organizations. Thirty-nine percent mention fair, unbiased or nonpartisan reporting, with another 12% mentioning balanced reporting. Thirty-one percent mention accurate or factual reporting.
Commitment to journalistic ethics also figures prominently in Americans’ responses. Thirty-one percent mention credible, honest, ethical or reputable reporting, and 18% cite good or professional journalism or reporting.
Very few respondents mention a specific direction of bias in reporting as fostering trust for them. This includes 3% who say conservative coverage, 1% who say liberal coverage, and 3% who say support or respect for the president, government, Constitution or country lead them to trust news organizations.
Nearly two-thirds of respondents mentioned accuracy-related reasons at least once in their comments as a reason they trust news organizations. About half mentioned (a lack of) bias at least once.

Thinking now about some of the news media organizations you trust, what are some of the reasons why you trust those news organizations? [OPEN-ENDED] Cont’d.
Older adults and younger adults diverge in the extent to which they focus on sourcing and details as a way of gaining trust in news media outlets. Just 6% of those aged 55 and older say completeness, details and citing sources make them trust news organizations, compared with 17% of 18- to 34-year-olds and 15% of those aged 35 to 54. Similarly, 4% of older adults mention reliable or credible sources, compared with 11% of younger adults and 6% of middle-aged adults.
A news organization’s history, longevity or reputation was not frequently cited as a key trust factor, but college graduates (14%) were much more likely than nongraduates (5%) to mention it.
Partisans also differ in the kinds of comments they offer when saying what leads them to trust news organizations. Thirty-nine percent of Republicans versus 28% of Democrats mention accurate and factual reporting, and 43% of Republicans compared with 33% of Democrats remark on a news organization having fair, unbiased or nonpartisan reporting. In contrast, at least twice as many Democrats as Republicans mention fact-checking, research and verifiable facts (25% to 9%), good or professional journalistic practices (24% to 12%), and history or longevity (11% to 3%).
While accuracy and bias are commonly mentioned when Americans indicate why they trust or do not trust particular news organizations, accuracy is mentioned more often than unbiasedness as a reason for trusting an organization, and bias is mentioned more often than inaccuracy as a reason for distrust. Specifically, 65% gave a response that touched on accuracy as a reason for trusting an organization, while 49% mentioned a lack of bias. When detailing reasons for not trusting organizations, 75% of respondents made a comment about bias, while 66% offered a response that dealt with inaccuracy.
Summary of Mentions of Accuracy and Bias in Open-Ended Comments About Trust and Distrust of News Organizations
The likelihood of mentioning bias- or accuracy-related reasons for trusting or not trusting news organizations is similar by subgroup. One notable difference is that Democrats (79%) are much more likely than Republicans (61%) or independents (55%) to bring up accuracy as a reason they trust certain news organizations.
DETAILED FINDINGS
TRANSPARENCY JOINS ACCURACY AND BIAS AT TOP OF LIST OF IMPORTANCE RATINGS FOR TRUST
In addition to getting Americans to describe in their own words why they trust or do not trust news organizations, the survey asked them to rate the importance of each of 35 different attributes that can engender trust in news organizations. As in the open-ended responses, accuracy and bias are important factors, but items that touch on transparency are also among the items that Americans rate most important.
The two highest-rated factors — both rated as very important by more than eight in 10 respondents — are a commitment to accuracy (89%) and quickly and openly correcting mistakes (86%). Seventy-seven percent say the organization’s record of having published inaccurate or false information is very important, and 53% say the same about the frequency with which organizations make mistakes.
More than seven in 10 say a commitment to fairness (78%), providing fact-checking resources (74%), a commitment to transparency (71%) and providing links to research and facts to back up its reporting (71%) are very important factors for them in fostering trust.
Sixty-four percent rate a news organization clearly distinguishing news stories from commentary, analysis or advertiser-paid content as being very important to their trust in it.
A majority of Americans (58%) also say that news organizations being neutral is very important.
Some of the least important factors in promoting trust are the number of awards a news organization has won for reporting (4%), how large its circulation or viewership is (4%), whether it is a local (5%) or a national (8%) outlet, and how long the organization has been reporting the news (10%).
Although Americans’ trust in the media and views of particular news organizations are strongly related to partisanship, Americans do not say that political considerations are important determinants to them in whether they trust particular news media outlets. Just 5% say it is very important that the organization’s reporters share their political views, and 10% say the same about the outlet giving positive coverage to people, groups or issues with which they agree. Also, their trust is little influenced by cues or endorsements from others, including
political leaders with whom they agree (8%), political leaders with whom they disagree (8%), and their family and friends (5%).
The specific content that a news organization covers is of midrange importance — 43% regard the types of issues a news outlet focuses its coverage on as being very important. Thirty-two percent assign the same degree of importance to whether reporters understand the challenges “people like me” face.
How important are each of the following factors in determining whether or not you trust a news organization?
How important are each of the following factors in determining whether or not you trust a news organization? Cont’d.
There are not very large differences in ascribed importance of these characteristics by subgroups, especially for the attributes ranked near the top and bottom of the list. One of the bigger differences concerns neutrality — this resonates less with Democrats (44% say it is very important) than independents (64%) and Republicans (68%).
Also, awareness and respect of the news organization’s brand are more important to Democrats (49%) and Republicans (39%) than to independents (25%), as well as among more attentive (47%) than less attentive (27%) news consumers.
The location of the source — in the U.S. or a different country — seems to matter slightly more to adults 35 and older (26%) than to younger adults (12%), to noncollege graduates (25%) than to college graduates (15%), and to Republicans (33%) more than to Democrats (19%) and independents (17%).
Young adults (83%) see links to research and facts to back up reporting as more important to earning their trust than adults 35 and older (65%) do.
Older adults seem especially sensitive to news organizations’ records of making mistakes — 62% of those aged 55 and older say it is a very important factor in their trust in news media organizations, compared with 48% of adults younger than 55.
DETAILED FINDINGS
EXPERIMENTAL DATA CONFIRM IMPORTANCE OF ACCURACY, BIAS AND TRANSPARENCY, BUT SHOW INFLUENCE OF PARTISANSHIP
A final way to assess the importance of various factors in determining media trust does not rely on direct self-reports from respondents. An experimental method known as conjoint analysis translates respondents’ choices between two competing options — in this case, two hypothetical profiles of news organizations — into measures of importance. Based on the choices respondents make, the technique can estimate the relative importance of various aspects of a product or other object, as well as the specific characteristics within those aspects that are important. This method thus provides measures of importance that do not rely on respondent self-reports and can avoid the possibility that those reports are plausible or socially desirable but not reflective of the true factors that drive an individual’s preferences or behaviors.
To apply this method to news media trust, a separate sample of 1,322 Gallup Panel respondents indicated which of two randomly generated hypothetical profiles of news organizations they consider more trustworthy.
The appendix gives the list of the nine trust attributes included in the conjoint task, and the features that were varied across those nine attributes in each profile. The profiles consisted of information conveying an organization’s commitment to accuracy, unbiasedness and transparency — the top-rated factors in the importance ratings. The profiles also included information about the news organization from dimensions scoring lower on those same importance ratings, including ownership, awards, audience size and local versus national coverage.
Respondents were presented with two such profiles and were asked to say which they believe would be more trustworthy. Each respondent completed 10 separate choice tasks, evaluating a total of 20 different profiles across those tasks.
The results of the conjoint analysis confirm the importance attached to core journalistic standards. On a relative basis, the accuracy factors — how quickly and openly an organization corrects mistakes and how carefully it evaluates facts before reporting — were the most important. About half of the variability in respondents’ choices was explained by these two attributes. Transparency — in the forms of disclosing potential conflicts of interest and making additional reporting material available to readers — accounted for another combined 27% of respondents’ decisions. The five remaining factors accounted for less than 25% of respondents’ preferences in the choice tasks.
Relative Importance for Each Attribute in Choice of More Trustworthy News Source
In addition to capturing the relative importance of each attribute, the conjoint analysis offered insight into how much specific features or actions affect the likelihood that a respondent chooses one news organization profile as more trustworthy over another.
For example, regarding accurate reporting, the likelihood that an individual chose a news organization as more trustworthy than another dropped 19 percentage points if speed of reporting was prioritized over accuracy. Also, compared with news organizations that have a record of making quick and visible corrections to mistakes, respondents were 28 percentage points less likely to select a news source as being trustworthy if it rarely reports corrections to mistakes, 18 percentage points less likely if it occasionally does not make corrections and eight percentage points less likely if it makes corrections quickly but not in a highly visible manner.
For balanced and unbiased reporting, respondents viewed news organizations with a partisan reputation as less trustworthy than ones with an unclear or mixed partisan reputation; however, the effects were modest.
In terms of transparency, respondents were somewhat less likely to choose a news organization as more trustworthy if it usually (rather than always) acknowledged conflicts of interests, and substantially less likely to favor it if it generally does not acknowledge conflicts of interest about sponsors and owners in its reporting. Respondents were slightly more likely to select news organizations that make additional research not included in stories publicly available (such as full, unedited interviews) as more trustworthy than those that did not.
Change in Probability in Choice of More Trustworthy News Source, Compared With Baseline Category
Percentage point change in probability compared with baseline category. For example, there is a nine-point greater chance a respondent will choose a news organization as more trustworthy than another if it makes additional reporting material publicly available compared with not making such material publicly available.
When the sample is broken down into partisan subgroups, the accuracy and transparency factors remained very important. However, a news organization’s partisan reputation is more influential in the choices made by partisan respondents. In fact, among Republicans, the effects of a partisan reputation were second in relative importance behind quick and open corrections of mistakes. Partisan reputation ranks fourth among Democrats. The results among all respondents indicated partisan reputation was not very important, but that was mainly because it did not matter much to independents, and the larger effects of Republicans and Democrats may have canceled each other out in the aggregate.
Further analysis of the data reveals the complexity of the relationship between partisanship and trust in news organizations. There was a substantial decline in relative perceived trustworthiness for news organizations with a reputation for favoring partisan positions and policies that ran counter to the respondent’s own political preferences.
Specifically, compared with a news organization having a mixed partisan reputation, Republican respondents were 22 percentage points less likely to choose one as being more trustworthy if it had a Democratic-leaning reputation. Democrats were 12 percentage points less likely to choose a news organization with a Republican reputation than one with a mixed or unclear partisan reputation.
Importantly, respondents were about equally likely to favor news organizations with a partisan reputation that aligned with their own as to favor those with a mixed or unclear reputation. In other words, partisans considered news organizations with a hostile agenda as much less trustworthy but did not view news organizations with a sympathetic agenda as more trustworthy.
Political independents were turned off about equally by news organizations with Democratic- or Republican-leaning reputations. They were six percentage points less likely to select a news organization as more trustworthy when it had a Democratic reputation and seven percentage points less likely when it had a Republican reputation, compared with a news organization having a mixed partisan reputation.
The importance of the partisan dimension in the conjoint analysis contrasts with the importance ratings. Relatively few Americans said political considerations were very important factors in their assessments of whether news organizations were trustworthy. These results may indicate that people are not aware of the degree to which partisanship colors their opinions of the news media. To the extent they are aware of this, they may want to give a “socially desirable” response in an opinion survey and indicate that political concerns do not affect their views of the news media.
The conjoint results also suggest that partisan reputations are an important shortcut or cue that Democrats and Republicans employ to sift through all the available information to form opinions about the trustworthiness of competing news organizations.
Conclusion
The Gallup/Knight Foundation report American Views: Trust, Media and Democracy indicates that Americans believe the news media play a critical role in U.S. democracy but think they are doing a poor job of fulfilling that role. This report reinforces that finding by showing that most Americans say they have lost trust in the news media in the past 10 years. However, Americans also say that their trust can be restored.
Americans give clear indications that their trust largely relies upon getting accurate, unbiased and even-handed news. Nevertheless, these normative factors are more philosophical in nature and provide less obvious direction for actions that news organizations can take to gain, or regain, public trust. Achieving these aims may require news organizations to rigorously adhere to journalistic norms, something most news outlets probably aspire to do but that may be more challenging to do in an era when staffs and resources have been slashed amid declining revenues.
A major challenge in fostering trust in the news media is that accuracy and unbiasedness are often in the eye of the beholder. Previous research in the Gallup/Knight Foundation partnership found that Democrats and Republicans mostly disagree as to which specific news organizations are accurate and unbiased.
Still, Americans are unlikely to say that their trust in news organizations depends on political agreement, but the conjoint analysis suggests it may be more important than they say — especially for partisans when the direction of perceived bias runs counter to their own political leanings. The prominent effects of partisan reputations in the conjoint analysis among Republicans and Democrats indicate how much these reputations can influence media trust. If certain sources are branded by opinion leaders as “liberal” or “conservative,” it could turn off large segments of the population to them and foster distrust in the news media more generally. An earlier experiment as part of the Gallup/Knight Foundation work confirmed how powerful such branding can be, as people’s ratings of the same news item differed significantly when the news organization that reported the story was shown versus not shown.
Restoring trust in the news media may then require addressing and countering shared perceptions of bias and inaccuracy within partisan groups.
Beyond addressing bias and inaccuracy concerns, efforts to increase transparency could help increase trust in the news media. While transparency is not an idea that is top-of-mind for Americans when talking about trust in their own words, it is among the most highly rated factors when respondents rate the relative importance of a number of items that can influence trust in the media. The conjoint analysis provides more specific guidance in this area by indicating that people regarded organizations as more trustworthy if they faithfully disclose conflicts of interest and make additional reporting material available to readers and viewers.

Partisan divides in media trust widen, driven by a decline among Republicans
By Jeffrey Gottfried and Jacob Liedke
In just five years, the percentage of Republicans with at least some trust in national news organizations has been cut in half – dropping from 70% in 2016 to 35% this year. This decline is fueling the continued widening of the partisan gap in trust of the media.
Nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (78%) say they have “a lot” or “some” trust in the information that comes from national news organizations – 43 percentage points higher than Republicans and Republican leaners (35%) – according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted June 14-27, 2021. This partisan gap is the largest of any time that this question has been asked since 2016. And it grows even wider – to 53 points – between liberal Democrats (83%) and conservative Republicans (30%).
The 35% of Republicans who have at least some trust in national news organizations in 2021 is half that of in 2016 (70%) – and has dropped 14 points since late 2019 (49%). By comparison, Democrats have remained far more consistent in the past five years, ranging somewhere between 78% and 86%.
How we did this
Overall, about six-in-ten U.S. adults (58%) say they have at least some trust in the information that comes from national news organizations. While still a majority, this is the smallest share over the past five years this question was asked. When it was last asked in late 2019, 65% expressed at least some trust. And far fewer (12%) express that they have “a lot” of trust in the information that comes from national news organizations.
Americans tend to have greater trust in local news organizations – though there is somewhat of a decline here as well. A large majority of Americans (75%) still say they have at least some trust in the information that comes from local news organizations, modestly lower than the shares who said the same in 2016 (82%) and in late 2019 (79%). And again, far fewer express the highest level of trust (18%).
A similar partisan divide emerges when it comes to local news, though to a lesser extent. As of June 2021, Democrats are 18 percentage points more likely than Republicans to have at least some trust in the information that comes from local news organizations (84% vs. 66%, respectively) – a gap that is again larger than at any time in recent years. Five years ago, 85% of Democrats had at least some trust in local news organizations, while 79% of Republicans did.
Social media continues to engender a much lower level of trust. About a quarter of Americans (27%) say they have at least some trust in the information that comes from social networking sites, with just 4% expressing that they have a lot of trust in it. This is about on par with late 2019 when 26% said they had at least some trust, but somewhat lower than the 34% who said the same in 2016. (In 2016, this question was asked of internet-using U.S. adults.)
Social media is trusted by a minority of both parties, though a partisan gap still exists. About a third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (34%) and 19% of Republicans and Republican leaners say they have at least some trust in the information that comes from social media – a 15-point gap. This gap is larger than gaps from any other time in recent years and has nearly doubled since late 2019.

Americans' Trust in Mass Media Edges Down to 41%
by Megan Brenan
Story Highlights
13% trust the media "a great deal," and 28% "a fair amount"
69% of Democrats, 15% of Republicans, 36% of independents trust media
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans remain largely mistrustful of the mass media as 41% currently have "a great deal" or "fair amount" of trust in newspapers, television and radio to report the news "fully, accurately and fairly." This latest reading represents a four-percentage-point dip since last year and marks the end of improvements in back-to-back years after hitting an all-time low.
Although trust in the media has edged down this year, it is well above the record low of 32% in 2016 when Republicans' trust dropped precipitously and drove the overall trust reading down during the divisive presidential campaign. Republicans' trust is still at a very low level and a wide gap in views of the media among partisans persists as 69% of Democrats say they have trust and confidence in it, while 15% of Republicans and 36% of independents agree.
Trust in the Mass Media Remains Low
After hitting the low point three years ago, U.S. adults' trust in the accuracy of the mass media appeared to be rebounding -- increasing 13 points over two years. Yet, the latest reading from a Sept. 3-15 Gallup poll found levels matching those in 2017.
Gallup first measured trust in the mass media in a 1972 survey when 68% of Americans said they trusted it. Similar levels were recorded in 1974 (69%) and 1976 (72%), but two decades later, when Gallup next asked the question, trust had fallen to 53%.
Although overall trust was at the majority level until 2004, no more than 21% of Americans dating back to 1972 ever said they had the greatest level of trust. Currently, 13% have a great deal of trust, 28% a fair amount, 30% not very much and 28% none at all.
Partisans' Trust in the Mass Media Remain Widely Divergent
Americans' trust in the media has been eroding over time, but in the current highly polarized climate, the views of political partisans have become increasingly divergent. President Donald Trump's description of the media as "the enemy of the people" has undoubtedly colored the views of all Americans.
Republicans became increasingly mistrustful of the media in 2016 when Trump was campaigning for president and was sharply critical of the media's coverage of him. Between 2015 and 2016, Republican trust in the mass media fell 18 points to its historical low of 14%, where it remained in 2017. Following a seven-point boost last year, it has returned to 15%. For their part, Democrats have consistently been more trusting of the media than Republicans but rallied around the press and became even more trusting when Trump took office in 2017.
The latest data show that in the last year, trust has declined slightly among all partisan groups, but still remains sharply polarized.
Recent Gallup data showed that Republicans' trust in most specific news sources in recent years has stagnated or declined, while Democrats' has risen. Fox News is the only national news source with majority-level trust from Republicans while majorities of Democrats trust six national news sources. Likewise, data from last year's Gallup/Knight Foundation surveys found similar results and also found that Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to perceive bias, inaccuracy and misinformation in newspapers, on television and on radio.

Most Americans say they have lost trust in the media - Columbia Journalism Review
Most Americans say they have lost trust in the media
The results of a new Knight Foundation and Gallup poll released on Tuesday won’t come as a huge surprise to most journalists: Trust in the media is down. Again.
A majority of those who were surveyed said they had lost trust in the media in recent years, and more than 30 percent of those who identified themselves as being on the conservative end of the spectrum said they had not only lost faith in the media, but they “expect that change to be permanent.” According to a separate Gallup poll from earlier this year that tracked trust in major institutions, newspapers and television news were among the lowest, exceeded only by Congress.
Is this decline in trust related to the repeated attacks on “the lying media” by President Trump and his supporters, who like to describe the press as “the enemy of the people?” That kind of analysis is beyond the scope of the latest Knight/Gallup study, but it has to be part of the backdrop. Respondents who said they paid the least amount of attention to the news were among those who mistrusted the media the most—is that because all they hear about the media is that it makes things up and is out to get the president?
When people were asked why they don’t trust the media, about 45 percent referred to things like inaccuracy, bias, “fake news,” and “alternative facts,” the latter two being common descriptions given by Donald Trump and members of his administration. A general lack of credibility and the fact that reports are “based on opinions or emotions” are two of the other reasons given for a loss of trust. About 10 percent of those surveyed also mentioned sensationalism, “clickbait,” or hype as a negative factor. Interestingly, twice as many young adults (18 to 34) as older respondents said politically focused coverage or partisan bias was a factor in their lack of trust.
The study did try to come up with a few rays of light. For example, the survey asked people whether they thought their trust in media might be restored somehow, and almost 70 percent of them said yes—60 percent of those who identified themselves as Republicans and 86 percent of those who said they were Democrats. And what might restore that lost trust? Respondents chose a variety of factors such as accuracy (including “not reporting stories before [a news outlet] verifies all the facts and being willing to correct mistakes it makes”), as well as lack of bias, and transparency (including “providing fact-checking resources and providing links to research and facts that back up [the news outlet’s] reporting”).
As the study’s authors admit, however, these proposed solutions aren’t as straightforward as they might appear. Whether a news outlet is being accurate when reporting the facts of a story, for example, is something different readers are going to come to different conclusions on, depending in some cases on their political views. If an outlet reports that Donald Trump is under suspicion for influence peddling with the Russians, to take just one hypothetical example, those who are inclined to believe this may see it as accurate, while those who vehemently disagree will see it as inaccurate and therefore untrustworthy. Trust, as an earlier Knight/Gallup poll suggests, is a slippery topic when it comes to the media.

Here are some more links about the complex relationship between trust and the media:
The rebound effect: Both Twitter and Facebook have talked about trying to expose users to a broader range of views to burst their filter bubbles, but a sociologist writing in The New York Times says his research shows that doing this causes people to become more entrenched in their views, not less.
What about trust ratings? Another experiment by Knight and Gallup using the same testing platform looked at whether crowdsourced ratings of trust or accuracy changed people’s expectations about a news article, and it turns out they do—stories that have trust ratings are actually trusted less than those that don’t.
A culture of listening: The American Press Institute recently held a symposium on ways that media organizations can help to build or regain the trust of their readers, and those who participated came up with a number of recommendations, including talking with “ex-fans” to see why they left, and also not being an “ask-hole.”
Optimizing for trust: New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen has written about what it means when a media outlet “optimizes for trust,” a recipe that includes transparency about potential conflicts, a commitment to accuracy, and a view of readers that sees them more as contributors rather than just consumers of content.
Other notable stories:
Brazilian fact-checkers working with Facebook to flag fake news stories in the run-up to elections in that country next month say they have been harassed and even subjected to death threats for their work, according to a report from Poynter.
Cory Doctorow writes about why European authors, journalists, and publishers need to fight the European Union’s newly proposed copyright laws, which could force online services and publishers to remove content if it matches an index of copyrighted works, and could also impose a tax for linking to external articles.
Bryan Goldberg, the founder and CEO of Bustle, plans to re-launch Gawker, the flagship site of the former Gawker Media, which filed for bankruptcy after a lawsuit launched by former wrestler Hulk Hogan. Goldberg acquired the domain name and archives of Gawker for $1.3 million in an auction in July.
Facebook is testing a new feature in its CrowdTangle service for journalists that would allow them to flag a news story as inaccurate from inside the service. CrowdTangle, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allows journalists and other users of the tool to see what stories, photos and videos are trending on the network.
Twitter and Facebook may get most of the attention when it comes to news, but a Pew Research Center study seems to show that Reddit is the most news-centric social service of them all. According to the survey, 73 percent of Reddit users say they get their news there, compared with 71 percent for Twitter and 67 percent for Facebook.
Nick Diakopoulos writes for CJR about an emerging category of social-media “bots” or automated accounts that actually help rather than cause harm, by aggregating or distributing information that has public value, including automated accounts that track changes in New York Times articles or Wikipedia entries.
Left-leaning news site ThinkProgress has complained that one of its articles was improperly flagged as inaccurate by The Weekly Standard, a conservative site that is a member of Facebook’s fact-checking program. Alexios Mantzarlis, who runs the International Fact-Checking Network, wrote on Twitter about some of the problems raised by the case, which he says were exacerbated by the post’s headline.

Okay, so from the Pew Research Center and Gallup polls, it's clear that trust in the media has been declining, especially among Republicans. In 2016, trust in the media hit a low point, and although there was some recovery, it seems to have dipped again recently. The partisan divide in trust is significant, with Democrats generally trusting the media more than Republicans do.

The Knight Foundation and Gallup survey provides some interesting insights. It shows that most Americans who have lost trust in the media believe that trust can be restored, which is a positive sign. The survey also highlights that accuracy and bias are the main reasons people trust or distrust media outlets.

I think it's important to note that while Republicans are more likely to see media bias, Democrats also have their concerns, especially regarding social media. This suggests that distrust in media isn't solely a Republican issue, but it's more pronounced on that side.

Moreover, the experimental approach in the Knight Foundation and Gallup survey indicates that both Republicans and Democrats are less likely to trust news sources that have a partisan reputation opposing their own. However, they don't necessarily express much greater trust in sources that align with their party. This suggests that a nonpartisan approach might be more appealing to both sides.

Another point is that transparency is seen as an important factor in building trust. This includes things like correcting mistakes quickly and openly, providing fact-checking resources, and being transparent about potential conflicts of interest.

Perhaps media outlets could focus more on these aspects to rebuild trust. For example, being more transparent about their sources, methods, and any potential biases could help. Also, making corrections promptly and acknowledging errors can go a long way in restoring credibility.

Furthermore, the survey found that while some people mention political bias in general, fewer specify a particular direction of bias. This might indicate that the perception of bias is more about a general slant rather than a specific alignment with a party.

I also noticed that younger adults are more likely to consider political bias as a factor in their trust, which could be due to the way news is consumed online and the prevalence of partisan echo chambers on social media.

Overall, it seems that the key to rebuilding trust is to prioritize accuracy, transparency, and minimizing bias. This is easier said than done, but it's clear that these are the areas where media outlets need to improve to regain the public's trust.

Perhaps I should look for examples of media outlets that are perceived as unbiased or that have successfully rebuilt trust.

Let me consider performing another search to find examples of media outlets that are considered trustworthy across the political spectrum.

7 Unbiased News Sources Free From Censorship
7 Unbiased News Sources Free From Censorship
Written by: Ryan Dube, Twitter: @rdube
Posted on: April 29th, 2020 in: Cool Websites
In a world that has become about as polarized and biased as ever, it can be extremely difficult to find unbiased news sources.
Especially in the United States, those on the liberal “left” believe right-wing news sources like Fox News are terribly biased. Those on the conservative “right” are convinced liberal media sources distribute nothing but “fake news”.
Table of Contents
Unbiased News Sources: Be Careful Who You Ask
Unbiased News Sources According to Readers Themselves
1. Associated Press
2. PBS News
3. NPR
4. CBS News
5. BBC
6. Reuters
7. Christian Science Monitor
So who’s right? Which media sources are free from government or corporate censorship and actually report the facts?
Unbiased News Sources: Be Careful Who You Ask
Because of how polarized the country is, you’ll be lucky if you can find two people who agree on which news sources are the most unbiased. The reality is that there really is no such thing. There are only varying degrees of bias.
One of the best ways to determine lack of bias is by surveying the audience itself. In fact Gallup and the Knight Foundation did just that in 2017, surveying 1,440 Gallup panel members.
What’s astonishing is that the publications listed as some of the most biased by conservatives and the least biased by liberals included The Washington Post and The New York Times. Yet those were two at the top of the list of the least biased news sources published by author Paul Glader at Forbes .
This reveals that either Forbes, or Paul Glader himself, has significant liberal bias leanings himself. If you check who conservative writers say are the most unbiased publications, you’ll find the opposite to be true.
So who’s right? How can you choose the most unbiased news sources when even those promoting allegedly “unbiased” sources are likely biased themselves?
Again, the check with the audience.
Unbiased News Sources According to Readers Themselves
Using the Gallup/Knight Foundation survey itself, it’s easy to identify the least biased news sources. It’s those that least upset both liberals and conservatives. The news sources rated in the middle of both lists represent the least bias.
Why is this the case?
Because journalists who rely on facts and evidence are least likely to ask loaded questions at a news conference (upsetting conservatives) or use offensive terms in their reporting (upsetting liberals).
Most journalists have probably read The Elements of Journalism by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel at some point in their study of journalism. It’s well known as a guide for good journalism. The Ethical Journalism Network further boils the principles from that book into five core principles of journalism.
What are the characteristics of the most unbiased news sources? According to EJN:
Focused on Truth: This means not only obtaining and verifying facts but putting those facts into accurate context.
Independence: Journalists need to avoid being influenced by sources in any way, including financial, personal power, or otherwise.
Fair and Impartial: Reporting should present both sides of any issue, and the context of the story should never be left out in order to manipulate the reader’s understanding of the issue.
Serve Humanity: A commitment to use stories to impact the world in a positive way, rather than causing harm.
Accountable: Good journalists acknowledge and correct errors or remedy unfair coverage of an issue.
So which news sources are actually unbiased? Which news outlets adhere best to the five core principles of journalism?
1. Associated Press
The AP is consistently featured on nearly every list of unbiased news sources. So it makes sense to list it first here.
The tagline featured at the top of the AP’s main page is “Advancing the power of facts”.
You’ll notice that the language used in the news stories here – even political ones – are very neutral and non-inflammatory.
AP journalists focus on reporting facts citing authoritative sources and corroborating or disproving claims made by sources by providing evidence.
Just this week, you’ll even find one story about all of the “fake news” readers might have seen on social media. The AP then confirmed or debunked those claims using hard facts.
The Top Stories section of the AP website is an excellent place to get the latest news around the world. There is also an interesting Video section with news segments, and Listen section which is the AP Radio broadcasts, updated hourly.
2. PBS News
PBS News is one of the few media outlets that remains immune from major accusations of bias.
Stories here feature both sides of every issue. When you read quotes from politicians or other major figures, you’ll read them with all of the important context provided. Context is a critical part of balanced reporting, and PBS News does it far better than most other media sources.
On PBS News you’ll find news categories like Politics, Health, World, Nation, Economy, and much more. It also features a Full Episodes section of all news broadcasts, a Podcasts section of their most popular audio news podcasts, and a Watch live link at the top of the page for watching current, ongoing news broadcasts.
If you need a U.S. focused source of news that you can trust to remain fair and balanced in their reporting, you can’t go wrong with PBS News.
3. NPR
While NPR news is often featured on most lists of balanced news sources, it also has more accusations of being left-leaning than other news sources on this list.
These accusations are usually related to a couple of NPR journalists who are less adept at keeping their political leanings in the background. However most NPR journalists adhere strongly to all of the core principles of journalism, especially accountability.
NPR listeners and readers who reach out to NPR will find that journalists are excellent at responding to criticism. In many cases they will even correct stories or seek to provide better balance on the topics where they hear criticism or complaints from their audience.
NPR offers a tremendous variety of news content for their audience. You’ll find categories on the site like Politics, Business, Technology, Science, and Race & Culture.
NPR also offers wonderful shows and podcasts, and even a music section focused on helping the NPR audience better appreciate existing, new, and alternative artists and music.
For the most part, when you explore NPR news stories – aside from the occasional left-leaning comments or slant from some of the journalists – for the most part you’ll find balanced and fact-based reporting there.
4. CBS News
According to a 2014 Pew Research Study, 40% of CBS News audience are “left-leaning”, while only 20% are “right-leaning”. While this is often pointed to by political conservatives that CBS News has a left-leaning bias, the truth is that the remaining CBS News audience is center-aligned.
This means that the CBS News audience is much more politically balanced than many other news outlets.
Even when covering very controversial issues, CBS News uses balanced and neutral language in its reporting. Article titles found across the site are matter-of-fact, and reporting includes context as well as opinions from all sides of any debate.
Other major network news outlets like NBC or ABC are often accused by conservatives of featuring inflammatory anti-right headlines, CBS News more often goes unscathed from those accusations.
In fact in the Gallup/Knight Foundation Survey, CBS News was rated far higher by conservatives than CNN, MSNBC, and NBC News. Liberals rated CBS News higher than CNN, USA Today, and even The Washington Post.
5. BBC
Two media-bias rating services, Media Bias/Fact Check and AllSides, both rank BBC News in the center of news reporting.
This means that for independent news readers, BBC news reporting stands as one of the best options. This may be due to the fact that the BBC is based in Britain so remains uninfluenced by U.S. political influence.
U.S. news coverage on the BBC is surprisingly balanced. Headlines are matter-of-fact and avoid pulling punches against either side of the U.S. political spectrum.
BBC also offers an extremely wide range of news coverage, including world news, business, science, health, and even a “reality check” section that debunks fake news you might have seen on social media or on other news sites.
6. Reuters
Both Media Bias/Fact Check and AllSides report Reuters as even less biased in its reporting than the BBC.
It doesn’t take long browsing the Reuters website to see why this is the case. Article titles there are refreshingly neutral, and journalists there are heavily fact-based in their reporting.
Despite that neutrality, Reuters journalism doesn’t pull any punches. You’ll find U.S based stories there that take a hard line against corruption, unethical politicians on both sides of the aisle, and well-rounded coverage of every issue.
Reuters is an excellent source of news for business and markets, politics, and even technology and lifestyle issues.
There’s also a TV link in the header where you can watch all of Reuters past video news broadcasts. Select the flag in the header to change Reuters coverage to your own region of the world.
7. Christian Science Monitor
One surprising contender on the list of unbiased news sources, given the name, is Christian Science Monitor. Both AllSides and Media Bias/Fact Check list Christian Science Monitor as center-balanced and unbiased.
This news organization has built a reputation over the years as providing extremely fair, in-depth exploration into important issues in the world today. Unlike the more biased media outlets out there, Christian Science Monitor works hard to bring in perspectives from all sides.
You won’t find article titles on this site that seek to malign or unfairly cover one political side or another. Stories dive into the most relevant issues that matter to the audience, providing full context and drawing in multiple sources to corroborate all facts.
The site content is mixed with both text and video news content. You’ll also find podcasts, photos of the week, and even a section devoted to book reviews .

Originally Answered: Who reports just news, not opinions on the mainstream media?
All media companies post both news and opinions. A factual report from a quality source will include opinions from experts on both sides of the issue.
Reporting both sides of a story is an essential part of news reporting in a democracy. (News services in dictatorships skip that step.)

The Associated Press.
For most others, it is up to you to learn the difference between “journalism” and “editorial content” — and then stick to the journalism.
Most legitimate resources prominently label their editorial content — but clueless readers often miss it.
Once you have learned the basics of journalism, it is easy to tell when someone is trying to manipulate you.
Legitimate journalism is a simple presentation of facts.

Originally Answered: What news sources are best for comprehensive and unbiased news? It seems that many sources think polarizing opinion is more important than reporting the facts.
A great newspaper. Television news can be unbiased (I’d point to the non-Fox networks and PBS as examples), but it’s at best a headline service that doesn’t tell you enough.
Chief among those would be the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. None are perfect — the Times has introduced too much “analysis” into its articles and under its current editor and publisher has become unremittingly liberal on its coverage of social justice issues, while the Journal has been compromised by Rupert Murdoch and slants to the right (the last editor was forced out because he was ma

Brandon, what you're looking for may not exist, simply because people write the news, and all people have biases that show through, despite the best intentions of the journalist.
That being said, I can relate where I go to try to get as close as possible to unbiased, factual reporting. The BBC often gives accurate reporting without bias, or at least without bias that is relevant here in the US. Not BBC America, mind you, but the British news.

Even a recitation of facts is subject to bias. Someone is selecting which facts to report. If I say, “The Trump Administration has allowed several staff persons without security clearances to have persistent access classified information.” that is a fact. However, in saying it, it would raise questions as to why I brought up that fact. Is it because I think his Administration has stunning levels of ineptitude and corruption? Or is it non-biased, since it is simply a fact.

BBC used to have “news readers”. Not sure what happened to that. Brexit?
NPR (at least the Chicago WBEZ/WBEQ bureau) ran a billboard ad campaign declaring themselves “impartial news”, but they simply aren’t. NPR has always leaned left, never flagrantly. Sulky, craven sarcasm routinely surfaces through the daily broadcast. I wager you’ll hear a petulant, hyperbolic, unsubstantiated jab at the current administration more times in an hour than you’ll hear “Jesus” on CBN.

Firstly, it’s useful to distinguish between rigorous reporting and commentary. Virtually all outlets that report FACTs rigorously also give voice to commentary, some with more balanced commentary than others. For instance, at Fox News, Shep Smith, before he resigned, used to report rigorous FACT at Fox News amid only the right wing commentary otherwise produced by Fox. Having said that, there are a number of outlets that publish rigorous news. Here’s a useful media chart that plots both bias and reliability.

The least worst is the best you are likely to achieve.

When I was a young journalist on a local paper, one of the first lessons was how to report motor accidents. Let’s say a car hit a streetlight which knocked out the lighting in the area. That seems unbiased news, doesn’t it? But if the information has come from the police, it will be different than if it comes from the driver.

If you want to make a huge all-encompassing charge like this, you will have to watch all the news media to ensure you are aware of all that bias. By doing so, you will become aware of where the bias is and then can avoid it.

First, it is impossible for any media outlet to be unbiased. Each outlet has to pick what stories to run. For instance, if a local news channel in New York City leads off a broadcast with crime reporting, the mayor’s supporters will claim bias. Which leads to a related problem: who arbitrates bias claims? The arbitrators are also biased.

It used to be that major, credible news outlets had ombudsmen or “public editors” who could investigate allegations of fake news or shoddy reporting. Unfortunately, as subscriptions have nosedived and media revenues tanked, almost every such outlet has let their ombudsmen (or equivalent) go[1] - along with a lot of the rest of their staff[2] .

Depends heavily on your personal prejudices and political views. If you’re pre-disposed towards one side or the other then you’ll naturally favor media sources that reflect your personal biases, while believing those which aren’t in full alignment with those biases are obviously “fake news” or “propaganda.”
Generally speaking, as other respondents here have noted, the most impartial/centrist outlets are generally acknowledged as: Associated Press, Reuters, Bloomberg, Christian Science Monitor, Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio, and the “big three” broadcasters (ABC, CBS, NBC).

When I was a young man, the News was the News, not commentary or personal political bias, but simply the relaying of information to the masses that afforded the listener the opportunity to form their own opinions based upon unbiased fact… “Just the facts, Ma'am, just the facts"… but today, all media seems to be biased, on both sides, spinning information in such a way as to support their particular narrative in the attempt to sway public opinion… nowadays, much more effort is required by the individual to find and discern the truth for themselves, by thoroughly researching both sides of any gi

Are there any centrist media outlets in the U.S. anymore?
If you want pure news without any form of opinion or interpretation, go with the news agencies like AP, Reuters or Bloomberg. That’s just what is happening. That’s about as “centrist” as it gets with media outlets.
If you want fair interpretation of those facts go with sources like Washington Post or the Guardian, with The Economist or National Review.
You might want to look into left leaning sources like The Huffington Post or CNN or right leaning sources like The American Conservative or The Federalist to get biased views of what is happ

Depending on one’s definition of “centrist,” I would say that the overwhelming majority of U.S. media outlets fit that label.
Many on the Right would likely disagree, but I believe most of these conflate fact-based Reality with Liberal values. In which case, the fault is more likely in their own ideologically constrained views than in the words of thoughtful people who put a great deal of effort and energy—and personal integrity—into reporting facts, as they find them.
One key enemy to such fact-based neutrality is a subset of outlets which masquerade as “Conservative,” but clearly fall far shor

Why would anyone want a media that is centrist? Facts can be either on the left or the right, so anyone in search of the truth should be looking towards where those immutable facts reside. Facts don’t gravitate toward the center like in a kitchen sink where everything whirls together in the middle before it is sucked down the drain. You might want to rephrase the question, Are there any reliable media outlets in the U.S. anymore? In which case I would answer, no, not in the mainstream media.

Because they receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts I suppose….Only once did I find NPR a little off center - an interview of Donald Rumsfeld in which the interviewed was a bit rude but otherwise, I find NPR refreshingly right down the middle and actively interested in both sides of the aisle.

The media has never been completely balanced but in my experience of almost 6 decades things were somewhat different before cable news arrived. Still, news media, and journalism has always maintained and ground it’s own axe. Complaints about unfair journalism go back to the beginning of the country. Branded and specific flavor choices in journalism may be todays approach. What makes money , what promotes a chosen agenda , seems to be as much the motivation today as getting to the bottom of the story, or any real journalistic integrity. In the end, it is what it is. We get to chose our poison.

This election many who are horrified by the far left democrat party and the unrest in the streets will vote Republican. Focus groups of undecided are also saying that the fear that the Democrats will “pack the supreme Court” is a major reason for voting Republican.
