I have this question: "How has Iturbide chosen to interpret the Kalho home and studio site?" I'm not entirely sure who Iturbide is or what the Kalho home and studio site is, but I need to figure this out. Maybe Iturbide is an artist or an architect who has interpreted or reimagined the Kalho home and studio in some way. I should start by finding out who Iturbide is and what the Kalho home and studio is.

First, I need to search for information about Iturbide. I think it might be a person's name, possibly an artist or architect. Let me perform a search to find out more.

Agustin de Iturbide: Biography & Significance
Instructor: Christopher Muscato
Chris has a master's degree in history and teaches at the University of Northern Colorado.
Mexican independence did not go quite as planned, and at the center of this was a man named Agustin de Iturbide. In this lesson, we'll get to know this controversial figure and see how he impacted Mexican history.
Agustín de Iturbide
Here's a fun plot for a revisionist history novel: George Washington begins the American Revolution, but is killed just under a year into the war. Benjamin Franklin then takes over, but he's killed too. At this point, the revolution is split between Paul Revere and Thomas Jefferson until, just as all seems lost, General Cornwallis switches sides, wins the war and declares himself emperor of the United States. Crazy, right? Like, that could never happen. Except it did. In Mexico.
Mexico's independence wars did not go smoothly. Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was killed in 1811, and José María Morelos died in 1815. However, out of this chaos arose a general named Agustín de Iturbide. He was so tough and formidable that he was known as El Dragón de Hierro, the Iron Dragon. The only problem: he was fighting for the Spanish. So, how did Spain's Iron Dragon become the champion and emperor of Mexico? Let's find out.

Emperor Agustin de Iturbide
The Early Life of Augustín de Iturbide
Agustín Cosme Damian de Iturbide y Arámburu was born in the colony of New Spain (today Mexico) in 1783. His father was a noble Spanish landowner, and Augustín was raised to be a good, Spanish gentleman. His mother was born in New Spain, which made her a criolla and slightly inferior in the Spanish racial caste system to his father, but his family adamantly insisted that she (and therefore their son) was of full Spanish blood. Any Amerindian heritage could, after all, threaten his future in the Spanish military and government. Agustín would be formally recognized as a criollo, a Spaniard born in the Americas.
As a teenager, Iturbide decided that he would pursue a military career, which was very respectable. By 1806, he had risen through the ranks to become a lieutenant in the Spanish royalist army.
Independence Begins
By 1810, Iturbide had established a reputation for himself in the military. He'd helped put down a few minor rebellions, but then news of a new one appeared. It was being led by a distant relative of his, Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Hidalgo offered Iturbide a place in this new revolutionary army, but after considering it, Iturbide refused. Hidalgo's army was composed almost entirely of Mexican peasants, armed with little more than sticks and generations of pent up aggression against their tyrannous Spanish overlords.
Like many, however, Iturbide underestimated this army. Hidalgo's forces made it nearly to the gates of Mexico City, cutting through Spanish forces as they went. Iturbide was one of the commanders defeated by this army, although he further distinguished himself for his bravery, tactical skills, and leadership during the battle.
After Hidalgo was killed, the revolution fell to José María Morelos. Iturbide fought Morelos for three years, before landing a crushing defeat against him in 1814. A year later, Morelos was captured and executed. Iturbide became a hero to Spanish loyalists in New Spain, but lost briefly lost his commission in 1816 due to surfacing accounts of cruelties committed by troops under his command.
The Plan de Iguala
After a few years of regaining favor with the right people, Iturbide was finally placed back in command of royalist forces in 1820. His task was to defeat the last remaining revolutionary leader, Vicente Guerrero. By this point, the colonial administrators of New Spain were so confident that they began offering pardons to anyone who abandoned the revolutionary army. Finally, Iturbide and Guerrero met. Iturbide marched his forces towards battle, then without warning switched sides, joined Guerrero and offered the royalist army to the revolutionary cause.
Wait, what? What just happened? If you're confused, you're not alone. Historians have debated Iturbide's sudden change of heart for decades. Why did he switch sides? Most likely, he saw an opportunity for himself. Spain was revamping its own constitution, and those changes could have threatened the landed elites of New Spain. To Iturbide, the best way to secure the future of Mexico's nobility was to seize control of the nation and turn it into an independent kingdom, free of the threat of becoming a republic.
Together, Iturbide and Guerrero drafted the Plan de Iguala, the aim of their new, joint movement in 1821. Under this plan, Mexico would become an independent monarchy, adopt Catholicism as the official religion, and guarantee political and racial equality. These were known as the Three Guarantees, represented by the flag of green, white, and red. Iturbide was named General of the Army of the Three Guarantees, and he marched into Mexico City virtually unopposed. Mexican independence had been won.

Agustín de Iturbide, also called (1822–23) Agustín I,  (born September 27, 1783, Valladolid, Viceroyalty of New Spain [now Morelia, Mexico]—died July 19, 1824, Padilla, Mexico), Mexican caudillo (military chieftain) who became the leader of the conservative factions in the Mexican independence movement and, as Agustín I, briefly emperor of Mexico.
Like many young men of the upper classes in Spanish America, Iturbide entered the royalist army, becoming an officer in the provincial regiment of his native city in 1797. In 1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla offered him a post with his revolutionary army, but Iturbide refused and pledged himself to the Spanish cause instead. His defense of Valladolid against the revolutionary forces of José María Morelos dealt a crushing blow to the insurgents, and for this victory Iturbide was given command of the military district of Guanajuato and Michoacán. In 1816, however, grave charges of extortion and violence caused his removal.

By 1820 the radical independence movement was almost entirely extinguished. Both Hidalgo and Morelos had been captured and executed; only guerrilla bands (under the command of General Vicente Guerrero) prevented the complete victory of the royalists. The Mexican independence movement then performed a curious about-face. In reaction to a liberal coup d’état in Spain, the conservatives in Mexico (formerly staunch royalists) advocated immediate independence. Iturbide assumed command of the army and, at Iguala, allied his reactionary force with Guerrero’s radical insurgents. Iturbide’s Plan de Iguala, published on February 24, 1821, proclaimed three guarantees: (1) immediate independence from Spain, (2) equality for Spaniards and Creoles, and (3) the supremacy of Roman Catholicism and a ban on all other religions. The Army of the Three Guarantees quickly subjugated the country; on August 24, 1821, Juan O’Donojú, the new representative of the Spanish king, signed the Treaty of Córdoba, recognizing the independence of Mexico.
The revolutionary coalition quickly fell apart as Iturbide removed Guerrero and his insurgent following from influence. On May 19, 1822, Iturbide placed the crown upon his own head and became Agustín I, emperor of Mexico. An arbitrary and extravagant ruler, he proved unable to bring order and stability to his country, and all parties soon turned against him. Opposition solidified behind Antonio López de Santa Anna, whose own plan called for Iturbide’s overthrow and exile. On March 19, 1823, Iturbide abdicated and went first to Italy and then to England. In 1824, however, he returned to Mexico, unaware that the congress had decreed his death. Captured on July 15, he was executed four days later. Although regarded by most scholars as a self-serving military adventurer, he has remained for the Roman Catholic church and for the conservative classes the great hero of Mexican independence.

Agustín de Iturbide (1st Emperor of Mexico) - On This Day
Agustín de Iturbide
Profession: 1st Emperor of Mexico
Nationality:
Mexican
Biography: During the Mexican War of Independence, Iturbide built a successful political and military coalition that took control in Mexico City on 27 September 1821, decisively gaining Mexico independence from Spain.
After the liberation of Mexico was secured, Iturbide was proclaimed President of the Regency of Mexico in 1821. He took the throne a year later, becoming the first Emperor of Mexico, reigning from 19 May 1822 to 19 March 1823.
Although Iturbide's reign was short, it defined the political struggles before and after independence. The two ends of Mexico's political spectrum, liberals who favored populist representative government and conservatives who favored a more authoritarian monarchical regime, would each gain the upper hand at various times in the decades after Iturbide's abdication.
Another legacy Iturbide left to Mexico is the current Mexican flag, which he is credited with designing.

Graciela Iturbide Biography
BIOGRAPHY
Graciela Iturbide married the architect 
            Manuel Rocha Diaz in 1962. She had three children from this marriage. 
            She studied cinema at the CUEC film school in the University of Mexico. 
            Iturbide's six year old daughter died in 1970; this led her to inner 
            search, which in turn led her to discover her interest in photography. 
            Between 1970 and 1971, Iturbide collaborated with famous Mexican photographer 
            Manuel Alvarez Bravo. Additionally, she had studied filmography at 
            Mexico's "Centro Unversitario de Estudios Cinematograficos", 
            a division of the UNAM university. While working with Alvarez Bravo, 
            she also learned photography techniques used by the celebrated photographer.
Along with Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide began to explore Mexico's indigenous 
            areas--Indigenous influence would surface later on in her career as 
            a photographer. In 1974, she received the Eugene Smith grant for humanitarian 
            photography, and a scholarship at the Guggenheim college.
In 1979, Iturbide was asked by a man to photograph his village. Interested 
            by the proposal, Iturbide released her first collection, titled "Mujer 
            Angel" ("Angel Woman") and shot at Mexico's portion 
            of the Sonoran desert. Her first experience as a photographer shaped 
            Iturbide's views on life, making her a strong supporter of feminism.
Some of the inspiration for her next work came from her support of 
            feminist causes. Her well known collection, "Señora de 
            Las Iguanas", ("Our Lady of the Iguanas") was shot 
            in Juchitan, Oaxaca, a city where women dominated town life. Her work 
            in Juchitan was not only about women, however: she also shot "Magnolia", 
            a photo of a man wearing a dress and looking at himself on a mirror. 
            It was "Magnolia" that has led many photography experts 
            to say that Iturbide also explored sexuality among Mexicans with her 
            work.
Graciela Iturbide liked Oaxaca, and in 1986, she returned to that 
            area for more photos.
Iturbide also worked in Argentina (during 1996), India (where she 
            shot another well known photo of hers, "Perros Perdidos", 
            or "Lost Dogs"), and the United States, where she did her 
            last known work, an untitled collection of photos shot in Texas.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so from these search results, it seems like there might be some confusion. The first few documents are about Agustín de Iturbide, who was the first Emperor of Mexico in the early 19th century. But the question is about Graciela Iturbide, a photographer, and specifically how she interpreted the Kahlo home and studio site.

Looking back at Doc 5, it mentions Graciela Iturbide, who is indeed a photographer known for her work in Mexico. According to this document, she worked with Manuel Alvarez Bravo and has taken photographs in various places, including Juchitan, Oaxaca, and other locations. It also mentions that she took photos in Texas, which might be relevant.

But I need to find out specifically about her interpretation of the Kahlo home and studio site. Frida Kahlo's home, also known as La Casa Azul, is a significant site in Mexico City, where Kahlo lived and worked. It's now a museum dedicated to her life and work.

I need to find more information about Graciela Iturbide's photographic work related to this site. Perhaps she did a photo series or project focusing on La Casa Azul.

Let me perform another search to find more specific information.

Frida Kahlo—Her Photos
I knew the battlefield of suffering was reflected in my eyes. Ever since then, I started looking straight into the lens, without winking, without smiling, determined to prove I would be a good warrior until the end.
— Frida Kahlo
An exhibition by Frida Kahlo Museum – Casa Azul/Diego Rivera Museum; Banco de Mexico Fiduciario en el Fideicomiso Museos Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo
The Heard Museum presents a selection of more than 240 images from the 6,500 which are part of the Blue House archive. The photographs, along with Frida Kahlo’s personal items, were locked in a room of the Blue House, the residence where she spent most of her life, and revealed to the public in 2007. The images have served as memories to Frida, as work tools or as a means to exorcise solitude. The exhibition Frida Kahlo—Her Photos, curated by the well-known Mexican photographer and photography historian Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, shows the importance of this medium in Frida’s life.
The photographs – taken by Man Ray, Martin Munkácsi, Tina Modotti, Edward Weston, Nickolas Muray, Manuel and Lola Alvarez Bravo and others – were cherished by Kahlo when she was immobilized and isolated in her bed.
Frida Kahlo had a very special relationship with photography. Besides her personal background – both her father, Guillermo Kahlo, and her maternal grandfather were professional photographers – she brought different uses to photography: she collected daguerreotypes and visiting cards (carte de visite in French or tarjeta de visita in the original) from the 19th century, she kept photographs upon which she put her personal stamp, cutting things out from them, writing dedications on them and personalizing them as if they were paintings. Some of the images have red lipstick kisses, others are trimmed or folded. Some have personal notations on the reverse.
These images give visitors an intimate view of Kahlo’s life. The exhibition does not intend to depict a chronological biography, but rather to exhibit parts of the personal history of an artist, of a country and of a period. It is a photographic collage made up of images that allow us to discover new facets of a key figure of the 20th century.
For Frida Kahlo—Her Photos 241 photographs have been chosen, organized into six main subjects: The Origins; The Blue House; Politics, Revolutions and Diego; Her Broken Body; Frida’s Loves and Photography. The images throw new light on Frida Kahlo’s work as an artist, a way of understanding her life in historical and cultural context, and a demonstration of her passion for Mexico.
Please note: No photography or filming of the exhibit is allowed.

"La Casa Azul" was Frida Kahlo's home.
Suzanne Barbezat
The Frida Kahlo Museum, in the former home of the celebrated Mexican artist, is located in the Coyoacán borough of Mexico City. Also known as "La Casa Azul" (The Blue House), this is one of the must-visit Mexico City sights. A visit to her home offers a glimpse into her life.
Although an inscription on the wall of the Casa Azul says that Frida and her husband Diego lived here from 1929 to 1954, this is not actually the case. Frida was born in this house in 1907 and lived here with her family until she married Diego Rivera in 1929. During the early years of their marriage they traveled extensively and lived in a few different places, then they moved to the twin houses designed for them by Juan O'Gorman in San Angel (now open to visitors as the Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo ). Frida moved back to her family home in 1939 when she and Diego were divorced. Upon their remarriage a year later Diego joined her here, maintaining the home in San Angel as his studio.

Portrait of Guillermo Kahlo
Suzanne Barbezat
There are only a few pieces of Frida Kahlo's and Diego Rivera's work exhibited here in the Casa Azul, including My Family (unfinished), Frida and the Cesarean (unfinished), and Frida's final painting, Viva La Vida.
Another of Frida's paintings that is on display in her house museum is the portrait that she made of her father, Guillermo Kahlo. Guillermo immigrated from Germany in 1891 and later became a very respected photographer specializing in Mexico's architectural treasures. He died in 1941 and Frida later painted this portrait of him, some ten years after his death.
You can see more of Frida's work on display at the Dolores Olmedo museum.

Dining Room of La Casa Azul
Suzanne Barbezat
The dining room at La Casa Azul shows Frida's appreciation for traditional Mexican furnishings and decorations. The floor and wooden shelves are painted bright yellow and pieces from Frida's collection of folk art are displayed throughout. Frida and Diego often entertained and this was the spot where they would come together with their guests to enjoy traditional Mexican food and drink and engage in long conversations.

Frida Kahlo's Divorce Clocks
Suzanne Barbezat
During Frida and Diego's turbulent marriage, both of them had numerous affairs. They mostly tolerated these affairs, though reportedly Diego was much more accepting of Frida's involvements with other women than with men. Frida was very hurt when she discovered that Diego was having an affair with her younger sister Cristina, and she separated from him for a few months but they later reconciled. Some time later they divorced and remarried a little over a year later. These clocks represent the time Frida and Diego were apart. On the first clock Frida inscribed: "Se rompieron las horas. Septiembre 1939" ("the hours are broken") and on the second she wrote the place, date and time of their remarriage, "San Francisco California, 8 diciembre 40, a las once."

Kitchen of La Casa Azul
Suzanne Barbezat
The kitchen is located through the hall from the dining room. The same color scheme is continued here, with yellow floor and furnishings, and blue and white walls. Frida favored a traditional wood-burning stove over modern appliances, even though they were available when she moved back to this house later in her life. Large clay pots on the stove and oversize wooden spoons and stir sticks are at the ready, making it seem like this kitchen was just recently abandoned. Tiny ceramic cups hanging on the wall spell out the names of Frida and Diego above the stove, and two doves holding a ribbon appear above a window on another wall.

Frida Kahlo's Bed
Suzanne Barbezat
Frida spent so much time in bed due to her various physical ailments that she has two beds in the house, a day bed, which has a mirror on the canopy, and the bed in her bedroom where she would sleep at night that has a framed collection of butterflies that was given to her by Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist with whom she had an affair.

Bedroom of La Casa Azul
Suzanne Barbezat
Frida requested that when she died her body be cremated. Her ashes rest here in her bedroom in a pre-Hispanic ceramic urn that is shaped like a frog. The frog is to symbolize her love for Diego Rivera who called himself "el sapo-rana" (the toad-frog). Diego requested that he be cremated and his ashes mixed with hers, but his wish was not respected: his ashes were placed in the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons inside the Panteon de Dolores civil cemetery.

Frida with Magenta Rebozo
Suzanne Barbezat
This iconic photo of Frida is called "Frida with Magenta Rebozo." It was taken by Hungarian-born American photographer Nickolas Muray in 1939. They had a love affair that lasted from 1931 when he met her on a trip to Mexico until 1940, but they remained friends for the rest of her life. He took many photos of her both in her home in Coyoacán and in New York City. The portrait is displayed in Frida's bedroom.

The Patio at Casa Azul
Suzanne Barbezat
Diego Rivera was an avid collector of pre-Hispanic art. He and Frida had a stepped pyramid built in the patio of the Casa Azul which they used to display some of his collection pieces. You can see more of his collection at the ​ Museo Anahuacalli which he designed. Entrance to Anahuacalli is included in the admission fee to the Frida Kahlo museum.

She was without doubt one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Frida Kahlo is a mysterious, elegant and passionate woman whose lifeline was freedom. In 1928, after having barely recovered from an accident where she injured her spine and her legs three years earlier, she met the love of her life, Diego Rivera. Forced to endure a long period of bedrest, she completed a superb collection of self-portraits, which she painted using the reflection from a mirror which hung over her bed. Diego Rivera was immediately seduced by Frida ’s paintings. He said, ‘she breaks all the taboos of the woman's body and of female sexuality ." Bound by their love of art, a profound attachment to their country and a shared passion for politics, the pair married in August 1929. Their relationship was marked by the immense success of the two artists, their many trips together, their encounters with the most famous artists of their time: Picasso, Breton, Kandinsky … but also the affairs which were had, notably that of Rivera with his sister-in-law, following which the couple divorced, before remarrying in 1940. They stayed together until Frida Kahlo ’s death in July 1954.
‘Through her paintings, she breaks all the taboos of the woman's body and of female sexuality.’
Vogue explores the intimacy of the artist at the heart of her famous dwelling, which is known as The Blue House, (La Casa Azul). A hub of creation, of passion, of parties and of drama, this quintessentially Mexican villa was the landmark of all the free spirited folk of the 1930s. Frida famously welcomed into her home the likes of Leon Trotsky, André Breton, and of course, she lived there with Diego Rivera.

Transcript
Martina: On an April day in 2004, the famous Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide approached the entryway to an electric blue house in Mexico City. She was at the former house of the painter Frida Kahlo…and today, Graciela had a very special assignment.
Graciela: Yo estaba en la casa de Frida Kahlo, una artista que hoy es muy famosa en Latinoamérica.​ Ella pintó unos cuadros muy impresionantes sobre su vida y su dolor. Muchos años después de su muerte, todavía había muchas cosas que no se sabían de su arte.
Martina: Frida Kahlo was born, lived, and died in this house — which is called “The Blue House.” Today, it’s also known as “The Frida Kahlo Museum.” Every year, thousands of people visit, to learn about the artist and her life. But on that April day, Graciela wasn’t there as a tourist, and the museum wasn’t open to the public.
Graciela: Ese día yo estaba allí porque había recibido una llamada de la directora del museo para tomar unas fotos de un lugar que había estado cerrado por muchos años… un baño.
Martina: For 47 years, the bathroom had remained sealed. Whatever was in there, was a mystery — even to the curators of the museum. Now, for the first time since Frida’s death in 1954, the bathroom had been opened. Nobody knew what this secret room might reveal about Frida’s life…but Graciela was about to find out.
Graciela: Durante la visita, exploré la casa y finalmente llegué a la habitación de Frida.
Caminé por el cuarto hasta llegar frente a su baño. La puerta estaba semiabierta y… entré.
Martina: Bienvenidos and welcome to a special edition of the Duolingo Spanish Podcast. I’m Martina Castro, and this season, we’re digging into some of the greatest mysteries of art and literature in the Spanish-speaking world.
As usual, the storyteller will be using intermediate Spanish and I’ll be chiming in for context in English. If you miss something, you can always skip back and listen again. We also offer full transcripts at podcast.duolingo.com.
Today, we’re taking you behind the scenes of the life and work of one of Latin America’s most famous painters, Frida Kahlo.
Martina: We’ll come back to Graciela Iturbide in a moment, but first let’s take a trip through time to the earliest days of Frida’s life. The Blue House is located in a charming neighborhood called Coyoacán — one of the oldest and most beautiful in Mexico City. And it’s the neighborhood where Frida Kahlo grew up. Marta Turok is an anthropologist who studied Frida Kahlo’s life, including the clothing, or vestimenta, and other objects that still populate her home.
Marta: Frida tenía mucha ropa indígena y se sentía muy orgullosa de ella. Descubrí a Frida a través de su vestimenta y me pareció una mujer fascinante, fuera de lo común.
Martina: When she was first studying Frida Kahlo, Marta learned that Frida had spent her childhood and teenage years in the Blue House surrounded by plants and animals. She had a normal, uneventful life, until she was involved in an accident on September 17, 1925. Frida was 18 years old.
Marta: Ese horrible accidente cambió su vida y su personalidad como artista.
Martina: Frida had been riding a bus when a streetcar…plowed into it. She broke her spine, among other things.
Marta: A Frida la operaron muchas veces después de ese accidente, al menos treinta y dos veces. Ella tuvo que usar corsés ortopédicos de distintos tipos. Todo el dolor y sufrimiento que sintió lo transformó en arte. Ella era la protagonista de sus cuadros.
Martina: One of Frida’s most famous paintings captures the aftermath of her accident. It’s called What the Water Gave Me, and it's a self-portrait of sorts, showing Frida’s feet emerging from a bathtub full of water. She’s clearly in a bathroom, but for years, art experts didn’t know where that bathroom was…
Marta: En el cuadro Lo que el agua me dio se ven las piernas de Frida en una bañera llena de agua. Las uñas de sus pies están pintadas de color rojo, como la sangre. Además, se ve que uno de sus dedos tiene una herida. Era una referencia directa a su sufrimiento después de aquel grave accidente.
Martina: Bedridden much of her life, Frida used mirrors to paint her famous self-portraits, or autorretratos.
Marta: En la habitación de Frida, detrás de su estudio, el tiempo se congela. Hay dos cuartos con dos camas de madera, y una de las dos camas tiene un gran espejo en el techo. Frida lo usaba para verse cuando estaba acostada y, de esta manera, pintar sus autorretratos.
Martina: Despite her injuries, Frida still had a rich social life…and love life. In 1929, when Frida was 22 years old, she married Diego Rivera, who was two decades her senior…and already a famous mural painter.
Marta: Frida y Diego vivieron en la Casa Azul, pero ese lugar era mucho más que una casa; era donde Frida pintaba y donde coleccionaba obras del arte de todo México. La decoración de los jardines y el interior de la casa tienen los colores de México. Allí vivió Frida, hasta que murió en una de sus camas.
Martina: Frida and Diego lived in the house together for the next 15 years, making art, entertaining friends, and holding political meetings…until Frida's death in 1954. Five years after her death, Diego turned the Blue House into a museum to honor his wife's legacy. Marta remembers her first visit.
Marta: La Casa Azul es el lugar donde los objetos personales de Frida revelan su más íntimo universo. En la casa se ven obras muy importantes y, también, la vida diaria de la artista. Es realmente mágico estar allí adentro y, además, es una experiencia imposible de olvidar.
Martina: Even though the house was open to the public…there was one room that was not. Before his death, Diego Rivera issued a request specifying that Frida’s bathroom should not be opened for 15 years… The reasons for this request are still a mystery…
Marta: Nadie sabe exactamente por qué Rivera decidió cerrar ese baño. Quizás simplemente sintió la necesidad de preservarlo como un lugar íntimo de la artista. Algunas personas creen que quizás quería esconder algo allí, pero nunca se supo nada. Él murió sin explicar su decisión.
Martina: But Rivera’s request was respected. In fact, the executors of his will went far beyond his wishes, and left the bathroom sealed not for 15 years…but 47. During this time, Frida’s art and legacy spread all over the world, turning her into a global icon. And yet, important details about her personal history remained hidden away in the sealed room at The Blue House…that is, until April 2004.
Marta: En el 2004, el Museo Frida Kahlo tomó la decisión de abrir el baño otra vez. Llamaron a varios expertos, incluida yo, para analizar los objetos que estaban en ese baño. Nadie se imaginaba lo que íbamos a encontrar ahí y mucho menos que íbamos a descubrir más cosas sobre la fascinante vida de Frida Kahlo. ¡Era increíble! Nadie había entrado allí desde la muerte de Frida.
Martina: Opening Frida’s bathroom wasn’t as easy as just opening a door. The museum had to catalogue everything inside…and no one was sure what they would find. That was when the museum director decided to call up Graciela Iturbide, who is one of Mexico’s most prestigious and respected photographers.
Graciela: La directora del museo es mi amiga y ya había trabajado con ella. Fue un gran honor cuando me llamaron y fui con mucho gusto. Yo había visitado la casa de Frida muchísimas veces, incluso había ido cuando Frida todavía no era tan famosa.
Martina: What had most interested the museum’s curators when they opened the bathroom was a wardrobe inside, which contained a lot of Frida’s clothing.
Graciela: La ropa de Frida era muy famosa. Está en sus cuadros y en sus fotos. Es algo muy característico de ella y de su arte. A través de sus telas se podía conocer mucho más sobre ella. Por esta razón, tomar esas fotos era tan interesante.
Martina: When Graciela arrived for her photoshoot, Frida’s’s clothing had already been removed from the bathroom. Her job was simply to document the fabrics, then leave. But Graciela ended up wandering around the house. The place is huge.
Graciela: Entré por el patio y comencé a caminar dentro de la casa. Exploré la cocina y la sala donde ella pintaba hasta que llegué a su habitación… Ahí vi dos camas, la que tenía un espejo en el techo y la otra con mariposas. También vi objetos de su vida diaria.
Martina: On the right side of the bedroom, at the bottom of two steps, Graciela saw a green metal door leading to the famous bathroom that had been sealed for so many years. She decided to sneak inside…
Graciela: Al llegar cerca del baño, lo primero que me llamó la atención fue el olor. Era una mezcla entre humedad, medicinas y polvo. Era muy fuerte, pero igual entré…
Martina: The bathroom was about 80 ft²…and its most striking feature was a white tile bathtub.
Graciela: Yo creo que esa bañera era importante porque Frida se bañaba allí y era el lugar en donde se relajaba. Era su espacio de intimidad y de creación.
Martina: Graciela began to uncover objects that offered an intimate glimpse into Frida’s life. She saw an iron stick in the bathtub, which Frida had likely used for some kind of physical therapy. Graciela also saw a robe, or bata, stained with blood and paint. To Graciela, these items were a major discovery: they provided real, tangible evidence of the physical pain that had inspired some of Frida’s greatest paintings.
Graciela: Esa bata con sangre era importante porque Frida la usaba cuando pintaba. Y porque como muchas de sus obras de arte, esa bata también era un símbolo de su dolor y sufrimiento.
Martina: There were also several body casts. Graciela recognized them, because Frida had taken some very famous photos in them during the worst days of her injuries…
Graciela: Esos corsés eran importantes porque eran parte constante de su vida. Frida los usaba todos los días para sostener su columna y los representaba en muchas de sus pinturas.
Martina: Graciela was really excited about what she had discovered in the bathroom. Her eyes, trained in photography, knew that the bathroom was a goldmine.
Graciela: Estuve mirando todo por mucho tiempo y luego pensé: “Yo estoy aquí para tomar fotos de las telas, no del baño”. Sin embargo, decidí hablar con la directora del museo y proponerle tomar fotos del baño también.
Martina: Immediately after leaving the bathroom, Graciela ran to speak with the museum’s curator.
Graciela: Hablé con la directora sobre las cosas que había visto en el baño y le dije que eso era lo que yo quería fotografiar.
Martina: The director accepted Graciela’s proposal. She was thrilled! The next day she returned with her best camera.
Graciela: Mi meta era analizar los objetos que estaban en el baño porque todos estaban mezclados y era difícil identificarlos. Entonces mi desafío fue combinar algunos de ellos.
Martina: Graciela got special permission to move the objects around. So she decided to arrange them in a way that would help tell the story of Frida’s life. She put the crutches inside the bathtub; and a corset against the wall, next to the blood-covered smocks.
Graciela: Mi idea con las fotos era mostrar cómo, a pesar del dolor, ella seguía pintando. Yo quería reflejar que la pintura era su verdadera terapia.
Martina: Graciela spent two days, back-to-back, photographing the bathroom. She was alone with her camera, moving around the contents of the room. At one point, when she was photographing the bathtub without anything in it, she thought:
Graciela: Tuve la idea de entrar en la bañera para fotografiar la perspectiva desde allí. Ya adentro, me di cuenta que se veían mis pies y uno de ellos estaba recién operado.
Martina: There, lying in Frida’s bathtub, Graciela felt a special connection with the artist.
Graciela: Sentí una conexión con Frida a través de mi dolor y creo que, en mi lugar, cualquier persona habría sentido lo mismo.
Martina: Afterwards, when she saw the printed photos, Graciela realized that this was the exact same bathtub where Frida had painted her famous self portrait, What the Water Gave Me. Until now, no one had been able to confirm where this self portrait was painted.
Graciela: Yo conocía el cuadro Lo que el agua me dio. Fue algo inconsciente, pero luego me gustó.
Martina: With all the photos she took, Graciela published a book called Frida’s Bathroom in 2006.
Graciela: Cuando tomo fotos, nunca pienso qué va a pasar con ellas o qué impacto van a tener. Pero sentí que, gracias a estas fotos y a esos objetos característicos de su dolor, pude conocer incluso más a esta mujer que logró transformar su propio arte en terapia.
Martina: Graciela's book was a huge success. And the objects she captured are now a crucial part of Frida's collection at the Blue House.
Graciela: Mis fotografías viajaron por muchas partes del mundo y las personas las recibieron muy bien porque les gustó descubrir esa parte de la historia de Frida. Ese baño transmite su dolor de una manera muy directa.
Martina: What started out as a simple request to photograph some clothing, turned into an opportunity to preserve Frida's life, and essence, in one room. The room's discovery served as a way to present Frida not just as an icon, but as a person.
Graciela: Y todo ocurrió porque decidí entrar a un baño. Desde que tomé aquellas fotos, creo que se conoce algo más de la vida de Frida Kahlo, de su dolor y su arte.
Martina: Today the objects found in Frida’s bathroom are on display in the museum. Graciela and Marta both continue to study Frida’s life and work. Marta is focused on the fabrics Frida wore and Graciela is regularly consulted about her book — which has become a piece of art in itself.

Graciela Iturbide’s Mexico
Feb 28
																		to
									Aug 23, 2020
For the past 50 years, Graciela Iturbide (b. 1942, Mexico City) has produced majestic, powerful, and sometimes visceral images of her native Mexico. One of the most influential contemporary photographers of Latin America, Iturbide transforms ordinary observation into personal and lyrical art. Her signature black-and-white gelatin silver prints present nuanced insights into the communities she photographs, revealing her own journey to understand her homeland and the world.
Graciela Iturbide’s Mexico is the artist’s most extensive U.S. exhibition in more than two decades, comprising 140 photographs organized around nine themes. Her photographs that document the Seri, Juchitán, and Mixtec societies offer compelling insight into the daily lives and customs of indigenous men and women. Iturbide demonstrates her deep awareness of complex cultural symbols through representations of processions honoring the dead, as well as lavish, exuberant fiestas that highlight Mexico’s pre-Hispanic and Spanish heritages. Her depictions of animals, birds, and plants are rendered with as much sensitivity as her images of people, calling attention to the relationship between human presence and nature.
Also featured are Iturbide’s haunting snapshots of Frida Kahlo ’s personal items left at her home, Casa Azul (Blue House), after Kahlo’s death. The photographs connect Iturbide to Kahlo, another of Mexico’s most celebrated artists, as two women who have used their craft to grapple with—and transcend—the hardships and tragedies of life.

Okay, so from these search results, I can see that Graciela Iturbide is a renowned Mexican photographer who has been capturing images of Mexico and its people for over five decades. Her work often focuses on indigenous communities and explores themes of identity, culture, and the human experience.

Specifically, regarding the Frida Kahlo home and studio site, also known as La Casa Azul, Iturbide was commissioned to photograph the contents of Frida Kahlo's sealed bathroom in 2004. This bathroom had been closed for 47 years after Kahlo's death in 1954, and when it was finally opened, it contained a wealth of personal items that offered insights into Kahlo's life and artistic process.

Iturbide's photographs of the bathroom and its contents were significant because they provided a glimpse into Kahlo's private world, including her physical struggles and her creative process. The images captured items such as medical devices, clothing stained with blood and paint, and other personal effects that spoke to Kahlo's resilience and her transformation of pain into art.

One particularly poignant moment mentioned is when Iturbide lay in Kahlo's bathtub, reflecting on Kahlo's famous self-portrait "What the Water Gave Me," which depicted Kahlo's lower body immersed in water, symbolizing her physical and emotional turmoil. Iturbide's experience in the bathtub underscored the connection between Kahlo's art and her personal life, highlighting how her environment influenced her creativity.

Moreover, Iturbide's work in documenting Kahlo's bathroom not only preserved these artifacts but also contributed to a deeper understanding of Kahlo's life and legacy. Her photographs have been exhibited and published, allowing a wider audience to appreciate the intimate details of Kahlo's existence and the way she channeled her experiences into her artwork.

In summary, Graciela Iturbide chose to interpret the Kahlo home and studio site by focusing on the personal and private aspects of Frida Kahlo's life through the lens of her sealed bathroom. By photographing the contents of this space, Iturbide revealed the physical and emotional challenges Kahlo faced and how she transformed them into her art, thereby offering a profound and intimate portrayal of one of Mexico's most iconic figures.
