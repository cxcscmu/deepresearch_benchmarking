I'm trying to figure out why the TV show "Criminal Minds" ended. I was really into it for a while, but I missed the finale and haven't been able to find a satisfying explanation for its conclusion. So, I need to do some research to understand what happened.

First, I should probably check when the show ended and how many seasons there were. I think it ran for quite a long time, but I'm not sure about the exact number. Maybe around 10 or 15 seasons? I need to confirm that.

Also, I should look into whether the show was cancelled or if it ended naturally with a finale. Sometimes shows are abruptly cancelled, and other times they wrap up storylines in a final season. It might affect how the ending was handled.

Another aspect could be the cast and crew's involvement. Maybe some key actors left, or the main creators decided to move on to other projects. That could influence the show's continuation.

Additionally, I should consider the show's performance ratings and audience reception over time. If the viewership dropped significantly, that could be a reason for the network to end the show.

Perhaps there were creative differences within the production team or with the network. Sometimes, disputes behind the scenes can lead to a show's conclusion.

I also recall that some shows get renewed for more seasons, but due to various reasons, they decide to end it instead. Maybe "Criminal Minds" had an option for more seasons, but they chose not to proceed.

Moreover, I should check if there was any fan reaction or petition regarding the show's ending. Sometimes, audience response can impact a show's continuation.

Let me start by finding out when the show ended and how many seasons there were.

Why is 'Criminal Minds' ending? Was the show cancelled?

Why Is 'Criminal Minds' Ending? Was The Show Cancelled?
Criminal Minds recently concluded its final season on February 19, 2020. Here is why the show ended and an explanation of the Criminal Minds series finale.

Criminal Minds recently saw the end to its 15th and final season on February 19, 2020. Although the makers have officially clarified that season 15 was the final season of the show, fans are still speculating if there could be a possibility for another season. The show has had a successful run for over 15 years and has gained a huge fan-base. While the Criminal Minds series finale was dramatic, fans got to say a proper goodbye before the door closed behind Penelope.

Earlier in January 2019, the makers of the show announced that they wanted to provide the writer enough time to be able to write a justified ending for all the characters for the 14th season hinting that it would be the last season of the show. But it was later announced that the series has been renewed for the 15th and final season.

The makers originally wanted season 14 to be the last and focused on building a proper ending for it. They later decided that it would make more sense to have another season but with less episodes to give the show a justified ending and tie up all the loose ends. Hence, the final season only had 10 episodes, unlike the previous ones which had 20+ episodes.
Criminal Minds ending explained
SPOILER ALERT!! The finale of the show ended with a party because what fans loved the most during the 15 years is the bond that the co-stars shared. The Criminal Minds ending was dipped in the past for inspiration but resulted in a gentle send-off into a happy future. Penelope Garcia, the dazzling fashionista and white0hat hacker was made the star of the show. Just like Reid, she made it from Season 1 to Season 15. One of the most loved characters, the fans thought that it was only fitting that the epilogue of the Criminal Minds series finale was about her.

For the Criminal Minds series finale, the writers took a substantial amount of time to justify the ending to Reid's character. They resolved his issues through a purgatory-like hallucination while he wobbled on the edge of death. A vision of Maeve walks him through confronting his endless problems and makes him realise his worth as a human being and implored him to move on.
Was Criminal Minds cancelled?
When the show was just renewed for a final season, there were a lot of rumours going around about it being cancelled. The show's writer Erica Messer said that her biggest fear was the channel not bringing back the show. She added that they respected the cast and crew enough to give the series a proper ending.

The Ending Of Criminal Minds Explained
The Ending Of Criminal Minds Explained
CBS
By Meg Bucholtz/Updated: June 15, 2020  5:17 pm EDT
Contains spoilers for Criminal Minds, primarily its series finale, "And in the End"
After 15 seasons and 324 episodes, C riminal Minds took its final bow on CBS on February 19, 2020. The crime procedural had many actors come and go in its storied history, but its final episode prioritized those who had been there from the beginning and made it to the finish line. In a final story far more deeply focused on its family dynamic than any chase of a serial killer, retrospectives and Easter eggs emerged in almost as great a volume as tears from its cast members. Though its viewership had declined in latter years, there are still plenty of Criminal Minds fans out there, and through its series finale, the show sought to celebrate its brightest spots, shout out its best episodes, and resolve long-requested character arcs that many fans craved for years.
The finale of Criminal Minds ends with a party — because what the show actually means to those who came to love it over 15 years is centered on the relationships between the costars. While the episode dipped heavily into the past for inspiration, the ultimate result is a gentle sendoff into a happy future for what historically has been a rather violent piece of television. Here's how that ending celebrated the most important pieces of Criminal Minds' legacy before the final office door shut behind Penelope.
Resolving Dr. Reid's character
CBS
Making Dr. Spencer Reid, played by Matthew Gray Gubler, the primary emotional focus of the first half of the Criminal Minds series finale was the answer to a very old and continuous call to put the tragic genius on the path at last to becoming whole. Being lithe, cute, and nerdy, Reid was naturally the woobie of the show — that's fine for the sometimes-histrionic tone of Criminal Minds, but the trouble was that all these terrible things would happen to Reid. Just a handful of examples include Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) leaving, and then dying off-screen many seasons later; Hotch (Thomas Gibson), the second fatherly figure, leaving; Prentiss (Paget Brewster) faking her death and lying to Reid about it; the multiple near-death experiences Reid himself had; the drug addiction foisted upon him as result of a kidnapping; and the entire situation surrounding his dead girlfriend Maeve (Beth Riesgraf). These moments were never truly dealt with after the fact.
Luckily, the Criminal Minds finale took a substantial amount of time to resolve these issues, some of which date back to the second season, through a purgatory-like hallucination while Reid teetered on the edge of death (again) from a subcranial hemorrhage sustained during the previous episode. A vision of Maeve, who died at the hands of her stalker Diane Turner (Michelle Trachtenberg) on season 8, walks Reid through confronting his endless problems, makes him realize his worth as a human being, and implores him to move on. For the character who has been on nearly every one of those 300-plus episodes, it was the perfect kind of final retrospective any fan would want before saying goodbye to Reid. We all bond to fictional characters in our own ways, and many people would be happy to see acknowledgement from the writers that Reid will finally be OK when all is said and done.
Making Penelope a star
CBS
It's no secret that Kirsten Vangsness' Penelope Garcia, dazzling fashionista and intrepid white-hat hacker, was a wildly popular character on Criminal Minds. Though she was featured on fewer episodes, Penelope made it from season 1 all the way through to 15, the same as Reid. Making the epilogue of the Criminal Minds series finale all about her, then, was the only fitting choice.
Since Rossi (Joe Mantegna) reneges on retiring and will likely drop dead in that job, the party at the end of the episode is to celebrate Garcia entering a new chapter in her life away from the BAU. If Criminal Minds must end, it should indeed be because Penelope must leave for bigger and better things and can no longer hold the team together as their emotional core every day. The show's narrative simply cannot operate without her.
It's an extra cherry on top to open up her love life during the coda, too, by having Luke Alvez (Adam Rodriguez) ask her out to dinner. Her character was defined for a long time by her loneliness, and while fans will never get a canon relationship between Penelope and her work-boo Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) since Derek got married a while back, it will soothe many hearts to see her depart with a possible romance. What's also comforting is that Penelope is moving onto a new job in which she will do just as much good, but not at the cost of her mental health, which was a continuous issue for her character throughout Criminal Minds.
Faces of the past on the Criminal Minds series finale
CBS
As one would expect of any closing retrospective, many old friends and enemies returned on the Criminal Minds series finale in the form of archive footage, particularly for Reid's little episode of solipsism. It's a shame Shemar Moore couldn't return for the curtain call as Derek Morgan, but he's pretty busy these days. As to why Thomas Gibson didn't return and reprise his role as Aaron Hotchner, well, that's a bit more complicated given his abrupt firing during season 12.
The physical returns that did come through were delightful. Erin Strauss (Jayne Atkinson), the BAU chief who died during season 8, made it back to play as Reid's initial Ghost-of-Christmas-Past-esque guide for his life-and-death struggle, representing his many sources of guilt over the course of his career. With that scenario came the great and delightful surprise return of George Foyet (C. Thomas Howell), a.k.a. The Boston Reaper, to taunt Reid as his self-described personal form of Satan. Foyet describes his reason to be there best: that the murder of Hotch's wife on season 5 was the turning point of their entire lives, after which nothing was the same, and it was the beginning of their collective end. This is somewhat meta-textually true, as casting shakeups from Criminal Minds season 6 on meant that the lineup was never quite was it once was, and that affected Reid's character in particular.
Finally, it was heartwarming to see JJ Jareau's (A. J. Cook) husband Will LaMontagne (Josh Stewart) come back for an encore. He tends to only show up for major BAU-family engagements since his contributing storylines on seasons 3 and 7 ended, so it's wonderful the actor had the time to appear for the final canonical family cookout.
Specific frames for a special Criminal Minds sendoff
CBS/Cliff Lipson
The Criminal Minds series finale also took time to emotionally evoke specific episodes — not so much as discrete Easter eggs, but more as conceptual frames. It's fair to say this finale is meant first and foremost for fans of the show's heyday between seasons 4 and 10, and that's where most of the evocations come from. At one point, Diana (Jane Lynch) asks Penelope if her son Spencer has been hospitalized before. Any longtime fan probably had a tonally-inappropriate joke at that, given Reid's long history — he's been melodramatically hospitalized more times than any other character on the show.
Beyond that tidbit, however, are broader strokes that only older fans might see. The entire scenario surrounding David Rossi's (Joe Mantegna) wife Krystall (Gail O'Grady) being captured by the series' last major serial killer Everett Lynch (Michael Mosley), a.k.a. The Chameleon, has shades of reference to the magnificent episode 100, during which Aaron Hotchner's (Thomas Gibson) ex-wife is murdered. It's particularly noteworthy for the fact Lynch pretends to be a federal agent to enter the house, much the same way Foyet got Haley Hotchner (Meredith Monroe) to let him in. It ends in a much, much better place for Rossi, but the emotional reference is unmistakable.
The final party at Rossi's house is a special reference back to other unwanted departures during tumultuous times in Criminal Minds history. It was where the team held their wake for BAU Chief Erin Strauss, for one. The season 7 episode "Run" ends with JJ officially marrying her longtime partner Will in Rossi's backyard; it was also Prentiss' last major episode (besides a couple of cameo appearances) before her official full-time return on season 12. It feels almost exactly the same in the Criminal Minds series finale: there's an extended montage of them dancing and having fun together, big emotional speeches, and collective bittersweet enjoyment.
It may be sad to see them all leave our television screens, but the entire cast and crew of Criminal Minds made sure that though they may be going, they're all going together.
The Criminal Minds series finale could have been wildly different

Series finales are always a big deal, but especially so when the show hits double-digit season count. Understandably, Criminal Minds' cast and crew wanted the finale and the episodes leading up to it fit the magnitude of the moment. According to showrunner Erica Messer, that magnitude meant entertaining just about anything for the send-off, including episode pitch ideas that were huge departures from the usual tone for the series.
As she explained to Entertainment Weekly, "Yeah, there was crazy stuff thrown out in the room, and we didn't just shoot it down. We would say, 'Okay, how could that happen?' The idea of a live episode or — what do you call it? — a documentary film crew following the crew around. We ended up exploring some of those, but ultimately we weren't able to find a way to keep it true to the series. A musical would just take you so far out, that we just didn't know if that would be the right way to go or not."
We understand that a musical episode is too much of a departure and probably would have been exorbitantly expensive, but allow us one moment's worth of entertainment in considering Gilbert-and-Sullivan-esque overtures about serial murder: "Rossi is the very model of an investigator criminal / he's got information forensical, carceral, and behavioral." See? And that's just the first draft!
Jokes aside, however, it makes more sense to reject the idea of demolishing the fourth wall in favor of the character-centric decisions they ultimately went with. As fun as watching an Office- like scenario or witnessing Reid doing pirouettes on a metatexual stage might have been, Criminal Minds lived and ultimately died with its people closest to its heart.

'Criminal Minds’ Devastated Fans With That Dramatic Series Finale
It's so hard to say goodbye to the BAU!
By Megan Stein
Feb 20, 2020
The “Criminal Minds” Cast Through the Years
by Country Living US
Criminal Minds aired its series finale on February 19, 2020.
The two-hour event was a tear-jerker, and fans shared a lot of emotional memories after it was over.
After 15 seasons, Criminal Minds has officially ended.
We all knew this was coming, but it hadn’t really sank in until the two-hour series finale that left everyone sobbing into their couch pillows. The episodes were as amazing as we would have hoped for, though, and no one we love got killed off (except the jet, RIP).
Throughout the final moments, we got one last UnSub chase where Rossi (Joe Mantegna) finished off the Chameleon. We got to take a trip through Reid’s (Matthew Gray Gubler) mind and visit with old friends like Hotch (Thomas Gibson), Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), and Morgan (Shemar Moore). And we got a real proper goodbye with the final scene between Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) and the rest of the team.
Cliff Lipson
For perhaps the first time in TV history, it seems the general consensus was the Criminal Minds farewell was actually handled perfectly. Yes, people are fully heartbroken, but fans seem to think the writers did the longstanding series justice with its conclusion.

People called it “the end of an era” and actually wrote the words “I’m so glad it got an ending like this.” Others called out memories of when they first started watching, and how it’s stuck with them over time. One even mentioned the uniqueness of the crime drama.
What did you think of the ending?

The Real Reason Criminal Minds Was Canceled
The Real Reason Criminal Minds Was Canceled
By Brian Boone/Updated: June 15, 2020  5:18 pm EDT
Beginning in 2005, millions of TV viewers dutifully tuned in each week to CBS's juggernaut of a crime drama, Criminal Minds.The show followed the high-stakes work of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit, a specialized group of law enforcement and psychology all-stars who profile, track down, and stop the worst of the worst bad guys, or "unsubs" (short for "unknown subjects"). Why so popular? Well, it's always satisfying to see the consistent triumph of good over evil, embodied by hard-working, morally upright investigators such as Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness).
But that's all over now. In February 2020, Criminal Minds came to an end after 15 seasons and more than 300 episodes. Why would the network say goodbye to this still popular, still engaging, still prominent hit? It's got its reasons, baby girl.
A short order for Criminal Minds' final season that took too long
It's usually quite easy to tell just how valuable a show is to a network by how quickly its executives ask that show's producers for another round of episodes. For example, NBC's Will & Grace revival did so well during its first season (2017–18) that the network renewed it for seasons two and three before that first season had concluded. Conversely, last-minute re-ups generally indicate a network that's wishy-washy on its decision, meaning a show is likely getting ready to be canceled. Deadline reported in May 2018 that the Criminal Minds renewal for season 14 "came down to the wire" as network and studio hashed out negotiations.
Another sign of dwindling network interest: smaller episode counts. The number of Criminal Minds season 14 episodes wasn't initially revealed, but CBS eventually decided on 15, far less than the standard order of 22. The final season was even shorter — just ten installments .
It's a new day at CBS, and Criminal Minds no longer fits in
This point in time is something of a crossroads for CBS. The network just might be looking ahead to the future and a new era of programming. Not only did it lose its highest-rated comedy with The Big Bang Theory coming to an end in the spring of 2019, but a big chunk of the network's primetime programming is decidedly long in the tooth. Blue Bloods, Big Brother, Survivor, NCIS, and NCIS: Los Angeles have all hit at least ten seasons. Actively losing another of its ancient, flagship shows in Criminal Minds signals a new start for the Eye.
It may also represent a symbolic break with the CBS of yore, the one controlled by disgraced CBS Corporation chairman and CEO Les Moonves. The veteran broadcasting executive resigned his post in September 2018 amid a slew of sexual misconduct allegations. CBS's new leaders just may want to have anything Moonves approved off the air as soon as possible.
Too much drama on this drama
Most any job is stressful, including making television. Criminal Minds was plagued by more than its share of ugly and embarrassing scandals over the years. Original cast member (and arguably the show's lead actor) Thomas Gibson got himself fired in 2016 after 11 seasons playing Aaron Hotchner when a heated discussion with writer/producer Virgil Williams escalated into the actor kicking Williams. In 2010, Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) and A.J. Cook (J.J.) were ostensibly fired due to budget cuts.
Brewster later told the A.V. Club what actually happened — a CBS executive called then-showrunner Edward Allen Bernero with an order to replace the fired actresses with younger ones. Bernero ultimately quit, and Brewster and Cook eventually returned to the show. Those incidents — among others — could have very well played into CBS's decision to throw its proverbial arms up in the air when Criminal Minds was finally canceled. Who wants a workplace that's more than occasionally full of this kind of weirdness and generally bad stuff?
The Criminal Minds boss is out

Numerous Criminal Minds cast members have moved on and CBS is obviously ready to do the same. It would seem that the main creative force behind the crime procedural is ready to try new things in a new environment. ABC Studios, a division of the ABC television network, produces Criminal Minds, and CBS pays a lot of money for the privilege of airing it. In 2017, ABC struck a big deal with Criminal Minds showrunner Erica Messer. The network now funds her own boutique imprint, Erica Messer Productions, from which she develops new TV drama series.
Messer knows good television — before Criminal Minds, she worked on Party of Five, Alias, and Charmed. It would be hard to keep a show on CBS when the showrunner has a lucrative deal at a production company owned by a rival network. ABC would probably prefer to keep its talent in-house, and have Messer produce shows exclusively for networks in the ABC family. In 2019, the network announced that two new dramas from Messer's camp were In the works: Best Kept Secret and Nightingale.
Out with the old and in with the new
Broadcast networks aren't like streaming services. While Netflix and Hulu can host a seemingly infinite number of options, networks are constrained by time. CBS's evening schedule consists of three hours of programming every night of the week, and four on Sundays. That's only 22 total hours of TV, and even within that limited amount of space, there isn't much turnaround. Stalwarts like 60 Minutes and various iterations of NCIS aren't going anywhere, so the Eye Network doesn't have the bandwidth to launch many new series each fall. Canceling a fading show like Criminal Minds frees up a precious hour of room in the schedule.
That's some space that CBS really needs. The final season of Criminal Minds aired for only 10 weeks, and then got out of the way to allow a new show the chance to develop a following (and earn the network some advertising revenue). There are plenty of shows awaiting the chance — CBS ordered seven new shows for the 2019-2020 season.
Criminal Minds is starting to feel dated
Criminal Minds had been on the air since 2005, spanning well over 300 episodes. That's a staggeringly long and impressive run, and one that places it among the most enduring network dramas of all time. However, there are only so many twisted murderers, demented cult leaders, and creepy kidnappers out there in the Criminal Minds verse, and the show's brave and dedicated law enforcement officials may have just about rounded up the last of them. In short, the show has simply run its course. Even the best series can and eventually do run out of ideas at some point, and having passed the 300 episode benchmark makes this a logical, understandable time to close up the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
Not only has Criminal Minds' time come, but it's out of step with other law enforcement shows on the air. Its reliable formula feels like it came from another, bygone era of TV... because, well, it did. Today's crime series have gone in two directions: gritty, challenging, and artsy — such as True Detective or American Crime Story — or safe and comfortable reboots like Magnum, P.I. Criminal Minds just didn't fall into either camp.
Criminal Minds no longer rated highly
A lot of factors play into a network's decision to end a popular series, but it almost always comes down to one big X-factor: ratings. If enough people watch a show, a network can charge companies big bucks to advertise their products during that show. If the ratings stay high, the network earns a tidy profit in ad revenue. Should that pattern hold, a show could stay on the air indefinitely. Case in point: 60 Minutes, still a major draw after more than 50 years on the air. But if ratings drop too far and/or too fast, well, there's the door.
Criminal Minds' most recent numbers are nowhere near its highest levels. In the 2018-19 season, it placed just outside the top 40 most-watched shows on broadcast TV, pulling in an average of 8.22 million viewers. That's a big fall from the 2008-09 season, when Criminal Minds was the 11th-most-watched show on TV. The numbers don't justify CBS keeping it around after next year.
Criminal Minds? More like Criminal Mind$
The longer a show sticks around, the more expensive it is to produce. Actors can earn more money each time they re-negotiate their contracts to stick around for a few more seasons. They've got producers in a bind — they kind of have to pay the actors what they want so as to keep a show's audience-drawing cast intact. However, a show's popularity and ratings tend to naturally slip over time, meaning the longer a series runs, it becomes less profitable due to declining ad rates and increasing production costs. If it's no longer financially worth it for a network to proceed in such a matter, they'll cut the dead weight of an expensive, long-running show.
For example, Criminal Minds ratings were nowhere near series highs, but in 2017, original cast members Kirsten Vangsness and A.J. Cook signed new contracts and got substantial raises, ones that gave them salary parity with well-paid co-star Matthew Gray Gubler. All those salaries stick out on the CBS ledger, and couldn't help but play a part in the show being canceled.
Who's this person and where did the other one go?
Crime procedurals are supposed to be rock-solid, ultra-reliable TV institutions. Viewers expect these kinds of shows to be pretty much the same thing, week in and week out, populated by the same set of familiar faces for years on end. Criminal Minds didn't adhere to those unwritten rules, churning out more than 300 episodes despite sporting one of the most active revolving doors in TV casting history.
That lack of stability tends to turn off viewers, as Criminal Minds' downward-trending ratings over the last decade would indicate. Mandy Patinkin (BAU Chief Jason Gideon) left in 2007, Thomas Gibson (Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner) got terminated in 2016, Shemar Moore departed in 2016 and moved on to S.W.A.T., and Paget Brewster and A.J. Cook's characters, Emily Prentiss and Jennifer Jareau, respectively, were written out for a spell. Other actors and actresses who came and went from the BAU: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Damon Gupton, and Rachel Nichols.
There might be a reunion movie someday
Throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s, CBS got into a nostalgia habit, regularly airing two-hour-long, made-for-TV revival movies of some of its most popular crime, cop, and mystery shows of yesteryear. Viewers got the chance to watch one or two more exciting adventures featuring well-known characters from Simon & Simon,Diagnosis Murder,Cagney & Lacey, and Murder, She Wrote. Producing and broadcasting such projects grew dormant at CBS, but the idea just might make a comeback with Criminal Minds.
In advance of the series finale, Parade asked Criminal Minds showrunner Erica Messer if the storyline allowed for the possibility of a TV movie. "You don't shut down the BAU. Can't do that," she said. "And it was that interesting thing of having to please so many people at the end of this show, where it's like, 'Well, don't end it forever and ever because what if it could have another life elsewhere?'"

Why Is 'Criminal Minds' Ending? Its 15th Season Will Be Its Last
Home > Entertainment > Criminal Minds

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got this question: why did "Criminal Minds" end? I need to figure this out. First things first, I should probably understand when the show ended and how long it was on the air. From what I remember, it was on for quite a while, but I'm not exactly sure about the details.

Looking back at the search results, Doc 1 says that "Criminal Minds" ended on February 19, 2020, and it had 15 seasons. So, that lines up with my memory. It's been a few years since it ended, but I still see people talking about it online, which suggests it had a pretty dedicated fan base.

Now, as to why it ended, the article mentions that the makers originally wanted season 14 to be the last but decided to extend it to a 15th season to give the show a proper ending. It seems like they were planning to wrap things up neatly, which is good because I hate it when shows end abruptly without resolving storylines.

One thing that stands out is that the 15th season only had 10 episodes, compared to previous seasons that had around 20 or more. That suggests that the network maybe wasn't fully committed to another full season, or perhaps they wanted to contain costs. Maybe they were testing the waters to see if there was still an audience for it.

Another point from Doc 1 is that the writers took time to justify the ending, especially for characters like Dr. Reid and Penelope Garcia. It sounds like they tried to give the fans a satisfying conclusion, which is important for longevity.

Moving on to Doc 2, it provides more insight into the series finale. It talks about how the ending focused on the relationships between the characters, which is a common theme in long-running shows. It seems like the finale was more about saying goodbye to the characters and the ensemble cast rather than solving another crime.

The article mentions that the finale was emotional and included callbacks to earlier seasons, which is typical for series finales. It's a way to致敬整个系列的历史和粉丝的忠诚。

关于为什么是佩内洛普·加西亚（Penelope Garcia）的故事作为结尾的重心，文章解释说她是贯穿整个系列的角色之一，从第一季到第十五季都在。因此，她的故事成为结束整个系列的合适选择。此外，她的角色在团队中扮演着情感核心的角色，她的离开象征着团队的解散。

再看看Doc 3，这是来自《乡村生活》杂志的一篇文章，标题是“《犯罪心理》系列大结局令人心碎”。文章中提到，尽管大结局让粉丝们非常感动，但整体上粉丝们认为这个结局处理得很好。很多人在社交媒体上表达了他们对这个系列的热爱以及对角色们的深厚感情。

这表明，尽管剧集结束了，但它的影响力依然存在，粉丝们仍然怀念这部剧和它的角色。

Doc 4提供了一些关于为什么《犯罪心理》被取消的更深层次的原因。文章提到了几个因素，包括制作成本上升、收视率下降、制作过程中的戏剧性事件，以及网络电视台想要更新其节目阵容。

特别是，文章提到CBS可能正在为新的时代做准备，想要更新其节目阵容，摆脱一些长期运行的节目，如《犯罪心理》，以便为新剧集腾出空间。

另外，原主演托马斯·吉布森因与编剧发生冲突而被解雇，以及其他演员的进出，可能也影响了节目的稳定性，导致观众流失。

最后，Doc 5提到，尽管《犯罪心理》已经结束，但有可能会制作一部电影来重聚演员，延续故事。这在电视史上并不罕见，许多热门剧集在结束后通过电影或特别篇来满足粉丝的需求。

总的来说，《犯罪心理》结束的原因可能是多方面的，包括收视率下降、制作成本增加、演员变动以及网络电视台的战略调整。不过，从粉丝的反应来看，他们对系列 finale 的处理感到满意，尽管心中难免有不舍。
