I've been hearing a lot about how used car prices have gone up recently. I'm curious to know why that's happening. I think it might have something to do with the pandemic, but there might be other factors too. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably look into what's been going on in the automotive industry lately. Maybe there's a shortage of new cars, which is driving up the price of used ones. Or perhaps more people are buying used cars for some reason. I need to gather some information to understand this better.

Let me start by searching for why used car prices have increased. I'll look for recent articles or data that can explain this trend.

In January 2020, Eddie Lee was on the verge of selling his 2013 Dodge Charger, but he wasn’t impressed with the amount CarMax offered: $9,500. “It wasn’t a great offer, and I was in no rush to sell it,” Lee told Vox.
© Ben Hasty/MediaNews GroupMore buyers are eyeing the used car market. But for those who can afford it, customers are buying larger, more expensive vehicles new.
Then, say it with me, the pandemic happened.
In September, Lee, who lives in Howard County, Maryland, sold that same car for $11,000 on CarMax, a $1,500 increase from the offer he received in January.
“When I heard used car prices were reaching levels unseen in several years, I took it to CarMax and it was a done deal,” Lee said.
Used car prices surged 21 percent since last April, including a 10 percent increase in April 2021 alone, according to the Consumer Price Index. Demand for used cars has increased, and while new car sales are up compared to January 2020, the auto industry doesn’t have a steady flow of new vehicles on hand. This can be traced back, in part, to another staple of pandemic consumerism: a disruption in the supply chain.
Cars never quite reached the coronavirus unavailability of toilet paper — if you wanted to buy one, you were almost certainly able to. However, the secondhand car market is notably different from what it was pre-virus. Your new car may not be the model you wanted, and it certainly won’t be a steal. As much as it might seem counterintuitive, low sales are helping fuel higher prices.
The used car market is deeply entangled with the new car market
The used car market is significantly larger than the new car market: About 40 million used cars were sold in 2019, compared to about 17 million new vehicles. But as one auto industry expert described it to me, they operate in tandem.
“The used car market relies on inventory from elsewhere,” Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at the automotive research site Edmunds, told Vox in October. Caldwell explains that stock in the used market comes from customers trading in old cars for new ones or turning over leased vehicles, as well as from other sources, like rental car companies casting off the tired fleet for fresh models.
But as the pandemic heated up, elements of that makeshift supply chain were impacted by more traditional disruptions in the new car supply chain: locked-down plants and skeleton crews. Currently, a global shortage of semiconductor computer chips has stalled the manufacturing process. Automakers are struggling with tens of billions of dollars in losses, according to NPR, and workers are facing temporary layoffs or hourly cuts.

“While the new car market took a big hit to sales, that affected the used market supply because you don’t have people trading in their cars as much or ending their auto leases on as regular a basis as before,” Caldwell said.
After the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government tried to spur the auto industry by passing legislation that would incentivize car-buying. Under the Car Allowance Rebate System, also known as the “Cash for Clunkers” program, people trading in old models could qualify for a discount of $3,500 or $4,500 off the purchase of a newer, more fuel-efficient vehicle.

There’s been no similar program following the latest recession as the automotive industry recovers from shutdowns and catches up to meet current demand. The industry is currently experiencing a V-shaped recovery, Caldwell said, even without auto-specific initiatives.
Certain kinds of cars and certain kinds of customers are keeping the new car market afloat: Aaron Bragman of Cars.com says that these shoppers are looking for large SUVs and pickup trucks. This popularity has led SUV prices to “go up considerably” by a couple thousand dollars. “Nobody wants a family sedan anymore, and SUVs are frankly just more expensive,” he said.
For some, that’s not a problem. “The folks who are buying [new] cars are not financially suffering because we can see that transaction prices are going up,” Caldwell said. And those buyers are in luck: Interest rates are unusually low, taking some of the shock off of the high price tag. Caldwell explained a trajectory not unlike the much-discussed K-shaped economic recovery, with wealthier people able and incentivized to buy new cars: “They’re buying more expensive or larger vehicles, and are moved to do so because the interest rates are low.”
But new and used car dealerships tend to have both different kinds of stock and different demographics of buyers.
With the new car market out of reach, some buyers turn to used
Pricey SUVs may reign on the lot, but the lack of smaller, cheaper cars forces younger, lower-income buyers out of the new car market. Buyers who can’t afford a new Toyota Highlander are looking for something pre-owned and affordable and may find themselves thrown into a market where sedans are still an option. On Reddit, first-time car buyers, primarily young adults and teenagers, seek advice from seasoned buyers and dealers on the subreddit r/UsedCars to determine which models require less maintenance, are reliable, and fit their budgets.
Demand for used vehicles has risen so much that dealers are reportedly running ads and calling up car owners, according to the New York Times. They attribute this spike to economic difficulty that might inspire customers to seek out a less-expensive alternative, but that’s not all. There are also, they say, buyers who are looking to avoid public transit and ride-sharing in light of the coronavirus.
Anecdotally, it certainly seems as though there has been an increase in first-time car buyers — with trend pieces about New Yorkers buying cars popping up from the New York Times to the Wall Street Journal — but industry insiders are not solely crediting these consumers with the increase in demand. Car lease periods are constantly ending, with many renters considering either a lease extension or a purchase.
“People are still buying cars regardless, and the factors that play into that decision could be low interest rates coupled with utility,” Bragman said. “If they’re looking for something cheaper and functional, not necessarily flashy, they might turn to the used car market.”
This increased demand, coupled with the still-recovering supply chain, means that even while sales are down, demand and supply remain tight, allowing prices to stay high and not waver.
As 2021 approaches, however, Caldwell predicted that used car prices will fall slightly: “There’s a finite period of time towards the end of the year when the model becomes one year older. So I’d imagine prices would briefly drop.” Even in a pandemic, cars lose value simply when the calendar turns to another year.
For now, though, it’s boom time for sellers — depending on their comfort level. Lee thinks he could’ve gotten a better deal if he sold the vehicle privately, up to $2,000 more, but because of the coronavirus, he wanted to minimize his interactions with strangers. Still, as a seller, he made out pretty well. “When I did the math, I got almost 70 percent of my money back for the Charger and put 15,000 miles on it,” Lee said.

Used Car Prices Have Increased 30 Percent
By Matt Posky on June 7, 2021
Tweet
We’ve been covering the staggering increase of automobile pricing all year, starting with the second-hand surge created by rental industries sucking up used models to replace all the vehicles they dumped during the pandemic. A year of suppressed demand and prolonged restrictions absolutely crippled supply chains and placed the automotive sector in an extremely difficult position going into 2021. We wish we could say things were improving but the most heartening news we’ve come across was the possibility that select manufacturers might soon have a line on semiconductor chips — hopefully encouraging new vehicle production.
0 seconds of 1 minute, 4 seconds Volume 0%
But the used market is still heading into uncharted waters. According to data collected by CarGurus , the typical price for a used automobile increased by about 30 percent against this time last year. Though more worrying is how much of that spike is consolidated within the last 90 days.
While no segment or brand has managed to avoid price inflations, used pickup trucks saw the largest increases with today’s average transaction swelling to 44.21 percent larger against 2020 rates. The rest hovered between 15 and 31 percent, with rates depending almost entirely on the popularity of the body style. Electric vehicles also saw an increase in value on the secondhand market, despite having one of the worst deprecation curves imaginable. Still, most data sheets we saw had used EVs trading at prices only a few percentage points higher (e.g. 6 percent for Tesla) than they would have been this time in 2020 while minivans had gone up in value by 22 percent.
While the list has some defunct brands (e.g. Saturn) seeing huge boosts in valuation, it’s likely more useful to keep tabs on existing brands. High-volume companies seemed to see the largest increases in pricing and pickup-centric nameplates tended to be at the top of the curve. Secondhand Ram, Ford, GMC, and Chevrolet products were all trading ownership at rates over 37 percent higher than this period in 2020. So was Aston Martin, which isn’t known for pickups and kind of mucks up the theory. The rest of the pack still saw sizable pricing increases over the same timeframe, with only premium Italian brands and Tesla managing to stay below double digits on the used market.
But not every study was as grim as the one furnished by CarGurus. Though it could be due to most of them not having figures from May and the pricing increase seemingly hitting the hardest over the last two months. In fact, valuations actually dipped slightly at the start of 2021 before commencing their ascension in the middle of March. We’ll be watching to see if outlets like iSeeCars and Cox Automotive paint a similar picture later this month.
Though we doubt they’ll be putting together a report that looks contrastingly sustainable. Pricing is getting out of control and if things don’t turn around soon, the big problem will be about things more immediate than how much money people are willing to spend on their next vehicle.

I bought a 2011 Ford Ranger 4×4 in September for $13,200. It had only 44,000 kilometers on the clock, so I figured I got a good deal. I sold in February for $16500. Now, I find out I could have gotten well over 20k for it so I’m kicking myself. Prices for trucks especially are going through the roof around here.

It isn’t the US consumers that are buying those vehicles and taking them home. It is the Canadian dealers who continue to ship their cars to the US wholesale auctions like they have always done with late model vehicles so some extent or another.
Here is one company that I used to drive by daily which specializes in exporting cars to the US. https://www.linkedin.com/company/crossborder-vehicle-group/about/

When I was shopping for an unusual pickup truck (2009-2013 Chevy Silverado Hybrid / GMC Sierra Hybrid), I was surprised by how many of the trucks I ran Carfax reports on had been owned by Canadians.
I’m really glad someone owned them, because I greatly prefer the hybrid driving experience in a pickup truck — and the one I bought cost about 25% of what I’d have to pay for a new F-150 Hybrid. Thank you, Canada!

A used car dealer acquaintance told me before COVID that the Americans were keeping his business alive. Another dealer told me that American business had driven prices up 30 percent and that Americans were “lined up to buy cars” at some outlets. Hearsay, I know.
I’m not sure how (or if) this affected prices after COVID, but it sure seemed to set the ball rolling.

Cars with mechanical speedo.

Scoutdude
June 7th, 2021 at 6:35 pm
Cars with digital odo have a way to switch between the two, either a dedicated button or in some menu. Most speedos are dual marked if the aren’t digital.
A 2010 Fusion we used to have was one of those lease returns imported from Canada. I did find that when the battery was disconnected it would default to metric upon rebooting but it took all of 10-15 seconds to go into the menu and switch it back.
Now back in the day part of the import process was to convert the speedo and there were shops that did that work. I ran across a couple years ago that had a sticker on the door jamb noting that the speedo had been changed upon importation per what ever federal regulation.

I think my C5 does the kph/mph elegantly. You hit the english/metric button and the backlight changes from mph to kph and the needle adjusts accordingly. No tiny numbers for one or the other and no digital nonsense.

I would think that current energy policy and increasing fuel price would lead to pickup/solid axle SUV prices go down while smaller, more efficient cars go up.

Again you don’t seem to understand how the world works. This isn’t about the price of fuel or energy policy it is about the gap between the haves and have-nots that increased during the pandemic and recovery.
In other words those with money still have money and they aren’t afraid to spend it. Meanwhile those in the middle that still have money are afraid to spend it and those that didn’t have much have less than before and are holding on to it.

@slavuta,
If all other things were equal, an increase in fuel prices would main a decrease in demand for large vehicles.
However, that’s not the case, because several things are changing at once:
* Vehicle supply is constrained due to the chip shortage. Even if demand shrinks, if supply shrinks more, the prices still go up.
* Work-from-home means people like me aren’t as concerned about MPG because commuting is no longer the main source of mileage. I’m an efficiency nerd and Hybrid/EV fan. However, I’m a member of the work-from-home class, and the fact that I don’t need to commute changes my requirements rather dramatically. Buying a GMT900 hybrid, instead of a small commuter car, ticks all of the boxes for me in WFH-world — because I use my vehicle mostly to haul people and stuff, rather than for commuting. I use much less gasoline than I did prior to WFH, even though I have a less efficient (but more capable) vehicle.
Your model would make a useful forecast if you could hold all other things equal. However, all other things are not equal. This stuff is as complicated as real life. Who knew?!?

As opposed to tradesmen and factory workers with physical presence required by job duties, yes, WFH workers are a different social class.
I am on my way to becoming a member of the Lounge Around At Home (LAAH) class – retired. My current work commute is from the bedroom to the living room to use a VPN to access a work computer and some months go by with only a few hundred miles added to car mileage. People like me should retard the price increases somewhat.

I’m not sure how much of this is due to actual price increases and how much is due to the have vs have not.
I’m guess it has a lot to do with the have vs have not increasing the ratio of near new used vehicles vs older used vehicles in the market place. Leases continued to end giving a reasonable supply of late model used cars. Meanwhile those in the middle are more likely to be holding pat and waiting things out. So the supply of the 5-6 year old trade ins is down. The fact that many people reduced the amount of miles driven also factor into this. Not only on the older used side where it helps people feel comfortable with standing pat but also on the lease return market where vehicles are getting turned in with much lower miles than expected giving them a boost in value.
To get the full picture we need to know how the average age, mileage and model/trim level has changed over the past year.
Yes used car prices are definitely up I’m just not so sure that those numbers reflect the increase of specific vehicles.

I’m skeptical. This spike in prices seems too broad, with prices up in every category. My own two newest vehicles—one late-model and low miles, one 5 years old with relatively high miles—have both appreciated substantially in the past three months according to KBB.
My read is that a combination of pent-up post-pandemic demand, rental companies snapping up all the late models they can get their hands on, and the chip shortage has just created a supply problem at the high end that reverberates all across the market.

I agree that in general it is basic supply vs demand economics, but I do think a lot of it is also due to a change in who is buying and selling and who isn’t buying and selling.
I’ve seen that a lot in Seattle area Real Estate. The number of ~$1m homes selling for cash is way up. Meanwhile in many lower price segments the ratio of vacant homes vs occupied homes has swung in favor of vacant homes. Some of it is people cashing out of rental properties. Some of it is due to those people who payed cash selling off their old home. However it is mostly due to people who need to sell to buy staying out of the game due to fear that they won’t be able to find a desirable replacement in a timely manner.

My mental model of this is that the following things are happening:
1) New car production is constrained due to the semiconductor shortage. New car prices go up.
2) Used car supplies are constrained, due to the lack of new cars turning into used cars. Used car prices go up.
The haves vs. have-nots issue is in play (have-nots buy used cars formerly owned by haves) for sure, but I think it’s only part of the story. If it were the whole story, the new car market would be mostly undisturbed.

Point #2 has been going on since 2014, everyone thought the lease glut 2012-15ish would eventually hit the market and bring a balance but it never really happened.
I mostly agree on Point #1 but a percentage of it is a complete lack of oversight on the financing companies. How about, no you can’t sell a 96 month loan on a *vehicle*. If someone is going to sign a note for a 96 month car payment, they are not a qualified buyer; period. Given high demand, its not as if every unit is not going to be sold so by allowing that unqualified buyer to compete is adding to the competition of qualified buyers. Just like FHA 3% notes for 600 FICO in real estate, though they may not be as much of a problem these days.
96 month no joke, as low as 3.99% no less!
72 months back to MY12, which is now nine years old. How is that possible? Gosh I’ll finally have this paid off when its 15 years old, happy days!

Rumor keeps having it that the rental companies are also buying up A LOT of available very-late-model used inventory, likely at desperation prices so they can honor a bunch of upcoming full-price reservations. That and the chip shortage alone are almost enough IMO to explain current market conditions.

I looked up the private party values of our fleet at kbb.com. The Infiniti and the Focus are up a bit. What surprised me was the seven-year-old AWD Sienna LE. It’s worth nearly $20k!
The best way to help alleviate the shortage is to hang onto what you already own for another year or two. I was thinking about replacing the Infiniti this fall with either a Tesla Model 3 Long Range or a VW Golf R. If I do, it will be fall of 2022, not 2021.

New car dealer lots near me are draining inventory. Seems like the upstream material shortages are starving the factories and the dealers, so people go and buy used, thus driving up used prices.
Can someone say if ATPs are up on new cars? I’d imagine that new car dealers aren’t going to negotiate much with high demand across the board.
All of this is why I’m willing to fix my older cars, and why I might just buy out my lease. I can keep it for less than its trade-in value.

Other factors are also in play in the rising prices for used vehicles. 2020 had a very minimal usage of cars. If you had a 3 year lease thats ending now, in reality you only have 2 years worth of mileage on it, so it’s worth more, and priced accordingly. Also, I have friends whose car leases are coming due, but with so low mileage on the car and an increase in new car prices (plus sometimes unavailability of what you want), they are buying the vehicle. This means fewer lease returns for sale on the lots. Also there was/is a savings in maintenance. I recently had a lot of time related work done on my 17 year old Lexus and the dealer was not very busy and was very willing to haggle over prices.

You’d almost think that abruptly turning off great swaths of the just in time economy in combination with banana republic level money printing had consequences.
I got lunch across the street from the Ford dealership this afternoon. They had three new trucks on the entire lot, two of them were 80 000 dollars and the third a 55000 dollar extended cab. Used is stupid expensive because used is all that’s left.

I’ve never crunched the numbers but there is probably a ratio between different vehicle classes and their new equivalents. My guess is those ratios have all increased by a factor of at least one in part because they track against new car prices. Since I only expect new vehicle prices to increase, these wholesale figure should only increase and even if there is an equilibrium with new car pricing I doubt used wholesale will fall back to the previous ratios. This will be because everyone will be sitting on expensive used inventory and won’t be able to absorb the fall… so they simply won’t be selling them which will perpetuate the used supply shortage.
This is basically what happened later last summer and fall, anyone (dealers) who bought in late May/June/July was really sitting on too highly priced inventory. So what happened? Many didn’t sell and that’s when I first started hearing about dealers not being able to source inventory. This is only going to get worse, the only thing which might pop a hole in this bubble would be for interest rates to rise. I don’t see JPow or Mr. Yellen allowing this to happen. Maybe they could engineer a fail of one of the sub-subprime banks which would spook them and then market rates could rise? Not a silver bullet but could cool the inflation down maybe for a time.
Build back better, comrades! I don’t expect this “chip shortage” to be resolved until the Fall (or perhaps Summer) of 2024. Hopefully the other Biden shortages are a distant memory before then. Oil will be the interesting commodity to see if there is a “shortage” of. I do think if they pull the lever on it, food would follow, and then we’re looking at the scenario many including I feared in early 2020. I really, really hope these psychopaths realize if they go too far it will be not years but decades of recovery.

Guess what? When business interests are at stake, people come up with some pretty impressive solutions to seemingly intractable problems. I give it another 6-12 months max until we see headlines like “What ever happened to the so-called chip shortage?”
And it’s quaint when people blame shortages on Biden, as if global geopolitical and economic trends suddenly change course when a new American president takes office. By your logic, I guess then it’s fair to call it Trump’s virus and blame those 500k deaths on him, right?

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger:
“Lesley Stahl: I’m wondering, if we’re going to continue to have shortages, not just in cars, but in our phones and for our computers, for everything?
Pat Gelsinger: I think we have a couple of years until we catch up to this surging demand across every aspect of the business.”
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-60-minutes-2021-05-02/
“Guess what? When business interests are at stake, people come up with some pretty impressive solutions to seemingly intractable problems. I give it another 6-12 months max until we see headlines like “What ever happened to the so-called chip shortage?””
I said the same thing, and logically in say a 12 month time period it should show signs of progress. So this started in the fall of last year, so Q4 would be approaching a year and maybe we will be saying, “gee, that chip shortage was no big deal”. I’m thinking given who is in power, that won’t be happening but I hope I am wrong.
“And it’s quaint when people blame shortages on Biden, as if global geopolitical and economic trends suddenly change course when a new American president takes office. ”
Really now? So when I had to hear “Trump’s fault” for four years the actors needed to realize global geopolitical and economic trends do not suddenly change course when a new American president takes office? Funny, I don’t recall that occurring. Here’s hoping the Biden shortages will dissipate in a few months, but I must confess I am a tad cynical on that actually occurring.
“I guess then it’s fair to call it Trump’s virus and blame those 500k deaths on him, right?”
Well I would expect as such from the brainwashed masses, despite the fact it originated in the PRC and the PRC *did nothing* to stop the flow of it out of their country. Oh and the true number of direct COVID deaths in 2020 will never be known, so you may as well attribute every death of the year to it because those figures are transitory after all.

How the Used Car Market is Contributing to Inflation
How the Used Car Market is Contributing to Inflation

Apr 27, 2022 · 3 min read
The increasing prices of used cars and trucks are being blamed in part for a soaring inflation rate, according to The Economist. In fact, figures released earlier this year indicate that American consumer-price inflation hit 4.2% year-on-year in April, which is reportedly the highest rate since 2008.
In May, the annual inflation rate rose even higher, to 5%—and as The Economist reports, about one-third of May’s overall month-to-month increase came from the appreciating value of used cars.
What does this mean and why is it happening this year? Let’s take a closer look at the facts and figures.
The increasing prices of used cars
The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures indicate that the prices of used cars and trucks have increased 30% over the past year, but many in the auto industry reportedly believe that’s an underestimate.
In fact, Manheim, the largest used-car auction business in the U.S., suggests in its latest index of second-hand values that prices have actually increased by 48% over the past year, rising by 5% just between April and May.
Pickup trucks have especially increased in sales, rising by 70% in just a year. Many people in the U.S. are reporting they are selling their used cars for a profit.
The Department of Labor also reported that car and truck rentals increased by 87.7% in one year, according to CNBC.
In addition to price increases in used cars and car rentals, other areas that have seen increased prices include public transportation (including airline fares) and hotels.

There are a few factors contributing to increases in used car and car rental prices.
In the summer of 2020, many Americans stayed home during the pandemic. This year, more people are venturing out of their home for the first time in months, so demand for car and rentals is increasing, meaning prices have skyrocketed, according to CNBC.
There has also been a global shortage in auto parts and components that has contributed to price increases and a soar in demand. As the economist points out, drivers have more to spend with stimulus checks from the government, and for those who don’t, car loans are cheaper than before.
Without increases in used cars, new cars, lodging and transportation services, the core consumer price index would only have increased .18% month over month, which is fairly normal, according to CNBC. It just goes to show the impact car sales and rentals are having on the economy.

CNBC also reports that according to Bank of America economists, we may currently be at the peak of used-car prices. The increase in sticker prices for consumers has now gone beyond the jump in wholesale used car prices—which did start to moderate last month.
MarketWatch points out that as the car computer chip shortage eases and car manufacturers boost production, a lot of the recent upward pressure on U.S. inflation will also go away.
But still, the costs of goods and services are on the rise. The high cost of gas, groceries and planes may still be impacting consumers and household budgets through the end of the year.

Across the country, the used car market is surging. The average cost of used cars and trucks jumped 10% during the month of April and 21% from the same month a year before, partly fueling a 4.2% increase in the most recent consumer price index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mark Kugman, the third-generation owner of Kugman Motors, a used car dealership in St. Louis, Missouri, spoke with “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal about what’s driving that inflation and what it means for his dealership. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.
Kai Ryssdal: I’m going to cut right to the chase here, Mr. Kugman: What is going on with used cars in this economy?
Mark Kugman: Well, I have two answers — one is simple, one is a little more complicated. Cars are scarce, so prices are up.
Ryssdal: OK, I’ll go with that, supply and demand works. That’s good. What’s the longer version?

Kugman: Well, the longer version is that production is slashed on new cars. Used car dealers rely on the new car market to drive our sales. We need the inventory. I can’t call a factory and ask them to send me additional used cars. We have to buy them at auction or trade-ins, and right now there’s very little inventory in the new car market.
Ryssdal: So how are you sourcing your inventory? What are you doing?
Kugman: Well, we are looking out of the box, so to speak, so virtual auctions. I’m going a little bit outside of my comfort zone, having to look [cars] over virtually, and we are paying higher prices for quality vehicles. And in addition to that, we’re paying for shipping, for logistics. … So we’re getting squeezed.

Why do oil companies call themselves “energy” companies?
Ryssdal: Yeah, I imagine. But look, you have to be passing these costs on to your customers. It’s not like I can walk onto the Kugman Motors lot and get a deal right now, right? You’re having to pass it on?
Kugman: Well, we’re trying to do as little of that as possible, because we do want to be competitive. The market, the way it is now, anybody can go online and see what these vehicles should be selling for. The problem is there’s a lag between what’s really going on in the marketplace and what Kelley Blue Book or Black Book thinks the car should sell for.
Ryssdal: So you know, this is all rooted in semiconductors and all of those supply chain stories that we’ve been hearing, and all indications are that those problems are not going to be fixed, say, tomorrow. So the question is, how much longer can these prices keep going before something stops working?
Kugman: Well it’s going to impact sales, if it hasn’t already. Actually, our sales, interestingly, are up. It’s been an unusual period of high demand, and if you need a car, you need a car. St. Louis is a fantastic city, but our mass transit isn’t all that hot, particularly if you’re a shift worker getting off of job at a hospital or something at 2 in the morning. And the demand is really high, I think, due to the stimulus.
Ryssdal: Say more about that stimulus. People have money in their pockets, and they’re buying cars with it at least in part?
Kugman: Yeah, somebody who needs a car and all of a sudden you’ve got $5,000, and you’ve been putting it off, this is the time to look at cars. I’ve heard some of my competitors say, “I’m not gonna buy anything until the price has come down,” and that’s nonsense. We want to be there for our customers. Instead of raising prices, we’re trying to sell more aftermarket, possibly extended warranties, gap insurance, to try and make up some of that, but this too shall end. I’ve been through a lot of these things. I’ve been doing it for 48 years.
Ryssdal: Well, I was just gonna say, you’ve been around this business for a while. Have you ever seen anything like this?
Kugman: I’ve seen much worse, when interest rates were 21% and nobody was buying anything. So at least we have demand. It seems like the economy is fairly strong. It’s changed. It’s not the economy that it was 20 years ago when people worked in factories and all that, but people do have jobs and they still have needs.

Why Are Used Cars So Expensive?
By
Alex Bernstein
, Managing Editor -July 19, 2021
Used car prices are expensive in 2021 largely because of a shortage of new cars. Although used car auctions shut down a year ago due to the pandemic, strong demand has fueled extreme price increases on preowned cars & trucks.
According to shopping site Edmunds, the average transaction price for used cars reached $25,410 in the second quarter of 2021 (up from $20,942 just a year ago). In some cases, used car prices may actually exceed the MSRPs of new cars.
For example, iSeeCars says the average used price of a Kia Telluride is approximately 8% higher than a new one. The website recently reported that the average used Telluride costs $47,730, $3,564 more than a comparable new SUV.
As we noted this spring, high used car values may make it a great time to sell your car. However, just because you can get top-dollar for your car may not mean much since new car rebates are down because of a global chip shortage.
If you're looking for a deal on a used car, consider a less-popular model. For example, we already know that used Toyota Tacoma pickup prices remain especially high. The situation may not be as dire on a truck model like the Ford Ranger.
It's also worth noting that factory-certified pre-owned cars sometimes qualify for incentives. For example, Toyota's used car interest rates are actually lower than those of its new cars, with deals like 1.99% APR on CPO RAV4 models.
Your priorities may dictate your ability to delay a purchase. Cox Automotive says wholesale prices (what dealers pay at auction) are on the decline, but how soon this translates to retail prices (the prices advertised) is an open question.
Limited supply may take away some of your negotiating power on a used car. There could still be deals, but they may be harder to find and require consumers to really do their homework and pounce if an opportunity to save presents itself.

Alright, I have these five documents from my search on why used car prices have increased. Let me see what each one is saying.

The first one is from MSN Autos, dated May 12, 2021. It's titled "Why are used cars so expensive right now?" It mentions that used car prices surged 21% since April 2020, with a 10% increase in April 2021 alone, according to the Consumer Price Index. The article suggests that the used car market is tied to the new car market, and that a shortage of new cars due to the pandemic and semiconductor chip shortages has led to higher used car prices. It also notes that certain types of buyers are seeking larger, more expensive new cars, which might be affecting the used car market.

The second document is from TheTruthAboutCars.com, dated June 7, 2021. It reports that used car prices have increased by about 30%, with pickup trucks seeing the largest increases at 44.21%. The article attributes this to suppressed demand and prolonged restrictions affecting supply chains, compounded by the semiconductor chip shortage impacting new car production. It also mentions that electric vehicles and minivans have seen increases in used market values.

The third document is from GetJerry.com, dated April 27, 2022. It discusses how used car market contributions are affecting inflation, with used car and truck prices increasing by 30% over the past year, although some in the industry believe this is an underestimate. The article cites a higher increase of 48% according to Manheim, the largest used-car auction business in the U.S. It attributes the price increases to a combination of increased demand as people venture out more post-pandemic and a global shortage of auto parts and components.

The fourth document is from Marketplace, dated June 4, 2021. It features an interview with Mark Kugman, a third-generation owner of a used car dealership in St. Louis. Kugman explains that the used car market is experiencing high prices due to a scarcity of cars, driven by slashed production in the new car market. He mentions that used car dealers rely on the new car market for inventory, and with less new car production, there are fewer used cars available. He also notes that the stimulus payments have increased demand for used cars.

The fifth document is from CarsDirect.com, dated July 19, 2021. It discusses why used cars are so expensive, again pointing to the shortage of new cars due to the pandemic and semiconductor chip shortages. It mentions that used car auctions shut down a year ago due to the pandemic, and the strong demand has led to extreme price increases on pre-owned cars and trucks. The article suggests that now might be a good time to sell a used car due to high values but acknowledges that new car rebates are down, which might limit the benefit for those looking to upgrade.

From these articles, several key points emerge:

1. **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The semiconductor chip shortage is a major factor affecting new car production, leading to fewer new cars available on the market.

2. **Tied to New Car Market:** The used car market is closely linked to the new car market. With fewer new cars being produced and sold, there are fewer trade-ins and lease returns entering the used car market, reducing supply.

3. **Increased Demand:** There is higher demand for used cars, possibly due to people wanting to avoid public transportation during the pandemic, stimulus payments increasing purchasing power, and a general desire for personal mobility.

4. **Higher Prices Across Segments:** While pickups and larger vehicles have seen significant price increases, other segments like electric vehicles and minivans have also experienced price hikes in the used market.

5. **Auction Prices Reflecting Market Trends:** Wholesale used car prices have increased significantly, as indicated by auction data from companies like Manheim.

Given this information, it seems that the root cause of the used car price increase is a combination of reduced supply due to new car production issues and increased demand from consumers. This supply-demand imbalance is driving up prices in the used car market.

I should consider whether there are any other factors at play. For example, are there any policies or regulations that might be affecting used car prices? Also, how long is this situation expected to last? The articles mention that the chip shortage is ongoing but suggest that it may ease in the future, which could lead to a normalization of used car prices.

Perhaps I should look for more recent data to see if the situation has improved or worsened since these articles were published. Additionally, it might be useful to check if there are any regional variations in used car prices.

Let me think about how this affects consumers. For those looking to sell their used cars, it's a good time as they can get higher prices. However, for those looking to buy, it's more challenging due to higher prices and limited availability.

It's also interesting to note that even electric vehicles are seeing price increases in the used market, which contradicts the general perception that EVs depreciate quickly. This might be due to the overall shortage of used cars and higher demand for EVs.

I should also consider the impact on the economy overall. Higher used car prices are contributing to inflation, as mentioned in the GetJerry.com article. This is a broader economic issue that could have implications beyond just the automotive sector.

In conclusion, used car prices have increased significantly due to a combination of factors including supply chain disruptions, reduced new car production, and increased demand from consumers. This situation is expected to persist as long as the underlying issues, particularly the semiconductor chip shortage, remain unresolved.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Used car prices have increased due to a combination of factors including supply chain disruptions, reduced new car production, and increased demand from consumers.}} \]
