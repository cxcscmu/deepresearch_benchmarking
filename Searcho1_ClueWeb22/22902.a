Alright, so I need to figure out how humans contribute to climate change. I know that climate change is a big topic, and there are a lot of factors involved, but I need to focus on the human aspects. I think starting with some basic understanding would be good. Maybe I should look up what climate change is first.

Wait, no, I know that climate change refers to long-term changes in global or regional climate patterns, especially changes that disrupt typical patterns. It's mainly attributed to human activities that increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures and other environmental impacts.

So, the key here is identifying those human activities that lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, among others. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, which is essential for life on Earth, but when their concentrations increase, they trap more heat, leading to global warming.

Let me think about where these gases come from in terms of human activities.

First, burning fossil fuels is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, which are used extensively in发电、交通运输、工业生产等。随着全球工业化和现代化的推进，对能源的需求急剧增加，导致化石燃料的使用量大幅上升，从而释放了大量的二氧化碳。

其次，农业活动也是温室气体排放的重要来源。畜牧业特别是牛的养殖会产生大量的甲烷，因为牛在消化过程中会排放甲烷。此外，稻田的管理、化肥的使用以及农田的排水等也会释放甲烷和氧化亚氮，这两种气体的温室效应都比二氧化碳强。

再者，森林砍伐也是一个重要的人为因素。树木通过光合作用吸收二氧化碳，释放氧气，因此森林被称为“地球之肺”。然而，大规模的森林砍伐不仅减少了二氧化碳的吸收，还因为树木被砍倒后腐烂或燃烧，会释放出之前吸收的二氧化碳，从而加剧了温室效应。

还有其他的一些人类活动，比如废物处理和垃圾填埋，也会产生甲烷；工业过程中的某些化学反应会释放氟利昂等强效温室气体；以及城市化进程中的土地利用变化，影响了地表反射率和热量吸收等。

我觉得应该把这些主要的人为因素整理一下，确保没有遗漏重要的方面。

首先，能源生产和使用：

- 燃烧煤炭、石油和天然气用于发电、供热和交通。

- 工业过程中的能源消耗，如冶炼、化工生产等。

其次，农业和土地利用：

- 畜牧业，尤其是反刍动物的消化过程。

- 农田管理，包括水稻种植和化肥使用。

- 森林砍伐和土地转化，如将森林变为农田或牧场。

然后，废物管理和工业过程：

- 垃圾填埋场产生的甲烷。

- 工业过程中释放的温室气体，如水泥生产中的二氧化碳排放。

- 制冷和空调设备中使用的氢氟碳化物等。

最后，也许还有建筑和交通领域的贡献，虽然这些可能已经包含在上述类别中。

我需要确认一下，是否还有其他显著的人为因素导致气候变暖。可能还有航空和航海的排放，这些属于交通运输的一部分，但它们有特殊的排放方式和气体，比如飞机排放的高空水蒸气可以形成凝结尾迹，影响气候。

另外，土地覆盖的变化，比如城市热岛效应，虽然局部，但可能在更大范围内也有影响。

不过，总的来说，最主要的还是能源使用、农业活动和森林砍伐等方面。

也许我可以看看一些数据，看看各个部门的温室气体排放占比，这样会更清楚哪些是主要的贡献者。

我需要查找一些可靠的资料来获取这些数据。可能可以参考国际能源署（IEA）、政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）或者联合国环境规划署（UNEP）的报告。

让我试着搜索一下相关的信息。

Humans have caused almost 100% of global warming, says new IPCC report
Climate science has evolved since the last IPCC report released in 2013, and scientists are now confident that human influence has caused climate change as we know it
NEXT NEWS ❯
By Avantika Goswami
Published: Tuesday 10 August 2021
The new climate science report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released August 9, 2021 differs from its predecessor on one main account: Scientists are now more confident that human activity has caused climate change than they have been before.
The report, the first instalment of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), has a simple message:
“It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change, making extreme climate events including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts more frequent and severe.”
There is almost no doubt that most of the observed warming of the planet since the late-1800s is caused by humans.
The report’s technical summary highlights how this confidence has increased with each successive IPCC report: “The evidence for human influence on recent climate change has strengthened progressively from the IPCC second assessment report [in 1995] to the AR5 [in 2013-14] and is even stronger in this assessment, including for regional scales and for extremes.”
This has been possible through advances in climate science and improvements in models and analytical tools. The report outlines some of these advances, saying:
“Progress in our understanding of human influence is gained from longer observational datasets, improved palaeo-climate information, stronger warming signal since AR5 (the fifth assessment report) and improvements in climate models, physical understanding and attribution techniques. Since AR5, the attribution to human influence has become possible across a wider range of climate variables and climatic impact-drivers. New techniques and analyses drawing on several lines of evidence have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in regional weather and climate extremes to human influence (high confidence).”
Human activities have warmed the planet at a rate never seen before in the planet’s long history in the past 2,000 years in particular. The IPCC report found that Earth’s global surface temperature warmed by 1.09 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900.
While natural changes to the Earth’s climate do occur, 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities. Thus, almost 100 per cent of global warming has been caused by humans.
Human influence is the main driver of hot weather extremes (which have become more frequent and intense since 1950s), and without which these extremes would have been unlikely. The AR6 is virtually certain that human-driven emissions are the main driver of the changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale, and of ocean warming and acidification.
Additionally, the AR6 acknowledges the ability of scientists to now pinpoint how much worse an extreme weather event was made by climate change.
Previously, they could not link a specific event to warmer temperatures caused by human activity. But this is no longer a challenge, as weather attribution studies can now be rapidly produced, as was done by the World Weather Attribution initiative for the North American heatwave in July 2021. It had concluded that the heatwave would be “virtually impossible” without human-driven climate change.

New U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet
News | September 27, 2013
New U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change
A 'Blue Marble' image of the Earth taken from the VIIRS instrument aboard NASA's most recently launched Earth-observing satellite - Suomi NPP.
A United Nations panel has released the first part of its much-anticipated six-year update on the state of climate change. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says there is 95 percent certainty that humans have caused most of the warming of the planet's surface that has occurred since the 1950s — up from 90 percent certainty in the last assessment report, which came out in 2007.
The report draws from many independent scientific analyses of climate change, which use direct observations of Earth’s climate, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models.
Other key findings include:
Today carbon dioxide is at an "unprecedented" level not seen for at least the last 800,000 years.
Sea level is set to continue to rise at a faster rate than over the past 40 years. Waters are expected to rise by between 26 cm (10 inches) at the low end and 82 cm (30 inches) at the high end.
There is "high confidence" that over the last two decades the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been melting, glaciers have receded in most parts of the world, and Arctic sea ice has continued to shrink in terms of extent.
Many of the changes seen in our climate since the 1950s are "unprecedented over decades to millennia."
The IPCC issued its "Summary for Policymakers" as part of the "Physical Science Basis of Climate Change" section of the report in Stockholm on Friday, and will release the full text of that section on Monday, Sept. 30, on the IPCC website (http://www.ipcc.ch/ ). Additional sections will be released in the coming months, providing a comprehensive summary of the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change.
More than 25 NASA scientists helped author and review the Fifth Assessment Report. The report is the work of a total of 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries, and over 600 contributing authors from 32 countries.

How do Human Activities Contribute to Climate Change  and How do They Compare with Natural Influences?
Submitted by Michael Rastall | published 7th Nov 2012 | last updated 16th Aug 2021
Please note that this material is from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2007. The latest climate science can be found in the IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report , published in August 2021. For other reports and further updates, please refer to the IPCC website.
This material is extracted from the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Working Group 1 (see full reference below).
Human activities contribute to climate change by causing changes in Earth’s atmosphere in the amounts of greenhouse gases, aerosols (small particles), and cloudiness. The largest known contribution comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases and aerosols affect climate by altering incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared (thermal) radiation that are part of Earth’s energy balance. Changing the atmospheric abundance or properties of these gases and particles can lead to a warming or cooling of the climate system. Since the start of the industrial era (about 1750), the overall effect of human activities on climate has been a warming influence. The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.
FAQ 2.1, Figure 1. Atmospheric concentrations of important long-lived greenhouse gases over the last 2,000 years. Increases since about 1750 are attributed to human activities in the industrial era. Concentration units are parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb), indicating the number of molecules of the greenhouse gas per million or billion air molecules, respectively, in an atmospheric sample.
FAQ 2.1, Figure 2. Summary of the principal components of the radiative forcing of climate change. All these radiative forcings result from one or more factors that affect climate and are associated with human activities or natural processes as discussed in the text. The values represent the forcings in 2005 relative to the start of the industrial era (about 1750). Human activities cause significant changes in long-lived gases, ozone, water vapour, surface albedo, aerosols and contrails. The only increase in natural forcing of any significance between 1750 and 2005 occurred in solar irradiance. Positive forcings lead to warming of climate and negative forcings lead to a cooling. The thin black line attached to each coloured bar represents the range of uncertainty for the respective value.

The new IPCC climate report is hugely important — and here are 6 main takeaways

Earth has warmed 1.09℃ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The report also found that escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth and every facet of the weather.
The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November.
The IPCC is the climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization, and it is the global authority on the state of Earth’s climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment.
Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today — but there is still time to avert the worst damage if humanity chooses to. Here are six takeaways from the report:
1. It’s unequivocal: Humans are warming the planet
For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally — leaving absolutely no room for doubt — humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans.
The IPCC finds Earth’s global surface temperature warmed 1.09℃ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29℃ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1℃ of the increase is due to data improvements.)
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years.
The IPCC recognizes the role of natural changes to the Earth’s climate. However, it finds 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities.
In other words, pretty much all global warming is due to humans.
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years, with the warming also reaching ocean depths below 2,000 meters.
The IPCC says human activities have also affected global precipitation (rain and snow). Since 1950, total global precipitation has increased, but while some regions have become wetter, others have become drier.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over most land areas. This is because the warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture — about seven percent more for each additional degree of temperature — which makes wet seasons and rainfall events wetter.
2. CO2 levels are rising faster than ever
Present-day global concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are higher and rising faster than at any time in at least the past two million years.
The speed at which atmospheric CO2 has increased since the industrial revolution (1750) is at least 10 times faster than at any other time during the last 800,000 years and between 4 and 5 times faster than during the last 56 million years.
About 85% of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels.
About 85 percent of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels. The remaining 15 percent are generated from land-use change, such as deforestation and degradation.
Concentrations of other greenhouse gases are not doing any better. Both methane and nitrous oxide, the second- and third- biggest contributors to global warming after CO2, have also increased more quickly. Methane emissions from human activities largely come from livestock and the fossil fuel industry. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the use of nitrogen fertilizer on crops.
3. Extreme weather is on the rise
Hot extremes, heatwaves and heavy rain have also become more frequent and intense across most land regions since 1950, the IPCC confirms.
The report highlights that some recently observed hot extremes, such as the Australian summer of 2012–2013, would have been extremely unlikely without human influence on the climate.
Human influence has also been detected for the first time in compounded extreme events. For example, incidences of heatwaves, droughts and fire weather happening at the same time are now more frequent. These compound events have been seen in Australia, Southern Europe, Northern Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and African tropical forests.
Even if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia.
4. Our oceans are getting hotter, higher and more acidic
Oceans absorb 91 percent of the energy from the increased atmospheric greenhouse gases. This has led to ocean warming and more marine heatwaves, particularly over the past 15 years.
Marine heatwaves cause the mass death of marine life, such as from coral bleaching events. They also cause algal blooms and shifts in the composition of species. Even if the world restricts warming to 1.5-2℃, as is consistent with the Paris Agreement, marine heatwaves will become four times more frequent by the end of the century.
Melting ice sheets and glaciers, along with the expansion of the ocean as it warms, have led to a global mean sea level increase of 0.2 meters between 1901 and 2018. But, importantly, the speed that the sea level is rising is accelerating: 1.3 millimeters per year during 1901-1971, 1.9mm per year during 1971-2006, and 3.7mm per year during 2006-2018.
Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of CO2, has occurred in the overall oceans and is reaching depths beyond 2,000 meters in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic.
5. Many changes are already irreversible
The IPCC says if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia. For example, global warming of 2℃ this century will lead to an average global sea-level rise of between two and six meters over 2,000 years — and much more for higher emission scenarios.
Globally, glaciers have been synchronously retreating since 1950 and are projected to continue to melt for decades after the global temperature is stabilized. Meanwhile, the acidification of the deep ocean will remain for thousands of years after CO2 emissions cease.
Global warming stays below 2°C during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The report does not identify any possible abrupt changes that would lead to an acceleration of global warming during this century — but does not rule out such possibilities.
The prospect of permafrost (frozen soils) in Alaska, Canada, and Russia crossing a tipping point has been widely discussed. The concern is that as frozen ground thaws, large amounts of carbon accumulated over thousands of years from dead plants and animals could be released as they decompose.
The report does not identify any globally significant abrupt change in these regions over this century, based on currently available evidence. However, it projects permafrost areas will release about 66 billion metric tonnes of CO2 for each additional degree of warming, and these emissions are irreversible during this century under all warming scenarios.
6. But we can still act and prevent the worst-case scenario
Earth’s surface temperature will continue to increase until at least 2050 under all emissions scenarios considered in the report. The assessment shows Earth could well exceed the 1.5℃ warming limit by the early 2030s.
If we reduce emissions sufficiently, there is only a 50 percent chance global temperature rise will stay around 1.5℃ (including a temporary overshoot of up to 0.1℃). To get Earth back to below 1.5℃ warming, CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere using negative emissions technologies or nature-based solutions.
Global warming stays below 2℃ during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2°C  … Humanity, however, must choose to act.
The IPCC analyzed future climate projections from dozens of climate models, produced by more than 50 modeling centers around the world. It showed global average surface temperature rises between 1-1.8℃ and 3.3-5.7℃ this century above pre-industrial levels for the lowest and highest emission scenarios, respectively. The exact increase the world experiences will depend on how much more greenhouse gases are emitted.
The report states, with high certainty, that to stabilize the climate, CO2 emissions must reach net zero, and other greenhouse gas emissions must decline significantly.
We also know, for a given temperature target, there’s a finite amount of carbon that we can emit before reaching net-zero emissions. To have a 50:50 chance of halting warming at around 1.5℃, this quantity is about 500 billion metric tonnes of CO2.
At current levels of CO2 emissions this “carbon budget” would be used up within 12 years. Exhausting the budget will take longer if emissions begin to decline.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2℃ and limit it to around 1.5℃, the globally agreed goals of the Paris Agreement. Humanity, however, must choose to act.

Global warming: why is IPCC report so certain about the influence of humans?

The fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. Many media outlets have reported that this is an increase from the 90 percent certainty in the fourth IPCC report, but actually the change is much more significant than that. In fact, if you look closely, the IPCC says that humans have most likely caused all of the global warming over the past 60 years.
Spot the Differences
Here is the relevant statement from the fourth IPCC report in 2007:
"Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely [90 percent confidence] due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations
Now here is the statement from the fifth IPCC report:
"It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together."
Did you spot the differences? The 2007 IPCC statement focused on human greenhouse gas emissions, while the 2013 statement pertains to all human influences on the climate. This includes the cooling effect from human aerosol emissions (pollutants that scatter sunlight).
Cooling from human aerosol emissions offsets about one-third of the warming from human greenhouse gas emissions. The new IPCC statement says that even taking that aerosol cooling effect into account, humans are still the main cause of the global warming over the past 60 years.
Current Global Warming Caused by Greenhouse Gases, Not Nature
The IPCC elaborates further. What's causing global warming: human greenhouse gas emissions.
"The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period ... The observed warming since 1951 can be attributed to the different natural and anthropogenic drivers and their contributions can now be quantified. Greenhouse gases contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3 °C over the period 1951−2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, likely to be in the range of −0.6°C to 0.1°C."
What's not causing global warming: natural external factors like solar activity, and natural internal factors like ocean cycles.
"The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C."
We've observed about 0.6°C average global surface warming over the past 60 years. During that time, the IPCC best estimate is that greenhouse gases have caused about 0.9°C warming, which was partially offset by about 0.3°C cooling from human aerosol emissions. During that time, natural external factors had no net influence on global temperatures. For example, solar activity has been flat since 1950.

Annual Total Solar Irradiance (TSI; thin light blue) with 11 year moving average of TSI (thick dark blue). TSI from 1880 to 1978 from Krivova et al (2007). TSI from 1979 to 2009 from PMOD.
As for the natural internal variability of the Earth's climate system, short-term noise averages out to zero over long time frames. Warm and cool ocean cycles cancel each other out, and thus internal variability has no long-term influence on average global temperatures.
Put it all together, and the IPCC is 95 percent confident that humans have caused most of the observed global surface warming over the past 60 years. Their best estimate is that humans have caused 100 percent of that global warming.
IPCC is Summarizing the Scientific Research
The IPCC does not conduct any original research; it's a summary report, and these statements accurately reflect the body of climate science research. For example, last year climate scientists Tom Wigley and Ben Santer published a paper concluding that human climate influences were responsible for 50 to 150 percent of the observed warming from 1950 to 2005.
Like this new IPCC statement, they found with 95 percent confidence that humans have caused at least half the observed warming since 1950, and most likely all of it. It's also possible that humans have caused more warming than has been observed because natural factors may have had a net cooling effect. The Wigley and Santer results are consistent with the body of scientific research on the causes of global warming.
Net human and natural percent contributions to the observed global surface warming over the past 50-65 years according to Tett et al. 2000 (T00, dark blue), Meehl et al. 2004 (M04, red), Stone et al. 2007 (S07, light green), Lean and Rind 2008 (LR08, purple), Huber and Knutti 2011 (HK11, light blue), Gillett et al. 2012 (G12, orange), Wigley and Santer 2012 (WS12, dark green), and Jones et al. 2013 (J12, pink).
The 'fingerprints' of climate change are also all consistent with what we expect to see as a result of human-caused global warming, for example changes in the atmosphere, as another paper by Ben Santer recently concluded.
Summary of observational evidence that human carbon dioxide emissions are causing the climate to warm.
What About the Naysayers?
A few naysayers like Judith Curry from Georgia Tech have disputed the IPCC confidence on this question, for example in an interview with the reliably inaccurate David Rose.
However, while Curry is a climate scientist, she doesn't research the causes of global warming. She also has a history of exaggerating climate uncertainties. Her comments are inconsistent with the body of scientific research on the subject. Put simply, she is speaking outside her area of expertise, like a podiatrist giving advice on open heart surgery.
The 97 Percent Consensus is Evidence-Based
This is why there's a 97 percent consensu s amongst climate experts and in the climate science literature that humans are causing global warming. The scientific evidence on this question is overwhelming.
Many commenters have noted that the expert consensus is itself not scientific evidence for human-caused global warming. That's true. The expert consensus is however based on the scientific evidence. The fact that 97 percent of climate experts agree on this subject also demonstrates the strength of the scientific evidence on human-caused global warming. And the strength of the evidence is why the IPCC is able to say with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming.

Alright, so from the search results, it's clear that humans are the main cause of the current global warming, and the IPCC is now 95% confident about that. In fact, the latest report says that humans have caused almost 100% of the global warming over the past 60 years. That's a really strong statement.

Let me try to understand this better. So, earlier reports had a lower confidence level, like 90%, but now it's 95%. But according to one of the articles, the change is more significant than just that small increase in percentage. It seems like the way they're framing it has changed.

In the fourth IPCC report in 2007, they said that most of the observed increase in global temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely (90% confidence) due to human greenhouse gas emissions. But in the latest report, they're talking about all human influences, including both warming from greenhouse gases and cooling from aerosols, and still attributing more than half of the warming to humans with 95% confidence.

Wait, actually, digging deeper, it says that humans have likely caused all of the warming over the past 60 years. That's pretty striking. So, even when accounting for the cooling effect of aerosols, which offset some of the warming from greenhouse gases, the net effect is still that humans are responsible for the observed warming.

Let me see if I can find more details on this. According to one of the documents, the best estimate is that greenhouse gases have caused about 0.9°C warming, while aerosols have caused about 0.3°C cooling, resulting in a net human-caused warming of about 0.6°C, which matches the observed warming.

That makes sense. So, the human influence includes both warming and cooling effects, but overall, it's a warming effect, and that aligns with the observed warming.

Now, what about natural factors? The report says that natural external forcings, like changes in solar activity, have had negligible influence on global temperatures over the past 60 years. That makes sense because solar activity hasn't increased much since the 1950s.

Also, internal variability, like ocean cycles, averages out over long time periods, so they don't cause a long-term trend in temperatures.

So, putting it all together, the IPCC is saying that humans are the main, and most likely the only, cause of the global warming observed over the past 60 years.

But, I should consider if there are any dissenting views on this. One of the articles mentions that some skeptics, like Judith Curry, disagree with this level of confidence. However, the article points out that her views are not supported by the body of scientific research on this topic.

Moreover, there's a broad consensus among climate scientists that humans are causing global warming. The 97% consensus is often cited, meaning that 97% of climate experts agree that humans are the main cause of recent global warming.

So, overall, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that humans are responsible for the current global warming.

Now, to understand how humans are contributing to climate change, I need to look into the specific activities that lead to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-forcing factors.

Firstly, burning fossil fuels is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. When we burn coal, oil, and gas for electricity, transportation, and industrial processes, we release CO2 into the atmosphere. CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat and leads to warming.

According to the IPCC, CO2 is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Its concentration in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.

Secondly, agriculture is another significant source of greenhouse gases. Livestock, especially cattle, produce methane during digestion, and rice paddies also emit methane. Additionally, the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, which is another powerful greenhouse gas.

Deforestation is also a key factor. Trees absorb CO2 as they grow, so when forests are cut down and burned or left to rot, that CO2 is released back into the atmosphere. Plus, fewer trees mean less absorption of CO2 in the future.

Industrial processes contribute as well. For example, the production of cement releases CO2, and some industrial chemicals, like hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases.

Lastly, waste management and landfill sites produce methane as organic waste decomposes.

So, these are the main ways humans are affecting the climate: through burning fossil fuels, agricultural practices, deforestation, industrial activities, and waste management.

Now, I should probably look into the relative contributions of these different sources to get a better picture.

I recall that energy production and consumption are the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, followed by agriculture, then forestry and other land use, and then industry.

Let me see if I can find some specific numbers.

Looking back at the search results, one of the documents mentions that about 85% of CO2 emissions come from fossil fuel combustion and industry, while 15% come from land use change, like deforestation.

Methane emissions are primarily from agriculture, including livestock and rice paddies, as well as from fossil fuel extraction and transport.

Nitrous oxide comes mostly from agricultural soil management and industrial activities.

So, it seems that energy and agriculture are the two biggest sectors contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, the way we manage land, through deforestation and other practices, also plays a significant role.

I should also consider the role of aerosols mentioned in the IPCC report. Aerosols are tiny particles in the atmosphere that can have both cooling and warming effects, depending on their type and location.

For example, sulfur aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, having a cooling effect, while black carbon absorbs sunlight, having a warming effect.

Human activities emit both types of aerosols. Burning fossil fuels and biomass can release sulfur aerosols and black carbon.

So, overall, human activities are increasing both greenhouse gases, which warm the planet, and aerosols, which have both warming and cooling effects, but the net effect is still warming.

Now, to get a clearer picture, perhaps I can look for data on the contributions of different sectors to total greenhouse gas emissions.

Maybe I can search for something like "greenhouse gas emissions by sector" or "IPCC emissions breakdown."

Let me try that.

Emissions by sector
Power generation 1 and transport together accounted for over two thirds of total emissions in 2019 and have been responsible for almost all global growth since 2010. The remaining third was mainly associated with the industry and buildings sectors.
After allocating electricity and heat emissions to final sectors, industry continued to be the largest emitting sector, with over 40% of global emissions in 2019. Emissions in the transport sector increased to account for 27% of the global emissions in 2019, while buildings related emissions slightly decreased to represent 25% of global emissions in 2019.

Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, at a time when they need to be rapidly falling.
To effectively reduce emissions we need to know where they are coming from – which sectors contribute the most? How can we use this understanding to develop effective solutions and mitigation strategies?
Below we look at the breakdown of emissions – total greenhouse gases, plus carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide individually – by sector.
Sector by sector: where do global greenhouse gas emissions come from?
In this section
Energy (electricity, heat and transport): 73.2%
Direct Industrial Processes: 5.2%
Waste: 3.2%
Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use: 18.4%
To prevent severe climate change we need to rapidly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The world emits around 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases each year [measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 eq)].1
To figure out how we can most effectively reduce emissions and what emissions can and can’t be eliminated with current technologies, we need to first understand where our emissions come from.
In this post I present only one chart, but it is an important one – it shows the breakdown of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. 2 This is the latest breakdown of global emissions by sector, published by Climate Watch and the World Resources Institute. 3,4
The overall picture you see from this diagram is that almost three-quarters of emissions come from energy use; almost one-fifth from agriculture and land use [this increases to one-quarter when we consider the food system as a whole – including processing, packaging, transport and retail]; and the remaining 8% from industry and waste.
To know what’s included in each sector category, I provide a short description of each. These descriptions are based on explanations provided in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report AR5) and a methodology paper published by the World Resources Institute.5,6
Emissions come from many sectors: we need many solutions to decarbonize the economy
It is clear from this breakdown that a range of sectors and processes contribute to global emissions. This means there is no single or simple solution to tackle climate change. Focusing on electricity, or transport, or food, or deforestation alone is insufficient.
Even within the energy sector – which accounts for almost three-quarters of emissions – there is no simple fix. Even if we could fully decarbonize our electricity supply, we would also need to electrify all of our heating and road transport. And we’d still have emissions from shipping and aviation –  which we do not yet have low-carbon technologies for – to deal with.
To reach net-zero emissions we need innovations across many sectors. Single solutions will not get us there.
Let’s walk through each of the sectors and sub-sectors in the pie chart, one-by-one.
Energy (electricity, heat and transport): 73.2%
Energy use in industry: 24.2%
Iron and Steel (7.2%): energy-related emissions from the manufacturing of iron and steel.
Chemical & petrochemical (3.6%): energy-related emissions from the manufacturing of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, refrigerants, oil and gas extraction, etc.
Food and tobacco (1%): energy-related emissions from the manufacturing of tobacco products and food processing (the conversion of raw agricultural products into their final products, such as the conversion of wheat into bread).
Non-ferrous metals: 0.7%: Non-ferrous metals are metals which contain very little iron: this includes aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, titanium and zinc, and alloys such as brass. The manufacturing of these metals requires energy which results in emissions.
Paper & pulp (0.6%): energy-related emissions from the conversion of wood into paper and pulp.
Machinery (0.5%): energy-related emissions from the production of machinery.
Other industry (10.6%): energy-related emissions from manufacturing in other industries including mining and quarrying, construction, textiles, wood products, and transport equipment (such as car manufacturing).
Transport: 16.2%
This includes a small amount of electricity (indirect emissions) as well as all direct emissions from burning fossil fuels to power transport activities. These figures do not include emissions from the manufacturing of motor vehicles or other transport equipment – this is included in the previous point ‘Energy use in Industry’.
Road transport (11.9%): emissions from the burning of petrol and diesel from all forms of road transport which includes cars, trucks, lorries, motorcycles and buses. Sixty percent of road transport emissions come from passenger travel (cars, motorcycles and buses); and the remaining forty percent from road freight (lorries and trucks). This means that, if we could electrify the whole road transport sector, and transition to a fully decarbonized electricity mix, we could feasibly reduce global emissions by 11.9%.
Aviation (1.9%): emissions from passenger travel and freight, and domestic and international aviation. 81% of aviation emissions come from passenger travel; and 19% from freight. 7 From passenger aviation, 60% of emissions come from international travel, and 40% from domestic.
Shipping (1.7%): emissions from the burning of petrol or diesel on boats. This includes both passenger and freight maritime trips.
Rail (0.4%): emissions from passenger and freight rail travel.
Pipeline (0.3%): fuels and commodities (e.g. oil, gas, water or steam) often need to be transported (either within or between countries) via pipelines. This requires energy inputs, which results in emissions. Poorly constructed pipelines can also leak, leading to direct emissions of methane to the atmosphere – however, this aspect is captured in the category ‘Fugitive emissions from energy production’.
Energy use in buildings: 17.5%
Residential buildings (10.9%): energy-related emissions from the generation of electricity for lighting, appliances, cooking etc. and heating at home.
Commercial buildings (6.6%): energy-related emissions from the generation of electricity for lighting, appliances, etc. and heating in commercial buildings such as offices, restaurants, and shops.
Unallocated fuel combustion (7.8%)
Energy-related emissions from the production of energy from other fuels including electricity and heat from biomass; on-site heat sources; combined heat and power (CHP); nuclear industry; and pumped hydroelectric storage.
Fugitive emissions from energy production: 5.8%
Fugitive emissions from oil and gas (3.9%): fugitive emissions are the often-accidental leakage of methane to the atmosphere during oil and gas extraction and transportation, from damaged or poorly maintained pipes. This also includes flaring – the intentional burning of gas at oil facilities. Oil wells can release gases, including methane, during extraction – producers often don’t have an existing network of pipelines to transport it, or it wouldn’t make economic sense to provide the infrastructure needed to effectively capture and transport it. But under environmental regulations they need to deal with it somehow: intentionally burning it is often a cheap way to do so.
Fugitive emissions from coal (1.9%): fugitive emissions are the accidental leakage of methane during coal mining.
Energy use in agriculture and fishing (1.7%)
Energy-related emissions from the use of machinery in agriculture and fishing, such as fuel for farm machinery and fishing vessels.
Direct Industrial Processes: 5.2%
Cement (3%): carbon dioxide is produced as a byproduct of a chemical conversion process used in the production of clinker, a component of cement. In this reaction, limestone (CaCO 3) is converted to lime (CaO), and produces CO 2 as a byproduct. Cement production also produces emissions from energy inputs – these related emissions are included in ‘Energy Use in Industry’.
Chemicals & petrochemicals (2.2%): greenhouse gases can be produced as a byproduct from chemical processes – for example, CO 2 can be emitted during the production of ammonia, which is used for purifying water supplies, cleaning products, and as a refrigerant, and used in the production of many materials, including plastic, fertilizers, pesticides, and textiles. Chemical and petrochemical manufacturing also produces emissions from energy inputs – these related emissions are included in ‘Energy Use in Industry’.
Waste: 3.2%
Wastewater (1.3%): organic matter and residues from animals, plants, humans and their waste products can collect in wastewater systems. When this organic matter decomposes it produces methane and nitrous oxide.
Landfills (1.9%): landfills are often low-oxygen environments. In these environments, organic matter is converted to methane when it decomposes.
Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use: 18.4%
Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use directly accounts for 18.4% of greenhouse gas emissions. The food system as a whole – including refrigeration, food processing, packaging, and transport – accounts for around one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. We look at this in detail here.
Grassland (0.1%): when grassland becomes degraded, these soils can lose carbon, converting to carbon dioxide in the process. Conversely, when grassland is restored (for  example, from cropland), carbon can be sequestered. Emissions here therefore refer to the net balance of these carbon losses and gains from grassland biomass and soils.
Cropland (1.4%): depending on the management practices used on croplands, carbon can be lost or sequestered into soils and biomass. This affects the balance of carbon dioxide emissions: CO 2 can be emitted when croplands are degraded; or sequestered when they are restored. The net change in carbon stocks is captured in emissions of carbon dioxide. This does not include grazing lands for livestock.
Deforestation (2.2%): net emissions of carbon dioxide from changes in forestry cover. This means reforestation is counted as ‘negative emissions’ and deforestation as ‘positive emissions’. Net forestry change is therefore the difference between forestry loss and gain. Emissions are based on lost carbon stores from forests and changes in carbon stores in forest soils.
Crop burning (3.5%): the burning of agricultural residues – leftover vegetation from crops such as rice, wheat, sugar cane, and other crops – releases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane. Farmers often burn crop residues after harvest to prepare land for the resowing of crops.
Rice cultivation (1.3%): flooded paddy fields produce methane through a process called ‘anaerobic digestion’. Organic matter in the soil is converted to methane due to the low-oxygen environment of water-logged rice fields. 1.3% seems substantial, but it’s important to put this into context: rice accounts for around one-fifth of the world’s supply of calories, and is a staple crop for billions of people globally. 8
Agricultural soils (4.1%): Nitrous oxide – a strong greenhouse gas – is produced when synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are applied to soils. This includes emissions from agricultural soils for all agricultural products – including food for direct human consumption, animal feed, biofuels and other non-food crops (such as tobacco and cotton).
Livestock & manure (5.8%): animals (mainly ruminants, such as cattle and sheep) produce greenhouse gases through a process called ‘enteric fermentation’ – when microbes in their digestive systems break down food, they produce methane as a by-product. This means beef and lamb tend to have a high carbon footprint, and eating less is an effective way to reduce the emissions of your diet.
Nitrous oxide and methane can be produced from the decomposition of animal manures under low oxygen conditions. This often occurs when large numbers of animals are managed in a confined area (such as dairy farms, beef feedlots, and swine and poultry farms), where manure is typically stored in large piles or disposed of in lagoons and other types of manure management systems ‘Livestock’ emissions here include direct emissions from livestock only – they do not consider impacts of land use change for pasture or animal feed.

Where do our greenhouse gas emissions come from?
This chart shows the breakdown of total greenhouse gases (the sum of all greenhouse gases, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents) by sector.
Here we see that electricity and heat production are the largest contributor to global emissions. This is followed by transport, manufacturing and construction (largely cement and similar materials), and agriculture.
But this is not the same everywhere. If we look at the United States, for example, transport is a much larger contributor than the global average. In Brazil, the majority of emissions come from agriculture and land use change.

How does this breakdown look if we focus only on carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions? Where does our CO 2 come from?
This chart shows the distribution of CO 2 emissions across sectors.
The global breakdown for CO 2 is similar to that of total greenhouse gases – electricity and heat production dominates, followed by transport, and manufacturing and construction. One key difference is that direct agricultural emissions (if we exclude land use change and forestry) are not shown; most direct emissions from agriculture result from methane (production from livestock) and nitrous oxide (released from the application of fertilizers ).
Like total greenhouse gas emissions, this breakdown varies between countries.

The breakdown of CO 2 emissions mirrors total greenhouse gas emissions closely.
The distribution of methane emissions across sectors is notably different. This chart shows methane emissions by sector, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.
We see that, globally, agriculture is the largest contributor to methane emissions. Most of this methane comes from livestock (they produce methane through their digestive processes, in a process known as ‘enteric fermentation’). Rice production is also a large contributor to methane emissions.
Aside from agriculture, fugitive emissions produce a significant amount of methane. ‘Fugitive emissions’ represent the unintentional leaks of gas from processes such as fracking, and more traditional oil and gas extraction and transportation. This can happen when gas is transported through poorly maintained pipes, for example.
Waste is third largest contributor. Methane is produced in landfills when organic materials decompose.

Nearly all of our nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions come from agriculture, as this chart shows.
Nitrous oxide is produced by microbes in nearly all soils. But the application of nitrogen fertilizers makes much more nitrogen readily available for microbes to convert to N 2 O – this is because not all of the applied nutrients are taken up by crops.
As the application of nitrogen fertilizers has rapidly increased over the past 50 years in particular, N 2 O emissions have also increased. But nitrous oxide is not only produced when synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is applied; the same processes occur when we use organic fertilizers such as animal manure.

Food production is responsible for one-quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions
When it comes to tackling climate change, the focus tends to be on ‘clean energy’ solutions – the deployment of renewable or nuclear energy; improvements in energy efficiency; or transition to low-carbon transport. Indeed, energy, whether in the form of electricity, heat, transport or industrial processes, account for the majority – 76% – of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 9
But the global food system, which encompasses production, and post-farm process such as processing, and distribution is also a key contributor to emissions. And it’s a problem for which we don’t yet have viable technological solutions.
The visualization shown here – based on data from the meta-analysis by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018), published in Science – summarizes food’s share of total emissions and breaks it down by source. 10
Food is responsible for approximately 26% of global GHG emissions.
There are four key elements to consider when trying to quantify food GHG emissions. These are shown by category in the visualization:
Livestock & fisheries account for 31% of food emissions .
Livestock – animals raised for meat, dairy, eggs and seafood production – contribute to emissions in several ways. Ruminant livestock – mainly cattle – for example, produce methane through their digestive processes (in a process known as ‘enteric fermentation’). Manure management, pasture management, and fuel consumption from fishing vessels also fall into this category. This 31% of emissions relates to on-farm ‘production’ emissions only: it does not include land use change or supply chain emissions from the production of crops for animal feed: these figures are included separately in the other categories.
Crop production accounts for 27% of food emissions.
21% of food’s emissions comes from crop production for direct human consumption, and 6% comes from the production of animal feed. They are the direct emissions which result from agricultural production – this includes elements such as the release of nitrous oxide from the application of fertilizers and manure; methane emissions from rice production; and carbon dioxide from agricultural machinery.
Land use accounts for 24% of food emissions.
Twice as many emissions result from land use for livestock (16%) as for crops for human consumption (8%). 11 Agricultural expansion results in the conversion of forests, grasslands and other carbon ‘sinks’ into cropland or pasture resulting in carbon dioxide emissions. ‘Land use’ here is the sum of land use change, savannah burning and organic soil cultivation (plowing and overturning of soils).
Supply chains account for 18% of food emissions.
Food processing (converting produce from the farm into final products), transport, packaging and retail all require energy and resource inputs. Many assume that eating local is key to a low-carbon diet, however, transport emissions are often a very small percentage of food’s total emissions – only 6% globally. Whilst supply chain emissions may seem high, at 18%, it’s essential for reducing emissions by preventing food waste. Food waste emissions are large: one-quarter of emissions (3.3 billion tonnes of CO 2 eq) from food production ends up as wastage either from supply chain losses or consumers. Durable packaging, refrigeration and food processing can all help to prevent food waste. For example, wastage of processed fruit and vegetables is ~14% lower than fresh, and 8% lower for seafood. 12
Reducing emissions from food production will be one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Unlike many aspects of energy production where viable opportunities for upscaling low-carbon energy – renewable or nuclear energy –  are available, the ways in which we can decarbonize agriculture are less clear. We need inputs such as fertilizers to meet growing food demands, and we can’t stop cattle from producing methane. We will need a menu of solutions: changes to diets; food waste reduction; improvements in agricultural efficiency; and technologies that make low-carbon food alternatives scalable and affordable.
Food waste is responsible for 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions
Food production accounts for around one-quarter – 26% – of global greenhouse gas emissions. 13 This is a lot, but it’s slightly easier to digest when we remind ourselves that food is a basic human need.
What’s harder to make sense of is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions which are caused in the production of food that is never eaten.
Around one-quarter of the calories the world produces are thrown away; they’re spoiled or spilled in supply chains; or are wasted by retailers, restaurants and consumers. 14 To produce this food we need land, water, energy, and fertilizer inputs. It all comes at an environmental cost.
Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018), in their large meta-analysis of global food systems, published in Science, estimated how much of our greenhouse gas emissions come from wasted food. 15
In the visualization here I show the emissions from wasted food in the context of global greenhouse gas emissions.
The study by Poore and Nemecek (2018) found that almost one-quarter – 24% – of food’s emissions come from food that is lost in supply chains or wasted by consumers. Almost two-thirds of this (15% of food emissions) comes from losses in the supply chain which result from poor storage and handling techniques; lack of refrigeration; and spoilage in transport and processing. The other 9% comes from food thrown away by retailers and consumers.
This means that food wastage is responsible for around 6% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. 16 In fact, it’s likely to be slightly higher since the analysis from Poore and Nemecek (2018) does not include food losses on the farm during production and harvesting.
To put this in context: it’s around three times the global emissions from aviation. 17 Or, if we were to put it in the context of national emissions, it would be the world’s third largest emitter. 18 Only China (21%) and the United States (13%) emitted more. 19

Appendix A
UNFCCC Inventories of Industrial Processes and Waste
INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USE
The industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector covers the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from various industrial activities that produce emissions not directly the result of energy consumed during the process and the use of man-made greenhouse gases in products (IPCC, 2006). Examples include the release of CO 2 as a by-product of cement production and the use of fossil fuel (primarily natural gas) as a feedstock in ammonia production. The IPPU sector accounts for about 7 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions from Annex I countries (UNFCCC, 2008) and about 6 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions for non-Annex I countries (UNFCCC, 2005).
Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is the most important greenhouse gas emitted by the IPPU sector, comprising about 69 percent of total emissions (in terms of CO 2 equivalents) from the sector for Annex I countries (UNFCCC, 2005). The main sources of CO 2 in this sector are the production of cement, lime, glass, ammonia, iron, steel, and aluminum. The calcination of limestone produces lime, which may then be combined with silica compounds to produce clinker (an ingredient of cement). Both processes result in CO 2 emissions. Glass production emits CO 2 during the melting and fusion of limestone, dolomite, and soda ash. The principal source of CO 2 emissions from ammonia production is the steam reforming of natural gas (methane, CH 4) to produce hydrogen (H 2 ). Iron and steel production yields CO 2 emissions through the use of metallurgical coke to convert iron ore to pig iron in a blast furnace. Similarly, CO 2 is emitted during the smelting process from the use of carbon to reduce alumina to aluminum.
The CO 2 emissions from mineral, chemical, and metal production can be estimated simply by applying appropriate emission factors to national-level production data. The major source of uncertainty in emissions from the mineral industry is typically the activity data (IPCC, 2006; EPA, 2008) because the chemistry of the processes involved is known. For cement production, CO 2 emissions should ideally be estimated using national-level data on clinker production, the lime content of the clinker, and the fraction of lime from limestone. However, national statistics on cement and/or clinker production may not be complete for countries in which a substantial part of production comes from numerous small kilns, for which data are difficult to obtain. If clinker production data are not available, they are inferred from information on the quantities of cement produced (correcting for imports and exports) and the types and clinker fraction of the cement. For lime and glass production, CO 2 emissions can be estimated using national-level data on the types and quantities of lime or glass produced (or, less preferably, total lime or glass production figures) and default emission factors. The key source of uncertainty for lime production is incomplete data; reported lime production statistics often omit nonmarketed lime production, potentially resulting in order-of-magnitude underestimates. For glass production, activity data uncertainties

are magnified where glass production is measured in a variety of units.
In the chemical and metal industries, reliable production data are available for most countries, so the emission factors present the greatest source of uncertainty, particularly for iron and steel production. For ammonia production, CO 2 emissions can be estimated using national-level data on ammonia production (or, less preferably, ammonia production capacity) and default values for the quantity of fuel (typically natural gas) required as feedstock per unit of output, the carbon content of the fuel, and the carbon oxidation factor. Any CO 2 recovered for purposes of urea production is also accounted for. For iron and steel production, the CO 2 emissions are estimated by applying the appropriate emission factors to national statistics on the amount of steel produced by each method and the total amount of pig iron produced that is not processed into steel. Similarly, the estimation of CO 2 emissions in aluminum production requires national-level production data by process type (i.e., Søderberg or Prebake) to which the appropriate default emission factor can then be applied.
Hydrofluorocarbons
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) comprise about 18 percent of total emissions (in terms of CO 2 equivalents) from the IPPU sector for Annex I countries. 1 The use of HFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in a variety of industrial applications is by far the largest source of HFC emissions, accounting for about 86 percent of total emissions from the sector, and their usage is growing rapidly. A smaller, but significant source of HFC emissions is the generation of trifluoromethane (HFC-23) as a by-product during the production of chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22).
Actual emissions of HFCs are estimated using either an emission-factor or a mass-balance approach (IPCC, 2006). Both methods can use activity data collected at either the application level (e.g., refrigeration) or the subapplication level (e.g., equipment or product type); the latter is expected to yield higher-accuracy estimates. For the emission-factor approach, HFC emissions are calculated by determining the net consumption of a chemical in a specific application or subapplication (production plus imports minus exports minus destruction of the chemical) and then applying an emission factor(s) to the net consumption. For the mass-balance approach, emissions are estimated as the sum of the sales of a chemical and, for equipment containing this chemical, the total charge of retired equipment minus the total charge of new equipment. The major source of uncertainty in national estimates of HFC emissions is the lack of activity data on chemical production or sales in countries where suppliers treat the information as confidential. This barrier to the production of reliable national estimates is being reduced with the development of regional and global databases of ozone-depleting substances. For example, databases that track the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances are directly relevant for estimating the phase-in of HFC substitutes (IPCC, 2006).
Emissions of HFC-23 can be calculated by applying a default emission factor to the quantity of HCFC-22 produced. Given the known variability in emissions from different HCFC-22 manufacturing facilities, the uncertainty in the emission factor far outweighs the uncertainty in the activity data (IPCC, 2006).
Nitrous Oxide
Emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from nitric acid and adipic acid production comprise about 7 percent of total emissions from the IPPU sector in Annex I countries. 2 Nitric acid production emits N 2 O as a byproduct during the catalytic oxidation of ammonia, and adipic acid production (most of which takes place in a few plants in the United States and Europe) generates N 2 O as a by-product during a process involving the oxidation of nitric acid. Emissions of N 2 O from both sources can be estimated by multiplying production by a default emission factor. For nitric acid production, the major source of uncertainty in N 2 O emissions is the activity data. Nitric acid production is often underestimated because nitric acid is formed as part of a larger production process and is never sold on the market. For adipic acid production, neither the default emission factor nor the activity data are significant sources of uncertainty (IPCC, 2006). The default emission factor

is derived from a well-understood chemical reaction (i.e., nitric acid oxidation), and only a small number of adipic acid plants exist.
WASTE
The waste sector is not a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for only about 3 percent of the total from Annex I countries (UNFCCC, 2008) and about 4 percent of the total from non-Annex I countries (UNFCCC, 2005). This sector covers the greenhouse gas emissions from solid waste disposal, biological treatment of solid waste, burning of waste, and wastewater treatment and discharge (IPCC, 2006). Waste sector reporting includes neither the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of waste material as fuel nor the CO 2 emissions resulting from the decomposition or burning of organic biomass. These emissions are accounted for under the energy sector and the agriculture, forestry, and other land-use sector, respectively.
Methane
The primary greenhouse gas emitted from the waste sector is CH 4, which accounts for about 90 percent of the total (in terms of waste sector CO 2 equivalents) in Annex I countries. 3 The degradation of organic material under anaerobic conditions at solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) is the principal source of CH 4 emissions. The potential of SWDS to generate CH 4 depends on the degradable organic carbon (DOC) content of the waste, which is a function of the amount and composition of the waste disposed, and on the waste management practices. Methane emissions from SWDS are calculated using the First Order Decay method, which assumes that the rate of CH 4 production is directly proportional to the amount of DOC remaining in the waste. The quantity of CH 4 that is oxidized in the landfill’s top layer and/or is recovered and combusted is then subtracted from the calculated emissions value.
The key source of uncertainty in estimates of CH 4 from SWDS is the activity data relating to the quantities and composition of the waste disposed (several decades of historical data are required), although some of the emission factors can also be highly uncertain. For many countries, data on waste amounts and composition (particularly historical data) are not available and default activity data must be used. The major uncertainties in the emission factors include the DOC values assigned to different waste types (e.g., municipal) and materials (e.g., paper, food), the fraction of DOC that is ultimately degraded and released from SWDS, and the half-life of the DOC, which is difficult to measure in real solid waste disposal sites. Also highly uncertain are the emission factors used to determine the fraction of CH 4 that is oxidized in the landfill’s top layer, which depends on whether the SWDS is managed or unmanaged and also varies considerably with conditions at the site.
The other significant source of CH 4 emissions within the waste sector is the anaerobic treatment or disposal of wastewater. The CH 4 emitted from wastewater handling depends on the amount of degradable organic material, measured by biological oxygen demand in domestic wastewater and chemical oxygen demand in industrial wastewater. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a means of estimating the quantity of domestic wastewater generated as well as default values for biological oxygen demand for selected regions and countries. Similarly, the IPCC provides default values for quantities of industrial wastewater generated and the chemical oxygen demand for various industry types. Reliable estimates of the quantity of CH 4 released from wastewater discharge are particularly difficult to obtain for developing countries due to uncertainties in the fraction of domestic wastewater that is removed by sewers (as opposed to being treated in latrines), the fraction of sewers that are open, and the degree to which these open sewers are anaerobic (IPCC, 2006).
Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide is a relatively minor source of greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector, accounting for about 4 percent of total emissions (in terms of CO 2 equivalents) from the sector for Annex I Parties. 4 The predominant source of these emissions,

comprising about 97 percent of total CO 2 emissions from this sector, is the incineration and open burning of waste containing fossil carbon (e.g., plastics, certain textiles). The practice of waste incineration is currently more common in developed countries, while open burning of waste occurs predominantly in the developing world. However, the basic approach recommended by the IPCC for estimating CO 2 emissions from these two sources is the same: the quantity of waste incinerated and/or open-burned is multiplied by default values for the dry matter content, total carbon content, fossil carbon fraction, and oxidation factor for the waste (IPCC, 2006). The major source of uncertainty is the estimation of the fossil carbon fraction of the waste, which is directly related to uncertainties regarding waste composition. Where country-specific data regarding quantities of waste incinerated and/or open-burned are not available, large uncertainties are also associated with the waste amounts determined from the IPCC default values for waste generation and management.
Nitrous Oxide
Nitrous oxide emissions comprise about 6 percent of total emissions (in terms of CO 2 equivalents) from the waste sector for Annex I countries. 5 The major source, comprising about 82 percent of total N 2 O emissions from the sector, is wastewater handling. N 2 O is emitted from the degradation of nitrogen components in the wastewater (e.g., urea, nitrate, protein). Although both wastewater treatment plants and the discharge of effluent into aquatic environments are sources of N 2 O emissions, the latter is typically a far more significant source. Emissions of N 2 O from wastewater effluent discharged to aquatic environments are determined using national statistics on population and annual per capita protein consumption to estimate the total amount of nitrogen discharged in wastewater effluent, and a default emission factor for the N 2 O emitted per unit of wastewater effluent nitrogen content (IPCC, 2006). Large uncertainties are associated with estimates of N 2 O emissions from wastewater handling, and the major source of uncertainty is the default emission factor for N 2 O from the effluent.

Appendix B: Estimates of Signals Created in the Atmosphere by Emissions

<|end_search_result|>

Okay, so from these search results, I can see that the IPPU sector, which stands for industrial processes and product use, contributes about 7% of total greenhouse gas emissions from Annex I countries, which are mostly developed nations, and about 6% from non-Annex I countries, which are developing nations.

Within the IPPU sector, the main greenhouse gases emitted are carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and nitrous oxide (N2O). CO2 is the largest contributor, accounting for about 69% of total emissions from this sector in Annex I countries.

Let me understand where these emissions come from.

First, CO2 emissions in the IPPU sector aren't directly from burning fossil fuels for energy; instead, they're by-products of certain industrial processes.

For example, cement production involves heating limestone to very high temperatures, which causes it to release CO2 as part of the chemical reaction. Similarly, producing lime, glass, ammonia, iron, steel, and aluminum all involve processes that emit CO2.

So, for cement, the CO2 comes from the chemical transformation of limestone, which is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), into lime (CaO), releasing CO2 in the process. This is different from the CO2 emitted from burning fossil fuels to heat the kiln; that would be counted under the energy sector.

Similarly, in ammonia production, natural gas is used not just for energy but as a feedstock, and the processing of it releases CO2.

For iron and steel production, CO2 is emitted when iron ore is converted to pig iron in a blast furnace using coke, which is mostly carbon.

And in aluminum production, CO2 is emitted during the smelting process.

So, these are all industrial processes where CO2 is a direct by-product, not just from burning fossil fuels for heat.

Now, the report mentions that CO2 emissions from these processes can be estimated by applying emission factors to production data. For example, for cement, you'd know how much clinker is produced, and from that, you can calculate the CO2 emissions based on the chemical process.

But there are uncertainties, especially in activity data, meaning that sometimes production data might not be entirely accurate or complete, leading to potential under- or overestimation of emissions.

Moving on to HFCs, which are a type of fluorinated gas, they account for about 18% of emissions from the IPPU sector in Annex I countries.

HFCs are used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances, like in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. So, as we phased out substances that harm the ozone layer, we started using HFCs instead, but they turned out to be potent greenhouse gases.

Another source of HFCs is the by-product of producing another substance called HCFC-22.

Estimating HFC emissions can be done using either an emission-factor approach or a mass-balance approach.

The emission-factor approach multiplies the net consumption of the chemical by an emission factor, which estimates what fraction of the chemical is emitted to the atmosphere.

The mass-balance approach looks at the sales of the chemical and the charges and retirements in equipment to estimate emissions.

Both methods have their uncertainties, but a big issue is getting accurate activity data, like production and trade data, because sometimes companies treat this information as confidential.

However, regional and global databases are being developed to track these substances, which should improve the accuracy of emissions estimates over time.

Next, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the IPPU sector, mainly from nitric acid and adipic acid production, account for about 7% of total emissions from this sector in Annex I countries.

Nitric acid production involves a chemical reaction where ammonia is oxidized, and N2O is a by-product.

Adipic acid production also emits N2O as part of its process.

These emissions can be estimated by multiplying production data by default emission factors.

The uncertainty in N2O emissions from nitric acid production is mostly due to inaccuracies in production data, whereas for adipic acid production, both the emission factors and activity data are relatively well known.

Now, moving to the waste sector, which accounts for about 3% of total emissions from Annex I countries and 4% from non-Annex I countries.

This sector includes emissions from solid waste disposal sites, wastewater treatment, and other waste management activities.

The primary greenhouse gas emitted from waste is methane (CH4), accounting for about 90% of total emissions from this sector in Annex I countries.

Methane is produced when organic material in landfills decomposes under anaerobic conditions, meaning without oxygen.

The amount of methane produced depends on the amount of degradable organic carbon in the waste and how it's managed.

To estimate CH4 emissions from landfills, the IPCC recommends using the First Order Decay method, which models the decay of organic matter over time.

This method considers factors like the amount of degradable organic carbon in the waste, the rate at which it decomposes, and how much methane is oxidized in the landfill cover or captured and used.

Uncertainties in these estimates come from difficulties in obtaining accurate data on waste amounts and composition, especially historical data, and variations in how landfills are managed.

For wastewater treatment and discharge, methane can also be emitted, but this is a smaller source compared to landfills.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the waste sector are relatively minor, accounting for about 4% of total emissions from this sector in Annex I countries.

These CO2 emissions mainly come from the incineration or open burning of waste that contains fossil carbon, like plastics and certain textiles.

Estimating these emissions involves knowing how much waste is burned and what its carbon content is, including how much of that carbon is from fossil fuels.

Again, uncertainties arise from not having precise data on waste amounts and their composition.

Finally, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the waste sector make up about 6% of total emissions from this sector in Annex I countries.

The main source is wastewater handling, where nitrogen compounds in the wastewater can be converted to N2O.

Estimating these emissions involves calculating the amount of nitrogen in wastewater and applying an emission factor for N2O.

However, there are large uncertainties associated with these estimates, particularly regarding the emission factor used.

So, in summary, the IPPU and waste sectors contribute a significant but smaller portion of total greenhouse gas emissions compared to energy production and agriculture.

However, they are still important to account for in national inventories and in strategies to reduce overall emissions.

Understanding the sources and magnitude of these emissions helps in identifying sectors where mitigation efforts can be targeted to reduce their contribution to climate change.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{Humans contribute to climate change primarily through activities that release greenhouse gases, such as burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and agricultural practices.}} \]
