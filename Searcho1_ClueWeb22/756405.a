So I've got this question: "How can mushrooms help save the world?" At first glance, it seems a bit abstract. Mushrooms are fungi, right? I know they're not plants because they don't photosynthesize, but beyond that, I'm not too sure. I need to think about this step by step.

First off, I should probably understand what makes mushrooms unique. They decompose organic material, right? They break down dead trees and such. So, maybe they play a role in the ecosystem by recycling nutrients. That sounds important, but how does that help save the world?

Well, saving the world could mean a lot of things. It could mean combating climate change, providing food security, improving health, or even cleaning up pollution. Maybe mushrooms can contribute in multiple ways.

Let me start by considering their role in the ecosystem. Since they decompose organic matter, they must be crucial for nutrient cycling in forests and other ecosystems. Perhaps preserving mushroom habitats can help maintain healthy ecosystems, which in turn can sequester carbon and support biodiversity.

But is there more to it than that? I've heard about mycoremediation‚Äîusing fungi to clean up environmental pollutants. Is that a thing? Maybe mushrooms can break down toxins or absorb heavy metals from soil. That would be pretty amazing if they can help detoxify contaminated areas.

Also, I've read somewhere that some mushrooms are being studied for their medicinal properties. Like, certain species are used in traditional medicine to boost the immune system or fight infections. Maybe modern medicine is looking into that as well.

Furthermore, mushrooms are a source of food. They're low in calories, high in nutrients, and can be grown in various conditions. Maybe they could be part of the solution to feeding a growing population sustainably.

Wait, and there's also mycelium, the vegetative part of the fungus. I've heard that mycelium can be used as a material for building insulation or even as a replacement for plastics. That sounds fascinating‚Äîusing fungal materials as sustainable alternatives to synthetic products.

So, it seems like mushrooms could contribute to saving the world through ecosystem services, bioremediation, medicine, food security, and sustainable materials. That's a broad range of applications. But I need to dig deeper into each of these areas to see how significant their impact really is.

Let me start with their role in ecosystems. I know that fungi are decomposers, but I'm not entirely clear on how that process works or how critical it is for the environment. Maybe I should look up some information on nutrient cycling and the importance of fungi in that process.

What Role Do Fungi Play in Food Chains?

You are probably familiar with fungi as mushrooms on pizza or mold on bread. In your kitchen, fungi are just tasty ingredients or a substance that ruins your leftovers. In an ecosystem, fungi play the role of decomposers -- they break down dead organic matter and return vital nutrients to the soil. Without fungi, nutrients would not cycle through an ecosystem, causing the breakdown of the entire food chain.
Fungi and Food Chains
The food chain begins with primary producers, such as green plants, that get energy from the sun and convert it to food through photosynthesis. Primary consumers, or herbivores, eat plants, secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and even tertiary or quaternary consumers enter the food chain. At the end of the chain, fungi and other decomposers take care of the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù in the food chain by consuming dead plants or animals. Decomposers complete the food chain cycle, and when nutrients return to the soil, a new food chain begins.
Fungi are Not Plants
While most fungi look like plants, they do not have chlorophyll and cannot make their own food through photosynthesis. Types of fungi range from mushrooms to toadstools or mold to mildew, and they can even form symbiotic relationships, such as lichens, which are the combination of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. Fungi reproduce by making spores, which are spread by water, wind and even animals.
Nutrient Recycling
In food chains, fungi act as decomposers, also called saprotrophs, which recycle nutrients in an ecosystem. Without fungi, forest floors would be covered in plant debris and animal carcasses; similarly other ecosystems would have a vast amount of waste piled up. Fungi break down plant components like lignin and cellulose, so they are particularly important in woody ecosystems. They also break down surface waste and release nitrogen back into the soil in the form of ammonium nitrate, a nutrient that plants need for survival.
Symbiotic Relationships
Without fungi, nutrients in the soil would be used up, and plants would not have food and couldn‚Äôt survive. If plants don‚Äôt survive, the animals that depend on plants for food would also suffer, and the whole food chain would collapse. Since transferring nutrients from fungi to the soil is such an integral part of the food chain, some organisms team up with fungi to form symbiotic relationships. Mycorrhiza, for example, is a symbiotic relationship in which fungi live in plant roots; the plant provides the fungi with carbohydrates, and the fungi in return transfer nutrients like phosphorus to the plant.
Detrimental Effects of Fungi
While most fungi aid the function of the ecosystem and contribute positively to the food chain, some fungi are harmful and destroy crops or other plant life. Fungi can spread on tree bark, for example, and decay the plant material; as large areas of dead tissue spread on the tree, nutrient supply is cut off, and the tree dies. Still other fungi produce toxins that are deadly to animals, including humans.

NARRATOR: It may seem that fungi play a specialized and limited role in the scheme of things. In fact, however, fungi are vital to world ecology. Many act as decomposers, breaking down the dead bodies of plants and animals and recycling the nutrients they hold. When a fungus grows on a dead organism, the chemicals released by the hyphae, which break down the tissue, also leak nitrogen, phosphorous, and other nutrients into the soil, as well as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The fungal decay makes these nutrients and carbon dioxide available to green plants for photosynthesis, and it completes an important cycle of raw materials in the ecosystem.
To see a mushroom or mold, it‚Äôs easy to think of them as just another lowly creature scratching out survival. But really the fungi have been an important part of the living world for billions of years, and their presence has had much to do with the way the world has evolved.

What Is the Role of Fungi in the Ecosystem?
By Staff Writer Last Updated April 17, 2020
Fungi are vital decomposers in the ecosystem, breaking down dead organisms and biological waste, freeing nutrients for use by other organisms and clearing away their remains. Fungi also act in partnership with some plants and algae, and are often vital to the survival of these organisms. Some species are parasites.
Fungi all receive energy and nutrition from their environments, and are incapable of generating food for themselves as plants do. Fungi grow as masses of thread-like structures known as hyphae. These have a very high surface area for their volume, and allow the fungi to absorb nutrients easily. They are generally buried deep in the soil and in decaying organisms, such as rotting wood. Parasitic fungi have specialized hyphae for penetrating living organisms, usually plants.
Fungi in mutualistic relationships with algae are called lichens. The associations between the fungal species and the species of algae are often so complete that each type is given a species name as a whole, despite containing two different organisms. Because of this association, lichens can survive where no other photosynthetic organism can, and they are a vital food source in some very cold environments. Other fungi grow in association with plant roots, where they provide vital nutrients in exchange for sugars and amino acids. It is estimated that 90 percent of vascular plants have associated species of fungi in mutualistic relationships with them.

What Do Fungi Contribute to the Ecosystem?
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
Updated March 09, 2018
By Kirsten Campbell
Fungi play an important role in energy cycling within, and between, ecosystems. Fungi are found in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments, and are part of a diverse community of ‚Äúdecomposers‚Äù that break down dead plants and animals. Aside from fungi, this community includes bacteria, tiny invertebrates, such as nematodes, and larger invertebrates, like snails, beetles and earthworms. Fungi transform organic matter into forms that can be utilized by other decomposers, and into food for plants.
Decomposition
Fungi live everywhere that moisture is present. They can be found as single-celled organisms, like yeast, that are invisible to the naked eye, and as multiple-celled organisms, like mushrooms, that are made up of strands of cells called ‚Äúhyphae.‚Äù Fungi are so widespread and numerous that they make up a large proportion of the biomass in any given ecosystem. Fungi play a very important part in the decomposition process, because they can break down tough organic materials, such as cellulose and lignin, which invertebrates find difficult to digest. Fungi release digestive enzymes that are used to metabolize complex organic compounds into soluble nutrients, such as simple sugars, nitrates and phosphates. Unlike animals, that digest food inside their bodies, fungi digest food outside of their ‚Äúbodies‚Äù and then absorb the nutrients into their cells.
Nutrient Cycling
Plants require nutrients for growth, but nutrients are seldom freely available in soil or water because they are locked up in insoluble compounds. Plants therefore rely on decomposers to provide them with soluble nutrients that can be taken up by roots. For instance nitrogen, one of the most important plant nutrients, is locked into proteins that are not easily taken up by plants -- although some plants have been shown to do so. Fungi metabolize proteins, and release inorganic forms of nitrogen, such as nitrate, that can easily be taken up by plant roots. In freshwater environments fungi are instrumental in the transfer of energy from riparian forest to aquatic ecosystems, by decomposing wood and leaf litter that fall into the water. In terrestrial systems, fungi transfer energy from above the ground, to below it, where it is recycled back to plants.
Symbiosis
Some species of fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants. Mycorrhizal fungi are associated with plant roots. This relationship is mutually beneficial because fungi facilitate the transfer of nutrients from the soil into plant roots, and in turn receive carbon from the plant. Carbon is stored by fungi in the soil and therefore is not released as carbon dioxide. It was once thought that plants were the only source of carbon for mycorrhizal fungi. However, an article published in the May 2008 issue of ‚ÄúFunctional Ecology‚Äù reveals that mycorrhizal fungi can actively decompose organic carbon, and therefore play a greater role in carbon loss and input from soil than previously thought. Lichens are another type of fungi that form a symbiotic relationship, but they do so with cyanobacteria. Lichens provide shelter for the bacteria, which in turn make energy and carbon for lichens via photosynthesis.
Food Source
There are many animals that rely partially, or wholly, on fungi as a food source. Herbivorous mammals tend to be opportunistic fungus feeders, eating fungi if they come across it while browsing in the forest. However, for some animals fungi makes up a large part of their diets. Examples are the caribou, which relies heavily on tree lichens for food during the winter when leafy foods are not available, and the long-nosed potoroo, an Australian mammal whose diet consists almost entirely of fungal fruiting bodies. Many invertebrates also eat fungi, both opportunistically and actively. Stream invertebrates receive extra energy when they eat decaying leaves that have fungi growing on them. Banana slugs are commonly observed feeding on mushrooms and other fungi, which they appear to favor over other foods.

Fungi are the major decomposers of nature; they break down organic matter which would otherwise not be recycled.
Learning Objectives
Explain the roles played by fungi in decomposition and recycling
Key Points
Aiding the survival of species from other kingdoms through the supply of nutrients, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers in the wide variety of habitats in which they exist.
Fungi provide a vital role in releasing scarce, yet biologically-essential elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from decaying matter.
Their mode of nutrition, which involves digestion before ingestion, allows fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules that would otherwise remain trapped in a habitat.
Key Terms
decomposer: any organism that feeds off decomposing organic material, especially bacterium or fungi
exoenzyme: any enzyme, generated by a cell, that functions outside of that cell
saprobe: an organism that lives off of dead or decaying organic material
Fungi & Their Roles as Decomposers and Recyclers
Fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems. They colonize most habitats on earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly-hostile environments, such as the tundra. However, most members of the Kingdom Fungi grow on the forest floor where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris from plants and animals. In these environments, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers, making it possible for members of the other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and to live.
The food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter. Some elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are required in large quantities by biological systems; yet, they are not abundant in the environment. The action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter, making them available to other living organisms. Trace elements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential for growth, but would remain tied up in rotting organic matter if fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolic activity.
Figure 24.2 A.1: Fungi as decomposers: Fungi are an important part of ecosystem nutrient cycles. These bracket fungi growing on the side of a tree are the fruiting structures of a basidiomycete. They receive their nutrients through their hyphae, which invade and decay the tree trunk.
The ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition. As seen earlier, digestion precedes ingestion. Fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients. These enzymes are either released into the substrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall. Large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which are transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane. Because the movement of small molecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively-high percentage of moisture in the environment.
As saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat. In addition to replenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, but sometimes damaging, ways.
Figure 24.2 A.1: Fungi: beneficial & pathogenic: Shelf fungi, so called because they grow on trees in a stack, attack and digest the trunk or branches of a tree. While some shelf fungi are found only on dead trees, others can parasitize living trees, causing eventual death. They are considered serious tree pathogens.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that fungi, including mushrooms, play a crucial role in ecosystems as decomposers. They break down dead organic material like plants and animals, recycling nutrients back into the soil. This is really important because it frees up nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that plants need to grow. Without fungi, these nutrients would stay locked up in dead material, and the ecosystem would struggle.

So, in terms of saving the world, maintaining healthy fungal populations could help ensure that ecosystems function properly. Healthy ecosystems can better withstand challenges like climate change and support biodiversity. Plus, if fungi are thriving, it means that the soil is likely rich and fertile, which is good for agriculture and natural plant growth.

Another point is that some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants, like mycorrhizae, where the fungus helps the plant absorb nutrients and water, and in return, the plant provides the fungus with carbohydrates. This mutualism is essential for many plant species to survive and thrive. So, preserving these relationships could help maintain stable and productive ecosystems.

Moreover, I remember hearing about mycoremediation, which is using fungi to clean up environmental pollutants. The search results didn't go into detail about this, so maybe I should look that up separately.

Mycoremediation - Wikipedia
Mycoremediation
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Pleurotus Ostreatus (Oyster mushroom)
Mycoremediation (from ancient Greek ŒºœçŒ∫Œ∑œÇ (mukƒìs), meaning "fungus" and the suffix -remedium, in Latin meaning 'restoring balance') is a form of bioremediation in which fungi -based remediation methods are used to decontaminate the environment.[1] Fungi have been proven to be a cheap, effective and environmentally sound way for removing a wide array of contaminants from damaged environments or wastewater. These contaminants include heavy metals, organic pollutants, textile dyes, leather tanning chemicals and wastewater, petroleum fuels, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides and herbicides [2] in land, fresh water, and marine environments.
The byproducts of the remediation can be valuable materials themselves, such as enzymes (like laccase [3] ), edible or medicinal mushrooms, [4] making the remediation process even more profitable. Some fungi are useful in the biodegradation of contaminants in extremely cold or radioactive environments where traditional remediation methods prove too costly or are unusable due to the extreme conditions. Mycoremediation can even be used for fire management with the encapsulation method. This process consists of using fungal spores coated with agarose in a pellet form. This pellet is introduced to a substrate in the burnt forest, breaking down the toxins in the environment and stimulating growth. [5]

Pollutants[edit]
Fungi, thanks to their non-specific enzymes, are able to break down many kinds of substances including pharmaceuticals and fragrances that are normally recalcitrant to bacteria degradation, [6] such as paracetamol. For example, using Mucor hiemalis,[7] the breakdown of products which are toxic in traditional water treatment, such as phenols and pigments of wine distillery wastewater, [8] X-ray contrast agents, and ingredients of personal care products, [9] can be broken down in a non-toxic way.
Mycoremediation is a cheaper method of remediation, and it doesn't usually require expensive equipment. For this reason, it is often used  in small scale applications, such as mycofiltration of domestic wastewater,[10] and industrial effluent filtration. [11]
According to a 2015 study, mycoremediation can even help with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) soil biodegradation. Soils soaked with creosote contain high concentrations of PAH and in order to stop the spread, mycoremediation has proven to be the most successful strategy. [12]
Acid mine drainage from a metallic sulfide mine
Metals[edit]
Pollution from metals is very common, as they are used in many industrial processes such as electroplating, textiles,[13] paint and leather. The wastewater from these industries is often used for agricultural purposes, so besides the immediate damage to the ecosystem it is spilled into, the metals can enter far away creatures and humans through the food chain. Mycoremediation is one of the cheapest, most effective and environmental-friendly solutions to this problem. [14] Many fungi are hyperaccumulators, therefore they are able to concentrate toxins in their fruiting bodies for later removal. This is usually true for populations that have been exposed to contaminants for a long time, and have developed a high tolerance. Hyperaccumulation occurs via biosorption on the cellular surface, where the metals enter the mycelium passively with very little intracellular uptake. [15] A variety of fungi, such as Pleurotus, Aspergillus, Trichoderma has proven to be effective in the removal of lead,[16] [17] cadmium,[17] nickel,[18] [17]chromium,[17] mercury,[19] arsenic,[20] copper,[16] [21] boron,[22] iron and zinc [23] in marine environments, wastewater and on land.[16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]
Not all the individuals of a species are effective in the same way in the accumulation of toxins. The single individuals are usually selected from an older polluted environment, such as sludge or wastewater, where they had time to adapt to the circumstances, and the selection is carried on in the laboratory[citation needed]. A dilution of the water can drastically improve the ability of biosorption of the fungi. [24]
Coprinus comatus (Shaggy ink cap)
The capacity of certain fungi to extract metals from the ground also can be useful for bioindicator purposes, and can be a problem when the mushroom is of an edible variety. For example, the shaggy ink cap (Coprinus comatus ), a common edible mushroom found in the Northern Hemisphere, can be a very good bioindicator of mercury. [25] However, as the shaggy ink cap accumulates mercury in its body, it can be toxic to the consumer. [25]
The capacity of metals uptake of mushroom has also been used to recover precious metals from medium. For example, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland reported an 80% recovery of gold from electronic waste using mycofiltration techniques. [26]
Organic pollutants[edit]
Deepwater Horizon oil spill site with visible oil slicks
Fungi are amongst the primary saprotrophic organisms in an ecosystem, as they are efficient in the decomposition of matter. Wood-decay fungi, especially white rot, secretes extracellular enzymes and acids that break down lignin and cellulose, the two main building blocks of plant fiber. These are long-chain organic (carbon -based) compounds, structurally similar to many organic pollutants. They achieve this using a wide array of enzymes. In the case of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), complex organic compounds with fused, highly stable, polycyclic aromatic rings, fungi are very effective [27] in addition to marine environments.[28] The enzymes involved in this degradation are ligninolytic and include lignin peroxidase, versatile peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, general lipase, laccase and sometimes intracellular enzymes, especially the cytochrome P450.[29] [30]
Other toxins fungi are able to degrade into harmless compounds include petroleum fuels,[31] phenols in wastewater, [32] polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in contaminated soils using Pleurotus ostreatus,[33] polyurethane in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, [34] such as conditions at the bottom of landfills using two species of the Ecuadorian fungus Pestalotiopsis,[35] and more. [36]
Pleurotus pulmonarius
The mechanisms of degradation are not always clear, [37] as the mushroom may be a precursor to subsequent microbial activity rather than individually effective in the removal of pollutants. [38]
Pesticides[edit]
Pesticide contamination can be long-term and have a significant impact on decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. [39] Therefore, their degradation can be expensive and difficult.
The most commonly used fungi for helping in the degradation of such substances are white rot fungi, which, thanks to their extracellular ligninolytic enzymes like laccase and manganese peroxidase, are able to degrade high quantity of such components. Examples includes the insecticide endosulfan,[40] imazalil, thiophanate methyl, ortho-phenylphenol, diphenylamine, chlorpyrifos [41] in wastewater, and atrazine in clay-loamy soils. [42]
Dyes[edit]
Dyes are used in many industries, like paper printing or textile. They are often recalcitrant to degradation and in some cases, like some azo dyes, carcinogenic or otherwise toxic. [43]
The mechanism by which the fungi degrade dyes is via their lignolytic enzymes, especially laccase, therefore white rot mushrooms are the most commonly used.[citation needed]
Mycoremediation has proven to be a cheap and effective remediation technology for dyes such as malachite green, nigrosin and basic fuchsin with Aspergillus niger and Phanerochaete chrysosporium [44] and Congo red, a carcinogenic dye recalcitrant to biodegradative processes, [45] direct blue 14 (using Pleurotus ). [46]
Synergy with phytoremediation[edit]
Phytoremediation is the use of plant-based technologies to decontaminate an area. Most of the plants can form a symbiosis with fungi, from which both the organisms get an advantage. This relationship is called mycorrhiza. Researchers found that phytoremediation is enhanced by mycorrhizae. [47] The mycorrhizae has a symbiotic relationship with plant roots and help to uptake the nutrition and soil waste like heavy metals bioavailable in the rhizosphere. The removal of soil contaminants by mycorrhizae is called mycorrhizoremediation.[citation needed]
Mycorrhizal fungi, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), can greatly improve the phytoremediation capacity of some plants. This is mostly due to the stress the plants suffer because of the pollutants is greatly reduced in the presence of AMF, so they can grow more and produce more biomass. [48] The fungi also provide more nutrition, especially phosphorus, and promote the overall health plants. The mycelium's quick expansion can also greatly extend the rhizosphere influence zone (hyphosphere ), providing the plant with access to more nutrients and contaminants. [49] Increasing the rhizosphere overall health also means a rise in the bacteria population, which can also contribute to the bioremediation process. [50]
This relationship has been proven useful with many pollutants, such as Rhizophagus intraradices and Robinia pseudoacacia in lead contaminated soil, [51] Rhizophagus intraradices with Glomus versiforme inoculated into vetiver grass for lead removal, [52] AMF and Calendula officinalis in cadmium and lead contaminated soil, [53] and in general was effective in increasing the plant bioremediation capacity for metals, [54] [55] petroleum fuels, [56] [57] and PAHs. [50] In wetlands AMF greatly promote the biodegradation of organic pollutants like benzene-, methyl tert-butyl ether- and ammonia from groundwater when inoculated into Phragmites australis.[58]
Viability in extreme environments[edit]
Antarctic fungi species such as Metschnikowia sp., Cryptococcus gilvescens, Cryptococcus victoriae, Pichia caribbica and Leucosporidium creatinivorum can withstand extreme cold and still provide efficient biodegradation of contaminants. [59] Due to the nature of colder, remote environments like Antarctica, usual methods of contaminant remediation, such as the physical removal of contaminated media, can prove costly. [60] [61] Most species of psychrophilic Antarctic fungi are resistant to the decreased levels of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production causing reduced energy availablilty, [62] decreased levels of oxygen due to the low permeability of frozen soil, and nutrient transportation disruption caused by freeze-thaw cycles. [63] These species of fungi are able to assimilate and degrade compounds such as phenols, n-Hexadecane, toluene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in these harsh conditions. [64] [59] These compounds are found in crude oil and refined petroleum .
Some fungi species, like Rhodotorula taiwanensis, are resistant to the extremely low pH (acidic) and radioactive medium found in radioactive waste and can successfully grow in these conditions, unlike most other organisms. [65] They can also thrive in the presence of high concentrations of mercury and chromium.[65] Fungi such as Rhodotorula taiwanensis can possibly be used in the bioremediation of radioactive waste due to their low pH and radiation resistant properties. [65] Certain species of fungi are able to absorb and retain radionuclides such as 137 Cs, 121 Sr, 152 Eu, 239 Pu and 241 Am.[66] [11] In fact, cell walls of some species of dead fungi can be used as a filter that can adsorb heavy metals and radionuclides present in industrial effluents, preventing them from being released into the environment.

Mycoremediation
Mycoremediation
Fungi are powerful planetary healers and disaster responders.
They are Nature‚Äôs decomposers, responsible for breaking down most of the Earth‚Äôs plant and woody material into life giving soil. Just like they break down complex carbon based plant cell structures, like cellulose and ¬†lignin, saprophytic fungi use their digestive enzymes to break down chemicals like hydrocarbons and pesticides.¬†Fungi can break down larger hydrocarbon chains into smaller pieces, allowing for microorganisms and plants to get to work.¬†Fungi can also extract and hyperaccumulate heavy metals, concentrating them in the fruiting body of the fungi (what we know as the visible mushroom).
Using fungi for bioremediation and earth repair requires a large amount of mycelium. Mycelium refers to the ultra-fine and dense network of branching thread-like white hyphae that is the vegetative part of the fungi. It is the mycelia that send out the enzymes that break down chemicals, and that also act as a filter, among many other things. In order to do effective bioremediation work and mycoremediation installations, a lot of mycelium is needed, and this can be challenge to most grassroots bioremediators. Mycellium can be bought, donated from mushroom farms, or you can learn how to grow your own mushrooms.
From layering mushrooms spawn with contaminated soil and wood chips, to installing mycofilters to trap contaminants in runoff and polluted water, there are many different ways to apply mushrooms to earth repair. Grassroots mycoremediators can install mushroom beds to deal with contaminated soil, decrease erosion, and ¬†help recharge and heal damaged land.
Mushrooms can be added to your grey water system. Mycelliated straw can be used to absorb spilled oil.¬†Mycobales can be made from straw bales inoculated with mushroom spawn, and placed in the path of polluted runoff or a contaminated stream.
Burlap sacks can be stuffed with straw, cardboard, coffee grounds, and mushrooms spawn, and similarly used to intercept and filter contaminated water.
A few of the common fungi used in remediation, and some of the contaminants they work on are:
Shaggy Mane
Arsenic, cadmium, and mercury
Elm Oyster
Dioxins, wood preservatives
Phoenix Oyster
TNT, cadmium, mercury, copper
Pearl Oyster
PCB‚Äôs, PAH‚Äôs, cadmium, mercury, dioxins
King Oyster
Toxins, Agent Orange
Shitake
PAH‚Äôs, PCB‚Äôs, PCP‚Äôs
Turkey Tail
PAH‚Äôs, TNT, organophosphates, mercury
Button Mushrooms
Cadmium
King Stropharia
E-coli and other biological contaminants
Most of us know a bit about growing plants. However, when it comes to cultivating mushrooms, we have little experience or training. In order to be effective mycoremediators, we need to understand some basic mycology and know how to cultivate ¬†and care for mushrooms.
Your mushrooms and mycoremediation installations will need moisture, shade, air and the right temperature to grow. Different mushrooms can handle different temperature ranges. One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is to not provide adequate moisture or shade to their mushrooms ‚Äì you don‚Äôt want your mushrooms to dry out or fry under the hot sun.
Also, different species of mushrooms are effective at remediating different contaminants. Different strains of that species can be more effective than others. Some mycoremediators actually train their mushrooms strains to eat a particular contaminant.
Some species of fungi like to be left undisturbed to do their work, others thrive on agitation. Different species of mushrooms require different things to grow on and eat. Some grow best in logs, others on wood chips, cardboard, corn cobs, cotton rags, burlap sacks, and more. These materials are called the substrate.
The wood chips used should be well hydrated, and should be fairly fresh ‚Äì between 2 weeks to 2 months old. If they are too old, they will likely have many other competitor fungal species in them, making it hard for your mushroom to grow. Different mushrooms like different types of wood ‚Äì some like alder and maple. Some like oak and douglas fir. Hardwoods are preferred, and anti-fungal species like cedar should be avoided.
Get to know the local mushrooms in your area ‚Äì it is always better to work with local mushrooms species and strains. Learn grassroots mycocultivation techniques that allow you to grow mushrooms from spore and tissue samples ‚Äì that way you won‚Äôt have to buy your spawn and have it shipped to you. Build relationships with different organic mushrooms farms, who may let you have their spent mushroom spawn for your remediation and earth repair projects. Connect with local arborists so that you can get fresh wood chips and logs sent your way to inoculate with mushrooms.
Finally, become acquainted with the many healing properties of mushrooms ‚Äì not only do they help bind, extract and transform contaminants in the land as well as retain water in the soil, they also are powerful healers for us humans. From powerful immune boosters to cancer fighters, they have much to offer to us all!
More detailed information on grassroots mycocultivation and mycoremediation techniques and projects can be found in . There are also some great grassroots mycoremediators who offer courses, as well as gatherings like the Radical Mycology Convergence, where many skills can be learned ‚Äì their information can be found in the Useful Links section of this website.

Abstract.
Some of the prospects of using fungi, principally white-rot fungi, for cleaning contaminated land are surveyed. That white-rot fungi are so effective in degrading a wide range of organic molecules is due to their release of extra-cellular lignin-modifying enzymes, with a low substrate-specificity, so they can act upon various molecules that are broadly similar to lignin. The enzymes present in the system employed for degrading lignin include lignin-peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), various H 2 O 2 producing enzymes and laccase. The degradation processes can be augmented by adding carbon sources such as sawdust, straw and corn cob at polluted sites.
1. Introduction to fungi.
Fungi feature among Nature‚Äôs most vigorous agents for the decomposition of waste matter, and are an essential component of the soil food web (Rhodes, 2012), providing nourishment for the other biota that live in the soil. The forest floor is covered with leaf litter from the previous season, which plants cannot use directly to grow on, because the fallen leaves are too tough to be broken down and digested; thus, any nutrients they contain are locked within them. The key organism for breaking down the leaf litter is fungus: strictly, mycelium ‚Äì the vegetative part of the fungus ‚Äì which we often observe as fine, white threads that grow out from dead wood, and leaves etc. Indeed, fungi are the only organisms on Earth that can decompose wood. The mycelium exudes powerful extracellular enzymes¬† and acids that are able to decompose lignin and cellulose, the two essential components of plant fibre. As the fungus breaks down wood and leaves, a rich material called humus is formed. In the natural ecosystem, a realm of organisms from different kingdoms make their assault on those different substrates that are present, and the rate of degradation becomes maximal when there is a good supply of nutrients in the soil, e.g. N, P, K and other essential inorganic elements (Rhodes, 2013). Aspergullus and other moulds are highly efficient in decomposing starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers, and some aspergilli can degrade such intractable substrates as fats, oils, chitin, and keratin. Substrates of human origin, such as paper and textiles (cotton, jute and linen) are readily degraded by these moulds, when the process is often referred to as biodeterioration. In 1969, when the Italian city of Florence (Firenza) flooded, it was found that 74% of the isolates from a damaged Ghirlandaio fresco in the Ognissanti church were Aspergillus versicolor (Rhodes, 2013). To achieve a successful mycoremediation, the correct fungal species must be selected to target a particular pollutant, for which a simple screening procedure has been described (Matsubara et al., 2006). An encyclopedic overview of the research literature on the action of fungi on organic pollutants, up to 2006 is available (Singh, 2006), along with the beautifully illustrated ‚ÄúMycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World‚Äù (Stamets, 2005), which serves to provide a hands-on guide to growing fungi and applying them to remediating contamination, e.g. from oil spills and chemical toxins, on the practical scale.
2. The issue of contaminated land.
The decontamination of soil and water from pollutants using microorganisms (bioremediators) is known as bioremediation (Rhodes, 2013). There are essentially two approaches, described as in situ and ex situ. In situ methods are those in which the contaminated material is treated on-site, whereas when the material is physically removed to be treated elsewhere it is referred to as ex situ. To excavate and remove contaminated soil is a relatively costly procedure, as is compounded when this is cleaned using chemical methods, or by incineration. In contrast, if the soil can be left where it is and decontaminated there, the overall expense is far less. Moreover, in washing or extracting toxic materials from soil, the contamination is simply moved from one place to another, and is not eradicated per se, while incineration may cause problems in its own right, e.g. dioxin formation, as well as being energy intensive. Methods of bioremediation offer means to degrade toxic organic materials, e.g. from oil spills, pesticides, and industrial waste, at the molecular level, converting them to more innocuous compounds. The ultimate goal of bioremediation is the full mineralization of contaminants, i.e. their transformation to CO 2, H 2 O, N 2, HCl, etc. Heavy metal and radioactive cations, of course, cannot be decomposed but can be rendered into forms of low solubility, e.g. by a change in oxidation state, such as U (IV) (in UO 2) (Singh et al ., 2014), so that they remain less harmfully in the ground, or might be physically removed by phytoremediation or mycoremediation, which involves harvesting the plant or fungus.
3.Bioremediation using fungi.
White-rot fungi digest lignin by the secretion of enzymes and give a bleached appearance to wood, from undissolved cellulose, hence their name. In contrast, brown-rot fungi degrade cellulose, leaving lignin as a typically brownish deposit. These fungi also cause chequered, cubical cracking and shrinking in wood, which is frequently apparent on felled confer trees (Stamets, 2005). It has been estimated that some 30% of the literature on fungal bioremediation is concerned with white-rot fungi (Singh, 2006). As we shall see, there are particular mechanisms implicit to white-rot over other kinds of fungi, which offer advantages, e.g. over the use of bacteria, as a means for bioremediation. In particular, bacteria need to be pre-exposed to the particular pollutant they are intended to degrade, in order to induce those enzymes that are required to accomplish the task. There is, furthermore, a pollutant concentration level below which the enzymes are not expressed in bacteria, thus limiting the technology (Adenipekun and Lawal, 2012). A very large range of organic molecules are susceptible to the actions of various strains of white-rot fungi, to varying degrees, and even normally highly intractable and persistent substances, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), may be degraded by them (Singh, 2006). The white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is an ideal model for bioremediation by fungi, since it is more efficient than other fungi or microorganisms in degrading toxic or insoluble materials. It presents simultaneous oxidative and reductive mechanisms which permit its use in many different situations, regarding the type of contamination, its degree, and the nature of the site itself. A number of other white-rot fungi also can degrade persistent xenobiotic compounds, e.g. Pleurotus ostreatus, Trametes versicolor, Bjerkandera adusta, Lentinula edodes, Irpex lacteus, Agaricus bisporus, Pleurotus tuber-regium, Pleurotus pulmonarius. (Singh, 2006; Adenipekun and Lawal, 2012). Soils may also be decontaminated from crude oil, with the requirement that lignocellulosic substrates (e.g. sawdust straw and corn cob) are also provided, to support the growth of fungal species in the soil (Lang et al ., 1995). Other toxic materials that have been successfully degraded using white-rot fungi are: polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins, pesticides, phenols and chlorophenols, effluents from pulp and paper mills, dyestuffs and heavy metals (Singh, 2006). It has been proposed that fungi might be deployed in the biodegradation of sites that are polluted by complex mixtures of PAH, for example from creosote, coal tar and crude oil (Loske et al ., 1990). However, it has been shown that the degradation of Benzo[ a ]pyrene by Pleurotus ostreatus is strongly influenced by the presence of heavy metal cations and mediators such as vanillin and 2,2‚Ä≤-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate). A 15 mM concentration of copper was found to best enhance the degradation (74.2%), which was progressively worsened as the Cu concentration increased. The extent of degradation was increased to 83.6¬†% when 5¬†mM of vanillin was included in the medium (Bhattacharya et al ., 2014). The possibility is offered, therefore, that the presence of vanillin (a breakdown product of lignin) might augment the process of mycoremediation using white-rot fungi in actual field-applications. It has been demonstrated (Isikhuemhen et al ., 2011) that L. Squarrosulus can degrade cornstalks significantly after 30 days, with a maximum lignocellulolytic enzyme activity being achieved on day 6 of cultivation, to generate exopolysaccharides. Thus, L. squarrosulus might prove very effective in the industrial pretreatment and biodelignification of lignocellulosic biomass. The main reason that white-rot fungi are active to such a wide range of compounds is their release of extra-cellular lignin-modifying enzymes, with a low substrate-specificity, so they can act upon various molecules that are broadly similar to lignin (Adenipekun and Lawal, 2012). The enzymes present in the system employed for degrading lignin include lignin-peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), various H 2 O 2 producing enzymes (Kirk and Farrell, 1987) and laccase, although the three types of enzymatic activity are not present in all lignolytic fungi.
4. Practical implementation of mycoremediation using white-rot fungi.
In order to use white-rot fungi successfully for bioremediation, knowledge must be taken from fungal physiology, biochemistry, enzymology, ecology, genetics, molecular biology, and engineering, among other cognate subjects. A four-phase strategy has been advocated (Lamar and White, 2001): bench-scale treatability, on-site pilot testing, production of inoculum, and finally full-scale application. Substrates such as wood chips, wheat straw, peat, corn cobs, sawdust, a nutrient-fortified mixture of grain and sawdust, bark, rice, annual plant stems and wood, fish oil, alfalfa, spent mushroom compost, sugarcane bagasse, coffee pulp, sugar beet pulp, okra, canola meal, cyclodextrins, and surfactants can be used in inoculum production both off-site or on-site, or as mixed with contaminated soils to improve the processes of degradation (Singh, 2006). It is critical to attain the correct nitrogen/carbon ratio in the substrates used, so to avoid any impeding effect on the efficiency of the fungi in the bioremediation process. Fungal inocula coated with alginate, gelatin, agarose, carrageenan, chitosan, etc., in the form of pellets, may offer a better outcome than with inocula produced using bulk substrates.
The latter approach, termed encapsulation, is derived from the mushroom spawn industry, and both preserves the viability of the inoculum and contributes nutrients to maximally support the degradation of pollutants. This, furthermore, increases the survival and effectiveness of the introduced species. Fungal inoculum may also be obtained by solid state fermentation. Such inoculum preparation methods improve the likelihood of success in the first phase (above), while good technical and engineering vitalise the second phase. Success in stages three and four depends on the exact remediation practices employed for the monitoring, optimisation, continuity and maintenance of the process overall. Native microbial populations will also provide a potential competition to mycoremediation process, but there is, as yet, a lack of defined protocols to eliminate such influences. There are some patents available which refer to the subject of remediation using white-rot fungi (Singh, 2006).
5. Conclusions.
Clearly, there is scope for the use of fungi in decomposing in situ intractable, persistent, and highly toxic pollutants, including TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) http://www.defmin.fi/files/2461/Steffen_Kari.pdf. and the nerve gases VX and sarin (Stamets, 2005). By inocculating a plot of soil contaminated by diesel oil, with mycelia from oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), it was found that after 4 weeks, 95% of many of the PAHs had been converted to non-toxic compounds. It seems that the naturally present community of microbes acts in concert with the fungi to decompose the contaminants, finally to CO 2 plus H 2 O (full mineralisation). In 2007, a cargo ship spilled 58,000 gallons of fuel along the San Francisco shoreline. Mats woven from human hair (resembling doormats) were used as sponges to soak up the spilled oil https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WscZJ2Dh0R. These were then collected and layered with oyster mushrooms and straw: the mushrooms broke down the oil and after several weeks the resulting soil was clean enough to be used for roadside landscaping. Wood-degrading fungi are extremely effective in decomposing toxic aromatic pollutants from petroleum and also chlorinated persistent pesticides (Rhodes, 2013). Mycofiltration is a similar procedure, in which mycelia are used as a filter to remove toxic materials and microorganisms from water in the soil. A major protagonist of mycoremediation is Paul Stamets, who has proposed (Stamets, 2005) that there should be ‚ÄúMycological Response Teams‚Äù, who would employ fungi to recycle and rebuild healthy soil in the area following any contamination incident (oil spill, chemical leak, radiation egress, e.g. at Fukushima). It has been suggested that edible mushrooms might be grown for the purposes of mycoremediation, and the prospects of whether they would be safe to eat afterwards are considered (Kulshreshtha et al ., 2014). Naturally this depends on the exact nature of the pollutants, so that heavy metals are likely be a problem (if they are absorbed and concentrated into the mushroom), while some organic soil contaminants might be decomposed without so imparting toxicity. In the latter case, the benefit is offered that land that is contaminated and unfit for agriculture could be both cleaned and made to yield a nutritious food crop.

Mycoremediation: Definition, Current Trends and Market Opportunities
Insights from BCC Research
Mycoremediation: Definition, Current Trends and Market Opportunities
A few months ago, we wrote a blog about the fast-growing bioremediation market, which is estimated to reach $186.3 billion by 2023, increasing 15.4% annually.
While we provided an overview of how bioremediation works‚Äîthe use of bacteria to break down toxic waste released into the environment from agricultural, industrial and pharma activity‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt give one important bioremediation process its due: mycoremediation.
Brief Definition of Mycoremediation
Mycoremediation, sometimes referred to as fungi remediation or mushroom remediation, is a form of bioremediation that uses fungi instead of bacteria to break down waste.
Benefit of mycoremediation
Mainly, mycoremediation may offer a more sustainable and effective way to decompose waste than traditional bioremediation processes, yet is often unheard of, misunderstood and therefore rarely employed.
To help us understand mycoremediation and all it offers to the bioremediation market, we interviewed industry experts Diethelm Suit and Charles Dixon of Delta Carbon Solutions. Our Q&A is below.
Q. How would you describe mycoremediation to someone who has never heard of it?
A. Mycoremediation is a component of the big picture of bioremediation. Microbes break down nutrients and organic compounds, store carbon, and they have their own world to sequester foods, just like humans do.
Mycoremediation uses fungi, which is most effective in breaking down waste, especially when combined with bacteria, as they work together to build soil humus and decompose waste. But mycoremediation isn‚Äôt studied very hard.
Q. Why is mycoremediation sometimes ignored in the bioremediation community?
A. When it comes to bioremediation, we‚Äôre very monoculture. We want a magic bullet bacteria or fungi that does it all, but neither of them can do it all alone. The problem with fungi, as good as they are at degrading carbon, is with the delivery method. The easiest product to deliver to end-users is definitely bacteria, but it‚Äôs not always effective.
Most of the mycoremediation that‚Äôs been done has delivered mattes of mycelium that‚Äôs been grown on cardboard and not something grown off the shelf, so it‚Äôs limited. That‚Äôs the big barrier to getting widespread use of fungi. But given that we have a growing concern of waste in the world, we need to begin using mycoremediation processes on a larger scale.
Q. What are some additional barriers to the growth of the mycoremediation market?
A. There‚Äôs only a few people‚Äîat a lot of different levels‚Äîwho truly understand what mycoremediation can do. The state regulators, especially in the plant care market, don‚Äôt even know about it. In the environmental market, the current method of remediating soil is to dig up the soil containing waste, take it to a facility or incinerator, then replace it with clean soil.
But when you look at the expanse of our waste in the world, you can‚Äôt do that. You‚Äôd have big piles of rotting soil and holes in the ground, which is extremely expensive to fix.
From a sustainability standpoint, we have to explore better options. Bioremediation will gain a lot from mycoremediation and as people are more aware of it, they‚Äôll see that as well.
Q. What does the mycoremediation market look like on a global scale?
A. Globally, India, South Korea and the Philippines have the most advanced knowledge about mycoremediation because they recognize what fungi do.
From an agricultural and food perspective, India doesn‚Äôt have the same sources or approaches as the U.S., so the agriculture community had to become experts in avenues that don‚Äôt rely on synthetic pesticides or GMOs. The use of fungi in agriculture and mycoremediation has been researched as alternatives to pesticide approaches. There‚Äôs more funding for mycoremediation because the country relies on it to grow food. There‚Äôs a need for it.
Q. Who are the major players in the mycoremediation market?
A. There are a few players that have been trying to deliver white rot and brown rot (forms of wood-decay fungus), which are effective in breaking down waste. Lots of groups are experimenting.
But with mycoremediation, it‚Äôs a delivery issue. We‚Äôre hoping to change that at Delta Carbon Solutions. Our product is a concentrated liquid of fungi and bacteria in vegetative form, delivered via spraying or injecting, as opposed to hand seeding fungal spores, which doesn‚Äôt always provide consistent results. Nobody has come close to what we have. We‚Äôre gaining some exposure in the bioremediation place. Within the next 6 months, we‚Äôll see some good results.

Using Fungi to Repair the Earth: Mycoremediation and its Applications
By
Mushroom Enthusiast
Although their impact is largely hidden from us, fungi are crucial to human welfare and, more broadly, the broader biosphere. Fungal mycelia weave dense, intelligent networks across virtually every landscape on Earth. The fruits of these mycelia are what we normally see above ground, the mushroom. The tenacious filaments underground hold the soil together and process nutrients by recycling dead plant matter. They even communicate with plants and trees to transfer nutrients and other minerals. Without them, we‚Äôd be covered in dead organic matter and all major ecosystems as we know it wouldn‚Äôt exist.
As nutrient cyclers, saprophytic fungi use extracellular enzymes and organic acids to decompose major plant components, notably lignin and cellulose. This same concept can be extended to pollutants and contamination in surface water and the soil. Both surface water and soil remediation are based on different properties of mycelium. Soil remediation relies on the natural ability of white rot fungi to break down pollutants externally by releasing extracellular enzymes. In water filtration and water contamination reduction, we rely on the interconnected web that mycelium forms which allows water to pass but not larger contaminants.
In this article, we will be exploring the major types of remediation efforts utilizing fungi. We will outline the major research concerning mycoremediation, including its role in habitat restoration of environmental contaminants such as oil spills, heavy metals, pesticides, and fecal coliform bacteria in wastewater. We will also discuss how you can get involved in the grassroots mycoremediation movement for local earth repair, and suggest some resources to learn more about this exciting new mycological application.
What is Mycoremediation?
Mycoremediation is an emerging multidisciplinary science at the interface of environmental chemistry, engineering, mycology, and environmental restoration. Mycoremediation is a term coined by Paul Stamets in 2005 that refers to the technique of using fungi mycelia to remove toxic biological and chemical pollutants from the environment and transform them into harmless, environmental-friendly products. While mycoremediation is a new science, the studies that exist have shown mycoremediation to be highly effective, cost-efficient, sustainable, and low-maintenance compared to other bioremediation methods.
Mushrooms for Cleaning Up Oil Spills: Mycoremediation of Hydrocarbons
Between 1964-1992, Chevron (then Texaco) illegally dumped billions of gallons of oil waste into the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. They were ordered to pay $9.5 billion (which they still haven‚Äôt chalked up), in restitution, but even to this day this contamination has wreaked havoc on a portion of the biodiverse ecosystem of the Amazon. This, and many others such as the BP oil spill of 2010 continue to pose a threat to major ecosystems on land and at sea.
Oil contains a wide range of toxic substances, including many carcinogenic ones. Oil spills are a major threat to the ecosphere, and they are always a question of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù rather than ‚Äúif‚Äù. Large scale application of mushroom mycelia may be a solution to this problem in the coming future.
Fungi to the Rescue
In the context of oil bioremediation, special attention has been paid to a particular subset of mushrooms known as white rot fungi. White rot fungi are wood decomposers that degrade lignin, a complex plant polymer, and leave behind bleached white cellulose byproducts. It turns out the enzymes it uses to break down this plant polymer can also be used to break down complex aromatic hydrocarbons, the major constituents of oil. These are complex organic compounds with highly stable polycyclic aromatic rings, and so they don‚Äôt readily break down.
How does it work?
When oil is treated, the mycelium from these fungal species absorb the oil and produce peroxidases and laccase. These enzymes break hydrogen-carbon bonds, including the bonds that form hydrocarbons in oil. These hydrocarbons are reformed into harmless carbohydrates. In general, the mycelia preferentially break down lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. However, they will break down the higher weight hydrocarbons into more unstable lower weight hydrocarbons. Then, a staged reduction can take place with additional mycelial treatments to completely reduce the constituents of the oil.
The Promising Mushroom Species for Mycoremediation of Oil Spills
The specific species involved in this process depends on the native species in the region where the contaminants are located. If local mushroom species are found in the bioregion, amplifying these species is the most effective. Otherwise, non-native mushroom spawn has to be introduced.
Some hydrocarbon-reducing fungal species include Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Agaricus bisporus (the common button mushroom), Glomus caledonium, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trametes versicolor (known as Turkey Tail), and Xenophiala xenobiotica, among others.
However, several studies have demonstrated that one of the most effective hydrocarbon bioremediating species is Pleurotus ostreatus, or the common oyster mushroom. This mushroom is especially attractive for murine spills because it has been found to be resilient to salt-water when colonized in straw. On straw substrate, it can also float above the water and therefore may be a promising option in reducing oil contamination in oceans and rivers. The oyster mushroom produces extensive amounts of biomass and is easily sourced from farms across the globe.
Mycoremediation of oil spills is an infant science, but many studies have shown promising results
One mycoremediation study of P. ostreatus came from Paul Stamets, which he describes in his book Mycelium Running. In this study, he and some scientists mixed P. ostreatus straw spawn with diesel-contaminated soil in large mounds covered with cloth. Two other ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù mounds were mixed with nitrogen fertilizer and left uncovered or mixed with bacteria and nitrogen fertilizer and covered with a tarp. Over sixteen weeks, the mycelial mound reduced its oily smell and, ultimately, total aromatic hydrocarbons in the diesel reduced from 10,000 ppm to < 200 ppm. The other two mounds were still oily, lifeless sludges, while the mycelial mound eventually grew plants and other secondary fungi and became their own functioning tiny ecological community. Eventually, this remediated soil was used as landscaping soil along highways.
In one study from 1999, compared to controls, P. ostreatus strains lowered the levels of anthracene, pyrene, and phenanthrene (three hydrocarbons) by 81-87%, 84-93%, and 41-64% respectively within two months. A more recent study from 2013 used P. ostreatus to mycoremediate hydrocarbon-contaminated substrates. The researchers found that petroleum hydrocarbons were reduced 85-90% by P. ostreatus within four weeks of incubation compared to controls, which had no effect.
The effects also extend to the aged waste spawn of P. ostreatus, a common byproduct of oyster mushroom cultivation that is commonly discarded. One study by Eggen and colleagues found an 87-99% degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in 12 weeks, while another study found an 80-92% PAH reduction over eight weeks.
It‚Äôs not fully known which variables influence the success of mycoremediation. Researchers have found that pH, temperature, biomass, and initial metal ion concentrations and contact time may play a role in the potential for biosorption. To keep temperatures warmer, Stamets et. al. found that mixing the mycelium with compost in 50:50 volume degrades hydrocarbons much faster than mycelium or compost alone. Large-scale applications will likely utilize mycelia/compost mixes.
Mycoremediation of Heavy Metals
Heavy metal contamination is an unfortunately common occurrence because heavy metals are found in the waste products of many industrial industries, including the electronics and textiles industries. Heavy metals are non-biodegradable and tend to accumulate and magnify in the food chain. Not only do they damage microbial soil communities, but they are also toxic in humans and animals by hindering various cellular processes, even in trace amounts.
Existing methods for heavy metal removal have several limitations. These methods include reverse osmosis, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, and electrodialysis. Many of these are time-consuming since the metal precipitate slowly. Others create environmentally-unfriendly toxic sludge. Most of them are costly and incompletely remove the metals.
Many Fungi are well-suited to absorb heavy metals
Fungal biomass binds metals with high affinity and can do this in a variety of pH and temperature conditions and either alive or dead. This makes mycoremediation more robust and efficient than other heavy metal bioremediation options.
Fungi have tough cell walls made of chitin that are resilient to high concentrations of heavy metals. The cell wall and the bioactive constituents within them offer excellent metal-binding properties due to the presence of several metal-binding ligands such as polysaccharides and glycoproteins. This allows them to accumulate above permissible levels of heavy metals, which poses an advantage over other bioremediation techniques.
Mushroom species for heavy metal contamination
One of the most popular species for heavy metal remediation is (you guessed it) the widely popular oyster mushrooms of the genus Pleurotus. Their low cost and high yield make them attractive options for reducing heavy metal contamination. They also have high biosorption potential (its ability to accumulate and concentrate heavy metals) due to their high mycelial production.
It concentrates high amounts of heavy metals, including mercury, cadmium, nickel, copper, iron, zinc, and manganese, in its fruiting body.
Other Pleurotus species like P. sajor-caju and P. flabellatus has been found to uptake more Cadmium than P. ostreatus. The exact species used depends on factors such as the ecological climate, the pH of the soil, the type of metal, and the substrate used. Special care must be made to separate these bioremediation mushrooms from edible ones, as the accumulated heavy metals could transfer into the food chain if ingested by any organisms. Some of these mushrooms have been found in some studies to accumulate more than 1500 times the background level of metals in the area.
Some research has shown Ploreutus species to be effective at accumulating heavy metals
P. ostreatus has been shown to bioaccumulate mercury on artificial compost. Bioaccumulation studies have also been performed on Pleurotus species cultivated on metal-enriched substrates. For example, P. sajor-caju grew on a metal-enriched substrate of duckweed. Researchers found that this mushroom accumulated Cadmium above permissible limits. P. pulmonarius reduced the levels of Copper, Manganese, and Nickel in cement-contaminated soil. This species also considerably decreased the content of lead in battery-polluted soils.
Mycoremediation for Water Contamination
in this mycoremediation technique, wood products (sawdust, wood chips, etc.) are transformed into a highly dynamic web of mycelia filaments. This living web can strain, adsorb, and digest bacteria as a food source with its enzymes and unique physical structure. This is all done with a small ecological footprint and relatively cheaply. Since this web is living, care must be taken to select the right species and filter the water at the right stage of mycelial growth. If the mycelial brick is too dense, water can‚Äôt pass through it, but if it is too porous, the contaminants can move through it with the water.
If appropriately scaled up, mycofiltration would be a paradigm shift in the water filtration sector. By a recent account from the International Stormwater BMP Database, the best management practices for decreasing levels of coliform bacteria are largely unable to reach the water quality improvement standards. Additionally, these existing practices are also costly and require lots of maintenance that may not make them suitable for dense urban areas or remote water treatment systems.
Pleurotus and Stropharia sp. show great promise as mycelial filters of contaminated water
Several genera of mushrooms have been investigated to reduce contamination in water contaminated with animal wastes and other pathological bacteria. This includes species from Stropharia and Pleurotus. These varieties have been shown to be resilient, low-cost, low-maintenance, and permeable enough to act as an effective mycofilter. Like other mycoremediation techniques, this technique can repurpose the waste spawn of these mushrooms from small farms and reuse it to filter storm runoff and other pathologically-infected waters. Future mycological farms may be strategically placed near vulnerable stormwater sites and contaminated zones for a quicker response to these hazards.
In a mycofiltration study from 2016, King Stropharia mycelium inoculated in straw wattles was used to reduce E. coli contamination in lab environments and wetland tributaries. The lab studies found that E.coli reduced with longer contact times (over an hour) to nearly zero levels relative to controls. Blue Oyster mycelia were also investigated and found to not be nearly as effective as King Stropharia.
In another study, the common oyster mushroom was used to filter an E. coli solution in open-ended glass tubes containing saw dust with mycelia (treatment) and just sawdust (control). A significant reduction was seen in the P. ostreatus mycelia group that was not seen in the control group.
In an exciting phase 1 trial from Paul Stamets and colleagues, mycofilters from Stropharia sp. showed a significant ability to remove freely suspended E. coli from freely flowing water. Higher reductions were found in sediment-bound pathogens, and could possibly achieve 100% E. coli removal. Further research is currently being done to scale up these mycofilters in order to satisfy large-scale design and operating procedures.
Paul Stamets has made this technology public domain, filed under the patent of Mycofilter and Mycorestoration. All of the concepts, methods, and applications will be made publically available. And of course, the team sells plenty of mycelium on www.fungi.com for anyone that wants to take on a local project to filter contaminated water themselves.
Mycoremediation of Pesticides
Pesticides were developed to kill undesired insects, pathogens and plants in the agricultural industry. All too often, these toxic compounds accumulate in the environment and pose a significant health risk to plants, animals, and humans. These long-lasting chemicals are well-known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic.
Current methods to reduce pesticides are of limited use
Several techniques have been developed to reduce these pesticides to more simple, ecologically safe compounds. There are significant downsides to many of the current remediation methods that exist (such as photocatalysis, incineration, or physical treatment), including toxic emissions, hazardous ash formation, and high expenses.
Other bioremediation methods utilize bacteria. Bacteria take a long time before they start to degrade any pollutants, need to be pre-exposed to the toxin, and they are generally not as tolerant as fungi to high concentrations of pesticides.
Using white-rot fungi to reduce pesticides
Using fungi mycelial is safe, feasible, and more economical than these other methods. Similar in principle to other mycoremediation techniques, the white-rot fungi show the most promise in degrading pesticides because of their lingnin-degrading enzymes. They enzymatically attack the pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides and degrade them to less harmful byproducts. They have the advantage of being able to degrade low concentrations of these pollutants to near non-detectible levels.
Many species can degrade insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, including Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Phlebia aurea, Aspergillus niger, Phoma glomerata, Chrysosporium pannorum, Morteriella sp.., and others. These white-rot fungi have been found to be effective in degrading several chemical compounds, including enilconazole, atrazine, heptachlor, endosulfan, and DDT.
Lindane is an insecticide that is banned in over 50 countries but is long-lived in the environment in which it used. It is known to be a hazardous neurotoxin. P. chrysosporium can remanufacture this toxic compound in liquid culture at 25C to harmless polar metabolites and C02. (Mougin et al 1996). Lindane is also degraded by P. ostreatus in liquid culture (Rigas et al 2005 ). In one study, oyster mushrooms were able to decrease concentrations from 345 to 30 mg/l within 45 days.
How does it happen?
The degradation is thought to occur through several mechanisms, including oxidation (adding oxygen to the compounds) , decarboxylation (removing a carboxyl group and releasing C02), and enzymatically by enzyme hydrolysis (releasing water in the process). Like in hydrocarbon degradation, pesticide degradation requires the use of laccase and manganese peroxidase, two enzymes secreted extracellularly by white-rot fungi. The efficiency of these reactions depends on several variables, including pH, soil type, temperature, biomass, moisture, aeration, and organic matter present.
Perhaps the most effective pesticide degradation involves a bacterial-fungal synergism. The fungal hyphae can transport the bacteria, release nutrients, and co-metabolize with the bacteria. This consortium is also full-spectrum: bacteria degrade the pesticides most efficiently in water-saturated environments while fungi degrade best in soil. Further studies will have to be conducted to see how well these fungal-bacterial teams degrade common pesticides in larger-scale settings.
Overall, mycoremediation is a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach that effectively degrades many popular pesticides. Mycoremediation of pesticides may be our best solution yet for reducing pollution from these overused chemicals for the betterment of human welfare and major ecosystems.
A mushroom that eats plastic? Yes, it really does exist.
Exponential increases in the production and consumption of plastics have led to tremendous ecological and economic issues. While there is no evidence of this slowing down (280 million kilograms per year and counting), there are some promising bioremediation species that are showing great potential for reducing the amount of plastic around the world, and even feeding us in the process!
Discovers in the rainforests of Ecuador, Pestalotiopsis microspora is a fungus that breaks down and digests a type of plastic called polyurethane. In fact, the fungus only requires polyurethane to thrive, it can survive on just that one carbon source, effectively turning it into harmless organic matter.
This fact makes it a great candidate for mycoremediation of large quantities of plastic. It also can do this in conditions without oxygen and in solid and liquid suspensions, which makes it a highly versatile bioremediation species with potentially broad applicability. An enzyme called serine hydrolase is responsible for the degradation of polyurethane. This enzyme is secreted extracellularly, where it can diffuse into the broader environment. Further research will have to discern whether other plastic polymers could be reduced by species in the Pestalotiopsis genus.
Two birds, One Fungus: Edible plastic-degrading mushrooms
It turns out this isn‚Äôt the only mushroom that can eat plastic. In a study by Katharina Unger of Utrecht University, the project addressed two major issues: the increase in world demand for a sustainable food source and the huge flows of plastic waste that are produced around the globe.
The researchers named their project Fungi Mutarium, a novel fungi food product that converts plastic waste into food. It is a hemispheric glass dome with egg-shaped cups of agar. The cups are filled with plastic and inoculated with a variety of fungi including the common oyster mushroom. There is no plastic in the finished product, and according to the head researcher, the final mushroom tastes sweet with the smell of licorice.
In the coming years, this food product may become a popular household item, a ‚Äúzero plastic emission‚Äù edible fungal grow dome. Cumulatively, this may reduce our plastic emission considerably while doing great things for our health.
Starting Small: Mycoremediation and Citizen Science
While everyday citizens can‚Äôt just walk up to a large oil spill or other ecological crisis to begin spreading mycelia, there are plenty of smaller community-based mycoremediation projects that are available for those interested in getting involved and learning more about mycoremediation.
Community-based Mycoremediation
Levon Durr runs the mycoremediation center FunGaia Farm in Northern California. He used the common oyster mushroom P. ostreatus to bioremediate a diesel fuel and motor oil spill behind a community center on Karuk tribal land near the Klamath River. The contaminated soil was layered with straw and burlap covered in the oyster mycelium. After some time, samples were taken that showed levels of oil reduced to non-toxic levels or were completely eradicated.
Community-level mycoremediation projects are occurring around the world just like this one. Grassroots mycoremediators may install mushroom beds to deal with contaminated soil, decrease erosion, and to help repair damaged land. Mushrooms can be included in your greywater system. Mycelliated straw (such as from Oyster mushrooms) can be used to absorb small amounts of spilled oil. Mycobales can be made from straw bales inoculated with mushroom spawn and placed in the path of polluted runoff or a contaminated stream. Burlap sacks can also be filled with coffee grounds, cardboard, straw, and mushroom spawn to filter contaminated water. Paul Stamets used a design like this he called a Mycoboom, a burlap sack with oyster mycelia and compost that floats in water contaminated with oil. It can reduce complex hydrocarbons in oil to simpler, unstable forms in a matter of weeks while also effectively containing the oil spill. The EPA even contacted him about these after the BP Oil Spill in 2010.
Tips to Get Started for Mycoremediation at Home
Connect with local mycologists and individuals interest in mycoremediation. Meetups such as this one in Melbourne, this one in New York, and this one in Central Texas bring like-minded individuals together to discuss mycoremediation and even offer workshops where you can obtain grow spawn.
Start cultivating for mycoremediation experiments! Spawn, cultures, tools, and grow kits can be purchased easily online from resources such as Amazon for mycoremediation projects. Tons of online resources like this video give step-by-step instructions for making lots of mycelium on your own. Local mushroom farms also have an abundance of spent mushroom blocks that they can give you for your mycoremediation projects.
Once you‚Äôve obtained grow spawn, get familiar with mycelia. There are a lot of different conditions and variables that factor in when growing mycelia. See how long it lasts on different substrates. Try introducing contaminants and see what happens. For instance, you could mix the spawn of oyster mushrooms with oily rags from car shops or bike shops and see how it reacts as its only food source. Other contaminants you could try include cigarette butts, styrofoam, and diapers. If you want to start smaller, you can use a petri dish of mycelia and add a few drops of 1% diesel to observe what happens, then scale it up when you feel comfortable.
Fund independent mycoremediation projects. Websites like Experiment.com let you directly fund the research of graduate students and postdocs working on mycoremediation projects. One such project from a few years ago was called ‚ÄúCan brown rot and white rot fungi work together to clean up spilled diesel? ‚Äù and received $4,620. Be on the lookout for live projects like this one.
Learn all you can! Mycelium Running is a classic book by Paul Stamets who really kicked off the growing interest in mycoremediation. His Ted Talk SIx ways mushrooms can save the world has been viewed millions of times and gives a great overview of the different ways mushrooms can repair the Earth. Online communities also exist such as Reddit‚Äôs Mycoremediation Subreddit which gives up to date information and lets you connect with people interested in mycoremediation all around the world. Tons of forums like Permies offers loads of information and resources for homemade mycorestoration and filtration projects. While mycoremediation is a new science, more studies are increasingly being published which may inspire at-home projects. Many are also accessible to the public. Lots of research coming out of UAB in Barcelona and Aalto University in Finland are showing great mycoremediation work, for example.
Final Thoughts
Mycoremediation is only just beginning to gain traction as a viable science to handle large scale contamination of all kinds, but nature has been using mycoremediation for millions of years. We are increasingly learning that fungi, specifically the white-rot fungi of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, are versatile species capable of reducing oil hydrocarbons, heavy metal levels, pesticides, water contamination, and even biochemical warfare agents like sarin and nerve gas. Over 30% of mycoremediation literature hones in on these white-rot fungi due to the impressive enzymes they secrete that even complex, highly-stable compounds can‚Äôt resist degradation from. Not only is this more cost-effective than traditional approaches, but it is also ecologically sustainable, ecologically regenerative, and highly effective, sometimes over 95% effective.
To sum up, Paul Stamets has a great call to action for a mycological paradigm shift at every level of society. He says,
‚ÄúOn a grand scale, I envision that we, as a people, develop a common myco-ecology of consciousness and address these common goals through the use of mycelium. To do so means we need to spread awareness and information. Please spread the word of mycelium. Educate friends, family, and policymakers about mycological solutions. Bring your local leaders up the learning curve on how fungi can decompose toxic substances, rebuild soils and strengthen our food chains. What we lack is the widespread availability of mycologically skilled technicians and educators and a more mycologically informed public. We need a paradigm shift, a multi-generational educational infrastructure, bringing fungal solutions to the forefront of viable options to mitigate disasters. An unfortunate circumstance we face is that the field of mycology is poorly funded in a time of intense need.‚Äù
