As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or the ability to conduct actual research studies. However, I can help you understand how a study might contribute to the body of knowledge in a general sense. Let's consider a hypothetical study for the purpose of this explanation.

Suppose we have a study titled "The Impact of Social Media on Teenagers' Mental Health." This study aims to investigate the relationship between social media usage and mental health issues among teenagers aged 13-18.

**Step 1: Identify the Research Gap**

First, I need to understand what existing research has already covered regarding social media and mental health. By reviewing previous studies, I can identify gaps in the current knowledge base. For instance, perhaps most studies have focused on adults, or they have looked at specific platforms but not others.

**Step 2: Define the Study's Objectives**

The objectives of this study are to:

- Examine the correlation between time spent on social media and symptoms of depression and anxiety in teenagers.

- Investigate whether certain social media behaviors (e.g., comparing oneself to others, cyberbullying) are more strongly associated with poor mental health outcomes.

- Explore potential protective factors that might mitigate the negative effects of social media on mental health.

**Step 3: Methodology**

To achieve these objectives, the study could employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative surveys to measure social media usage and mental health status with qualitative interviews to gain deeper insights into teenagers' experiences.

**Step 4: Expected Contributions**

Now, considering the above, hereâ€™s how this study could contribute to the body of knowledge:

1. **Expansion of Age-Specific Data:** If previous research primarily focused on adults, this study would provide valuable data specific to teenagers, whose developmental stage may make them more vulnerable to certain aspects of social media.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis of Social Media Behaviors:** By examining various social media behaviors, the study could offer a more nuanced understanding of which activities are most detrimental to mental health, allowing for more targeted interventions.

3. **Identification of Protective Factors:** Highlighting factors that protect against the negative impacts of social media could inform preventive strategies and support systems for teenagers.

4. **Methodological Rigor:** Using a mixed-methods approach could provide richer, more reliable data compared to studies that rely solely on quantitative or qualitative methods.

5. **Policy Implications:** Findings from this study could influence policy decisions regarding social media use among teenagers, such as guidelines for parents, educators, and social media platforms themselves.

**Step 5: Comparison with Existing Literature**

To further solidify the study's contributions, it's essential to compare its expected outcomes with existing literature. For example, if earlier studies have found a positive correlation between social media use and depression but haven't delved into specific behaviors, this study could fill that gap by identifying particular harmful practices.

**Step 6: Potential Limitations and Future Directions**

Acknowledging potential limitations, such as sample size, bias in self-reported data, or the rapidly evolving nature of social media platforms, would also be crucial. This transparency not only enhances the study's credibility but also suggests areas for future research.

In conclusion, this hypothetical study on social media and teenagers' mental health has the potential to significantly contribute to the existing body of knowledge by providing age-specific data, exploring diverse social media behaviors, identifying protective factors, employing a robust methodology, and offering implications for policy and practice.
