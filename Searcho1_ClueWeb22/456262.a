Alright, so I've got this question: "Are gun owners more likely to be shot?" Hmm, that's an interesting and somewhat sensitive topic. I need to approach this carefully and make sure I get accurate information. I think the best way to answer this is to look up some statistics and studies on the matter. Maybe there are some reliable sources that have investigated this issue.

First, I should probably define what we mean by "gun owners." Are we talking about people who own guns for self-defense, hunting, sport shooting, or all of the above? And "more likely to be shot" — does that mean being the victim of a gunshot wound in any context, like in a crime, accident, or suicide? I need to clarify that.

I think the question is broadly asking whether having a gun increases the risk of being shot oneself. So, perhaps it includes all scenarios where a person is shot, regardless of the intent or context.

I should consider both sides of the argument. On one hand, some people might argue that owning a gun makes you safer because you can defend yourself. So, in theory, you're less likely to be victimized because potential attackers know you have a gun. On the other hand, others might argue that having a gun at home increases the risk of accidents, suicides, or homicides involving that gun.

I recall hearing about studies that suggest homes with guns have a higher risk of firearm-related deaths, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look into that.

Let me try to find some reliable sources on this. I'll start by searching for studies or reports on gun ownership and the risk of being shot.

The people who quote these stats are either ignorant that 2/3 of the people shot “with their own gun” are shooting themselves on purpose or they don’t care.
It’s the same kind of BS statistics when “gun deaths” include police shooting criminals. Neither of these types of shootings should be included in the discussions.

Not actually, the statistics for Gun Owners in Gun Owning Households being killed by a firearm are intentionally skewed by Anti-Civil Liberties activists to intentionally ignore the “elephant in the room”.
80–90% of all firearms homicide victims have criminal arrest records. Less than 1% of Gun Owners have ever been arrested for any type of crime. This means that an outlier population of 1% is being included in totals for American gun owners without regard to their most glaring demographic marker: CRIMINAL ARREST AND INCARCERATION.

No. Owning a gun and being stupid, careless or reckless with it is a good way to get yourself shot, just as owning a car and driving drunk is a good way to get yourself into a car accident, or picking up a chainsaw and telling someone to hold your beer is a good way to loose a limb.
Granted, none of these things is as likely if you don’t own a firearm, a car or a chainsaw. But none of these objects will do anything to hurt anyone at all without some irresponsible idiot setting them in motion. Hence the problem is not the object, but the irresponsible idiot.

yes. but here’s the catch.
Most people who actively carry a firearm (concealed or openly) understand that by carrying that weapon they make themselves a target.
For me, and for countless other people who carry every day we understand that in an active shooter situation, or even coming into a robbery, a shooter, when faced with an armed individual will turn their attention to the armed individual first. That also means that while people are running away from gunfire, we will be running toward the shooter. While a shooter is concentrating on us however, they will NOT be shooting at the unarmed and

Getting shot means that the person who was shot was somewhere downrange of the muzzle end of a firearm when it was fired (for any of an infinite number of reasons).
Safe firearm ownership means not placing yourself (or others) at that end of any firearm under your control.
So no, it’s “not just a fact”. In fact, owning a firearm is completely unrelated to getting shot. That can easily be demonstrated by understanding that out of the people who have ever been shot, many of them did not own a firearm.

Yes, at least for the United States.
Mostly because suicide is a fairly common cause of death in the US, and gun owners who commit suicide are probably going to shoot themselves.
In small part because a some gun owners will be in professions (legal or not) with a higher risk of violent death. (Drug dealers, police, etc.)
In small part because people who are legitimately fearing violence against them may purchase a gun to protect themselves.
Owning a gun, in and of itself, won't make you more likely to be shot and killed.

Yes, but only because most gun deaths are suicides, and you're more likely to commit suicide by gun if you own a gun. Another factor to consider is that some people who buy guns for protection do so because they live in areas (or work or travel through) with high rates of crime.
But it's not as if the mere fact of owning a gun magically makes you more likely to be shot by someone else than you were had you not bought that gun. With the exception of cases of domestic violence, there is almost always an outside factor at work.

Also, people who think someone might try to rob or shoot them are very likely to buy guns. Which creates a strong selection bias effect to the statistic.
Among gun owners who are more likely to be shot are people whose store has been robbed or burglarized, former police officers and prosecuting attorneys who are the targets of criminals they arrested and convicted, people who transport or sell high value items like jewelry (wholesale jewelry salespeople who travel are a favorite target), musical equipment (musicians and roadies), etc.

No. It’s a fact that just buying a gun and having around without ever training with it, increases the chance of it being used against you. It’s a fact that brandishing a gun or threatening someone with it without pulling the trigger is a good way to get shot. If you’re responsible, and proficient, it’s not likely or even close to a fact that your own gun will harm you. There’s been cases, but statistically guns probably turn on their owners less than dogs do.

Firearms owners are trained in the safe handling of the weapons they own. Those who hurt themselves and others are usually not the gun owners, but friends who come over and allowed to use the owners weapons.
Another group that might be likely to get shot or killed during the use of a firearm are those who possess firearms illegally. Ones who don’t want to now about the safe operations of firearms, and don’t care who might be in the way of a stray round. After all, the only use of a firearm to them is to intimidate and kill.

No. Quite the opposite in fact.

Other cities have closely replicated these findings. The overwhelming majority of “gun crime” is career criminals killing other career criminals. Convicted felons haven’t been able to legally possess a gun since 1968, but since criminals don’t obey the law this is not much of a deterrent.

Also note that based on FBI figures the number of guns in the US has doubled in the past 20 years and the murder rate has dropped almost in half. Statistically speaking more guns = less crime.

Statistics do indeed indicate this.
Obviously you are far less likely to get shot with your own gun if you don't have one. Suicide is harder work, so you are more likely to seek help.
More disturbing is the fact that having a gun appears to make the owner more belligerent, and far more likely to get involved in fights. This tends to be bad for all concerned.

I did. I had just gotten home from my nightshift and was sitting at my dining room table eating cereal. This was my routine. I heard someone attempting to open the backdoor. My Husband was in Utah for work, so I knew it wasn't him. I looked out the window and saw two people, a male and female. I announced my presence and they continued to try and pry my back door open. I was dialing 911 as I went to my closet and retrieved my 12 gauge mossberg. I went to the backdoor, opened it, racked the shotgun. I heard the female say “shes got a shotgun”. They both ran toward their vehicle which was parked

Pros and Cons of Gun Ownership for Home Security
Gun ownership is both a basic American right and one of the most contentious social and political issues of the day. There are about 300 million privately-owned firearms in the US; which works out to roughly one gun for every man, woman and child in America; with nearly a third of the population owning at least one gun. Many of these firearms were bought with home protection in mind, which makes sense: in the right circumstances, a gun can be your first and most effective line of defense against intruders and criminals. But is it the best choice for you?
Gun ownership pros: A sense of security
For many gun owners, it’s a simple calculus: having a gun gives them at least a fighting chance in the event that a burglar or home invader manages to get in. And while definitive numbers on the frequency of defensive gun use in the US are hard to come by; they range from a low of 55,000 to a high of over two million per year; none of that will matter if you are one of the thousands of American gun owners who uses a firearm in self defense against a criminal or intruder each year.
Criminals don’t like finding themselves on the business end of a gun barrel any more than the rest of us do, which is why 74% of them actively try to avoid breaking into houses when the owners are home. In other words, just the fear of being shot is often enough to dissuade criminals from targeting certain homes.
Gun ownership cons: Having a gun in the house makes living there statistically more dangerous
Unfortunately, guns can’t discriminate between criminals and innocent bystanders. Studies have shown that unintentional shootings are four times as common as occurrences of gun use in legitimate home defense situations. You’d actually be more likely, statistically speaking, to shoot someone by accident than you are to shoot a home invader.
Having a gun in the house also increases your own chances of becoming the victim of a firearm-related homicide or suicide in the home. Researchers have found that this holds true regardless of the type of gun you own, how you store it, or how many guns you own.
Finally, if you have children, you should take into account how the presence of a firearm in the home might affect their safety. Most gun-owning parents take precautions to keep their children from finding and handling the family’s firearms. However, despite these efforts, children often handle guns in the home without their parents’ knowledge; in one study, 22% of parents who believed that their children had never handled the guns in the home were contradicted by the children themselves. Further, when a child or teen is killed by a firearm, the gun that killed them comes from their own home fully 72 percent of the time.
So what’s the answer?
There is no “right” answer. Whether or not a gun is the best choice for your home protection needs is a very personal decision. You are the best person to realistically assess the tradeoff between the risks and rewards of gun ownership and decide what the best course of action is for your family.

Though your question is weird, I’ve actually seen this exact twisted logic used to dissuade black Americans from lawful gun ownership. The notion that “if you’re black and you have a gun you’re more likely to be shot be police” is one such way this logic is applied. Though there have a been a few cases where legally armed black Americans were immediately seen as a “threat” by responding police, I see those offenses as individual crimes, and NOT a national epidemic. And even if was a national epidemic, WHY should lawful innocent people punish THEMSELVES for the evil acts of others who see only

Depends what you do with it. The fact that in america and possibly other places in the world theres no law about carrying a gun is truely at fault so yes in that sense there is more chance of being shot.
in a general sense, carrying a concealed gun is not going to increase the chance of getting shot. If you are waving it around, police might consider you a threat, if you are hinting that you have a gun on yourself to every drug dealer, you are basically just asking to be shot.
No owning a gun is not going to increase the chance you kill someone. If you are the murderous type you will kill someon

I am no expert and I do not carry a gun. I find the question comical but I will try to answer with respect. First, to me, there is no debate, we, as Americans are granted the right by the US Constitution to be armed. There are over 70 million legally owned firearms in private hands in the United States. A minuscule number of these are used to shoot someone in anger, even less are used in crimes. No, owning a legal firearm in the US doesn’t make these things more likely.

What is the best argument you have for owning a gun?
A few years ago I was driving my Honda Prelude and the timing belt broke and the car came to a halt on the interstate. I got out and called AAA and they said they will be by in 45 minutes. While I was out a State Trooper came by and told me to get back in the car and lock the door. He left after saying that to me. A few minutes later, a car came by and he backed up to my car so closely I couldn’t see his license tag. A young guy got out and walked up to the car and I locked the door grabbed my 9mm Glock and I cracked the window. The guy asked if I needed help and I said no, help is on the way.

Your question illustrates the problems with so many pro gun controllers attempts to open a debate on the gun issue. The first is, your question is absurdly arbitrary. You are clearly starting from a place of near zero knowledge and rather than educate yourself to make your question meaningful you basically say 'you know what I mean.'. No, no we don't.

You see this:
It’s a golf ball. Rather, it’s a golf ball with a hole in it (see the light passing through on the other side?)
I made that hole…. Well, the round from my pistol made that hole. Believe it or not, I shot this golf ball off the top of an expended shotgun shell from 15 yards on the draw (one shot, with a pistol). I’m quite proud of it. My fellow agents, who were also golf buddies, told me it was the best golf ball that they had ever seen me hit. Which is probably true… I love golf, but I’m a terrible golfer.

Depends on how you count. Most of the “studies” that purport to show “hundreds of gun owners are killed by guns a day” count criminal “ownership” of firearms to get to that number. And the most likely cause of that death is another criminal using their own gun to kill the “owner”, so it is not even a death cause by the owners own guns, but rather a death connected to criminal activity.
There are also violent encounters that do target lawful gun owners, but do so in a way that the lawfully owned guns have no bearing on the outcome of the situation. These would include quite a few home invasions

This pro gun argument uses semantics to exploit a common language shortcut. That is to say, when someone says that guns kill people, they expect you to understand what they mean by that and not take it to a ridiculously literal extreme.

Owning a gun doesn’t make you suicidal (well, maybe if it’s a really shitty gun), but it certainly makes it more likely that you will shoot yourself rather than hang yourself.

Historically, felonies were crimes that were typically associated with the death penalty… Murder, rape, kidnapping, treason, etc.
Conviction for those crimes came with fairly obvious removal of one’s civil rights (Death!!!)
Indeed, let’s remember that this largely predates the idea of prison. People before this time who were convicted of crimes were either executed, fined, or punished in some other way (torture/public humiliation/etc.)
So once we started not executing people convicted of felonies, we retained the idea that those people still lose a variety of civil rights… The right to vote, rest

I am a person on the autism spectrum (Asperger's), who owns a gun and has a concealed weapon permit. State and local laws vary considerably, but Alabama just acts if one has been hospitalized for mental illness. As I explained in a comment on a related topic, persons on the autism spectrum are not mentally ill, though we are prone to mood and anxiety disorders.

What percentage of gun owners own the most guns?
How is that in any way significant? You might as well ask what percentage of golfers own the most golf clubs.
You can only use one gun at a time. Owning a hundred guns is no more dangerous than owning one.
Considering that over 90% of violent crime is committed by career criminals (2+ felony convictions) who can’t legally own ANY guns, the number of guns owned by law-abiding gun owners is likewise irrelevant.

Is owning a gatling gun legal?
Yes. True gatling guns, being manually operated by a crank, are not considered machineguns and are regulated the same as any other firearm. An original or reproduction Gatling gun that fires paper cartridges may not even be considered a firearm, and thus would not be regulated at all.
However, electrically operated Gatling style guns, such as the Minigun, are considered machineguns are are strictly regulated. Civilians can't own any machineguns made after 1986.

How do I own a blank firing gun in the UK?
You don't need a licence to buy or own a blank-firing gun in the UK, (as long as its not an actual fire-arm that just fires blanks!). Blank-firing guns are designed not to chamber or fire live ammo -just 8mm rimmless blanks for automatics, and 9mm and .22 rimmed for revolvers. (Btw, I find a lot of attitutes towards guns/weapons/explosives in the UK to be on the very negative side -which is a shame).

What is the most deadly type of round (bullet)?
Originally Answered: What is the most dangerous bullet?
The Radically Invasive Projectile, or the R.I.P, in my opinion, is quite arguable the most deadliest bullet.
It’s a 9mm round and costs around $36.99 - $47.99, but what’s the most brutal part about it is the ejection function on the tip.
See those spikes? They’re meant to eject from the bullet and create a “spray fire”, something like this-
“The bullet shreds through solid objects, and only then, expands it’s energy,” said G2, the company who manufactured the bullet. It hits the target much like a shotgun does, and causes massive internal damage.
So yeah, there’s your answer.

If a bullet is found, can it be traced back to your registered gun?
No because there is no registry of guns in most of the United States and definitely no registry of bullets from the guns to match them up to.
Even in places where there is registration there is no registry of fired bullets or casings. What systems to do this partially that did exist were dismantled years ago as they never worked for the stated purpose of linking bullets to guns!

Guns in Home, Greater Odds of Family Homicide
From the WebMD Archives
By Steven Reinberg
HealthDay Reporter
MONDAY, July 22, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Family members are at risk of being killed in homes with guns in the United States, a new study suggests.
For each 10% jump in home ownership of guns, the risk of someone in the household being killed rises by 13%. The risk of a nonfamily member getting murdered is increased only 2% with gun ownership, researchers found.
"This study suggests that some of the risks associated with gun ownership are fairly localized in the home," said lead researcher Aaron Kivisto. He's an associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Indianapolis.
"Considered alongside the robust literature showing an association between gun ownership and suicide, however, these findings further suggest that gun ownership is associated with mortality and that the most likely victim is someone in the home," Kivisto said.
The risk of homicide goes up for both males and females in homes with guns, but women are more at risk, he said. Only about 1 in 4 murder victims is a woman, but women account for about 3 out of 4 victims of intimate partner homicide, Kivisto added.
Dr. Megan Ranney is an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. She was not part of the study.
"This study reinforces for women, in particular, a partner's access to a firearm puts her at risk," said Ranney, who is also chief research officer of the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine.
Kivisto noted that the "narrative about gun ownership and personal protection" is a common rationale for gun ownership. But it tends to ignore the risks associated with owning a firearm, including the risks to others in the home, he said.
"Gun owners should weigh these perceived benefits and risks, and engage in safe storage and other practices to reduce the risk of a domestic incident becoming fatal," he added.
However, Kivisto cautioned that this study shows an association between guns in the home and increased rates of murders of family members. It doesn't prove a causal relationship.
For the study, Kivisto and his colleagues used data from the U.S. Census, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report.
They looked at annual murder rates in all states from 1990 through 2016. And they gathered data on murders of intimate partners, other family members, acquaintances and strangers.
During that time, 316,000 gun homicides occurred in the United States, according to the study.
Murders of family members rose significantly with gun ownership and also varied regionally, the researchers found.
Gun ownership ranged from 10% in the Northeast to nearly 69% in the South and West. As gun ownership increased, so did murders of family members.
Compared with the states with the fewest gun owners, household murders were 65% higher in the states with the most gun owners, according to the study.
Overall, about 1 in 3 firearm murders was of a family member, with most gun murders occurring in the South.
Kivisto said that they did not distinguish between handguns and long guns.
Attempts by HealthDay to reach out to the National Rifle Association for comment were unsuccessful.
Ranney said the sobering statistics about women being more frequent victims begs the question: "How do we make the world safer for women in America?"
Understanding more about gun killings is essential, she said. It's a problem that the federal government is prohibited from funding research on guns, and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is banned from researching gun violence, she noted.
"Gun violence is a public health epidemic, and we have never had an epidemic that the CDC is not involved in helping to research and prevent," Ranney said.
The report was published online July 22 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Offering protection, or creating perilous situations?
(Image: Deborah Raven/Getty)
Packing heat may backfire. People who carry guns are far likelier to get shot – and killed – than those who are unarmed, a study of shooting victims in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has found.
It would be impractical – not to say unethical – to randomly assign volunteers to carry a gun or not and see what happens. So Charles Branas ‘s team at the University of Pennsylvania analysed 677 shootings over two-and-a-half years to discover whether victims were carrying at the time, and compared them to other Philly residents of similar age, sex and ethnicity. The team also accounted for other potentially confounding differences, such as the socioeconomic status of their neighbourhood.
Despite the US having the highest rate of firearms-related homicide in the industrialised world, the relationship between gun culture and violence is poorly understood. A recent study found that treating violence like an infectious disease led to a dramatic fall in shootings and killings.
Advertisement
Overall, Branas’s study found that people who carried guns were 4.5 times as likely to be shot and 4.2 times as likely to get killed compared with unarmed citizens. When the team looked at shootings in which victims had a chance to defend themselves, their odds of getting shot were even higher.
While it may be that the type of people who carry firearms are simply more likely to get shot, it may be that guns give a sense of empowerment that causes carriers to overreact in tense situations, or encourages them to visit neighbourhoods they probably shouldn’t, Branas speculates. Supporters of the Second Amendment shouldn’t worry that the right to bear arms is under threat, however. “We don’t have an answer as to whether guns are protective or perilous,” Branas says. “This study is a beginning.”
Daniel Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore, Maryland, thinks it is near-sighted to consider only the safety of gun owners and not their communities. “It affects others a heck of a lot more,” he says.

Alright, so I've got these search results. Let's see what they're saying.

First, there's a Quora thread about whether gun owners are statistically more likely to get shot and killed. There are a bunch of answers there, and it seems like opinions are divided. Some people are saying that owning a gun doesn't necessarily make you more likely to get shot, while others are suggesting that it does, especially considering factors like suicide and accidents.

One answer mentions that most firearm-related deaths are suicides, and since gun owners have access to guns, they might be more likely to use that method if they attempt suicide. Another point is that people who feel the need to own guns might live in areas with higher crime rates, which could also increase their risk of being shot.

Then there's a Cove Smart blog post about the pros and cons of gun ownership for home security. It talks about how guns can provide a sense of security and deterrence against intruders. However, it also points out that having a gun in the house increases the risk of unintentional shootings and firearm-related deaths, including suicides.

Another Quora answer discusses the idea that owning a gun might make you more likely to receive a bullet or kill someone. The answer argues that while owning a gun might not directly make you more likely to be shot, the way you handle the gun and your behavior with it can influence your safety.

There's also a WebMD article that suggests that having guns in the home is associated with a greater risk of family homicide. For every 10% increase in gun ownership in a home, there's a 13% increase in the odds of someone in the household being killed, according to the study mentioned in the article.

Lastly, there's a New Scientist article from 2009 that found people who carry guns are more likely to get shot and killed compared to those who don't carry guns. The study suggests that carrying a gun might create perilous situations where the carrier is more likely to be shot.

Okay, so synthesizing all this information, it seems that there are several factors to consider:

1. **Suicide Risk:** Gun owners might have a higher risk of dying by suicide because they have access to a lethal means.

2. **Accidental Shootings:** There's a risk of accidental shootings, especially if guns are not stored properly or if there are children in the home.

3. **Homicide Risk:** There's some evidence suggesting that having guns in the home may increase the risk of homicide, particularly among family members.

4. **Behavioral Factors:** People who choose to own guns might live in higher-crime areas or have other risk factors that make them more likely to be involved in violent events.

5. **Perception of Safety:** On the other hand, gun owners might feel safer and more protected, which could have psychological benefits, even if the actual statistical risk is debated.

Given all this, it's complex to definitively say whether gun owners are more likely to be shot. It depends on various factors, including how the gun is stored, the owner's training, and the circumstances in which the gun is owned.

Perhaps the most accurate answer is that owning a gun comes with both potential risks and benefits, and the overall impact on an individual's safety can vary widely based on these factors.

So, to directly answer the question: "Are gun owners more likely to be shot?" The answer is that it depends. There are increased risks associated with gun ownership, particularly regarding suicide and accidents, but there may also be protective benefits in terms of self-defense. It's essential for gun owners to be trained properly and to store their guns safely to minimize risks.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Owning a gun can increase the risk of being shot due to higher suicide rates and accidental shootings, but it may also provide protective benefits in self-defense situations. The overall impact on an individual's safety depends on various factors, including proper training and safe storage practices.}} \]

If I buy a gun, how do I get it home?
I have never had to transport a firearm I purchased. The gun store I worked at was in the middle of town, and the customers who came in to purchase a firearm were always local people who either drove their own vehicle to the store, or had a friend drive them. They would transport their newly purchased firearm home in their own vehicle, usually in the trunk. If they did not have a vehicle, they could arrange to have a friend drive them home with their firearm.

Is there any benefit to owning a gun?
Yes, if you have the knowledge to use it safely, and are willing to take the time to train with it, you have a much better chance of protecting yourself and your family in the event of a home invasion or other violent encounter. It is important to remember, however, that the best way to protect yourself is to be aware of your surroundings and to take steps to avoid dangerous situations in the first place. Guns are tools, and like any tool, they can be used for good or ill. In the hands of a responsible person, they can be a force for good.
