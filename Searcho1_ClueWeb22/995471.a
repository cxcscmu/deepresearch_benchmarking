Alright, so I need to figure out how companies become platform leaders. Hmm, first things first, I should probably understand what a platform leader is. I think a platform leader is a company that dominates in a particular industry by providing a central platform that others build upon or use. Like, think of companies such as Microsoft with Windows, or Google with Android, or Apple with its iOS ecosystem. They're not just selling a product; they're building an entire ecosystem around their platform.

But I need to be more precise. Maybe I should look up the definition of a platform leader. Let me try searching for that.

Every leader, whether leading four or four thousand, needs a platform--a set of values for which he or she is (or will become) known. As a leader, a leadership platform drives the culture of your team or department or organization; it's your internal roadmap that will guide you, and for which you'll hold yourself accountable going forward.
How do you develop your own leadership platform?
One way to begin is to ask yourself the following 3 questions:
What legacy do I want to leave?
What do I want people to say about who I am as a leader?
What do I want to be known for or associated with?
For people in positions of power, attention is currency. What you are saying with your leadership platform is,
I'm going to pay attention to this. This is what is important to me.
If you have a boss, you're telling him or her that these are the markers for which you can be held accountable. So it's important to revisit your leadership platform during your tenure in that role. It can serve as your guide and return your attention to what is important if it has strayed.
Here are a few items on my leadership platform as CEO of CHOP. In a nutshell:
Promote a safe environment by reducing events of preventable harm
Promote a culture of respect, including diversity and inclusivity in the workplace
The best ideas come from the front lines, meaning good managerial decision-making starts closest to the actual work
Commit to innovation
Hold leadership accountable, including myself.
True leaders are
deliberate
in their leadership. They are not only at the head of projects and the day-to-day business, but they're also creating the culture and making changes where change is needed.
Leaders are also talked about by employees; this is natural and to be expected. In fact, it can be a good thing, if what they're saying helps further your agenda. For example, let's say two employees are planning to bring an issue to their boss (that's you) and one of them says, "Let's not talk to her until we've done all of our homework. She's known for asking the following questions...and I know she will hold us accountable for the answers." That's your leadership platform in action!
This platform doesn't just help establish your reputation; it also enables you to be less wishy-washy as a leader because everyone, including yourself, knows where you stand. As you go forward in your role, your leadership platform becomes an effective guide and measure for your actions and the progress of your team.

You would think that a company like Intel, which in 2001 provided nearly 85% of the microprocessors for personal computers, would feel relatively secure. But companies holding the keys to popular technology don’t live in a vacuum. In many cases, they are dependent not only on economic forces in the wider world but also on the research-and-development activities of partners. David Johnson, one of the directors of the Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) in Hillsboro, Oregon, goes so far as to call that reality desperate. “We are tied to innovations by others to make our innovation valuable. If we do innovation in the processor, and Microsoft or independent software parties don’t do a corresponding innovation, our innovation will be worthless. So it really is a desperate situation for us.” 1
The Desperation of Being on Top
Although leading companies from all industries know that business in our interconnected world has become too complex for complacency, the issues are particularly clear in the information-technology industry. There, platform leaders (companies that drive industrywide innovation for an evolving system of separately developed pieces of technology) are navigating more frequent challenges from wannabes (companies that want to be platform leaders) and complementors (companies that make ancillary products that expand the platform’s market). To put their organizations in the best competitive position, managers need to master two tricks: coordinating internal units that play one or more of those roles and interacting effectively with outsiders playing those roles.
Intel and its computer on a chip, the microprocessor, illustrate the issues. In 2000, Intel had revenues of nearly $34 billion and net profits of more than $10.5 billion. Even after the economic downturn, with microprocessors still the core hardware component of the personal computer and increasingly in demand for new programmable devices, Intel should feel on top of the world.
But a microprocessor can do little or nothing useful by itself. It’s a component in a broader platform or system. Even the PC has no value without other companies’ products: operating systems, software applications, software-development tools and hardware (monitors, keyboards, storage devices, memory chips and the like). Those complementary products fueled the growth of the PC market. But Intel considers its situation desperate because it cannot be certain that its own key complementors will continue to produce market-expanding innovations as fast as Intel does.

Platform Manager Job Description
Theerapong28/iStock/GettyImages
In computer science, a platform is a piece of architecture or a framework through which software and hardware can be run from. Within a software company, there are often specialists who are fully aware of how computer platforms function and are able to fulfill a variety of different functions within the company. Some platform managers fulfill the role of computer architect, who is a type of computer software engineer, while other platform managers are responsible for fully understanding the needs of the customers when constructing computer architecture.
Identification
The computer platform is another term for the operating system, which is the overall program responsible for running all other programs on a given computer. The operating system has the ability to analyze all input that comes into the computer and is able to send output to all output devices and store data on the hardware. For instance, when a computer user types on the keyboard with a word processor running, pressing the “r” key tells the operating system to read the scripts found in the word processing software. The script will tell the operating system to send a message to both the monitor and the portion of the storage device responsible for storing the data indicating that you typed the letter “r.” The monitor is told to create an image of an “r” on your monitor. Platform managers are responsible for the development of platforms such as this for a large variety of devices, from computer to cell phones to video game consoles.
Function
Platform managers are responsible for overseeing the development of the platform that is used by those working for the computer company and/or the platform of customers who do business with the computer company. Some platform managers focus on improving the overall performance of computer systems, while other platform managers focus on developing platforms upon which computer programs will run. All of this development must be done with the company budget and customer needs kept in mind, according to Education-Portal. At Yahoo!, the platform manager acts as a liaison between the platform development team and Yahoo!’s customers. These managers are responsible for answering customer questions and also explaining customer concerns to the project development team so that the platforms can be developed to better serve customers.

Skills
Computer science and computer engineering degrees are available for those who are interested in pursuing a career as a platform manager, according to Education-Portal. In addition to this educational background, platform managers need interpersonal skills in order to communicate effectively with staff and might also need to engage in customer service.
Prospects
The computer software engineer industry is growing rapidly. Between 2018 and 2028, the need for computer software engineers is expected to grow by 25 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New software continues to be developed as software engineers upgrade software and develop new uses for computer software.
Earnings
In 2020, the median earnings for computer software engineers were $110,140, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The highest 10 percent earned more than $170,100, while the lowest 10 percent earned less than $65,210.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that "platform leader" isn't a term that's directly defined in any of the documents I've found. However, I can piece together what it might mean based on the context provided.

In Doc 1 from HuffPost, it talks about a "leadership platform," which seems different from what I'm looking for. It's more about a leader's values and principles. Not quite what I need here.

Doc 2 from MIT Sloan Management Review is more promising. It mentions "platform leaders" specifically in the context of the tech industry, using Intel as an example. It describes platform leaders as companies that drive industry-wide innovation for an evolving system of separately developed technology components. So, these are companies that set the foundation or the main technology upon which others build their products or services.

Doc 3 from The Free Dictionary gives a general definition of "platform" across various fields, including computing, where it refers to the basic technology of a computer system's hardware and software that defines how a computer is operated and determines what other kinds of software can be used. This aligns with the concept in Doc 2.

Doc 4 seems to be about a "platform manager" in a software company, who oversees the development of platforms that run software and hardware. Again, this ties back to the idea of platforms as foundational technologies.

Doc 5 from Merriam-Webster defines "platformer" as a planner or deviser of a political platform or a platform speaker. This seems unrelated to what I'm seeking.

So, synthesizing from Doc 2 and Doc 3, a platform leader appears to be a company that creates and maintains a key technological platform that others build upon, thereby influencing or driving the entire ecosystem's innovation.

Now, the question is, how do companies become platform leaders? Based on the MIT article, it seems that platform leaders need to coordinate both internally and externally. Internally, they need to manage different units that may play various roles within the platform ecosystem. Externally, they need to interact effectively with complementors—other companies that make products or services that enhance the platform.

The article also mentions that platform leaders are dependent on innovations from complementors to make their own innovations valuable. This suggests that building a robust ecosystem around the platform is crucial for a company to become and remain a platform leader.

Moreover, the fact that Intel is mentioned as a platform leader in the context of microprocessors, which are central components in computers, indicates that being at the heart of a technology stack is important. So, companies that provide essential, foundational technologies may have a better chance of becoming platform leaders.

Additionally, the ability to evolve and adapt the platform over time, keeping up with technological advancements and market demands, is likely crucial. Platform leaders need to continuously innovate to stay relevant and attract developers and users to their ecosystem.

It might also be important for platform leaders to set standards and encourage compatibility within their ecosystem. This could involve developing open APIs, fostering developer communities, and ensuring that different components work well together.

Furthermore, marketing and branding play a role. A strong brand can attract more developers and users to a platform, making it more attractive for others to build upon.

Lastly, strategic partnerships and alliances can help a company become a platform leader. By collaborating with key players in the industry, a company can expand its reach and influence.

To summarize, becoming a platform leader likely involves several key factors:

1. Providing a essential, foundational technology.

2. Building and maintaining a robust ecosystem of complementors.

3. Continuous innovation to stay relevant.

4. Encouraging compatibility and standards within the ecosystem.

5. Strong marketing and branding.

6. Strategic partnerships and alliances.

I should probably look for more specific examples and case studies to understand this better. Maybe I should search for companies that have successfully become platform leaders and see what strategies they employed.

Let me consider some well-known platform leaders:

- Microsoft with Windows

- Google with Android and Google Services

- Apple with iOS and Mac OS

- Amazon with AWS

- Facebook with its social media platforms

Each of these companies has built a platform that others build upon, creating a network effect that reinforces their leadership position.

Looking at Microsoft's Windows, for example, they established a dominant position in personal computer operating systems. They attracted a wide range of software developers to create applications for Windows, making it the go-to platform for consumers and businesses alike.

Similarly, Apple's iOS has become a leading platform for mobile apps, attracting developers worldwide to create innovative applications for iPhone and iPad users.

Amazon's AWS provides a cloud computing platform that numerous businesses rely on for their IT infrastructure, making Amazon a leader in the cloud services sector.

From these examples, it seems that platform leaders achieve their position by creating valuable platforms that solve real problems or meet real needs, and then fostering a vibrant ecosystem around those platforms.

Perhaps I should look into the strategies these companies used to become platform leaders. Maybe there are common patterns or best practices that can be applied generally.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for academic research or business literature on platform leadership to get a more structured understanding.

Let me consider conducting another search to find more specific information on how companies become platform leaders.

In recent years, many high-technology industries, ranging from “smart” cell phones to social networking Web sites such as Facebook Inc. and MySpace.com, have become platform battlegrounds. These markets require distinctive competitive strategies because the products are parts of systems that combine core components made by one company with complements usually made by a variety of companies. If a platform leader emerges and works with the companies supplying complementary products and services, they can together form an “ecosystem” of innovation that can greatly increase the value of their innovations as more users adopt the platform and its complements. However, companies often fail to turn their products into industry platforms.
Our previous research focused on understanding the levers or strategic mechanisms that existing platform leaders use to maintain their positions. (See “About the Research,”) This article focuses on the special problems of companies that want to become platform leaders — “platform-leader wannabes.” Many companies do not succeed in becoming platform leaders because their strategies fail to tackle adequately both the technology and business aspects of platform leadership. The technological challenges involve designing the right architecture, designing the right interfaces/connectors and disclosing intellectual property selectively, in order to facilitate third-parties’ provision of complements. The business challenges include either making key complements or introducing incentives for third-party companies to create the complementary innovations necessary to build market momentum and defeat competing platforms.
About the Research
Over the past decade, we have investigated dozens of companies that have attempted to formulate and implement platform strategies. These companies operated in a variety of industries including computing, telecommunications, electronic appliances, semiconductors, enterprise software, data storage, automobiles, Web portals and electronic payment systems. The major companies we studied in the first phase of our research included Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Palm, and NTT DoCoMo, the Tokyo-based mobile communications company. We interviewed hundreds of managers and engineers and complemented the interviews with analysis of companies’ archival records and company and industry data. This first research stage aimed at uncovering the drivers of success at established platform leaders. The results of that work were published in MIT Sloan Management Review in 2002, as well as in our book Platform Leadership (HBS Press, 2002).

You would think that a company like Intel, which in 2001 provided nearly 85% of the microprocessors for personal computers, would feel relatively secure. But companies holding the keys to popular technology don’t live in a vacuum. In many cases, they are dependent not only on economic forces in the wider world but also on the research-and-development activities of partners. David Johnson, one of the directors of the Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) in Hillsboro, Oregon, goes so far as to call that reality desperate. “We are tied to innovations by others to make our innovation valuable. If we do innovation in the processor, and Microsoft or independent software parties don’t do a corresponding innovation, our innovation will be worthless. So it really is a desperate situation for us.” 1
The Desperation of Being on Top
Although leading companies from all industries know that business in our interconnected world has become too complex for complacency, the issues are particularly clear in the information-technology industry. There, platform leaders (companies that drive industrywide innovation for an evolving system of separately developed pieces of technology) are navigating more frequent challenges from wannabes (companies that want to be platform leaders) and complementors (companies that make ancillary products that expand the platform’s market). To put their organizations in the best competitive position, managers need to master two tricks: coordinating internal units that play one or more of those roles and interacting effectively with outsiders playing those roles.
Intel and its computer on a chip, the microprocessor, illustrate the issues. In 2000, Intel had revenues of nearly $34 billion and net profits of more than $10.5 billion. Even after the economic downturn, with microprocessors still the core hardware component of the personal computer and increasingly in demand for new programmable devices, Intel should feel on top of the world.
But a microprocessor can do little or nothing useful by itself. It’s a component in a broader platform or system. Even the PC has no value without other companies’ products: operating systems, software applications, software-development tools and hardware (monitors, keyboards, storage devices, memory chips and the like). Those complementary products fueled the growth of the PC market. But Intel considers its situation desperate because it cannot be certain that its own key complementors will continue to produce market-expanding innovations as fast as Intel does.

Based on lessons from successful high-technology platform leaders, this book explains the dynamics of these highly complex and interconnected processes and partnerships. It provides a study of how companies successfully become platform leaders - companies whose products provide the basic technological architecture on which other products and systems are built (such as the microprocessor and Windows Operating System). The authors discuss how platform producers encourage other firms to create complimentary innovations, orchestrate innovations and standards for an entire industry and deal with various internal and external tensions or conflicts that arise when implementing platform-leadership strategies.

Amazon.com Review
Certain products, like the VCR and the microprocessor, are far more valuable as the center of a network of ancillary items than they ever could become on their own. Platform Leadership, by Annabelle Gawer and Michael A. Cusumano, examines how a handful of firms has maximized this position--or are attempting to do so--and proposes a framework that other businesses can use to establish similar game plans. Combining original research with analysis that draws upon their experiences as professors specializing in high-tech strategy, Gawer and Cusumano focus on Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Palm, NTT DoCoMo, and supporters of the Linux operating system to show how to establish and expand this vital hub positioning. Their four-pronged approach concentrates on scope (what firms produce on their own and encourage others to produce), technology (how much detail about product architecture and design they should disclose to outsiders), alliances (how collaborative or competitive their relationships with those outsiders should be), and organization (what structures best balance subsequent external and internal conflicts). The examples selected illustrate varying methods for walking the fine line required to achieve "platform leadership" and will provide food for thought along with practical guidance for others interested in attaining similar status. --Howard Rothman

Platform Company - Understand How Platform Companies Work
Platform Company
Home › Resources › Knowledge › Deals & Transactions › Platform Company
What is a Platform Company?
A platform company refers to the initial acquisition made by a Private Equity Group in a specific industry or marketplace. The acquisition acts as the starting point for other acquisitions in the same industry. Platform companies create value by facilitating exchanges between consumers and producers of goods or services. For the exchanges to happen, the platform company creates large networks of users and resources that can be accessed on demand.
A private equity group may create up to six platforms for each fund, and they are grown organically before bolt-on acquisitions are added to each of the platform companies.
Characteristics of a platform company
Generally, a platform company comes with the following characteristics:
Strong and experienced management
A platform company must employ a strong and experienced management team that can steer the company forward. Private equity firms look for executives with a proven track record in a specific industry and who possess the ability to direct the operations of the company effectively. Some of the management team members may be retired executives of large companies who sit on the board and act as advisors on issues such as regulation, expansion, and acquisitions.
The top player in its industry
Private equity groups prefer investing in platform companies that are top players in their specific niche markets. Most often, these companies employ innovative systems that give them an advantage over their competitors, which helps them maintain top performance in the industry. After the purchase of such companies, the private equity group finds complementary add-on acquisitions that can make the company more profitable and dominant in the industry.
Well defined systems
When a private equity firm is looking to acquire a platform company, it analyzes the potential companies against predetermined investment criteria. Typically, the investment criteria may comprise geographical location, EBITDA, industry, positive cash flows, and potential for growth. The identified companies must have well-defined systems that match the acquirer’s investment criteria.
How platform companies work
Platform companies function by creating value for their users. The success of the value creation process determines if the company will succeed in turning potential connections into transactions. Once the users have joined the system, the platform matches them together in a way that is beneficial to both parties.
The platform must establish the rules that govern how users relate and interact with each other. The users require tools and services to facilitate the transaction and ensure both parties are treated fairly. If the users are satisfied with the process, they will use the platform over and over again to generate and exchange value.
What a platform company is not
The term “platform” is commonly used to describe technology or pieces of software that are synonymous with websites and mobile apps. However, these technologies do not have the characteristics of a platform company that creates value by allowing exchanges between consumers and producers.
Instead, non-platform companies are linear business models because they follow the typical linear supply chain. The operations of these businesses involve creating value in the form of products and services that are then sold to customers in the lower classes of the supply chain. Linear enterprises have a different cost structure and economics from platform companies.
Types of platform companies
Platform company models are categorized based on the value that is exchanged as part of the company’s core operations. The following are the main types of platform companies:
Payment platform
Payment platform companies offer peer-to-peer (P2P) or business to consumer (B2C) payment services. They use online technologies that allow consumers to transfer funds from their account to other individuals’ accounts through the internet. Consumers can also use these platforms to receive payments from abroad, as well as to pay for goods and services.
Social networks
Social networks allow friendly interactions between friends, colleagues, workmates, etc. Users are allowed to register on these platforms so that they can be allowed to interact with other users who are also registered on the platforms. Apart from friendly interactions, users also share rich media content like videos and photos on the site.
Product marketplace
Product marketplaces allow sellers and buyers to exchange physical products through the platform. The involved parties also make and receive payments through the platform. It allows buyers and sellers from different geographical locations to transact without requiring face-to-face interaction.
Service marketplace
Service marketplaces operate in the same way as a product marketplace, except that they involve the exchange of services between sellers and buyers. They allow consultants to offer their services to buyers without geographical limitations. Some of the services provided on these platforms include legal services, architectural designs, bookkeeping and taxation, interior design, graphic design, academic research, etc.
Social gaming platform
Social gaming platforms allow participants to participate in online gaming interactions. They allow two or more users to engage in common games concurrently.
Elements of a platform company
The following are the elements of a successful platform:
Matchmaker
Platforms serve as matchmakers in marketplaces by facilitating connections between consumers and producers. The matchmakers collect relevant data about the participants and use it to enhance the connection between the interacting parties. For example, Amazon collects data about buyer purchasing behavior to facilitate the relationships between sellers and buyers on its platform.
Infrastructure
A platform company must provide an infrastructure that supports interactions between participants. The infrastructure includes storage for products, hosting online videos, libraries, etc. For example, Apple Inc. allows its developers to use its operating system and code libraries to enable them to develop apps that consumers will love and buy. The infrastructure is vital in ensuring smooth interactions between producers and consumers.
The magnet
When designing a platform, promoters must create an environment that attracts participants to the platform. This requires developing attractive incentives, pricing models, reputation, quick payment solutions, etc. For example, for sellers to be attracted to the eBay business model, the system must be efficient to allow smooth transactions. Similarly, buyers want to transact on a platform with a good reputation, fair pricing, and an efficient purchasing process.

Corporate Venturing
Corporate VenturingCorporate venturing (also known as corporate venture capital) is the practice of directly investing corporate funds into external startup companies. This is usually done by large companies who wish to invest small but innovative startup firms. They do so through joint venture agreements and acquisition of equity stakes.
Mezzanine Fund
Mezzanine FundA mezzanine fund is a pool of capital which invests in mezzanine finance for acquisitions, growth, recapitalization, or management/leveraged buyouts. In the capital structure of a company, mezzanine finance is a hybrid between equity and debt. Mezzanine financing most commonly takes the form of preferred stock or subordinated and unsecured debt.

Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation - Do You Have Platform Leadership?
6/24/2002
Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco roared to success by encouraging other companies to use their products as "platforms," spurring industry innovation and customer excitement along the way. Now platform wannabes including Palm, NTT, DoCoMo, and Linux are charging into the market. A new book, Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation, offers a framework that managers can use to design a strategy of platform leadership. PLUS: Q&A with Annabelle Gawer.
by Annabelle Gawer and Michael A. Cusumano
Modularity and industry evolution
At the birth of many industries, a few firms develop all or almost all the components necessary to make the products. As industries evolve, what generally happens is that specialized firms emerge to develop certain components of the larger puzzle. An increasing number of industries today consist of different firms that each develop one component of a big jigsaw puzzle. Economists refer to these industries as "de-integrated." This evolution has happened in the computer industry, where companies like vertically integrated IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) have left center stage for a specialist, hardware component maker, Intel, and a specialist, software component maker, Microsoft—and the plethora of complementary developers around them.
The reasons industries evolve this way are widely discussed, but a central tenet of many theories is the concept of modularity. A module is a unit whose structural elements are powerfully connected to each other and relatively weakly connected to elements in other units. Clearly there are degrees of connection, thus there are gradations of modularity. Many industries of complex products have evolved toward a more modular architecture, including the computer, telecom, and automotive industries. Consequences of modular designs reach far beyond the purely technical characteristics of the products, for example, the physical shape of the product or its internal structure. 4 Design decisions affect the organization of production, and modular designs provide the means for people to divide up the work in tasks or groups of tasks that are relatively independent of each other. Modularity in product design has a powerful impact on innovation: Innovation can happen on modules of the product without having to impact (and thus threaten the integrity of) the overall system.
In addition to modular designs, the vast improvement in tools of communication is another factor accelerating the pace of innovation. The development of the Internet, for example, has reduced tremendously the difficulties of coordinating work on discrete modules or components across distant locations and fostered collaboration on new products.
Another aspect of modern industry is the ubiquity of software. Organizations and individuals have used software tools in a pervasive manner to achieve improvements on products and processes. Software expertise—fueled by developments in computer higher education and the ubiquity of cheap PCs—has also reached unprecedented levels and availability. The combination of these factors leads to the fact that technological innovation—once restricted to the labs of rich and powerful companies—has never been so prevalent and widely distributed. Barriers to innovation are at a historical low.
The ability for an increased number of actors to innovate separately on different modules of systems is radically altering the nature and stability of relationships between the firms that make core products and the developers of complementary products. This book analyzes the strategies that executives at Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Palm, NTT DoCoMo, and supporters of the Linux operating system, have developed for facing these challenges. Their strategies differ in many respects, but they also share many similarities. Each group, in their own way, follows an approach that we have called platform leadership.
Platform leadership
Platform leadership refers to the common objective sought by the companies we talked to: to drive innovation in their industry. The increased breadth of innovation described earlier creates the necessity for either one firm or a group of firms to ensure over time the integrity of an evolving platform. It also creates strategic opportunities to channel the direction of innovation on complementary modules or products. Ensuring the integrity of the platform and driving its evolution become strategic imperatives in industries where distributed innovation constantly challenges established relationships of power between suppliers of complementary products.
More and more firms want their products to become the foundation on which other companies build their products or offer their services; that is, they want to become platform leaders. A platform leader can benefit from—but is also highly dependent on—innovations developed at other firms. Platform leaders might rest easier if they had the resources to create the core components and all possible complementary products themselves for every market around the world. But this is impossible. No single company can replicate all the innovative capabilities of a market, especially at a time when tools and knowledge necessary to innovate are more widespread than ever. As a result, nearly all the platform leaders we observed have had to work closely with other firms to create initial applications and then new generations of complementary products. Platform leaders and complementary innovators have great incentives to cooperate, however, because their combined efforts can increase the potential size of the pie for everyone.
From the perspective of the platform leader, complements are both a curse and a blessing. They can be a curse when a firm that depends on complements developed externally fails to get them created in a timely manner or at a high enough level of quality or volume. On the other hand, complements can draw new customers in, inducing them to buy the core product. For Microsoft, whose core product is the Windows operating system, a large number and variety of complementary Windows-compatible software applications are a blessing because it encourages potential customers to buy Windows-based computers. Likewise, having a large number and variety of movies on VHS-compatible videocassettes available in video stores pushed the sales of VHS recorders. The availability of a large number of complementary products adds value to the core product. Innovation on complementary products, therefore, constitutes a great opportunity.
In short, in industries that center around platform products, the value of a platform increases when there are more complements. The more people who use these complements, the more incentives there are for complementary producers to introduce more complementary products, which then stimulate more people to buy or use the core product, stimulating more innovation, and so on. It is, therefore, in the interest of a platform leader to stimulate and channel innovation on complementary products.
The game is risky, though, because platform producers may fail to get other firms to cooperate and innovate, and this failure can lead to greatly reduced sales for everyone tied to the same platform. Since platforms are made of components that interact following standard interfaces, standard wars are necessarily part of platform strategies. Examples include Sony and the Betamax standard, which failed to dominate the VCR market, and the Apple Macintosh line of PCs, which has found some resurgence in recent years but has not unseated Windows machines as the mass-market standard. DEC's Alpha microprocessor failed to garner much of a following, mainly because of a lack of software applications. Informix has found a niche in the corporate database software market, but lost out to Oracle and Microsoft as the industry standard. QUALCOMM is in the midst of a global struggle with companies such as Nokia, Ericsson, AT&T, and Motorola to establish its technology as the international standard for next-generation wireless cell phones.
The Navigator browser, which fit into a platform and once had a market share of around 90 percent, declined sharply in popularity as a result of Netscape's inability to keep it as the industry standard. 5 Microsoft's Pocket PC operating system may suffer a similar fate at the hands of Palm or other competitors if Microsoft cannot persuade more companies to adopt their system for their handheld computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular telephones, or cable TV set-top boxes.
More and more firms want their products to become the foundation on which other companies build their products or offer their services.

In other words, it is quite possible to fail to become a platform leader and to mismanage the process of stimulating and channeling complementary innovation. The result is an inability to exploit the dynamics of markets driven by the economic forces we have described. Of course, there are no guarantees of success in high-tech markets, where change can be quick and brutal. The VHS platform for the VCR and what has been called the "Windows-Intel" platform for the PC are now standards, but their originators did not win their markets easily or by accidents. 6 Managers and engineers at Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Palm, and other successful platform leaders, as well as platform leader "wannabes" must work hard to establish, maintain, and grow their dominant positions.
Framework: four levers of platform leadership
Based on the companies we studied, we developed a framework that managers can use to design a strategy for platform leadership or make their existing strategy more effective. This framework—which we call the Four Levers of Platform Leadership—allows platform leaders or wannabes to design and test the validity of their strategy, given the circumstances of their industry and the competences of their corporation. Here is an outline of the four levers:
Scope of the firm: This lever deals with what the firm does inside and what it encourages others to do outside. Is it better for firms to develop an extensive in-house capability to create their own complements or to let the market produce complements? Is there a "happy medium" between these two extremes? If so, when is that the best approach?
Product technology (architecture, interfaces, intellectual property): This lever deals with decisions that platform leaders and wannabes need to make with regard to the architecture of their product and the broader platform, if the two are not the same. In particular, they need to make decisions about the degree of modularity, the degree of openness of the interfaces to the platform, and how much information about the platform and its interfaces to disclose to outside firms—potential complementors who may also become competitors. 7
Relationships with external complementors: This lever centers on determining how collaborative versus competitive should the relationship be between the platform leader or wannabe and the complementors. Platform leaders and wannabes also need to worry about how to achieve consensus with their partners, and how to deal with potential conflicts of interest, such as when the platform leader decides to enter complementary markets directly and turns former partners into competitors.
Internal organization: This lever allows platform leaders and wannabes to use their internal organizational structure to manage external and internal conflicts of interest more effectively. Options include keeping groups with similar goals under one executive, or separating groups into distinct departments in order to address potentially conflicting goals with outside constituencies. The issue of culture and process comes in here: We found that since innovative, modular industries are often ambiguous environments, where a complementor today can become a competitor tomorrow, an internal atmosphere that encourages debate (or at least tolerates ambiguity) accelerates the strategy reformulations that are sometimes necessary. At the same time, efficient internal communication of corporate strategy, once a decision has been made at the top, facilitates the implementation of strategic reorientations.
We believe that each of these levers is critical for achieving or sustaining platform leadership. The Four Levers cover both strategy formulation and implementation issues, which are intertwined. The levers are distinct but closely related; therefore, platform leaders or wannabes need to make choices on these dimensions in a coherent fashion.
The decision of what complements to make inside and what to leave to external firms is probably the single most important issue that platform leaders and wannabes have to decide—and keep deciding. It is not a onetime event because firms innovate continuously on their products and add new functionalities that may well have been performed previously by external firms. This decision encompasses choosing appropriate levels of investment in venture capital activities or acquisitions aimed at evolving the platform or helping the complements business.
Decisions on the architecture or design of the product and on how to treat intellectual property (i.e., whether to keep product interface specifications "open" or closed"), tend to have a major impact on the incentives and ability of external firms to innovate on complements. And deciding how to treat external firms is, of course, related to the scope of the firm because it requires a decision on whether to compete or to collaborate.
We shall also see that platform leaders and wannabes need to be mindful of the consequences of encroaching on the territory of developers of complements. There is a strategic trade-off between systematically entering any complementary market that seems to hold the promise of profit and maintaining goodwill and collaborative relationships with developers of complements. While some companies invest a lot of effort in building a strong reputation for not encroaching on complementors' turf, others are less careful where they trample. We shall explain the external circumstances that can justify these different behaviors and clarify the risks involved with these two approaches.
We shall also see that platform leaders or wannabes need to establish an internal organization that supports their objectives. In particular, when the objective is to maintain collaborative relationships with complementors, certain organizational design decisions—such as whether to keep particular groups under one executive or to separate groups into distinct departments—impact the ability of a platform leader to convince third parties that it will not recklessly infringe on their turf. Distinct departments reduce the fears that third parties might have to invest in complementary products and new technologies.
The important point here is that platform leaders usually need to perform a delicate balancing act between competing and collaborating with complements producers, whose products are necessary to create demand for the platform. The firms we studied relied on various means to influence outside firms, ranging from specific technical choices and organizational decisions to initiatives to enhance their external relationships and reputations.

Q&A: Building a Platform Company
Annabelle Gawer
Platform leaders, says author Annabelle Gawer, are companies such as Intel that convince other companies to build products and services using Intel's own products as the core. Think "Intel Inside". The co-author of Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation discusses the characteristics of successful platform companies with HBS Working Knowledge editor Sean Silverthorne.
Silverthorne: For a platform company, what are the key characteristics to look for in recruiting coalition partners?
Gawer: Firms that have power to influence their industry. That is, the big players in making products complimentary to yours, such as connecting devices or products or services. Furthermore, it's important to carefully approach the company whose disapproval or disengagement might be fatal to the coalition.  Last, it is important to ensure that these firms have the resources, human and technical, to keep the collaboration going for a long time.
Q: Platform leaders become leaders through artful building of alliances and coalitions of shared interest. Yet Microsoft is often seen by the industry it competes in as a difficult partner at best and a predatory one at worst. So how did Microsoft become a platform leader--and can it sustain that advantage?
A: Great question. Let's remember that Microsoft got its initial advantage by obtaining from IBM the right to place its MS-DOS inside every IBM-compatible PC in the world. Microsoft's initial power therefore came from the sheer number of PCs being loaded with MS-DOS. That market share advantage had lasting power because Microsoft did not stop, but continuously redesigned its own piece of the larger system to make sure it continued to provide essential features. By doing so, Microsoft did not allow any new entrant to capture the initial position it has acquired. As such, Microsoft acted as a platform leader by continuously innovating on its own piece to keep it essential.
Now, regarding Microsoft's controversial behavior vis-Ã -vis complementors. The reasons Microsoft can "get away with" what is seen in the industry as non-collaborative behavior are varied, but there are several points to make.
One, despite this "non-collaborative" behavior, Microsoft is investing huge amounts of money to ensure a continued supply of complimentary products, in the form of Windows-compatible applications. It continuously puts on training seminars with software developers worldwide, shares with them software developer kits, publishes application programming interfaces—all activities that are collaborative in the sense that they share information with developers of compliments.
The problem is not so much the lack of collaboration as it is the uni-directionality; it is always Microsoft who influences the direction and can impose its terms on these collaborations. The simple fact of a lack of a powerful competitor to Microsoft's Windows operating system offers very few alternative options for developers of applications--they simply have very few other choices of partners.

Q: Which companies are best poised to become tomorrow's platform leaders?
A: It is very unclear at this point. The game of platforms is being played as we speak, coalitions are forming today. The landscape of tomorrow's platform leader is still in the making and things could go in several directions.
Q: If you were recruiting a top executive for a platform company, what traits would you favor? Would they be the same traits you'd look for to lead a non-platform company?
A: External market savvy: Someone who understands the dynamics of platforms and the specifics of these markets. Wisdom about the mechanics of his or her own firm.  Internally, understanding the value of debate and sometimes conflicting objectives. Someone that can tolerate and operate in ambiguous environments. Someone who is able to reformulate strategy on the fly, and can manage the task of reconfiguring the game of alliances over time. Being able to manage relationships that evolve is the key skill.
Q: When is it wise to not turn your product into a platform? I'm thinking of Steve Jobs when he returned to Apple and decided to keep the Mac operating system closed, so Apple could control the innovation and look-and-feel around the product. Was that a smart decision?
A: Jobs' decision turned out, in hindsight, not to be the right one. But that is easy to say in hindsight. Things could have turned out differently. For example, if Apple had been able to successfully complete its ambitious operating systems on time, and had they been able to provide a significantly superior computer, the closed system approach would have been the best. However, Apple failed to do this. Open systems are best for tapping into the innovative capabilities of the external market. If a company has the unique competencies to be able to innovate not only on a core product, but also on complementary products better than the companies around it—then it might be better to use a closed system.
It also depends on the nature of the product. PCs are versatile multi-usage products that can be used in a variety of contexts. And computer users operate in a variety of industries. It is unlikely that in such a usage environment a single company would have the best capabilities at innovating in all these directions at once. A modular and therefore open approach allows the task of innovation to be subdivided and allocated across different firms.
Q: What comes next in understanding how platform strategies evolve?
A: We know a lot about competition between individual companies. What platform leaders demonstrate is that there is a clear gain to orchestrate industry innovation within coalitions. The next question is how can we better understand the nature of competition between these coalitions? This new kind of competition is still poorly understood—but that will be the nature of the game for the years to come. A fascinating area to explore.
Q: What project or research are you working on now?
A: I am working on a theoretical paper with professor Rebecca Henderson from MIT that looks at the impact on innovation in complementary markets when one monopolist competes with its complementors. Also, the book has generated an enormous amount of interest from companies around the world who have contacted me for seminars and advice.

Okay, so from Doc 1, it seems like platform leadership is about how companies drive innovation in their industry by setting the foundation or platform upon which others build their products or services. Doc 2 and Doc 3 provide more detailed insights into this concept, using examples like Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco.

From these sources, it's clear that platform leaders are companies that create a core technology or system that others build upon, thus influencing the entire ecosystem's innovation. They depend on complementors—other companies that create products or services that enhance the platform—to make their own innovations valuable.

So, how do companies become platform leaders? Based on the MIT articles and the book by Gawer and Cusumano, several key strategies and considerations come into play:

1. **Providing Essential Technology:** Being at the heart of a technology stack is crucial. Companies that provide fundamental technologies that others need to build upon have a better chance of becoming platform leaders.

2. **Building a Robust Ecosystem:** Attracting and nurturing a community of developers and businesses that create complementary products and services is essential. This ecosystem increases the value of the platform and creates a network effect.

3. **Continuous Innovation:** Platform leaders need to continuously innovate to stay relevant and attract developers and users to their platform. This involves updating the platform, adding new features, and ensuring compatibility with emerging technologies.

4. **Encouraging Compatibility and Standards:** Setting standards and ensuring compatibility within the ecosystem is vital. This can involve developing open APIs, fostering developer communities, and ensuring that different components work well together.

5. **Marketing and Branding:** A strong brand can attract more developers and users to a platform, making it more attractive for others to build upon.

6. **Strategic Partnerships and Alliances:** Collaborating with key players in the industry can help expand reach and influence. These partnerships can also help in shaping industry standards and norms.

7. **Managing Internal and External Relationships:** Platform leaders need to manage both internal units and external partners effectively. This includes coordinating different internal teams that play various roles within the platform ecosystem and maintaining productive relationships with complementors.

8. **Balancing Collaboration and Competition:** Platform leaders often walk a fine line between collaborating with complementors and competing with them. Finding the right balance is crucial to maintain a healthy ecosystem.

9. **Intellectual Property Management:** Deciding what parts of the platform to keep proprietary and what to open up is a strategic decision. It affects the level of innovation from external developers and the platform's competitiveness.

10. **Organizational Structure:** The internal organization should support the platform leadership strategy. This might involve structuring departments in a way that aligns with external collaboration needs and manages potential conflicts of interest.

Looking back at the examples provided, companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook have successfully become platform leaders by implementing many of these strategies. They have created valuable platforms, fostered large ecosystems of developers and users, and continuously innovated to stay ahead in their respective fields.

However, becoming a platform leader is not without challenges. Companies need to navigate complex relationships with complementors, manage the tension between collaboration and competition, and adapt to rapid technological changes and market dynamics.

In conclusion, to become a platform leader, a company needs to provide essential technology, build a robust ecosystem of complementors, continuously innovate, encourage compatibility and standards, invest in marketing and branding, form strategic partnerships, and manage both internal and external relationships effectively. Balancing these elements is key to establishing and maintaining platform leadership.
