As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and perspectives on the topic of whether parents should limit screen time for teenagers.

Firstly, it's important to understand what is meant by "screen time." Screen time typically refers to the amount of time spent using electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs. These devices are integral to modern life, serving educational, communicative, and entertainment purposes.

Many experts suggest that excessive screen time can have negative effects on teenagers' physical and mental health. For instance, too much screen time has been linked to obesity, poor sleep quality, and increased risk of depression and anxiety. Moreover, excessive use of screens can interfere with academic performance and social skills development.

On the other hand, screens are also powerful tools for learning and connecting with others. Teenagers use them to do homework, stay informed about current events, and maintain relationships with friends and family, especially those who live far away.

Therefore, it's not necessarily about whether parents should limit screen time, but rather how they can guide their teenagers to use screens in a healthy and balanced way. This might involve setting boundaries around screen use, encouraging a variety of activities beyond screens, and modeling healthy screen habits themselves.

In conclusion, while it's essential for parents to be mindful of their teenagers' screen time and set appropriate limits, it's also crucial to recognize the benefits that screens can provide when used thoughtfully.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Parents should set reasonable limits on screen time for teens to promote a healthy balance between digital activities and other aspects of life.}} \]
