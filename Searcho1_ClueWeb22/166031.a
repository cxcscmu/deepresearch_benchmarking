Alright, so I need to figure out why energy prices are high. This seems like a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First off, I should probably understand what factors influence energy prices in general.

I know that energy comes in different forms, like oil, gas, electricity, and renewable sources. Maybe the prices for each of these are influenced by different things. But for now, since the question is general, I'll consider energy prices overall.

One thing that comes to mind is supply and demand. Basic economics tells us that when demand goes up or supply goes down, prices tend to increase. So, perhaps there's been an increase in global demand for energy, or maybe there are constraints in supply.

Let me think about demand first. Population growth and economic development usually lead to higher energy consumption. More people mean more homes to heat or cool, more appliances to power, and more transportation needs. Similarly, industrial activity requires a lot of energy. So, if the global economy is growing, energy demand probably increases as well.

On the supply side, energy production might not be keeping up with this demand. Extracting and producing energy, especially fossil fuels, can be limited by geological factors, production capacities, and investment in new resources. For example, oil production might be constrained by the availability of new oil fields or the rate at which existing fields can be exploited.

Another factor could be geopolitical tensions. Many countries rely on imports for their energy needs, and disruptions in supply chains due to political instability or conflicts can drive up prices. For instance, if a major oil-producing region experiences unrest, it can affect global oil supplies and thus prices.

Environmental regulations and the push towards renewable energy might also play a role. As governments implement policies to reduce carbon emissions, there could be costs associated with transitioning to cleaner energy sources, which might get passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Moreover, infrastructure constraints can be an issue. If the energy distribution network isn't efficient or needs upgrading, that can add to the overall cost.

I should also consider the role of speculation and market dynamics. Energy commodities are traded on financial markets, and speculative activities can sometimes lead to price volatility.

Given all these potential factors, I need to see which ones are currently contributing to high energy prices. Maybe some factors are more significant than others at this particular time.

Perhaps I should look into recent events and trends in the energy sector. Maybe there have been specific incidents or changes in policy that have impacted supply or demand recently.

Wait, I remember hearing about issues in the natural gas market. Last winter, there were shortages in some parts of the world, leading to higher prices. So, natural gas could be a big contributor to overall energy price increases.

Also, the transition to renewable energy might be affecting prices. While renewables themselves are becoming cheaper, the integration of variable energy sources into the grid can pose challenges, possibly leading to higher balancing costs.

Furthermore, after the pandemic, there was a surge in demand as economies reopened, but supply might not have adjusted quickly enough, leading to price hikes.

I should also consider the role of inflation. If general prices are rising across the economy, energy prices might be increasing in tandem.

Maybe I need to look at specific regions or countries to see if the situation varies. For example, in Europe, dependency on Russian gas has been a sensitive issue, and any disturbances in that supply could affect prices.

Similarly, in the United States, decisions about domestic oil and gas production, as well as investments in renewable energy, could influence energy prices.

Perhaps I should check some recent news or reports on energy prices to get a better understanding of current trends and causes.

Let me try to search for some information.

Compared to this time last year, we're all paying a lot more to use many kinds energy — whether it's gasoline for our cars or heating fuel for our homes.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Compared to this time last year, we're all paying a lot more to use all sorts of energy right now, whether it is gas for our cars or heating fuel for our homes. That is part of a global trend.
And NPR's Camila Domonoske is here to explain why. Hey, Camila.
CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.
KELLY: So I'm struck by - I mean, this is something that affects all of us. You know, crude oil, prices per barrel - that can be hard to get your head around. But your heating bill is right there, staring at you from the kitchen table. How are things looking?
DOMONOSKE: Yeah. Overall, prices are up, like you said. It's not the worst-case scenario that people were bracing for just a few months ago, and it's not nearly as bad as the crisis that Europe has been seeing, but, yeah, compared to last year, if you look at gas prices, you're up about 40%. Natural gas prices are up more than 60%. And natural gas, I should note - it's used by about half the country for heating. But even more people have it feed into their electricity bill. So yeah, this is definitely something people can feel.
KELLY: And why? Why are prices so high?
DOMONOSKE: A lot of it is the same story that we've seen unfold across a bunch of different parts of the economy over the last two years. During the early days of the pandemic, demand disappeared really quickly. People stopped driving and flying. Factories shut down and didn't need power. So supplies went down. But now that demand is coming back, supply is struggling to keep up.
In fact, if you look at, say, oil prices in particular, they've tracked so closely to the pandemic headlines that you can basically use them as a gauge for public sentiment. If people are optimistic that the pandemic's ending, oil prices go up. Then you get delta or omicron news, and they go back down.
There are some other factors. Like in the oil industry, investors are really pushing producers to make less, keep supplies down so prices stay high to boost profits. It's really different than the days of drill, baby, drill. That's having an effect, too.
KELLY: Well, let's just talk about what this means for all of us, all of us ordinary people staring, as I said, at this heating bill on our table because it is winter, although it hasn't actually felt like winter here in D.C. (laughter). We'll hold out for January on that front. But what is happening with home heating costs?
DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So those costs are also up. And it doesn't really matter what your source of fuel is. They're all up to some degree. But I'll also note when it comes to heating fuels, talking about the weather like that is not just small talk. I mean, here in Virginia, it was 65 degrees this week. That affects prices. It reduces demand. And natural gas prices, which had been skyrocketing just a few months ago - they actually came back down recently because so much of the country had mild weather. But that could still change. If there's a cold snap, prices will go in the other direction. And bills will go way back up again.
KELLY: And what about gas prices? What are you watching for?
DOMONOSKE: Yeah. So they are down a bit from their recent highs, still up about 40% from where they were last year. As for what happens next, the forecasts are all over the map, from a fall very shortly to a sharp rise. I mean, so much of this - it goes back to the pandemic and all the uncertainty around it. Energy prices have always been volatile, and now that's just more true than ever.
KELLY: NPR's Camila Domonoske, thanks. Happy New Year.
DOMONOSKE: Thanks. You, too, Mary Louise.

Energy prices soared in 2021 - with gas, oil, coal, electricity and carbon all shooting higher in large part owing to a resurgence of geopolitical tensions between producers and consumers.
The "steep rise in prices was probably the most dramatic development on the commodities markets in 2021", noted Commerzbank analyst Barbara Lambrecht.
The most spectacular surge was that of Europe's reference gas price, Dutch TTF, which hit 187.78 euros per megawatt hour in December - 10 times higher compared with the start of the year.
The spike has been fuelled by geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia, which supplies one third of Europe's gas.
Western countries accuse Russia of limiting gas deliveries to put pressure on Europe amid tensions over the Ukraine conflict and to push through the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline set to ship Russian gas to Germany.
Critics say Nord Stream 2 will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a "geopolitical weapon".
Russian energy giant Gazprom has strongly rejected Western accusations that Moscow is limiting gas deliveries to Europe, already hit by low stocks as economies reopen from pandemic lockdowns.
Reliance on gas increased as calmer weather has reduced the availability of wind power.
OPEC oil impact
Crude oil prices rocketed also in 2021, gaining more than 50 percent as demand recovered and oil producing nations led by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia modestly boosted supplies.
It came after OPEC+ drastically slashed output in 2020 as the pandemic began to unfold, and virus-related restrictions caused demand and prices to crash.
Although crude prices have shot back up, trading above $75 per barrel heading into the new year, the jump "seems almost moderate by comparison" with gas, noted Lambrecht.
US oil benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate, reached a seven-year peak at $85 per barrel in October, before easing.
Chain reaction
Soaring gas and oil prices have pushed up the cost of coal, one of the most polluting fossil fuels, at a time when countries are under pressure to increasingly switch to cleaner energy sources.
A tonne of coal for delivery to the ports of Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp struck $280 at the start of October, nearly three times the price that had lasted for around a decade.
This helped to push up European carbon prices, which reached above 90 euros per tonne for the first time in December, around three times the level at the start of the year.
Carbon trading, while seen as a key way to prevent climate change, involves companies buying the right to pollute from others who have a lower carbon footprint.
Electricity prices have also surged. Electricity for delivery in France next year rose above 450 euros per megawatt hour in December, four times more than in early September.
The surge in energy prices is fuelling high inflation worries as soaring costs badly affect businesses and consumers globally.

Why Are Energy Prices So High?
Photo: Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg via Getty Images
The global economic recovery is running low on fuel. Chinese factories have been flickering on and off as Beijing rations electricity. Britons have been parking in petrol lines as their nation’s pumps run dry. Americans have turned on their president as spiking gas prices eat their wage gains. And the entire northern hemisphere is sweating the cost of keeping warm this winter.
High energy prices have long been the bane of the post-2020 recovery. But as the days grow shorter and the nights get colder, their salience is steadily rising. In recent days, Democrats and Republicans alike have called on Joe Biden to take immediate action to reduce the cost of energy. The former implored the president to bring down gas prices by tapping the nation’s emergency oil reserves. The latter chastised Biden for personally driving up energy prices by blocking new oil and gas drilling on federal land.
Meanwhile, fossil-fuel lobbyists and eco-socialists alike are casting the energy crunch as a byproduct of the world’s (slow and uneven) green transition. In their account, investors have been spurning new oil and gas production out of fear of future regulations, while renewables have failed to scale up fast enough to compensate. For oil barons, this narrative functions as an argument against stringent carbon pricing. For Marxists, it offers hope for an impending crisis of capitalism, as the old energy system dies and the new one struggles to be born.
Global energy markets contain multitudes. The price of oil internalizes myriad forces, from the financial to the macroeconomic to the geopolitical to the meteorological. So, one can tell a wide range of true stories about the energy crisis of 2021. But two of the most prominent narratives in American discourse — that climate policy is the primary driver of the global price spike, and that Biden could resolve the crisis if only environmentalists would let him — are simply false. Such myths do less to explain the present crisis of energy inflation than to undermine our prospects for rapid decarbonization. So it’s important to be clear about what they get wrong.
Why energy prices are high and rising.
The true origin of today’s energy crisis isn’t the 2020 COVID crash, but rather, the 2014 oil-price collapse.
In the first years of the last decade, China’s strong growth propelled a global commodities boom, and kept the price of oil hovering around $100 a barrel. This was a boon to energy investors in the short run. But the rally sowed the seeds of its own undoing. Forms of energy extraction that had been prohibitively expensive when oil was trading at $60 a barrel suddenly became eminently profitable. Capital poured into America’s shale industry. Thus, the supply of fossil fuel on global markets rapidly increased. At the same time, slowing global growth combined with advances in energy efficiency lowered global energy demand.
Traditionally, OPEC would have responded to such conditions by trying to stabilize global prices by pumping less oil. But Saudi Arabia saw opportunity in a sustained energy glut.
As a conventional oil producer, Saudi Aramco had a much lower break-even price than America’s shale drillers. And as a sovereign government with a foreign-currency reserve worth $750 billion, the Saudis could afford to sell energy at a loss for a lot longer than private firms in the Permian basin. Thus, by keeping the taps on and allowing global energy prices to crash, the House of Saud could reclaim the global market share that frackers had so rudely wrestled from it.
As a result, the price of oil plunged by 70 percent between mid-2014 and early 2016.
All this had two lasting consequences for global energy markets that are integral to today’s crisis. First, investors’ appetite for new oil and gas production collapsed. Global capital craves steady returns, not 70 percent price swings.
Graphic: IEA 2019
Long-term shareholders in fossil-fuel firms pressured managers to cut back investment in favor of dividends. Many such shareholders had sustained heavy losses during the crash, and therefore refused to sanction risky new projects until they recouped their initial investments.
Second, the combination of advances in fracking technology and a glutted energy market made natural gas unprecedentedly abundant and cost-competitive with coal. Utilities therefore started replacing coal-fired power plants with gas-fired ones, and the global electricity system became newly reliant on natural gas.
These changes in global energy markets lay the kindling for an energy crisis. COVID lit a match, and then bad weather rained down kerosene.
The COVID recession took a toll on both energy demand and supply. Thanks to unusually robust fiscal policy throughout the Global North, however, global appetite for energy rebounded much faster than supply chains did. This year has seen the highest pace of post-recession growth in eight decades. Yet 2020 also left behind a maintenance backlog in the world’s energy industry: Public-health regulations and outbreaks forced many producers to postpone upkeep operations that had been scheduled last year. This, combined with several unexpected outages and supply-chain dysfunctions, impaired the ramping up of production in 2021.

Adverse meteorological conditions exacerbated the mismatch between supply and demand. Last January brought extremely cold weather to much of Asia, causing a surge in the continent’s consumption of energy. Meanwhile, droughts in multiple regions reliant on hydropower, combined with below-average wind speeds in Northern Europe, yielded an unexpected reduction in the world’s renewable-energy capacity.
By themselves, these developments would have been sufficient to trigger a spike in energy prices. What’s kept prices elevated so durably, however, are the structural changes wrought by the 2014 oil-price plunge. Even before the COVID shock, energy production was failing to keep pace with rising demand. Alas, this year’s price jump hasn’t triggered any surge in “catch-up” investment within the oil and gas industry.
To the contrary, after years of poor returns, shareholders have forced fossil-fuel firms to prioritize windfall profits over new investment. This prioritization of dividends over drilling hasn’t just prevented private energy producers from raising production to meet soaring demand; it’s also stopped state-owned oil companies from doing so.
Like private investors in the energy sector, the OPEC nations and Russia suffered a prolonged period of disappointing returns after 2014. Now, they are eager to milk the current energy rally for all the revenue that it’s worth.
If U.S. shale drillers were responding to high prices by increasing production, then Russia and OPEC would have an incentive to respond to market demand; they remember what happened the last time that they allowed the price of a barrel of oil to approach triple digits, and do not want to lose market share to frackers.
But as Reuters reported last week, Saudi Arabia and Russia are now confident that “higher oil prices will not elicit a fast response from the U.S. shale industry.” As a result, they feel that they have more to gain than lose from letting prices continue to rise while they sit on their spare capacity.
The second legacy of last decade’s energy glut and price collapse — the global advance of gas-fired power plants — has also proven problematic. It is far more common for people to heat their homes with natural gas than with coal. Thus, as gas has displaced coal on power grids, competition between the electric and home heat sectors for fuel in the wintertime has increased.
As Barron’s notes, U.S. electricity prices have historically tended to rise in the summer (as consumers turn on their air conditioners) and fall in the winter. But in 2020, this pattern reversed: As power plants bid against households for limited supplies of natural gas, electricity prices reached new heights in the year’s closing months.
This bodes poorly for the winter to come. The U.S. government expects home heating bills to rise by as much as 54 percent for Americans this winter relative to last year. And as households burn their disposable income to keep warm, they are also liable to see their electricity bills soar.
What’s climate policy got to do with it?
Last decade’s drop-off in oil and gas investment began just before the Paris Climate Agreement. Many observers have therefore been tempted to draw a causal arrow between the two: With decarbonization looming, fear of stranded assets chased capital out of the fossil-fuel sector, and public investment in renewables failed to fill the gap. Ergo, energy crisis.
This narrative is plausible on its face. And it isn’t necessarily untrue that concerns about climate policy have impacted new investment in fossil fuels at the margin. But it just isn’t the main story.
First of all, investment in oil and gas plunged after the 2014 price collapse, and stabilized in the years immediately following the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Second, as Adam Tooze notes, investment in pipelines for liquified natural gas (LNG) has been robust in recent years. LNG pipelines are long-term investments with significant upfront costs. They therefore are a poor financial proposition if one presumes that rapid decarbonization is nigh. Yet even Europe, where the price of carbon permits is set to steadily rise in the coming decades, is building out pipelines and LNG terminal capacities far in excess of its present needs. There is little sign that fear of an impending green transition is the primary force shaping investment in the energy sector.
Rather, as we’ve seen, today’s shortfalls in fossil-fuel investment and production derive from the geopolitical tensions and financial volatility that have long characterized the sector. Whatever the state of climate policy, investors in shale oil would want to recoup their 2014 losses this year, while OPEC and Russia would wish to press their present advantage. If we want a global energy system that is less vulnerable to the whims of Wall Street and petrostates, we need to accelerate the green transition, not back away from it.
This said, climate policy has been a secondary factor in this year’s energy inflation. The displacement of coal by natural gas in global electric grids was driven primarily by market prices. But emissions targets have also had an impact. The Chinese government has pursued a national policy of limiting coal power in favor of gas. And that transition has played a significant role in Europe’s energy troubles. Reliant on gas imports from Asia, Europe was ill-prepared for heightened competition from China over the region’s limited gas supplies.
In an earlier era, rising gas prices might have led Europe to pivot toward coal. But the rising cost of the E.U.’s carbon permits rendered this economically nonviable.
So green policy has elevated global demand for natural gas. But it has relatively little to do with the present constraints on supply.
Joe Biden alone can’t fix it.
In recent weeks, the president has implored Russia and OPEC “to pump more oil,” while maintaining his opposition to new oil and gas drilling on lands owned by the U.S. government, and rhetorical support for a swift green transition.
Republican senators have taken umbrage at this conduct, informing Biden in an August letter, “It is astonishing that your administration is now seeking assistance from an international oil cartel when America has sufficient domestic supply and reserves to increase output, which would reduce gasoline prices.”
Certainly, there is an irony in the president of a major oil- and gas-producing nation begging foreign governments to produce more oil and gas. Still, the GOP’s criticism is mostly hot air.
Unlike their counterparts in Russia and Saudi Arabia, American energy producers are not just sitting on tons of spare capacity. OPEC has the resources at its disposal to rapidly increase the global energy supply. U.S. firms don’t. Rather, they’d need to drill and complete new wells to comparably increase oil and gas volumes, a process that would take months. More fundamentally, the American energy industry sits in private hands. Joe Biden does not have the authority to order an increase in oil and gas drilling, and Republican senators would surely impeach him if he tried to impinge on the private sector’s prerogatives in that fashion.
Meanwhile, Biden’s curb on new drilling on federal lands is doing precisely nothing to limit production. As already emphasized, oil and gas investors simply are not interested in expanding production. And even if they were, U.S. companies already own drilling rights on “so much federal acreage that they have enough to drill for years without needing to apply for more permits,” according to Barron’s.
Biden could tap America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But analysts say this would only deliver a small, temporary reduction in oil prices. More radical measures, such as a ban on oil and gas exports, would likely backfire. If America cut off the world’s access to its domestic energy supply, global oil prices would rise. And since American oil refiners are dependent on foreign oil supplies to make gasoline, higher global oil prices would yield higher U.S. gas prices.
With Congress’s help, there are things the president can do to ease pain for low-income consumers, such as increase federal funding for home-energy assistance. But Democrats can’t do very much to ease supply constraints in the near term.
What they can do is render America’s energy system less vulnerable to outrageous commodity cycles in the long term by increasing investment in renewable energy. Let’s hope mythic misconceptions about today’s energy inflation don’t stop them.

It was in the middle of summer when consumers began to feel the chill: millions were told their energy bills would rise in the autumn.
Meanwhile energy analysts could see a storm brewing that would eventually claim dozens of energy suppliers and result in thousands of job losses.
The soaring wholesale cost of gas was behind the 2021 energy crisis. Gas is vital for the UK, heating 86 per cent of homes and generating around 40 per cent of the country’s power. In November, gas prices were 435 per cent higher compared to 12 months earlier.
A series of coinciding events dramatically pushed up gas prices. The main factors were a Europe-wide shortage because of supply issues from Russia, low European production of pipeline gas due to maintenance work and gas storage levels across the continent, including the UK, being lower than usual following a long winter across 2020 and 2021. Large economies in Asia also upped their liquified natural gas usage as they moved away from coal.
Making matters worse, demand for gas in the UK grew due to problems securing electricity. Supply was dented after a fire damaged a UK converter station that brings power from France and wind production was down, which meant more gas was needed to generate sufficient levels of electricity.
Early 2021
Some analysts began getting spooked by gas prices early in 2021 as economies around the world rebounded from Covid-19 restrictions.
Marlon Dey, an analyst at Aurora Energy Research, explained: “During the high demand gas months, you would withdraw from your storage and gas. And then when the demand is low, you top it up again, build up the bank balance. Because of that low production in Europe and then on top of that, not getting that additional supply from Russia, the storage levels didn’t get replenished in low gas months season.
“And this has been happening from the start of the year, it really peaked around September, and that caused gas prices to get really high. It’s remaining high at the moment. So that’s how we’ve gotten to this place.”
High gas prices feed directly into electricity prices, which Robert Buckley, an analyst for energy research firm Cornwall Insight, began to notice in March.
“It was on a rising trend, the electricity price. It pushed through £50 per megawatt hour, was pushing up to £60 per megawatt hour – it got there in April, May time.”
Wholesale power prices are now 350 per cent higher than they were in November 2020.
Asked if the situation was unprecedented, Mr Buckley said: “I’ve been analysing these markets since about 1990 and there’s been nothing like this.”
July
The first sign of problems for the public came in July when billpayers were told by Ofgem’s chief executive Jonathan Brearley warned that “global prices for fossil fuels, especially gas, are increasing at an unprecedented rate”.
It was inevitable that providers would have to charge customers more. Mr Brearley braced the public for the price cap – which limits the rate a supplier can charge for their default tariffs but fluctuates in line with the underlying costs to energy supply – to go up by around £150 per household.
While the increase in the price of gas is “unprecedented”, “boom and bust” in the UK and EU markets is nothing new, said Robert Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and Professor of Energy Policy at Imperial College London.
“We have experienced increases of a similar magnitude in the oil market in the past. In 2007/2008 the price of oil increased about three-fold, before it collapsed during the financial crisis. The increase in 1979 during the second oil-shock was even larger. There is no doubt that back in the 1970s the effects were severe, feeding both high inflation and economic recession.”
While the UK’s long-term plans for net zero “will liberate us from the boom and bust of oil and gas prices”, the UKERC’s annual review of energy policy is calling for a rethink of the way gas is secured and stored.
August
In August, Jacopo Torriti, a professor of energy economics and policy at the University of Reading, began to worry about the energy crisis as both a consumer and an analyst.
“I had to change supplier… I chose to go for a two-year fixed as opposed to a one-year fixed tariff.”
He also knew the energy crisis would started hitting smaller suppliers that were unable to increase their own prices. That same month the first firm went to the wall as a result of soaring wholesale prices: Hub Energy.
September
The pace picked up in September with nine smaller energy suppliers going bust.
While the price cap is aimed at protecting vulnerable energy users from paying too much, Prof Torriti said it has “detrimental effects on those suppliers that had hedged too much on prices”.
“They will still have to buy at the wholesale price, very expensive energy, and then be obliged to only charge the cap level as a maximum to some customers. So those suppliers that had quite a lot of customers on the price cup basically went bust.”
Among September’s casualties was Utility Point, whose 220,000 customers transferred to EDF.
Reflecting on how energy companies like his have fared, Utility Point’s chief information officer Andy Harris said: “I think it’s fair to say that it’s never been this worrying, including when around 10 years ago, the ‘big six’ [energy firms] were having to increase prices by [around] 30 per cent.”
But he added: “It’s also fair to say that runs on prices are not unprecedented as we see that in all commodities from time to time.”
Utility Point was forced to make staff redundant, as were other suppliers and third party energy businesses, resulting in many job losses.
When suppliers fail, the costs are covered by the remaining businesses and will eventually push up prices for customers. Some estimates put it at £120 a household.
In September, soaring gas prices began hitting industries. The US firm CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60 per cent of the country’s CO2, which is used in the food and drinks industries and the NHS. The sites restarted production after reaching a £30m bailout deal with the Government.
October
Energy-hungry industries such as steel manufacturers and paper-makers warned they were on the brink of collapsing due to spiralling energy bills.
October was also the month in which the new Ofgem energy price cap began, increasing bills by at least £139 a year for 15 million customers.
Coming after the financial uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and coinciding with the end of the furlough scheme, it was bad news for the public.
“Most people will be feeling a financial squeeze but for the poorest households this will be the toughest start to winter many can recall,” said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy of the charity National Energy Action (NEA).
“Average domestic energy bills have now soared by over £230 per customer compared to last winter.”
November
The lights went off at Bulb, the country’s seventh largest supplier, in November when it went into special administration. Due to the size of the company – 1.7 million customers – it was deemed too big to fail so the Government stepped in with £1.7bn to help keep it running for the time being.
As the cold weather took hold of the UK, older people in low-income households were forced to use “desperate strategie” to stay warm cheaply, such as heating just one room and wearing multiple layers of clothing indoors.
David Southgate, Age UK’s policy and research officer, said: “We’ve also heard from some older people who have been using their free bus pass and travelling around on the buses just to stay warm.”
He called for the Government to give people receiving Cold Weather Payments an additional £50 and for the £500m support fund for vulnerable households to be doubled to £1bn.
It was found in November that helping fuel poor households could save the NHS £1.5bn a year in treating health conditions exacerbated by cold weather.
December
On 1 December, Zog Energy, which supplies 11,700 households, went bust.
It marked the 25th time in just three months that a supplier had collapsed.
With so many firms going to the wall, the lack of competition leaves customers with fewer opportunities to shop around for a deal.
Responding to the fate of the suppliers, Ofgem announced the energy price cap could be reviewed every three months – rather than every six months – or replaced altogether by a six-month fixed tariff.
2022 and beyond
Bills are predicted to soar again in April 2022 but the volatility should settle. As it generates more power from renewable sources, the UK will become less dependent on gas.
Mr Dey said: “The cost of delivering net zero though investment in alternative technologies such as wind, solar, nuclear and carbon capture will have to be funded by the consumer (or taxpayer).
“Consumers in the UK will therefore face an inevitable rise in energy prices through supplier levies needed to fund the energy transition, even if wholesale energy prices return to normal levels.”

It was in the middle of summer when consumers began to feel the chill: millions were told their energy bills would rise in the autumn.
Meanwhile energy analysts could see a storm brewing that would eventually claim dozens of energy suppliers and result in thousands of job losses.
The soaring wholesale cost of gas was behind the 2021 energy crisis. Gas is vital for the UK, heating 86 per cent of homes and generating around 40 per cent of the country’s power. In November, gas prices were 435 per cent higher compared to 12 months earlier.
A series of coinciding events dramatically pushed up gas prices. The main factors were a Europe-wide shortage because of supply issues from Russia, low European production of pipeline gas due to maintenance work and gas storage levels across the continent, including the UK, being lower than usual following a long winter across 2020 and 2021. Large economies in Asia also upped their liquified natural gas usage as they moved away from coal.
Making matters worse, demand for gas in the UK grew due to problems securing electricity. Supply was dented after a fire damaged a UK converter station that brings power from France and wind production was down, which meant more gas was needed to generate sufficient levels of electricity.
Early 2021
Some analysts began getting spooked by gas prices early in 2021 as economies around the world rebounded from Covid-19 restrictions.
Marlon Dey, an analyst at Aurora Energy Research, explained: “During the high demand gas months, you would withdraw from your storage and gas. And then when the demand is low, you top it up again, build up the bank balance. Because of that low production in Europe and then on top of that, not getting that additional supply from Russia, the storage levels didn’t get replenished in low gas months season.
“And this has been happening from the start of the year, it really peaked around September, and that caused gas prices to get really high. It’s remaining high at the moment. So that’s how we’ve gotten to this place.”
High gas prices feed directly into electricity prices, which Robert Buckley, an analyst for energy research firm Cornwall Insight, began to notice in March.
“It was on a rising trend, the electricity price. It pushed through £50 per megawatt hour, was pushing up to £60 per megawatt hour – it got there in April, May time.”
Wholesale power prices are now 350 per cent higher than they were in November 2020.
Asked if the situation was unprecedented, Mr Buckley said: “I’ve been analysing these markets since about 1990 and there’s been nothing like this.”
July
The first sign of problems for the public came in July when billpayers were told by Ofgem’s chief executive Jonathan Brearley warned that “global prices for fossil fuels, especially gas, are increasing at an unprecedented rate”.
It was inevitable that providers would have to charge customers more. Mr Brearley braced the public for the price cap – which limits the rate a supplier can charge for their default tariffs but fluctuates in line with the underlying costs to energy supply – to go up by around £150 per household.
While the increase in the price of gas is “unprecedented”, “boom and bust” in the UK and EU markets is nothing new, said Robert Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and Professor of Energy Policy at Imperial College London.
“We have experienced increases of a similar magnitude in the oil market in the past. In 2007/2008 the price of oil increased about three-fold, before it collapsed during the financial crisis. The increase in 1979 during the second oil-shock was even larger. There is no doubt that back in the 1970s the effects were severe, feeding both high inflation and economic recession.”
While the UK’s long-term plans for net zero “will liberate us from the boom and bust of oil and gas prices”, the UKERC’s annual review of energy policy is calling for a rethink of the way gas is secured and stored.
August
In August, Jacopo Torriti, a professor of energy economics and policy at the University of Reading, began to worry about the energy crisis as both a consumer and an analyst.
“I had to change supplier… I chose to go for a two-year fixed as opposed to a one-year fixed tariff.”
He also knew the energy crisis would started hitting smaller suppliers that were unable to increase their own prices. That same month the first firm went to the wall as a result of soaring wholesale prices: Hub Energy.
September
The pace picked up in September with nine smaller energy suppliers going bust.
While the price cap is aimed at protecting vulnerable energy users from paying too much, Prof Torriti said it has “detrimental effects on those suppliers that had hedged too much on prices”.
“They will still have to buy at the wholesale price, very expensive energy, and then be obliged to only charge the cap level as a maximum to some customers. So those suppliers that had quite a lot of customers on the price cup basically went bust.”
Among September’s casualties was Utility Point, whose 220,000 customers transferred to EDF.
Reflecting on how energy companies like his have fared, Utility Point’s chief information officer Andy Harris said: “I think it’s fair to say that it’s never been this worrying, including when around 10 years ago, the ‘big six’ [energy firms] were having to increase prices by [around] 30 per cent.”
But he added: “It’s also fair to say that runs on prices are not unprecedented as we see that in all commodities from time to time.”
Utility Point was forced to make staff redundant, as were other suppliers and third party energy businesses, resulting in many job losses.
When suppliers fail, the costs are covered by the remaining businesses and will eventually push up prices for customers. Some estimates put it at £120 a household.
In September, soaring gas prices began hitting industries. The US firm CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60 per cent of the country’s CO2, which is used in the food and drinks industries and the NHS. The sites restarted production after reaching a £30m bailout deal with the Government.
October
Energy-hungry industries such as steel manufacturers and paper-makers warned they were on the brink of collapsing due to spiralling energy bills.
October was also the month in which the new Ofgem energy price cap began, increasing bills by at least £139 a year for 15 million customers.
Coming after the financial uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and coinciding with the end of the furlough scheme, it was bad news for the public.
“Most people will be feeling a financial squeeze but for the poorest households this will be the toughest start to winter many can recall,” said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy of the charity National Energy Action (NEA).
“Average domestic energy bills have now soared by over £230 per customer compared to last winter.”
November
The lights went off at Bulb, the country’s seventh largest supplier, in November when it went into special administration. Due to the size of the company – 1.7 million customers – it was deemed too big to fail so the Government stepped in with £1.7bn to help keep it running for the time being.
As the cold weather took hold of the UK, older people in low-income households were forced to use “desperate strategie” to stay warm cheaply, such as heating just one room and wearing multiple layers of clothing indoors.
David Southgate, Age UK’s policy and research officer, said: “We’ve also heard from some older people who have been using their free bus pass and travelling around on the buses just to stay warm.”
He called for the Government to give people receiving Cold Weather Payments an additional £50 and for the £500m support fund for vulnerable households to be doubled to £1bn.
It was found in November that helping fuel poor households could save the NHS £1.5bn a year in treating health conditions exacerbated by cold weather.
December
On 1 December, Zog Energy, which supplies 11,700 households, went bust.
It marked the 25th time in just three months that a supplier had collapsed.
With so many firms going to the wall, the lack of competition leaves customers with fewer opportunities to shop around for a deal.
Responding to the fate of the suppliers, Ofgem announced the energy price cap could be reviewed every three months – rather than every six months – or replaced altogether by a six-month fixed tariff.
2022 and beyond
Bills are predicted to soar again in April 2022 but the volatility should settle. As it generates more power from renewable sources, the UK will become less dependent on gas.
Mr Dey said: “The cost of delivering net zero though investment in alternative technologies such as wind, solar, nuclear and carbon capture will have to be funded by the consumer (or taxpayer).
“Consumers in the UK will therefore face an inevitable rise in energy prices through supplier levies needed to fund the energy transition, even if wholesale energy prices return to normal levels.”

Alright, so I've got some articles here that discuss why energy prices are high, particularly focusing on 2021. Let me try to synthesize the information from these sources.

First, it seems that the root of the current energy crisis can be traced back to the 2014 oil-price collapse. Back then, the price of oil plummeted by 70% between mid-2014 and early 2016. This had two main consequences:

1. **Investment in new oil and gas production decreased significantly** because investors were wary of the volatile prices and sought more stable returns elsewhere.

2. **Natural gas became more abundant and cost-competitive with coal**, leading to a shift in the electricity sector towards gas-fired power plants.

So, the stage was set for potential supply shortages when demand picked up again.

Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. The global economy went into a recession, reducing energy demand. Producers scaled back operations, and some maintenance and investment plans were postponed due to the uncertain economic environment and health restrictions.

As the world started recovering from the pandemic in 2021, energy demand surged faster than supply could keep up. This mismatch was exacerbated by several factors:

- **Adverse weather conditions**: Extremely cold weather in Asia increased energy consumption, while droughts and lower wind speeds reduced renewable energy generation in various regions.

- **Supply chain disruptions**: The aftermath of the pandemic led to delays and shortages in equipment and labor, hindering the ramp-up of energy production.

- **Geopolitical tensions**: Specifically, tensions between Russia and Europe over gas supplies played a significant role in driving up gas prices.

Regarding the geopolitical aspect, Russia supplies a significant portion of Europe's gas, and there have been accusations that Russia is limiting gas deliveries to exert pressure on Europe regarding the Ukraine conflict and the approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russia denies these claims, stating that it is fulfilling its contractual obligations.

The reliance on gas for both heating and electricity has intensified the competition for limited gas supplies, leading to higher prices in both sectors.

Now, some people attribute the current energy price spikes to climate policies, suggesting that the shift towards renewable energy sources is causing instability in energy prices. However, the articles suggest that while climate policies have influenced the energy mix, they are not the primary drivers of the current crisis.

The 2014 oil-price collapse and its aftermath have had a more profound impact on the energy market's structure and investment patterns. The reduced investment in oil and gas production, coupled with the shift towards gas in the electricity sector, has made the energy system more vulnerable to supply shocks, as seen in 2021.

Moreover, the argument that climate policies are causing energy prices to rise is nuanced. While policies promoting renewables can have an impact, the current price spikes are more directly linked to the interplay of supply and demand in fossil fuel markets.

Regarding the role of government intervention, particularly in the context of the U.S., there's a debate about whether the government can or should take actions to lower energy prices. The articles suggest that the U.S. government's options are limited. For instance, releasing oil from strategic reserves might provide only temporary relief, and banning oil exports could backfire by increasing domestic prices.

In summary, the high energy prices in 2021 are primarily due to a combination of factors:

- Legacy issues from the 2014 oil-price collapse, leading to reduced investment in oil and gas production.

- The shift towards gas in the electricity sector, increasing competition for gas supplies.

- The rapid economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, outpacing the ability of energy producers to ramp up supply.

- Adverse weather conditions affecting both demand and renewable energy generation.

- Geopolitical tensions impacting gas supplies.

Climate policies are playing a role, but they are not the main drivers of the current crisis. Government options to immediately alleviate energy prices are limited, and long-term solutions lie in accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources to make the energy system more resilient and less vulnerable to price volatility in fossil fuels.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{High energy prices in 2021 are primarily due to a combination of factors including reduced investment in oil and gas post-2014 oil-price collapse, shift towards gas in electricity generation, rapid economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, and geopolitical tensions.}} \]
