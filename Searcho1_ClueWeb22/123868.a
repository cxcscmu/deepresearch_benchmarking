Alright, so I need to figure out how gender inequality affects children. Hmm, gender inequality is when males and females aren't treated equally, right? It's not just about wages; it's broader, involving social, economic, and political aspects. So, how does this unequal treatment impact kids?

First, maybe I should understand what gender inequality looks like in different parts of the world. I know that in some countries, girls don't have the same access to education as boys do. That seems like a big issue. So, if girls can't go to school as much, that must affect their opportunities later in life, but also, right now, as children, they might feel left out or inferior.

Let me think about that. If a girl is told she can't go to school because she's a girl, that must have a huge psychological impact. It could make her feel less valuable than her male peers. That could lead to lower self-esteem, which could affect her entire life.

Also, education is key to breaking cycles of poverty. So, if girls aren't educated, they might be more likely to stay in poverty, and then their own children might not get proper education, and it's a vicious cycle.

But maybe I should look into some statistics or studies that have been done on this. Maybe there are specific ways that gender inequality affects children that I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps I should consider how gender roles are imposed on children from a young age. Like, boys are encouraged to play with trucks and be tough, while girls are given dolls and taught to be nurturing. Does that kind of socialization lead to inequality later on?

Probably, yes. If children are taught from a young age that they have specific roles based on their gender, they might not explore their full potential. For example, a girl who loves math and science might be steered away from those subjects because they're "masculine," and vice versa.

That could limit their career choices later on, but as children, it might make them feel like they can't pursue their interests fully. That must be frustrating and could affect their mental health.

Moreover, gender inequality can affect children's health. In some cultures, male children are favored over female children, which might lead to better nutrition and medical care for boys compared to girls. That could result in higher mortality rates or poorer health outcomes for girls.

Wait, is that true? I should check if there's data supporting that.

Providing education to women can make a major 
difference in their health care.
Promoting gender equality is one of the most important global efforts taking place in the world today. When women and girls are able to receive educations and make decisions about their future, society benefits in many ways, including in the realm of health care.
How Gender Inequality Affects Healthcare for Women
Although great strides are being made in the field of health care and maternal health in developing countries, discrimination against women and girls still occurs in many cultures, having a negative effect on families living in poverty. Giving girls access to educational opportunities to encourage literacy is one of the most effective ways of bridging this gender gap and improving health care. Even small victories on the march toward equality can make a major difference in the lives of girls and women living in poverty.
According to a 2011 report from the World Health Organization, denying primary education to young girls has been shown to negatively impact fertility rates, birth spacing, health literacy and healthy behaviors. Similar reports have found that educating women in Africa and Latin America lowers their risk of HIV infection.
By empowering women and young girls through educational opportunities, they are able to become well-versed in the safest health practices, learning the best ways to deal with common issues in their communities. Training women to become health workers, especially within the realm of maternal care, can foster independence while building a sustainable health care system. Additionally, health education allows these women to make informed decisions about personal health care, which in turn can help them avoid preventable diseases or potentially dangerous procedures.
In many countries that ChildFund serves, we have helped train women to work with mothers in these impoverished communities, providing good information about their health and their children's development. In Indonesia, for example, women known as "health cadres" have caused a cultural shift in their communities, leading more women to have their babies in hospitals instead of at home. This has led to lower birth mortality rates.
Promoting Gender Equality and Empowering Women
As we see daily in news reports, we have a long way to go before all women have the chance to live independent, fulfilled lives, but we are making some headway in gender equality. Whether it's empowering girls by providing access to education, making sure that young mothers have the necessary maternal care, or equipping women with the knowledge and resources required to sustain their own income, these efforts require your continued support.
ChildFund works with many girls and women in developing countries on gender issues, providing them with opportunities for health care and education so they can become healthy, independent adults. You can help in our efforts by choosing a gift from our Real Gifts catalog. We have many options for aiding girls and women, and your gift could make a difference in the lives of children in need and their families.

Gender inequality is a major form of injustice which in turn affects the health of women globally. In most societies, women have lower social status than men, producing unequal power relations. For example, Women have lower status in families, communities and society (World Health Organisation, 2007). In rural areas, female heads of household have less than half the years of education of their male counterparts (Food & Agriculture Organisation of United Nations, 2014). They have less access to and control over resources (World Health Organisation, 2007).If women had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase yields on their farms by 20-30% (Food & Agriculture Organisation of United Nations, 2014). They also have less of a say in decision making than men (World Health Organisation, 2007). Numerous studies have agreed and disagreed with the facts above. These studies discuss gender inequalities and education, trade, ill-health, employment and economic growth and trades in gender inequality. There are many reasons to be concerned about existing gender inequalities in important well-being related dimensions such as education, health, employment or pay. Gender inequalities are problematic as they lower well-being and are a form of injustice in most conceptions of equity of justice (Klasen, 2002). A summary of my findings in the literature are listed in appendix 1.

The topic of discussion will be primarily on mentally ill offenders; however, I would like to first discuss the ineffectiveness in mental health treatment on the population as a whole based on an individual’s race, class and gender.  Mental disorders are very common in the United States.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans, ages 18 and older, suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year.  This is about one in four adults; this
true. Even in countries with laws in place to guarantee equality, individuals and sometimes, whole groups of people fall through the cracks. Gender, income, physical (dis)ability, ethnicity, and race are among the most notable issues that can affect a person's status in a society. In some countries, there is no pretense about being "born equal," for inequality is built into the very fabric of the society. These are the most glaring cases: countries that do not even buy into the premise of the statement

REPORT ON GENDER INEQUALITY
Introduction 
Gender inequality is a state in which there is an unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals based on their gender. (forum, 2014). Gender inequality have been brought about by both people perspective and also through inheritance. Gender inequality have brought about degradation of economic status of the country.
Gender inequality goes hand in hand with economic status of a country. Gender inequality plays a great role in increase
Gender Inequality in the Corporate World
	How do you feel about women holding higher positions within corporations?  In today’s society, there are several inequalities between women and men.  These inequalities between women and men have been around since the beginning of time and will always be a factor.  Gender inequality can be seen in many different ways across our society today.  One major area that this inequality can be seen is in the workforce.  There are many women who have jobs in today’s
The social-conflict theory states that inequality exists in every society, which results in conflict and change. This theory takes into consideration factors such as social class, race, ethnicity, gender, and age. Throughout history, there has been inequalities between the rich and the poor, males and females, white people and people of color; these inequalities are still ongoing today in several societies around the world. Furthermore, this social inequality causes conflict since it benefits specific

Efforts to decrease gender inequality, such as tuition-free primary education and paid parental leave, transform norms and improve health for women and their children, according to a new study.
“These policies had both direct positive health effects as well as a positive impact on health mediated by more gender equality in decision making,” says coauthor Jessica Levy, associate professor of practice at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis.
“We know that the health consequences of gender inequality fall most heavily on girls, women, and gender minorities,” Levy says, “but restrictive gender norms harm everyone’s health.
“Gender norms are the often unspoken ‘rules’ that govern what is valued and considered acceptable for being masculine/male and feminine/female. They’re deeply embedded in our community culture and institutions, and can intersect with other social factors to impact health over the life course,” she says. “Knowing how to decrease gender inequality and change restrictive gender norms are key to seeing long-term, equitable improvements in health.”
3 paths to less gender inequality
In the paper, Levy and her coauthors ask what has been done and what can be done to decrease gender inequalities and loosen restrictive gender norms in order to improve the health and well-being of communities.
They looked at three key ways of accomplishing this goal: gender transformative health programming (which are programs that actively seek to transform norms and improve health); large-scale laws and policies; and actions related to governance.
First, in their systematic review of gender transformative programs, they found that most interventions were in Sub-Saharan Africa (46 percent), South Asia (24 percent), and North America (16 percent).
“One the one hand, we were encouraged to find that 85 programs met our study’s inclusion criteria and worked in some way to address gender norms and improve health; however only 16 of those programs actually showed evidence of larger norm change,” Levy says.
What’s working?
Levy says that among those 16 programs, researchers found four key similarities:
they involved multiple stakeholders across multiple levels were involved;
they used multi-sectoral action, recognizing that interventions that reach beyond the health sector can better improve health outcomes;
they used diversified programming, strategically combining activities that reinforce one another and address issues from multiple perspectives; and
they fostered critical awareness and participation among affected community members, encouraging people to become active agents in shaping their own health.
Using conceptual and statistical models, they also studied laws and policies with the potential to affect gender equality and health. Analysis of data from more than 20 countries showed that increased equal opportunities in work and education improved gender equality in decision making.
Access to tuition-free education throughout primary school, as well as a 10-week increase in paid maternity or parental leave, increased the odds that women had sole or joint household decision making power with spouses/partners by about 45 percent, respectively. The same laws and policies also significantly improved women’s and their children’s health, the researchers found.
“These findings are innovative because they demonstrate that these policies improve health, in part by improving gender norms,” Levy says.
The researchers also found that across 97 countries, a 10 percent increase in the gender parity index, an index reflecting gender equality, is associated with an increase in life expectancy for women of about one to two years and of men of approximately one year.
“Increasing gender equality in political representation by, for example, having more women and gender minorities at the table, makes all of this possible,” Levy says.
The research appears in The Lancet.

Child abuse and neglect linked to gender inequality

Child abuse and neglect linked to gender inequality
by Springer
Children growing up in societies that experience high levels of gender inequality—irrespective of whether these are developed or developing countries—are more likely to be maltreated. This is according to a cross-national analysis of data from 57 countries worldwide, conducted by Joanne Klevens and Katie Ports of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US. The results are published in Springer's Journal of Family Violence .
Klevens and Ports analysed data about severe physical discipline of children, such as being hit, slapped or repeatedly beaten, or child neglect (being left without the supervision of an adult). The source of the data was surveys conducted by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and Demographic and Health Surveys conducted by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 2011 to 2015. Face-to-face questionnaires were completed by adult caregivers; they were asked about an index child in the household aged between 1 and 14, and about the levels of discipline this child was subjected to.
The researchers considered three country-based indices of gender inequity to investigate gender-based gaps. These were the Social and Institutional Gender Index or SIGI (which measures discrimination against women), the Gender Inequality Index or GII (which measures health economic and power inequities), and the Gender Gap Index or GGI (a measure of economic, education, health and political power).
Forty-four percent of the countries included in the analysis are considered to have a high or very high level of human development, while a third is seen as having low human development. The sample did not include countries in the European Union or highly populated countries such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia or the USA.
Klevens and Ports' analysis showed that the rate of physical abuse of children varied between 1 and 43 percent, while child neglect rates stood between 0.8 and 49 percent. Rates of discrimination against women substantially influence the levels of child physical abuse and child neglect.
The researchers found all three gender inequity indices to be significantly associated with physical abuse and two of the three to be significantly associated with neglect, after controlling for country-level development. Specifically, higher scores indicating greater levels of discrimination against women on the SIGI, greater gender inequity on the GII, and lower scores on the GGI indicating greater gender gaps are associated with higher rates of child physical abuse and child neglect.
The authors conclude that based on these findings, efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect might benefit from reducing gender inequity .

Gender and health
Overview
WHO's role
Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed.  This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each other. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time.
Gender is hierarchical and produces inequalities that intersect with other social and economic inequalities.  Gender-based discrimination intersects with other factors of discrimination, such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, age, geographic location, gender identity and sexual orientation, among others. This is referred to as intersectionality.
Gender interacts with but is different from sex, which refers to the different biological and physiological characteristics of females, males and intersex persons, such as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs. Gender and sex are related to but different from gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person’s deeply felt, internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at birth.
Gender influences people’s experience of and access to healthcare. The way that health services are organized and provided can either limit or enable a person’s access to healthcare information, support and services, and the outcome of those encounters. Health services should be affordable, accessible and acceptable to all, and they should be provided with quality, equity and dignity.
Gender inequality and discrimination faced by women and girls puts their health and well-being at risk.  Women and girls often face greater barriers than men and boys to accessing health information and services. These barriers include restrictions on mobility; lack of access to decision-making power; lower literacy rates; discriminatory attitudes of communities and healthcare providers; and lack of training and awareness amongst healthcare providers and health systems of the specific health needs and challenges of women and girls.
Consequently, women and girls face greater risks of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, cervical cancer, malnutrition, lower vision, respiratory infections, malnutrition and elder abuse, amongst others. Women and girls also face unacceptably high levels of violence rooted in gender inequality and are at grave risk of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, and child, early and forced marriage. WHO figures show that about 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.
Harmful gender norms – especially those related to rigid notions of masculinity – can also affect boys and men’s health and wellbeing negatively. For example, specific notions of masculinity may encourage boys and men to smoke, take sexual and other health risks, misuse alcohol and not seek help or health care. Such gender norms also contribute to boys and men perpetrating violence – as well as being subjected to violence themselves. They can also have grave implications for their mental health.
Rigid gender norms also negatively affect people with diverse gender identities, who often face violence, stigma and discrimination as a result, including in healthcare settings. Consequently, they are at higher risk of HIV and mental health problems, including suicide.

Alright, so from the search results, it seems like gender inequality affects children in various ways, impacting their health, education, and overall well-being. Let me try to organize my thoughts.

First, gender inequality can lead to differences in how boys and girls are treated within their families and communities. For example, in some cultures, boys might be prioritized for education over girls, which can limit girls' opportunities for learning and personal development. This educational disparity can have long-term effects on their earning potential and social status as adults.

Moreover, gender inequality can influence the types of roles and behaviors that are expected of boys and girls. Stereotypical gender roles can restrict children's choices in terms of activities, interests, and future careers. For instance, girls might be discouraged from pursuing STEM fields, while boys might be pushed away from expressing emotions or seeking help, which can affect their mental health.

Additionally, gender inequality can affect children's health. In some societies, girls may receive less food or medical care compared to boys, leading to higher rates of malnutrition and mortality among girls. Also, gender-based violence, such as female genital mutilation or child marriage, can have severe physical and psychological consequences for young girls.

On the other hand, boys can also be affected by gender inequality. Traditional masculine norms can pressure boys to engage in risky behaviors or suppress their emotions, which can lead to poor mental health outcomes and higher rates of substance abuse or suicide.

It's also important to consider how gender inequality intersects with other forms of discrimination, such as race, class, and sexual orientation. Children who belong to marginalized groups may face compounded disadvantages that further exacerbate the effects of gender inequality.

From the search results, I saw that policies aimed at reducing gender inequality, such as providing tuition-free education and implementing paid parental leave, can have positive impacts on family health and well-being. This suggests that addressing gender inequality through systemic changes can benefit children by creating more equitable environments.

In summary, gender inequality affects children in numerous ways, including limiting their educational and economic opportunities, shaping their behavior and role expectations, impacting their health and safety, and influencing their mental well-being. Addressing these inequalities requires comprehensive approaches that challenge societal norms and implement policies promoting equality and inclusivity.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Gender inequality affects children by limiting their educational and economic opportunities, shaping their behavior and role expectations, impacting their health and safety, and influencing their mental well-being.}} \]
