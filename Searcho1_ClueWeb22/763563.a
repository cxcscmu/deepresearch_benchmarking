So I have this question: "Why did people immigrate to America?" It seems like a pretty broad question, but I'll try to break it down and find some answers. I think the best way to approach this is to consider different time periods and the reasons people had for moving to America at those times.

First, I should probably start with the earliest immigrants. I know that Native Americans are considered the first inhabitants of America, but I think the question is more about people who came to America from other parts of the world. So, let's consider European immigration first.

I recall that Columbus discovered America in 1492, right? Although natives were already here, his arrival marked the beginning of European exploration and eventual settlement. So, why did Europeans start coming to America?

Well, I think one of the main reasons was the promise of land and economic opportunities. In Europe, especially in countries like England, Spain, and France, there was a lot of overcrowding and limited land availability. In America, there was plenty of land to be had, especially as the native populations were displaced.

Also, I think religious freedom played a big role, especially for certain groups like the Pilgrims who came to New England in the early 17th century. They were seeking a place where they could practice their religion without persecution.

Moreover, during the colonial period, many Europeans were lured by the prospects of wealth from natural resources like furs, gold, and silver. The British, for example, established colonies in North America to exploit these resources and establish trade networks.

Moving forward to the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a massive wave of immigration from Europe. People were fleeing poverty, political oppression, and religious persecution in their home countries. For instance, the Irish came in large numbers during the potato famine in the mid-1800s. Similarly, Jews from Eastern Europe fled pogroms and sought better lives in America.

Additionally, the Industrial Revolution created job opportunities in American cities, attracting immigrants looking for work in factories and other industries.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was also significant immigration from Asia, particularly China and Japan. Chinese immigrants initially came to work on railroad construction and in mining, while Japanese immigrants were drawn to agricultural opportunities in places like California.

However, it's important to note that immigration policies were not always welcoming. For example, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted Chinese immigration, reflecting racial prejudices of the time.

Shifting to more recent history, in the mid-20th century, after World War II, there was another wave of immigration, although perhaps not as massive as earlier periods. People from war-torn Europe and other parts of the world sought refuge in America.

Then, in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, immigration patterns have shifted, with a significant increase in immigrants from Latin America and Asia. People come to America seeking better economic opportunities, escaping political instability or violence in their home countries, or reuniting with family members already in the U.S.

For example, many Mexicans have come to the U.S. to find work, given the higher wages compared to Mexico. Similarly, people from countries like Vietnam, India, and the Philippines have immigrated to America for educational and professional opportunities.

It's also worth mentioning that some immigrants come for education, attending American universities and choosing to stay after graduation.

Furthermore, America has been a destination for asylum seekers and refugees fleeing conflict zones, such as those from Syria, Afghanistan, and Haiti.

So, summarizing, the reasons for immigration to America have included economic opportunities, escape from persecution or poverty, seeking political freedom, family reunification, education, and refuge from conflict.

However, I feel like I'm scratching the surface here. There must be more nuanced reasons and varying motivations depending on the time period and the immigrants' backgrounds.

Maybe I should look into specific waves of immigration to get a better understanding. For instance, the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrial North in the early 20th century was driven by the search for better jobs and to escape racial discrimination and violence.

Similarly, during the 1960s and 1970s, there was an increase in immigration from Asia, partly due to changes in U.S. immigration policy that abolished national origin quotas and allowed for more diverse immigration.

I also recall that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 played a significant role in shaping modern immigration patterns by emphasizing family reunification and skilled labor.

Moreover, the diversity visa program, established in 1990, aims to attract immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S., promoting diversity.

But beyond these macro-level factors, there are personal stories and individual motivations behind each immigrant's decision to come to America.

Perhaps to get a more comprehensive answer, I should look for statistics on immigration trends and the stated reasons for immigration.

Maybe I can find some data from government sources or academic studies.

Wait, perhaps I should perform a web search to gather more precise information.

Let me try that.

What Are the Reasons Why People Immigrated to America?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 30, 2020

People immigrated to America for a variety of reasons, most of which involved seeking personal, religious or economic freedom. The largest reason for immigration, however, was poverty. People left their home countries, where they had low wages and poor living conditions, to go to America and attempt to create a better life for them and their families.
Immigration in the United States is divided into four eras: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century and post-1965. Each era brought with it a different major group of immigrants and a different reason for immigrating.
During the colonial period, immigrants came to America to flee religious or economic persecution and to attempt to establish a better life for themselves. However, the 1790 Act limited entry to “free white persons.”
The mid-19th century brought immigrants mainly from northern Europe, and they came as indentured servants. During the early 20th century, the main bulk of immigrants came from Southern and Eastern Europe to escape famine and war. The peak year for immigration was during this time. In 1907, 1,285,349 immigrants came into America. This period was also when the Great Depression hit, which caused many impoverished immigrants to try to find a better life in America. Late in this period, immigrants came to America to avoid World War I and World War II, and to be free from Nazi persecution.
The most recent period for immigration was the post-1965 period. These immigrants were predominantly Hispanic and Asian. In recent years, immigrants have come up from Mexico to flee from violence and poverty.

Why Did Immigrants Come to America?
By Staff Writer Last Updated April 03, 2020
Tetra Images/N/A/Getty Images
Immigrants came to America for many reasons, but most came for the possibilities of a free society which would allow them to better their lives and to practice their religion freely. The initial American immigrants, known as the Pilgrims, came because they did not want to be persecuted for their religious beliefs.
The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock and originally came from Europe. The English created the first permanent settlements at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony. From there, dissidents came to America so that they could continue to speak out when they were silenced in their own countries. Then new immigrants came to better their lives and that of their families. Of course, the original inhabitants of America were those who crossed the land bridge that used to exist between Asia and North America.
Since World War II, more than four million refugees have come to America in order to find safety and freedom. They flourish in the creative openness that the United States has to offer. However, since the early 1850s when a large number of Asian immigrants arrived, seduced by the California gold rush, the anti-immigrant sentiment has grown. Many native-born Americans were concerned that immigrants would become unwanted competition for jobs. Immigration policy was primarily handled by the states, but the federal government stepped in during 1890.

Additionally, it is worth noting that America was a colony of Britain. Therefore, America received a significant number of immigrants during the colonial period. However, during this era, the immigration policy did not exist. Nonetheless, the largest wave of immigrants arrived in America in the 20 th century. This essay provides an insight into the History of immigration in America.
The colonial period, in America, lasted from 1607 to 1776. During this period, majority of immigrants were Britons. In fact, by 1790, sixty percent of the population in Jamestown (Virginia) and Plymouth (Massachusetts) was from Britain. Most of these immigrants came to America for economic reasons. However, some arrived in search of religious freedom. The Germans, who began arriving in America around early to mid 1700s, were the second major group to arrive.
However, they lived in rural areas and resisted assimilation by other cultures. Additionally, from the start of the colonial period until the abolition of slave trade, America received many immigrants from Africa. These were slaves meant to work in plantations. Therefore, they were involuntary immigrants. About eleven to twelve million African slaves were shipped to the Americas between the 16 th and 20 th Centuries.
The first large-scale wave of immigrants occurred between 1820 and 1880. In this time, over ten million immigrants arrived in America. The most notable immigrants were the Irish. Three million people migrated from Ireland to the US supposedly to escape the potato famine. Furthermore, the second wave of immigrants took place between 1880 to1930. In this episode alone, America received 27.5 million immigrants.
This group was from Southern and Eastern Europe. Moreover, they were Catholics and did not speak English. The Jewish also migrated to America during this time. However, they were more skilled than the earlier group. For that reason, it was easier for them to settle than the group from Eastern and Southern Europe. Additionally, the first wave of Asian immigrant was between 1840 and 1924.
These were mainly Chinese and Japanese immigrants. The Japanese settled in the rural farms where they worked as agricultural contract workers. On the other hand, the Chinese worked on Hawaiian plantations, mines and railroads. The largest wave of immigrants came after 1965. A significant number of Mexicans entered America during this wave.

Uncontrolled immigration caused a major crisis in the US. Consequently, there was a need to develop restrictive immigration policies. For that reason, a literacy test was developed in 1917. This was followed by the immigration act of 1924 and later the Hart Cellar Act of 1965.
In the immigration act of 1924, the total immigration was restricted to 165,000 people per year while only 2% of all immigrants were to come from the same country. On the other hand, the Hart Cellar Act of 1965 restricted immigration to family unification and employment visas. In addition, the act placed ceilings on immigrants from certain hemispheres.
In conclusion, it is worth noting that America’s immigration history is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the various ethnic groups within it. Additionally, the controversy in the immigration has stood for a long period of time. Therefore, failure to control the number and type of immigration in America is not a new thing.

Alright, I've got some information from these documents. Let me see what I can make of it.

First, Doc 1 from Reference.com gives a general overview of why people immigrated to America throughout history. It mentions that the primary reasons were seeking personal, religious, or economic freedom, and that poverty was a major factor driving immigration. It divides immigration history into four eras: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, the start of the 20th century, and post-1965. Each era had different groups of immigrants and different reasons for coming.

The colonial period saw immigrants fleeing religious or economic persecution, while the mid-19th century brought immigrants as indentured servants, mostly from northern Europe. The start of the 20th century saw immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe fleeing famine and war, and trying to escape the Great Depression and World Wars. The post-1965 period has seen a rise in Hispanic and Asian immigrants, often fleeing violence and poverty.

Doc 2 from Lexington Abogado also discusses the main reasons immigrants come to America, reiterating the pursuit of economic opportunity, religious freedom, and escape from poverty or oppression. It notes that family reunification is another key reason, and mentions that recent immigrants often come from Mexico to escape violence and poverty.

Doc 3 from another Reference.com page focuses more specifically on why immigrants came to America, highlighting the Pilgrims' search for religious freedom and the economic opportunities that drew people to the New World. It also mentions the initial immigration of Asians during the California gold rush and the subsequent anti-immigrant sentiments that arose due to fears of job competition.

Doc 4 is an essay on American immigration history, providing a timeline of immigration waves. It details the colonial period with British immigrants, followed by Germans and Africans (as slaves). The first large-scale wave from 1820 to 1880 included Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine, and the second wave from 1880 to 1930 consisted largely of Southern and Eastern Europeans, many of whom were Catholics and non-English speakers. The essay also mentions the immigration of Asians, particularly Chinese and Japanese, who worked in agriculture and other manual labor jobs. The largest wave after 1965 was predominantly Mexican immigrants.

The essay also touches on the development of restrictive immigration policies in response to uncontrolled immigration, including literacy tests, the Immigration Act of 1924, and the Hart-Celler Act of 1965, which shifted the focus to family reunification and employment-based visas.

Doc 5 from Frank Slide blog repeats some of the points made in the previous documents, emphasizing that immigrants came to America seeking economic opportunity, political freedom, and to escape famine and poverty.

From these documents, it's clear that immigration to America has been driven by a combination of push factors (problems in the home country like poverty, persecution, war) and pull factors (attractive features of America like economic opportunities, religious freedom, and family ties).

However, I feel like there might be more specific reasons or perhaps some less obvious factors that drove immigration. Maybe I should look into the impact of immigration policies on immigration patterns or the role of American industry in attracting workers.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find information on how immigration affected American society and economy, which might give me more insights into why people came.

Wait, maybe I should look for statistics on immigration trends over time to see if there are correlations with events in home countries or changes in American policies.

Let me try another search.

Editor’s Note: The U.S. Census Bureau experienced significant challenges collecting data in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and released only a small number of data points from its 2020 American Community Survey, which it called “experimental.” As a result, this Spotlight has to rely on 2019 data for a number of sociodemographic and economic characteristics of immigrants and the U.S. born, with some of the trends it describes predating the pandemic.
U.S. immigration trends and policies underwent a series of dramatic changes over the last year. Wide COVID-19 vaccine availability in the United States and other wealthy countries led to easing of travel restrictions and gave new life to international mobility and the global economy. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s inauguration brought new policy priorities designed to increase migrant protections and smooth immigrants’ arrival into the country, in sharp contrast to the restrictive approach of the prior Trump administration. Among these was the Biden administration’s extension of temporary protections to just under 475,000 Venezuelans, Afghans, Ukrainians, and Burmese already in the United States, following global crises around the world. At the same time, a record-breaking number of apprehensions and expulsions occurred on the southern border, and continued slowdowns of government services due to the pandemic and other factors contributed to delayed immigration processing.
This Spotlight offers information about the approximately 44.9 million immigrants in the United States by compiling the most authoritative and current data available. It provides an overview of historic immigration trends in the United States, sociodemographic information about who is immigrating, through which channels, and how many immigrants become naturalized citizens. It also provides data on the government’s enforcement actions and adjudication efforts to process visas.
This article draws on statistics from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI); the U.S. Census Bureau (using its 2019 American Community Survey [ACS], 2021 Current Population Survey [CPS], and 2000 decennial census); and the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and State. (Note: DHS and State Department data refer to fiscal years that begin on October 1 and end on September 30; ACS and CPS data refer to calendar years). For more detailed information on U.S. and global immigration data sources and one-click access to these datasets, see the MPI report Immigration Data Matters. All the data tools and maps linked to in this article also can be accessed through MPI’s Migration Data Hub.

Definitions
"Foreign born" and "immigrant" are used interchangeably and refer to persons with no U.S. citizenship at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, persons on certain temporary visas, and unauthorized immigrants.
Geographical regions: MPI follows the definition of Latin America as put forth by the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau, which spans Central America (including Mexico), the Caribbean, and South America. For more information about geographical regions, see the U.S. Census Bureau and United Nations Statistics Division.
Immigrants Now and Historically
How many immigrants reside in the United States?
More than 44.9 million immigrants lived in the United States in 2019, the historical numeric high since census records have been kept. In 2019, immigrants comprised 13.7 percent of the total U.S. population, a figure that remains short of the record high of 14.8 percent in 1890.
The foreign-born population remained largely flat between 2018 and 2019, with an increase of 204,000 people, or growth of less than 0.5 percent. This is consistent with the 203,000 increase from 2017 to 2018 and much lower than the approximately 787,000 increase—or nearly 2 percent growth—between 2016 and 2017. The slowing growth of the immigrant population over the past few years is mirrored by the slowing growth of the overall U.S. population since 2015.
How have the number and share of immigrants changed over time?
In 1850, the first year the United States began collecting nativity data through the census, the country had 2.2 million immigrants, representing nearly 10 percent of the total population.
Between 1860 and 1920, immigrants’ share of the population fluctuated between 13 percent and almost 15 percent, peaking at 14.8 percent in 1890, largely due to high levels of immigration from Europe. Restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924 limited permanent immigration almost exclusively to northern and western Europeans. Combined with the Great Depression and World War II, this led to a sharp drop in new arrivals from the Eastern Hemisphere. The foreign-born share steadily declined, hitting a record low of 4.7 percent (or 9.6 million immigrants) in 1970 (see Figure 1).

Sources: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau, 2010-19 American Community Surveys (ACS), and 1970, 1990, and 2000 decennial census. All other data are from Campbell J. Gibson and Emily Lennon, "Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850 to 1990" (Working Paper no. 29, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 1999).
Since 1970, the share and number of immigrants have increased rapidly, mainly because of increased immigration from Latin America and Asia. Important shifts in U.S. immigration law were responsible for this change in flows, including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which abolished national-origin admission quotas, the creation of a formal refugee resettlement program with the Refugee Act of 1980, and the Cold War-era grant of preferential treatment to Cuban immigrants. Other factors were the United States’ growing economic and military presence in Asia and Latin America, as well as economic and social ties with the United States’ southern neighbors, and major economic transformations and political instability in countries around the world.

Where are most immigrants from originally?
Mexicans are the largest group of U.S. immigrants, comprising 24 percent of the total immigrant population in 2019, which is a decline from 30 percent in 2000. China (including Hong Kong and Macao but not Taiwan) and India were the origins of the next two largest immigrant groups, each accounting for approximately 6 percent of the overall foreign-born population. Other top countries of origin include the Philippines (5 percent); El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic (3 percent each); and Guatemala and Korea (each 2 percent).
Together, these ten countries accounted for 57 percent of all immigrants in the United States in 2019.
To learn more about key immigrant populations, check out the Migration Information Source ’s Spotlights archive. These articles provide data profiles of a range of individual immigrant groups in the United States including Mexicans, Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Cubans, and other countries and regions all over the world.
How do today’s top countries of origin compare to those of the past?
The large numbers of immigrants from Latin America and Asia in recent decades represent a sharp turnaround from the mid-1900s, when immigration largely came from Europe. In the 1960s no single country accounted for more than 15 percent of the U.S. immigrant population, but Italians were the top origin group, making up 13 percent of the foreign born in 1960, followed by Germans and Canadians (about 10 percent each).
Immigrants from Mexico were the most numerous for decades after 1970, but the composition of new arrivals has changed since 2010. Now, immigrants are more likely to come from Asia, with India and China leading the way. In fact, in 2013 India and China displaced Mexico as the top origin countries for new arrivals.
The number of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Cuba, Venezuela, Guatemala, and El Salvador has also increased since 2010. By contrast, the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States declined by more than 779,000 between 2010 and 2019, representing the largest absolute decline of all immigrant groups.
Among the groups with at least 100,000 immigrants in the United States in 2019, the Venezuelan immigrant population increased the most between 2010 and 2019 (by 153 percent), followed by individuals from Afghanistan (143 percent), Nepal (140 percent), Myanmar (also known as Burma; 84 percent), and Nigeria (79 percent).

How long have current immigrants resided in the United States?
Fifty-one percent of all immigrants in the United States in 2019 arrived prior to 2000 (29 percent entered before 1990 and 21 percent between 1990 and 1999), while 25 percent entered between 2000 and 2009. The remaining 25 percent have come since 2010.
How many U.S. residents are from immigrant families?
Immigrants and their U.S.-born children number approximately 84.8 million people, or 26 percent of the U.S. population in the 2021 CPS, a decline of approximately 950,000 from 2020. The Pew Research Center has projected that the immigrant-origin share of the population will rise to about 36 percent by 2065.
Demographic, Educational, and Linguistic Characteristics
Definitions
College-educated persons are defined as adults 25 years and older with a bachelor's degree or higher.
Race as used by the U.S. Census Bureau reflects the race or races with which individuals most closely self-identify. Race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.
Hispanic and Latino are ethnic, not racial, categories. They include individuals who classified themselves in one of the specific Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino categories listed on the decennial census and American Community Survey questionnaire—"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban"—as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino origin." Persons who indicated that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino" include those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people who self-identify more generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on.
Read more about the U.S. Census Bureau’s definitions on its website.
What is the median age for immigrants?
The immigrant population’s median age in 2019 was 45.7 years, making it older than the U.S.-born population, which had a median age of 36.5 years. One reason for this is that the immigrant population is comprised of people who arrive largely as adults, whereas immigrants’ children born in the United States contribute to the younger median age of the U.S.-born population.
Fewer than 1 percent of immigrants were under age 5 in 2019, compared to 7 percent of the U.S.-born population in this age group. Children and youth ages 5 to 17 years accounted for 5 percent of immigrants and 18 percent of the U.S. born. People of working age (18 to 64 years) comprised 78 percent of the immigrant population, a much higher figure than the 59 percent of those born in the United States. Approximately 17 percent of immigrants were 65 years and older, similar to the 16 percent of the U.S. born in this age group.
What is the sex ratio of the immigrant population?
Slightly more immigrants are women and girls than men or boys; in 2019, about 52 percent of all U.S. immigrants were female. The share has fluctuated slightly over the past four decades, but females tend to be a slight majority. They accounted for 53 percent of the immigrant population in 1980, 51 percent in 1990, 50 percent in 2000, and 51 percent in 2010.
What is the racial makeup of immigrants?
In 2019, 45 percent of immigrants reported their race as single-race White, 27 percent as Asian, 10 percent as Black, and 15 percent as some other race. About 2 percent reported having two or more races.
Use the State Immigration Data Profiles from MPI’s Migration Data Hub to learn more about the demographic characteristics of immigrants and the U.S. born (including age, race, and ethnicity) in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and nationwide.
How many immigrants are Hispanic or Latino?
In 2019, 44 percent of U.S. immigrants (19.8 million people) reported having Hispanic or Latino ethnic origins.
Note: The Census Bureau classifies Hispanic and Latino as ethnic categories, separate from the racial categories listed above (see Definitions box for more information).
How many Hispanics in the United States are immigrants?
Most U.S. Hispanics are U.S. born. Of the 60.5 million people in 2019 who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, 33 percent (19.8 million) were immigrants and 67 percent (40.6 million) were native born.
Which languages are most frequently spoken at home?
In 2019, approximately 78 percent (241 million) of all 308.8 million U.S. residents ages 5 and older regardless of nativity reported speaking only English at home. The remaining 22 percent (67.8 million) reported speaking a language other than English at home.
Among those who reported speaking a language other than English at home, 62 percent spoke Spanish. Other top languages were Chinese (including Mandarin and Cantonese, 5 percent); Tagalog (almost 3 percent); and Vietnamese, Arabic, French (including Cajun), and Korean (about 2 percent each) (see Table 1).
Table 1. Languages Spoken at Home Other than English (ages 5 and older), 2019
Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2019 ACS.
Not including English, Spanish was the most common language spoken at home in all but four states: Alaska (where the Eskimo-Aleut languages dominated), Hawaii (Ilocano, Samoan, Hawaiian, Marshallese, or other Austronesian languages), and Maine and Vermont (French) (see Figure 2).

Data for these 15 jurisdictions are from the U.S. Census Bureau pooled 2015-19 ACS.
How many immigrants are Limited English Proficient (LEP)?
In 2019, approximately 46 percent (20.7 million) of the 44.6 million immigrants ages 5 and older were Limited English Proficient (LEP). Immigrants accounted for 81 percent of the country’s 25.5 million LEP individuals.
Note: The term "Limited English Proficient" refers to persons ages 5 and older who reported speaking English "not at all," "not well," or "well" on their survey questionnaire. Individuals who reported speaking “only English” or speaking English "very well" are considered proficient in English.
MPI has compiled information on the size of the LEP population across the United States and by state in the data table Limited English Proficient Population: Number and Share, by State, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2019.
What share of the immigrant population has a college education?
In 2019, 33 percent (12.9 million) of the 39.5 million immigrants ages 25 and older had a bachelor’s degree or higher, similar to U.S.-born adults (see Figure 3). However, newer arrivals tend to be better educated; 48 percent of immigrants who entered the country between 2014 and 2019 held at least a bachelor’s degree.

Educational attainment varies by immigrants’ country of origin. Almost 80 percent of immigrant adults from India had a bachelor’s degree or more in 2019, more than any other origin country. Other top countries were Zimbabwe (74 percent), Taiwan (73 percent), the United Arab Emirates and Belarus (70 percent each), and Singapore (69 percent).

Immigrant Destinations
Which U.S. states have the largest numbers of immigrants?
The U.S. states with the most immigrants in 2019 were California (10.6 million), Texas (5 million), Florida (4.5 million), New York (4.4 million), and New Jersey (2.1 million).
As a percentage of the total population, immigrants made up the largest shares in California (27 percent), New Jersey (23 percent), New York (22 percent), Florida (21 percent), and Nevada (20 percent).

Which states have experienced the fastest growth of their immigrant populations?
Traditional immigrant destinations have the largest absolute number of new immigrants. But other states have seen much larger relative growth in their immigrant populations. In some cases this is because the states’ initial foreign-born populations were quite small, so a relatively small absolute increase has translated into high-percent growth (see Table 2). For instance, more immigrants moved to Florida between 2010 and 2019 than any other state (868,000), but the size of the immigrant population in South Dakota grew by a larger relative share (68 percent).

Immigrants in the Labor Force
Definition
The civilian labor force is comprised of civilians ages 16 and older who were either employed or unemployed but looking for work in the week prior to participation in the American Community Survey or decennial census.
How many immigrants are in the U.S. civilian labor force?
Immigrants constituted 17 percent (28.6 million people) of the civilian labor force (166.3 million) in 2019, which comprises both employed and unemployed people. Immigrant participation in the labor force has more than tripled since 1970, when immigrants accounted for approximately 5 percent of the civilian labor force.

What types of jobs do immigrants perform?
Of the 27.6 million employed foreign-born workers ages 16 and older in 2019, the largest share (35 percent) worked in management, professional, and related occupations (see Figure 4).

Income and Poverty
Immigrants tend to have slightly lower incomes than the native born. Immigrant households in 2019 had a median income of $63,550, compared to $66,040 for native-born households.
Fourteen percent of immigrants were poor (that is, with family incomes below the official poverty threshold of $25,750 for a family of four in 2019), compared to 12 percent of the U.S. born.
Health Insurance Coverage
What share of immigrants have health insurance?
Approximately 58 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2019 (compared to 69 percent of the U.S. born), and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage (compared to 36 percent of the U.S. born). Meanwhile, about 20 percent lacked health insurance (compared to slightly less than 8 percent of the U.S. born).
Since implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014, health insurance coverage rates have improved for both the U.S. born and immigrants. From 2013 to 2017, the rate of uninsured immigrants fell from 32 percent to 20 percent, and the rate for the native born fell from 12 percent to 7 percent. The Trump administration made a number of changes to ACA policies, including eliminating the individual coverage mandate penalty, ending cost-sharing subsidies to insurers, and cutting funding for navigator programs. The rates of those uninsured has since remained mostly level.
Note: Health insurance coverage is calculated only for the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Since some people may simultaneously hold both private and public health insurance coverage, estimates of those with public health insurance and those with public coverage may overlap. The sum of these rates therefore may be greater than the total share of people with health insurance.
Children of Immigrants
Definitions
First-generation immigrant children are any foreign-born children with at least one foreign-born parent.
Second-generation immigrant children are any U.S.-born children with at least one foreign-born parent.
Children with immigrant parents are both first- and second-generation immigrant children.
Note: The estimates in this section include only children under age 18 who reside with at least one parent.
How many U.S. children live with immigrant parents?
Approximately 17.8 million U.S. children under age 18 lived with at least one immigrant parent in 2019. They accounted for 26 percent of the 68.9 million children under age 18 in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2000 and 13 percent in 1990.
Most of these children are themselves native born. Second-generation immigrant children born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent accounted for 88 percent (15.6 million) of all children with immigrant parents. The remaining 12 percent (2.2 million) were born outside the United States.
Note: Beginning with the 2014 ACS, the U.S. Census Bureau has excluded children of same-sex married couples from the total number of children; the same information is unavailable by parental nativity.
For information on children living with immigrant parents by age and in different states, see the Children in U.S. Immigrant Families data tool.
How has the number of children in immigrant families changed over time?
Between 2010 and 2019, the number of children ages 17 and under with immigrant parents grew by 5 percent, from 17 million to 17.8 million. This was a significantly smaller rate of growth than during the 2000-2010 era, when the number grew by 30 percent, from 13.1 million.
This growth has been driven by the increasing number of children born in the United States to immigrant parents, which has gone up steadily since 2000. Their numbers increased by 7 percent between 2010 and 2019, from 14.6 million up to 15.6 million. This followed rapid growth of 40 percent between 2000—when their population was 10.4 million—to 2010.
Meanwhile, the population of first-generation immigrant children born outside the United States has declined over the last 20 years. It dropped by 9 percent between 2010 and 2019, from 2.4 million to 2.2 million, after a 12 percent drop during the 2000-2010 period, at the start of which there were 2.7 million first-generation immigrant children.
How many children living with immigrant parents are in low-income families?
Regardless of nativity, 25.6 million children under 18 lived in families with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold in 2019. Of them, nearly 8 million (or 31 percent) had one or more foreign-born parent.
Of the 17.8 million children of immigrants, 45 percent were in low-income families. This is a higher rate than for children of U.S.-born parents (35 percent of the 51.1 million).
For state-level estimates of children of immigrants and share in low-income families, see the Demographic and Social Profiles in the State Immigration Data Profiles.
In which states do most children in immigrant families live?
In terms of absolute numbers, the top states for children under age 18 living with immigrant parents in 2019 were California (4 million), Texas (2.4 million), New York and Florida (1.4 million each), and New Jersey (769,000). These states accounted for 56 percent of the 17.8 million U.S. children with immigrant parents.
In terms of the share of children who had immigrant parents, the top states in 2019 were California (47 percent of all children in the state), New Jersey (41 percent), Nevada (38 percent), New York (36 percent), and Texas (35 percent).
Which states have experienced the fastest growth of the number of children in immigrant families?
Traditional immigrant destinations such as Texas and Florida experienced the largest absolute growth in the number of children with immigrant parents in recent years, but other states have seen much larger relative growth (see Table 3). In states such as North Dakota, the initial number of children with immigrant parents was quite small, so relatively small absolute increases have translated into high-percent growth.

Permanent Immigration
How many immigrants obtain lawful permanent residence (also known as getting a green card)?
In fiscal year (FY) 2020, slightly more than 707,000 immigrants became lawful permanent residents (LPRs, also known as green-card holders), the lowest number since 2003 and the first time the figure dropped below 1 million since 2013, when 991,000 people obtained green cards. The number of new LPRs in FY 2020 was approximately 324,000 lower than in FY 2019 (a decline of 31 percent), and represented a decrease of 476,000 (a 40 percent decline) from the recent high of 1.2 million in FY 2016.
Much of the decline in new LPRs in FY 2020 is due to the fewer number granted to individuals living outside the country, as result of processing and other delays during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past decade, immigrants obtaining LPR status have been on average about evenly divided between those already living in the United States who are adjusting their status and those applying from abroad. But in FY 2020 the 268,000 new green cards issued to applicants abroad represented just 38 percent of the total, and a 41 percent decline from the nearly 454,000 issued in FY 2019. The overwhelming majority of these new arrivals (82 percent) were immediate family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs.
Meanwhile, approximately 62 percent (or 439,000) of the 707,000 new LPRs in FY 2020 received green cards from within the United States. Most of these new permanent residents were spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs, followed by people who obtained their green cards through employment or after initially entering the country as refugees and asylees.

For more on the impact of immigration backlogs during the COVID-19 pandemic, read the U.S. Policy Beat article “ Mounting Backlogs Undermine U.S. Immigration System and Impede Biden Policy Changes .”
Under which categories are permanent immigrants admitted?
There are four main pathways to obtain a green card: through a family relationship, employment sponsorship, humanitarian protection (for refugees and asylees), and the Diversity Visa (DV) lottery (also known as the green-card lottery). Some categories within these pathways are capped at the number of new green cards that can be issued each year.
Of the 707,000 immigrants who received green cards in FY 2020, 45 percent were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens (an uncapped visa category), followed by 17 percent were family-related immigrants (whose admission is limited by visa and country caps). About 21 percent of new LPRs were sponsored by their employers or self-petitioned, including investors who create jobs, a jump from just 14 percent of new LPRs in FY 2019. Meanwhile, 9 percent adjusted from refugee or asylee status and approximately 4 percent were diversity lottery winners.
What are the most common countries of origin for new permanent immigrants?
The top five countries of birth for new LPRs in FY 2020 were Mexico (14 percent), India (7 percent), mainland China (6 percent), and the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and the Philippines (4 percent apiece). Together, these countries represented about 39 percent of all new green-card recipients in FY 2020.
How many people are selected in the Diversity Visa lottery and where do they come from?
The Diversity Visa lottery is available to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Created in 1990, the lottery sets aside 55,000 green cards annually, of which 5,000 must be used for applicants under the Nicaraguan and Central America Relief Act of 1997. Interest in the lottery is significantly higher than the amount of available visas; about 6.7 million qualified applications were filed for the DV-2021, covering 11.8 million applicants plus their spouses and minor children. This number was down from 14.7 million applications in DV-2020 and 14.4 million in DV-2019. (The number of applications varies each year in part because the list of eligible countries is modified annually.) Before receiving permission to immigrate, lottery winners must provide proof of a high school education or its equivalent or show two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience. They also must pass a medical exam and a background check.
In FY 2020, 25,000 people received a green card as diversity immigrants, representing approximately 4 percent of the 707,000 new LPRs.
The leading countries of birth of DV recipients were Nepal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, together accounting for about 14 percent of DV entrants adjusting to LPR status in FY 2020. Other top countries of origin were Egypt and Russia (6 percent each), Albania (5 percent), and Ukraine, Sudan, and Algeria (4 percent each).
For some countries, the Diversity Visa lottery represents a major share of all new LPRs. For example, 59 percent of all nationals of Algeria who obtained LPR status in FY 2020 did so through the green-card lottery. Shares were also high for nationals of Tajikistan (58 percent), Benin (52 percent), Sudan (50 percent), and Azerbaijan (48 percent).

Temporary Visas
Definition
Nonimmigrants are citizens of other countries who come to the United States temporarily for a specific purpose, such as education or tourism. There are more than 80 classes of nonimmigrant visas, including temporary workers and trainees, religious workers, intracompany transferees, foreign students, visitors for business or for pleasure, international representatives, and foreign government officials. Most classes of nonimmigrants must have a permanent home abroad, and most can be accompanied by a spouse and minor children. Nonimmigrants are restricted to the activities allowed by their visa while in the United States.
How many nonimmigrant visas does the State Department issue each year?
The 2.8 million nonimmigrant visas issued by the State Department in FY 2021—which include tourists and other short-term visitors—represented a 30 percent decline from the 4 million issued in FY 2020, and marked the sixth year in a row that these numbers have gone down.
Forty-eight percent of the nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2021 were temporary business and tourist visas (B and BCC visas). The next largest visa class was for academic students and exchange visitors and their family members (F and J visa categories), which comprised 19 percent, and 17 percent was for temporary workers and trainees and their family members (H visa categories).
The Trump administration’s travel ban, which was extended to six other countries in early 2020, was one reason for the sharp decline in nonimmigrant visa issuances in FY 2021. On June 22, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending the issuance of certain nonimmigrant visas including H-1B visas (for temporary workers in specialty occupations), H-2B visas (for nonagricultural workers), certain J visas (for exchange visitors), and L visas (for intracompany transferees), as well as recipients’ dependents. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a global slowdown in international mobility and a slew of border restrictions, continues keeping the number of visas issued down.
Note: The number of visas issued does not necessarily match the number of foreign nationals who entered the United States that year because some nonimmigrant visas may not be used.

How many nonimmigrant admissions does DHS grant each year?
Foreign nationals were admitted into the United States for nonimmigrant purposes 86 million times in FY 2020—a 54 percent decrease from the 186 million in 2019. Of the 86 million, nearly 49 million were admissions of Canadians and Mexicans traveling for business or pleasure, who are exempt from completing the I-94 arrival/departure form at the port of entry; DHS does not provide characteristics for this group.
The remaining 37.2 million temporary admissions of nonimmigrants who filled out the I-94 form were similarly 54 percent fewer than the 81.6 million admissions a year earlier. Most were admissions of tourists (77 percent) or business travelers (11 percent), followed by temporary workers and their families (7 percent; see Table 4).
Table 4. Nonimmigrant Admissions by Category, FY 2020 (I-94 only)
Note: Nonimmigrant admissions represent the number of entries. Individuals may have multiple entries within the year. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Immigration Statistics reports characteristics of nonimmigrants who must complete an I-94 arrival/departure form at entry.
Source: MPI tabulation of data from DHS, 2020 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (Washington, DC: DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, 2022), available online.
These data are for the number of times people were admitted into the country—not the number of individuals who were admitted (in other words, a single individual can be admitted multiple times in a year). Often, these people stay in the United States for only a short period, such as for the duration of their vacation or business trip. Only once has the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) estimated the number of individuals who came temporarily, in FY 2016. For that year, DHS estimated that 42.7 million individuals entered as I-94 nonimmigrants on various temporary visas, each of whom was admitted 1.8 times on average.
Most of these nonimmigrants—34.2 million—entered as tourists, followed by 3.7 million as business visitors. Of these, 15 million tourists and 1.7 million business travelers were from Visa Waiver Program countries, meaning they did not need a visa to enter the United States. An additional 1 million international students entered on F-1 visas. OIS additionally estimated that about 290,300 individuals were admitted on high-skilled worker H-1B visas (mostly from India, China, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Mexico) and 81,600 on nonagricultural temporary or seasonal worker H-2B visas (mostly from Mexico, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa, and Canada).
Note: Nonimmigrant admissions represent the number of entries. Individuals may have multiple entries within the year.

How many U.S. residents have temporary visas?
According to DHS, 3.2 million foreign nationals on various temporary visas resided in the United States during FY 2019, up from about 2.8 million in FY 2018. About half (1.6 million) were temporary workers and their families, followed by 35 percent who were foreign students and their families (1.1 million).
Sixty percent of temporary-visa holders residing in the United States were from Asia, while 17 percent were from elsewhere in North America and 14 percent were from Europe. The top countries of origin were India (27 percent), China (14 percent), Mexico (9 percent), Canada (6 percent), and South Korea (3 percent). Together, these five countries accounted for approximately 60 percent of all U.S. residents on temporary visas.
Note: The population of residents holding temporary visas includes temporary workers, international students, exchange visitors, diplomats, and representatives of foreign governments and international organizations. It excludes tourists and other short-term visitors. North America includes Canada, Bermuda, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Notes on Refugees and Asylees
What is the difference between a refugee and an asylee? In the United States, the main difference is the person's location at the time of application. Refugees are nearly always outside the United States when they are considered for resettlement, whereas asylum seekers submit their applications while physically present in or at a port of entry to the United States.
Asylum seekers can submit an asylum request either affirmatively or defensively. The affirmative asylum process applies to people who initially file an asylum application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as well as those who subsequently have their application referred by USCIS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The defensive asylum process applies to people in removal proceedings who appear before EOIR and people who apply for asylum at U.S. borders and points of entry.
Refugees and Asylum Seekers
How many refugees enter the United States each year, and where were they from?
Every year, the president in consultation with Congress sets the annual refugee admissions ceiling and allocations by region of origin. The Trump administration set the ceiling at 15,000 in FY 2021 and 18,000 in FY 2020, down from 30,000 in FY 2019 and the lowest since the resettlement program was formally created in 1980. The Biden administration subsequently revised the FY 2021 limit to 62,500 and doubled the number to 125,000 for FY 2022.
Due to the limited capacity of the resettlement program and COVID-19-related logistic challenges, only 11,411 refugees were resettled in the United States in FY 2021, amounting to 18 percent of the 62,500 allocated spaces for the year. By the end of February 2022, nearly 6,500 refugees arrived in the United States, out of the 125,000 allowed for FY 2022.
In FY 2021, refugees’ primary countries of nationality were the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Myanmar (also known as Burma). Combined, these countries accounted for 75 percent (nearly 8,600) of all refugees resettled that year. Rounding out the top ten were Sudan, Iraq, El Salvador, Eritrea, and Iran. Together, nationals of the top ten countries comprised 89 percent (almost 10,200) of all refugee arrivals in FY 2021 (see Table 5).
Table 5. Top Ten Countries of Refugee Admissions by Nationality, FY 2021
Source: MPI tabulation of Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) data from the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.
As of this writing, 692 refugees from Ukraine had been resettled so far in the United States during the first five and a half months of FY 2022, 62 percent of whom arrived during February 2022.
For more data on refugees, including top resettlement states, read the Migration Information Source Spotlight on “ Refugees and Asylees in the United States .”
Learn more about refugee admissions by year, national origin, and destination with State Department WRAPS data.
What is the sex ratio of the admitted refugee population?
About 48 percent of refugees admitted into the United States in FY 2020 were female.
What are the most common religions of admitted refugees?
Refugees who identified as Christian (including Pentecostalists, Catholics, and Baptists) made up 74 percent of all admitted refugees in FY 2020. Muslim refugees (including Sunni and Shiite) comprised 22 percent of admitted refugees. The remainder included Buddhists (1 percent) and Hindu (under 1 percent). About 1 percent of refugees reported not being affiliated with any religion or being atheists.
Overall, the United States admitted more Christian refugees in the past decade than Muslim ones. Between FY 2010 and FY 2020, Christians represented 48 percent (286,100) of the 601,000 refugees with known religion data, compared to 33 percent (201,000) who were Muslim. FY 2016 marked the only time since 2010 when the United States resettled more Muslim refugees (38,900 individuals, or 46 percent of the total 85,000 refugees in FY 2016) than Christians (44 percent, 37,500 individuals).
Note: Refugee demographic data is based on self-identification, so religious breakdowns include major religions as well as denominations.
What are the most common languages spoken by refugees?
In FY 2020, the top languages spoken by refugees were Ukrainian, Russian, Arabic, and Kiswahili. Rounding the top ten were Spanish, Kinyarwanda, Sgaw Karen, Kibembe, Tigrinya, and Dari. Speakers of the top ten languages made up 71 percent of all refugees resettled that year.
How many asylum applications are filed each year?
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) received approximately 61,000 affirmative asylum applications in FY 2021, the fewest since FY 2014. This marked the fourth year of declining applications after eight years of growth.
Meanwhile, 63,800 defensive asylum applications were filed in FY 2021 with the Department of Justice’s immigration court system, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)—a 59 percent decrease from the 155,000 applications filed in FY 2020.
What is the asylum approval rate?
According to preliminary USCIS data, 28 percent of affirmative asylum petitions completed in FY 2021 were approved, similar to the 27 percent approval rate in FY 2020 and a slight decrease from the 31 percent in FY 2019 and 30 percent in FY 2018.
Approvals of asylum petitions handled by immigration courts rebounded in FY 2021 after undergoing a steady downward trend: 34 percent of such applications were approved, versus 26 percent in FY 2020, 29 percent in FY 2019, 33 percent in FY 2018, 37 percent in FY 2017, and 43 percent in FY 2016.
How many people receive asylum status?
In FY 2019, 46,500 individuals were granted asylum after seeking protection upon or after arrival in the United States, including principal applicants and their spouses and/or unmarried children under age 21. This represented a 24 percent increase from the 37,600 people granted asylum in FY 2018. An additional 3,300 individuals received derivative asylum status in the United States as immediate family members of principal applicants and 6,300 were approved for derivative status outside the United States. (Note that this number reflects travel documents issued to these family members, not their arrival in the United States.)
More than 59 percent of asylum grants came affirmatively through USCIS (rather than defensively through the immigration courts), of which there were 27,600 in FY 2019, up 13 percent from 24,400 in FY 2018 and 77 percent from 15,600 in FY 2017. This increase is partly a result of a January 2018 policy change by USCIS to begin adjudicating asylum applications on a last-in, first-out basis, which the agency has said discourages non-meritorious cases.
Where are most asylum seekers from?
China was the top country of origin for those receiving asylum in FY 2019, with 7,500 people (or 16 percent of total asylum grants), followed closely by Venezuela, with 6,800 individuals (15 percent). Other top countries of origin were El Salvador (with 3,200), Guatemala (2,600), and India (2,300). Together, nationals of these five countries made up 48 percent of those receiving asylum in FY 2019.
What is the current asylum application backlog?
Due to the large application volume and limited resources, both the affirmative and defensive asylum systems have extensive backlogs. As of the end of 2021, more than 432,000 affirmative asylum cases were pending with USCIS and nearly 629,000 cases were pending with EOIR.
For more information, see the USCIS affirmative asylum quarterly reports, EOIR’s workload and adjudication statistics data on asylum cases, and the Refugees and Asylees Annual Flow Report from DHS’s Office of Immigration Statistics.
For more on the immigration court backlog and asylum share, see the MPI report The U.S. Asylum System in Crisis: Charting a Way Forward.
Unauthorized Immigrants
How many unauthorized immigrants are in the United States?
The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates there were about 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States in 2019. Almost half resided in three states: California (25 percent), Texas (16 percent), and New York (8 percent). The vast majority (81 percent) lived in 176 counties with 10,000 or more unauthorized immigrants each, of which the top five—Los Angeles County, California; Harris County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; Cook County, Illinois; and Orange County, California—accounted for 20 percent of all unauthorized immigrants.
Visit the Migration Data Hub’s Unauthorized Immigrant Population Profiles for detailed sociodemographic information about unauthorized immigrants nationwide, in 41 states and the District of Columbia, and 130 counties.
MPI estimates of the number of unauthorized individuals who could receive legal status under various policy scenarios, including DREAMers, essential workers, and farmworkers, in Back on the Table: U.S. Legalization and the Unauthorized Immigrant Groups that Could Factor in the Debate. See also MPI Estimates of Potential Beneficiaries under the DREAM Act of 2021.
What are unauthorized immigrants’ countries of birth?
Mexicans and Central Americans accounted for roughly two-thirds (67 percent, or 7.4 million) of U.S. unauthorized immigrants in 2019, according to MPI estimates. About 1.7 million (15 percent) were from Asia; 907,000 (8 percent) from South America; 440,000 (4 percent) from Europe, Canada, or Oceania; 327,000 (3 percent) from the Caribbean; and 295,000 (3 percent) from Africa.
Unauthorized immigrants’ top countries of birth were Mexico (48 percent), El Salvador and Guatemala (7 percent each), India (5 percent), and Honduras (4 percent).

How many unauthorized immigrants live with children under age 18?
About 4.3 million unauthorized immigrants (41 percent of all unauthorized immigrants ages 15 and older) lived with one or more children under age 18, MPI estimates. Of this group, about 81 percent (3.5 million) resided with at least one U.S.-citizen child under age 18, and 19 percent (806,000) lived with children who were not U.S. citizens.
How many children under age 18 live with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent?
Approximately 5.5 million children under age 18 lived with an unauthorized immigrant parent as of 2019, representing 7 percent of the U.S. child population. About 86 percent (4.7 million) of these children were U.S. citizens, another 13 percent (726,000) were themselves unauthorized, and 1 percent (61,000) were legally present, including LPRs and those with temporary visas.
How many people are eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under original rules and how many applications have been received since its launch in 2012?
The DACA program, announced in 2012, offers two years of deportation relief and work authorization to eligible young unauthorized immigrants. To be eligible, one must:
be at least 15 years old
have entered the United States before age 16
have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007
be enrolled in school, have earned a high school diploma or its equivalent, or be an honorably discharged veteran
have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors; or otherwise pose a threat to public safety or national security
The Trump administration attempted to terminate DACA in 2017, but multiple court challenges left the program alive, albeit closed to new entrants. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2020 that rescinding DACA violated federal law, and USCIS briefly began accepting new applications. The Biden administration attempted to revive and expand the program, but ongoing court challenges mean that as of this writing DHS is prohibited from granting DACA requests and accompanying requests for employment authorization made by new applicants.
MPI estimates that as of December 2021, 1.5 million individuals were eligible for DACA under its original rules, 1.2 million of whom were immediately eligible under the program’s age and educational requirements (the rest were eligible aside from the education requirements or were too young but estimated to be eligible once they reached age 15). Between August 15, 2012 (when the government began accepting applications) and December 31, 2021, nearly 835,100 applicants were approved, suggesting this is the maximum number of people who have ever held DACA status during the life of the program. The agency granted 83 percent of the 1 million accepted initial applications; 8 percent (83,600) were denied, and 91,300 remained pending.
Among the 1 million accepted initial applications since the program’s inception, individuals’ top states of residence are California (28 percent), Texas (17 percent), Illinois and New York (5 percent each), and Florida (4 percent). The top five countries of origin of accepted applicants are Mexico (79 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and South Korea (1 percent).
How many people currently have DACA status?
USCIS reports that 611,470 individuals had active DACA status as of December 31, 2021
The top states of residence for DACA active participants were California (29 percent), Texas (17 percent), and Illinois (5 percent), followed by New York, Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina (about 4 percent each).
The top countries of origin of active DACA program participants were Mexico (81 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and Peru, South Korea, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina (about 1 percent each).

How many people are covered by Temporary Protected Status?
Since the Immigration Act of 1990, the United States has occasionally granted a form of humanitarian relief called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) when the origin countries of foreign nationals in the United States experience natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other circumstances making return unsafe. TPS offers work authorization and protection from deportation for periods of six months to 18 months. El Salvador was the first country to be designated for TPS in 1990, to protect Salvadorans who had fled its civil war. Since then, more than 20 countries have been designated for TPS.
In 2021, the Biden administration added Myanmar and Venezuela to the list of eligible countries and expanded eligibility for those from Haiti. Certain Liberians and residents of Hong Kong were designated for Deferred Enforced Departure, a similar status offering temporary protection from deportation and work authorization. In March 2022, Ukraine and Afghanistan were also added to the list of TPS countries, and eligibility for those from South Sudan and Sudan was expanded. Collectively, more than 500,000 individuals in the United States are eligible for TPS according to publicly available government estimates as of this writing.
Fourteen countries are currently designated: Afghanistan, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar (also known as Burma), Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Ukraine, and Yemen. As of March 11, 2021, an estimated 319,000 people had active TPS status, with the largest groups being Salvadorans (198,000), Hondurans (60,000), and Haitians (41,000). By the end of FY 2021, 16,000 Venezuelans had been approved for TPS and more than 204,000 applications were pending.
Certain Liberians and residents of Hong Kong have also been designated for Deferred Enforced Departure, a similar status offering temporary protection from deportation and work authorization.

Immigration Enforcement
Definition
The Department of Homeland Security uses the term enforcement encounters for both apprehensions and expulsions of migrants at the Southwest border. The term has been used since a pandemic-related public-health order known as Title 42 took effect in March 2020, allowing for the immediate expulsion of anyone entering the country without authorization, including individuals who Intend to seek asylum.
Note: Apprehensions and expulsions are events, not individuals. In other words, the same individual can be apprehended more than once, with each apprehension counted separately. The recidivism rate has increased sharply since the expulsions policy began, given intercepted migrants are not being put into formal removal proceedings that could trigger criminal sanctions upon a future re-entry.
How many times are unauthorized immigrants stopped at the border each year?
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported nearly 1.8 million enforcement encounters at both the southern and northern borders in FY 2021, a major increase from 490,000 a year earlier, when the pandemic suppressed movement around the world. The vast majority of these FY 2021 encounters (1.7 million) were at the U.S.-Mexico border. (The term encounters is a recent one used by CBP, reflecting both apprehensions and expulsions.)
Enforcement encounters at the Southwest border increased significantly starting in March 2021, in response to factors including the change in presidential administrations and uneven economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 1.7 million encounters at the Southwest border in FY 2021 was a record high, well more than triple the 458,000 encounters in FY 2020 and 77 percent higher than the 978,000 in FY 2019.
Notably, these figures refer to individual actions, not the number of people who attempted to cross the border without authorization. Use of Title 42 to immediately expel migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the consequences for individuals caught crossing the border, and many have responded by repeating attempts on multiple occasions, contributing to higher numbers of encounters
How many families and unaccompanied children have been detained at the U.S.-Mexico border?
CBP in FY 2021 made nearly 480,000 encounters of children and adults travelling as families (known as “family units”) and about 147,000 unaccompanied children along the Southwest border. This represents a sixfold increase from the 71,000 family units and 33,000 unaccompanied minors encountered in FY 2020. Including single adults, CBP encountered migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border more than 1.7 million times in FY 2021.
Just a share of encounters led to detention or release into the United States (known as Title 8 apprehensions); among these, figures for family and unaccompanied minors apprehended in FY 2021 remained below FY 2020 levels until February 2021 and below FY 2019 levels until July 2021. The combined 495,000 Title 8 apprehensions of family and unaccompanied minors in FY 2021 were much higher than the 83,000 in FY 2020, but were 19 percent less than the 608,000 that occurred in FY 2019.
Unaccompanied children arrested at the border in FY 2021 were primarily from Guatemala and Honduras, with smaller numbers from Mexico and El Salvador. Families were primarily from Honduras, with smaller numbers from Guatemala, Brazil, and El Salvador.
Note: The term “family unit” refers to individuals—either a child under 18 years old, parent, or legal guardian—apprehended with a family member by the U.S. Border Patrol.

How many people are arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) within the United States each year?
While the number of CBP border arrests reached a record high in FY 2021, ICE arrests in the interior of the United States declined. ICE agents made approximately 74,100 administrative arrests in FY 2021, down from the 103,600 arrests in FY 2020 and 143,100 in FY 2019. ICE has attributed the drop to a change in focus during COVID-19. An administrative arrest is the arrest of an individual for a civil violation of U.S. immigration law, which is subsequently adjudicated by an immigration judge or through other administrative processes.
How many people are deported per year?
ICE removed 59,000 foreign citizens in FY 2021, which continued a decline from nearly 186,000 removals and returns in FY 2020 and 267,300 in FY 2019.
CBP had not reported FY 2021 data as of this writing, but in FY 2020 CBP and ICE collectively reported more than 406,000 removals and returns. Of these, 221,000 were carried out by CBP, which was 17 percent less than the 264,100 in FY 2019.
For more information, see FY 2021 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report.
Note: Removals and returns, which are carried out both by ICE and CBP, result in the confirmed movement of inadmissible or deportable aliens out of the United States. Title 42 expulsions carried out at the border are not included in these numbers.
Naturalization Trends
How many immigrants are naturalized citizens?
In FY 2019, 23.2 million immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, accounting for approximately 52 percent of all 44.9 million immigrants and 7 percent of the total U.S. population (328.2 million), according to ACS estimates.
Of these 23.2 million naturalized citizens, 32 percent were naturalized between FY 2010 and 2019, 28 percent between FY 2000 and 2009, and 39 percent prior to FY 2000.
How many immigrants become U.S. citizens annually?
USCIS naturalized about 628,0000 green-card holders in FY 2020, a 26 percent decrease from the 844,000 in FY 2019. Meanwhile, the 968,000 petitions for naturalization filed in FY 2020 was nearly 17 percent more than the 831,000 a year earlier. At the same time, the number of denied petitions decreased by nearly 18 percent, from 98,000 in FY 2019 to 81,000 in FY 2020.
USCIS is taking longer to process naturalization applications, with average processing times increasing from 5.6 months in FY 2016 to 9.1 months in FY 2020 to 11.7 months as of the end of January 2022.
From a historical perspective, naturalizations have increased dramatically in recent decades. On average, fewer than 120,000 LPRs became citizens each year between FY 1950 and FY 1969, 150,000 in the 1970s, 210,000 in the 1980s, 500,000 in the 1990s, 680,000 during the 2000s, and 721,000 between 2010 and 2020.
Naturalizations reached an all-time high in FY 2008, increasing 59 percent from 660,000 the prior year to 1,047,000. This came as a result of impending application fee increases and the promotion of U.S. citizenship in advance of the 2008 presidential election.

How many foreign nationals become U.S. citizens through military naturalization?
In FY 2020, 2,600 foreign-born military personnel became U.S. citizens, a 31 percent drop from FY 2019 (3,800) and the fewest since FY 2002.

Where are newly naturalized citizens from?
Of the new U.S. citizens in FY 2020, 13 percent were born in Mexico, 8 percent in India, and 5 percent each in the Philippines and Cuba (see Table 6). Immigrants from these four countries, together with those from China, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Colombia, and El Salvador accounted for 48 percent of the 628,000 new U.S. citizens that fiscal year.

Where in the United States do newly naturalized citizens live?
Nearly 54 percent of people naturalized as citizens in FY 2020 lived in one of five states: California (18 percent, or 113,000 individuals); Florida (13 percent, or 79,000); Texas (11 percent, or 67,000); New York (9 percent, or 56,000); and New Jersey (4 percent, or 22,000).
The top metropolitan areas with the largest number of new naturalizations were New York-Newark-Jersey City (69,000), Miami-Ft Lauderdale-Pompano Beach (53,000), Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim (43,000), Washington-Arlington-Alexandria (26,000), and San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley (23,000).  These five metro areas were the residences for 34 percent of all naturalizations in FY 2020.
How many green-card holders are eligible to naturalize?
According to the latest available DHS estimates, about 9.1 million of the 13.6 million green-card holders residing in the United States on January 1, 2019 were eligible to become naturalized citizens based on how long they had held LPR status.
For more information, see Estimates of the Lawful Permanent Resident Population.
How long does it take on average for green-card holders to naturalize?
On average, immigrants who became U.S. citizens in FY 2020 had previously held green cards for about seven years, a decrease from an average of eight years in FY 2019. The time varied by region of origin: immigrants born in Africa and Asia spent an average six years in LPR status before naturalization, those born in South America spent an average of seven years in that status, Europeans spent an average of eight years, and new citizens from Oceania and North America (including Central America) each spent an average of ten years with a green card.
In general, the requirements for naturalization are being at least 18 years of age, passing English and civic exams, and for most applicants, residing in the United States with LPR status continuously for at least five years (three years for those married to a U.S. citizen).
For more information, see DHS Annual Flow Reports.
Read the USCIS Naturalization Eligibility Requirements.
Naturalization Rates
The number of green-card holders who naturalize every year depends on many factors, including the number of people who are eligible, application processing times, and stringency and length of background checks. This number can also be affected by barriers to naturalize, such as high application fees, as well as personal motivations. For instance, green-card holders from mainland China may be less inclined to become U.S. citizens because China prohibits dual citizenship, whereas immigrants from countries that allow dual citizenship may have greater incentive.
The share of green-card holders who naturalize within a certain time period, such as within ten years of receiving a green card, varies by LPRs’ country and region of birth and class of admission. This is known as a naturalization rate.
Overall, 53 percent of the immigrant cohort who became LPRs in FY 2008 naturalized by FY 2018. A ten-year naturalization rate was the highest for those born in Africa (76 percent) and South America (64 percent) and the lowest for LPRs from North America, including Mexico and Canada (27 percent). The ten-year naturalization rate was nearly 70 percent for Indian-born green-card holders, 60 percent for those from the Philippines, 52 percent for Cubans, 44 percent for LPRs from China, and 27 percent for Mexicans.
In terms of classes of admission, approximately 68 percent of humanitarian migrants and employment-based green-card holders who became LPRs in FY 2008 had become naturalized citizens by FY 2018. Ten-year naturalization rates were lower for those who were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or other family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs (about 47 percent each).
For more information, read the DHS report Trends in Naturalization Rates: FY 2018 Update Report.
Notes on Visa Backlogs
Two types of backlogs impact the issuance of green cards.
The first is due to visa availability (with caps established in 1990):
Family-sponsored preferences are limited to 226,000 visas per year.
Employment-based permanent visas for foreign workers and their families are capped at 140,000 per year worldwide.
Also, no country can be the origin for more than 7 percent of the total annual number of family-sponsored and employment-based visas (approximately 25,600 visas).
The second type of backlog is due to delays processing applicants' documents, which is related to government capacity as well as increased background and criminal checks.
Visa Backlogs
How many visa applications for permanent immigration (green cards) are backlogged?
Because of limits on certain visa categories and per-country caps, the U.S. government in some cases is still processing applications that are more than two decades old. In March 2022, the State Department was processing some family-sponsored visa applications dating to September 1997, and employment-related visa applications from January 2012.
According to data on petitions submitted to the State Department, more than 4.1 million applicants (including spouses and minor children) were on the waiting list as of November 1, 2021, a 4 percent increase from the same point in 2020 (when there were just under 4 million applicants).
The overwhelming majority of backlogs were among family-sponsored applicants (nearly 4 million, which includes the principal applicant and their immediate family members). About 172,000 backlogged applicants were for employment-sponsored channels and their families.
Of the overall 4.1 million applicants, 1.2 million were citizens of Mexico, followed by those from the Philippines (309,000), India (303,000), the Dominican Republic (275,000), and mainland China (239,000). Family- and employment-based prospective immigrants who are waiting to adjust their status to lawful permanent residence from within the United States are not included in the State Department estimates.
USCIS also publishes backlog statistics, but only for petitions approved in one of the five employment-based categories. As of April 2021 (the latest available as of this writing), approximately 481,000 approved employment-based immigrant petitions were awaiting a priority date. This figure corresponds to the number of primary applicants covered by these petitions but excludes their dependents. To MPI’s knowledge, USCIS has not published backlog statistics on other types of green-card applications the agency adjudicates.
In other words, the overall number of people waiting for a green card—within and outside of the United States—is likely to be larger than the 4.1 million reported by the State Department (as of November 2021) and 481,000 reported by USCIS (as of April 2021).

23+ Incredible Immigration Statistics You Need to Read [2022 Update]
Jenifer Kuadli
January 04, 2021
Immigration is a sensitive topic most people try and tiptoe around. The term “immigrant” has unfortunately developed negative connotations, despite the fact that millions of legal immigrants enter the country every year.
What’s more, there are plenty of facts and stats that get totally blown out of proportion!
So, how do you separate the truth from the lies?
Well, our mind-blowing immigration statistics are a brilliant place to start! We’ve compiled some of the most intriguing and thought-provoking stats on this topic. Check them out, and you’ll learn a thing or two about the state of immigration in the US — and throughout the world — just as we did when we were compiling them.
Mind-boggling Immigration Statistics (Editor’s Pick)
13.7% of the US population were immigrants in 2018, or about 44.8 million people.
77% of immigrants are here legally.
Over 1 million immigrants enter the country each year.
11.2 million Mexicans moved to the US in 2018, making up the largest immigrant group.
6,674 refugees came to the US between October 1, 2019 and March 5, 2020.
267,258 people were deported from the US in FY2019.
3.5% of the global population are immigrants.
General Immigration Facts
Let’s start by running through some of the more general United States immigration statistics. This will include facts and figures relating to the number of immigrants in the country and how things have changed over the years.
So, how many immigrants are there in the US right now?
Let’s find out.
1. There were approximately 44.8 million immigrants in the US in 2018.
The most recent statistics on immigration say that just under 45 million people in the United States are immigrants. Remember, an immigrant is anybody who leaves their country of origin and moves somewhere else.
So, don’t get confused and assume this refers to illegal immigrants! The majority of immigrants are legal - and we’ll get onto that in just a moment. As far as the percentage of the population goes, well, it looks like this…
2. 13.7% of the population are immigrants, US immigration statistics show.
Initially, seeing that 44.8 million immigrants live in the US sounds quite shocking. But in terms of percentages, it’s not that high at all. If you bear with us, you’ll find that immigration statistics by country show many other places with a much higher percentage.
Still, there’s no denying the fact that the immigrant population of the US has definitely increased since the introduction of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.
3. There are more than four times as many immigrants now compared to the 1960s.
That’s right, the total number of US immigrants has more than quadrupled since the 1960s. This is according to the most recent immigration numbers by year, but what does it mean?
Well, there’s been a steady increase since the introduction of the new Immigration Act in ‘65. Contrary to what you may believe, it’s not simply a case of illegal immigrants and refugees all flooding to the country by any means necessary.
In fact, green card statistics suggest that in most cases, people took the chance to move to the US for job opportunities and a chance at following the American Dream!
4. 35.2 million immigrants in the US are lawful immigrants.
Of the 44.8 million total immigrants in the country, 77% are here legally. When you dive into the statistical data, you find that the legal immigration statistics are split into different categories. This includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, and temporary residents.
In essence, the main thing to take from this data is that the vast majority of US immigrants are here legally in some way, shape, or form.
5. 22.6 million legal immigrants are naturalized citizens.
This works out as approximately 51% of the total US immigrants, founded on government immigration statistics. Therefore, the bulk of legal immigrants do have US citizenship. This means they’ve gone through the naturalization process established by the Immigration and Nationality Act.
For all intents and purposes, they are Americans. It’s just that they technically retain their immigrant status because they’re also citizens of another country.
6. 27% of legal immigrants are lawful permanent residents, the latest US immigration data shows.
This amounts to 12.3 million people.
What does it mean?
Well, a lawful permanent resident means that someone legally lives in the country on a full-time basis. They work here, pay local taxes, and so on. The only thing missing is their official US citizenship.
However, many of the lawful permanent residents do choose to become naturalized at a later date.
7. 5% of legal immigrants are here on a temporary basis.
According to the latest US legal immigration statistics, this is around 2.2 million of the lawful population.
Someone is classified in this category for many reasons. Typically, it refers to students that have come here to study or people who are working in the US for a specific period. They’ve got all the right visas and travel information, but they aren’t staying in the country permanently.
8. Illegal immigration statistics show that 23% of immigrants are here unlawfully.
By our calculations, that makes for a total of 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States — at the time of gathering this data.
We have to point out that the official immigrant statistics only go up to 2017 at the moment. So, this number could have risen or decreased since then.
An illegal immigrant is defined as anyone that enters the country by avoiding the legal process and without having all of the correct documents.
US Immigration Statistics By Year
Time to narrow things down just a little bit. All of the previous stats have shown the overall number of immigrants in the US. But what do the figures look like on a yearly basis? Well, read on to find out…
9. 44,728,700 immigrants entered the US in 2018.
According to the DHS immigration statistics, over 1 million immigrants enter the country every year.
This is one of the largest immigration rates in the world, but it’s largely down to the sheer size of the country. Consider the fact that the population of the US sat at over 327 million people in 2018.
With the help of a calculator, this works out to 0.36% of the population. All of a sudden, this stat doesn’t seem so alarming!
10. Between 2017 and 2018, the immigrant population increased by less than 0.5%.
There was an overall increase in the US immigrant population by 203,000 in 2018. This figure indicates that the foreign-born population stayed flat between 2017 and 2018, as can be deduced from US immigration stats.
Now, hold on just a second.
You might think this contradicts the previous stat that showed over a million immigrants entering the country that year. So, how can the population increase by less than this?
Well, it comes down to the number of immigrants that left the country during this period. Temporary residents may have left, some illegal immigrants may have gotten deported, etc.
11. 11.2 million immigrants came from Mexico.
Immigration statistics 2018 show that Mexicans made up over 11 million of the immigrants entering the country that year.
This should come as no surprise. Besides, it’s been long known that many Mexicans see the land beyond Rio Grande as a place to make more money and get a good start in life.
12. 25% of immigrants entering the US each year are Mexicans.
The Mexican immigration statistics show that a quarter of all US immigrants are from Mexico. Again, this just backs up our previous point.
Unfortunately, there’s currently no data that accurately reflects the legal vs illegal immigration statistics for people by country. So, we can’t say for sure how many Mexican immigrants are here lawfully.
13. Indian and Chinese immigrants are in joint-second place.
If we were to look at US immigration by country, then India and China are in joint-second place with 6% of the immigrant population each.
The same data suggests that the Philippines are next with 5%, followed by El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic with 3%. Lastly, South Korea and Guatemala round off the top 10 with 2% each.
In the final analysis, the majority of US immigrants come from either Central America or Asia.
14. 23% of US immigrants entered in 2010 or later.
By looking at the US immigration statistics by decade, we see that just under a quarter of the immigrant population entered the country after 2010.
In comparison, 25% arrived in the decade before, and 21% in the decade before that.
Before 1990, 30% of the immigrant population moved to the US. If anything, this shows that the immigration rate is decreasing each decade.
15. Over 756,000 immigrants were naturalized in 2018.
While most of the immigration data only dates back to 2017, we can look at some more recent naturalization statistics. In 2018, over 750,000 immigrants were naturalized and took up US citizenship.
US Refugee Statistics
Refugees are migrants that flee their own country to avoid some type of significant issue. Typically, this happens when countries are at war and the population wants to get to safety. With that in mind, we’ve found some telling US refugee stats that are well worth looking at:
16. More than 6,000 refugees were admitted to the US in the first five months of FY2020.
This is another one of those US immigration statistics that sound insane at first sight. In a little over five months of FY2020 (October 1, 2019 - March 5, 2020), 6,674 people received refugee status in the US. This figure represents more than one-third of the annual maximum of 18,000, which is the lowest level on record.
17. There were 30,000 refugees admitted in 2019, exactly matching the annual maximum.
American immigration statistics confirm that there were 30,000 refugees let into the United States in 2019, which exactly matched the annual ceiling. Fewer refugees (22,491) were recorded a year prior, representing a sharp drop of 58% from 2017.
18. In 2018,  43.4% of the refugee population was below the age of 18.
Perhaps the most harrowing of all statistics about immigration — 9,722 of refugees in the US are children.
This goes to show that kids are regularly fleeing their countries to try and avoid conflict and get the help they need. It also throws a bit of light on the potential impact of strict refugee capping policies. By limiting how many refugees enter the country, the government is effectively stopping loads of children from finding a safe home.
Of course, things are more complex than that, so we won’t get into a political debate here!
19. 35.2% of refugees in the US are from DR Congo.
In terms of immigration numbers, that’s 7,878 people. In second place, you have Burma with a refugee share of 15.9% in the US. To put it in numbers, that’s 3,555 people.
Coming in at third place is Ukraine, with 11.8% of refugees coming from this European country. However, there’s much more to these stats than you might initially think. So, let’s break things down for you…
20. There has been a massive decrease in numbers for both Burma and DR Congo.
The Department of Homeland Security immigration statistics reveal that both Burma and DR Congo saw dramatic decreases in refugee numbers since 2016. Back then, DR Congo saw 16,370 refugees entering the US to seek asylum. Burma had 12,347 people seeking refuge in the country.
Percentage-wise, these USA asylum seekers statistics show that they still make up the top two places for US refugees. However, the numbers have decreased by well over half.
When you look at the yearbook of immigration statistics, the figure on refugees isn’t overly shocking. If refugee numbers are down by over 50% since 2017, it only makes sense that these numbers are also decreasing.
But, things get a little interesting when we look at Ukraine.
21. The number of Ukrainian refugees has increased by 3% since 2016.
In 2016, there were 2,543 Ukrainian refugees in the US. This number rose to 2,635 in 2018  as shown by the US immigration history statistics.
What’s more, Ukraine is the only nation to see a rise in refugees entering the US in the same period. How does that work out?
Well, the main reason could be down to the increasing tension in the country. Ukraine has fallen on hard times since 2014 as a result of the conflict in the Donbass. There’s also a substantial Ukrainian diaspora in North America, so it is seen as a good place to go and still hold onto some of your cultural heritage.
Having said that, it’s still very surprising that this is the only country to see a rise in refugees entering the United States. Especially considering previously mentioned immigration stats that reveal that the number of refugees is rapidly declining.
US Deportation Statistics
Next on our journey through immigration statistics, we have some deportation numbers to throw at you.
So, let’s see what the data has to say:
22. 267,258 people were deported from the US in FY2019.
Of that number, 150,141 were convicted criminals, immigration statistics 2019 show.
What’s more shocking is that 5,702 immigrants listed as family unit members were deported. This represents a whopping increase of 110% in family unit member deportations, the highest level recorded over the last 10 fiscal years.
Mexicans are the largest group of deportees, accounting for 127,492 of the total number. They were followed by Guatemala (54,919), and Honduras with 41,800 repatriated nationals.
23. Immigration detention statistics hinted that there has been a slight increase in deportations in the past year.
In the 2018 fiscal year, 256,085 people were deported from the US. By the end of FY2019, this number increased by over 11,000.
What can we take from this?
Although the increase is not that large, the number of people being deported is on the rise! Is this that surprising?
Well, not really.
If you look at some of the data we’ve collected, you can see sustained growth in the US immigration trends. The aim is to reduce the number of people entering the country — particularly illegally — and get rid of as many undocumented settlers as possible, thus lowering the percentage of illegal immigrants in the US.
Therefore, it will be very interesting to see what the deportation numbers say at the end of this year.
Immigration Stats from Around The World
On that note, we’ve concluded our United States immigration data and statistics. You’ve seen the numbers, and you’ve looked at all the information.
But how does this compare to the rest of the world?
Now, you might remember we mentioned some global statistics earlier on. Well, now we can reveal what immigration looks like overseas.
24. There were 272 million immigrants around the world in 2019, world immigration statistics confirm.
Research from the United Nations determines that approximately 3.5% of the global population were immigrants in 2019.
From a US perspective, this is quite curious. If you recall, 13.7% of the country is made up of immigrants. As such, you could conclude that the US has a way above average rate of immigration.
It’s obviously not as simple as that, but how many of the world’s immigrants are in the United States?
25. According to world immigration statistics by country, about 51 million global immigrants are located in the U.S.
Of course, this is due to the sheer number of people living in the country. If you have over 44 million immigrants, you’re bound to make up a fair chunk of global immigrants. It’s not really an indication of a problem in the US, but more of an indicator of the fact that loads of people are choosing to live there due to the vast number of opportunities provided.
In fact, if you look at some of the other countries, the US immigration rate of 13% doesn’t seem that high at all…
26. The UAE has the highest percentage of immigrants — 87.3% — in the world.
87.3% of the UAE is made up of immigrants. Now, by comparison, the percentage of immigrants in the US is ridiculously low!
Do you see what we’re getting at? Immigration facts can be very hard to track and compare because of how different they can be. Do you worry about the number of people entering the country, or do you look at the percentage compared to the rest of the population?
The intriguing thing about the UAE is that this percentage is mainly down to the considerable developments in this part of the world. You have places like Dubai that have sprung up over the last few decades and transformed into luxury areas to live. So, it stands to reason that people are flocking there to work and make a lot of money.
The Lowdown On Immigration
Aaaand breathe.
That’s it, you’ve reached the end of our detailed look at immigration facts and statistics. We hope you’ve taken a lot away from this.
The key takeaways are:
Over a million immigrants enter the US every year. The majority of immigrants in the country are here legally, with most of them accepting nationalized status. The number of refugees is decreasing, while the number of deportations is rising.
It’s always important to get the facts straight, as there is a lot of misleading information on immigration out there!

Frequently Requested Statistics on Immigrants and Immigration in the United States
February 11, 2021
Spotlight

The year 2020 was a momentous one for U.S. immigration, marking the last year of an administration that had a nearly unprecedented focus on reducing immigration, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically chilled travel and migration to the United States and around the world.
Even prior to 2020, the immigrant population in the United States already had been growing at much slower rates than a decade ago. And origins for recent arrivals were shifting, with more new immigrants coming from Asia than other regions. The year had other notable developments: The most recent estimates revealed illegal immigration was on the decline, the United States resettled the smallest number of refugees in the history of the refugee resettlement program, and nearly half of recently arrived immigrants had a bachelor’s degree or more.
To offer more context on the immigrants often at the center of political discussions, who numbered 44.9 million in 2019, this Spotlight offers information about some of the most frequently requested immigration-related issues by compiling the most authoritative and current data available. It answers questions such as: What are the historic immigration trends in the United States? Who is immigrating, and through which channels? In what occupations do immigrants work? How many immigrants become naturalized citizens? What immigration enforcement actions were taken during the year? What are income and poverty metrics, as well as health insurance coverage, for immigrants and the U.S. born alike?
This article draws on the most recent resources and data from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI); the U.S. Census Bureau (using its 2019 American Community Survey [ACS], 2020 Current Population Survey [CPS], and 2000 decennial census); and the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and State. (Note: DHS and State Department data refer to fiscal years that begin on October 1 and end on September 30; ACS and CPS data refer to calendar years). For more detailed information on U.S. and global immigration data sources and one-click access to these datasets, see the MPI report Immigration Data Matters. And all of the data tools and maps linked to in this article also can be accessed through MPI’s Migration Data Hub.

Immigrants Now and Historically
Definitions
"Foreign born" and "immigrant" are used interchangeably and refer to persons with no U.S. citizenship at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, persons on certain temporary visas, and unauthorized immigrants.
Geographical regions: MPI follows the definition of Latin America as put forth by the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau, which spans Central America (including Mexico), the Caribbean, and South America. For more information about geographical regions, see the U.S. Census Bureau and United Nations Statistics Division.
How many immigrants reside in the United States?
More than 44.9 million immigrants lived in the United States in 2019, the historical numeric high since census records have been kept. Immigrants’ share of the overall U.S. population has increased significantly from the record low of 4.7 percent in 1970. In 2019, immigrants comprised 13.7 percent of the total U.S. population, a figure that remains short of the record high of 14.8 percent in 1890.
The foreign-born population remained largely flat between 2018 and 2019, with an increase of 204,000 people, or growth of less than 0.5 percent. This is consistent with the 203,000 increase from 2017 to 2018 and much lower than the approximately 787,000 increase—or 2 percent growth—seen between 2016 and 2017. The slowing growth of the immigrant population over the past few years is mirrored by the slowing growth of the total U.S. population since 2015.
How have the number and share of immigrants changed over time?
In 1850, the first year the United States began collecting nativity data through the census, the country had 2.2 million immigrants, representing nearly 10 percent of the total population.
Between 1860 and 1920, the immigrant share of the population fluctuated between 13 percent and almost 15 percent, peaking at 14.8 percent in 1890, largely due to high levels of immigration from Europe. Restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924 kept permanent immigration open almost exclusively to northern and western Europeans. Combined with the Great Depression and World War II, this led to a sharp drop in new arrivals from the Eastern Hemisphere. The foreign-born share steadily declined, hitting a record low of 4.7 percent (or 9.6 million immigrants) in 1970 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Size and Share of the Foreign-Born Population in the United States, 1850-2019
Source: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau, 2010-19 American Community Surveys (ACS), and 1970, 1990, and 2000 decennial census. All other data are from Campbell J. Gibson and Emily Lennon, "Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850 to 1990" (Working Paper no. 29, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 1999).
Since 1970, the share and number of immigrants have increased rapidly, mainly because of large-scale immigration from Latin America and Asia. The vast diversification of immigration flows was ushered in by important shifts in U.S. immigration law (including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which abolished national-origin admission quotas; the creation of a formal refugee resettlement program with the Refugee Act of 1980; and the Cold War-era grant of preferential treatment to Cuban immigrants); the United States’ growing economic and military presence in Asia and Latin America; economic ties, social linkages, and deep migration history between the United States and its southern neighbors; and major economic transformations and political instability in countries around the world.

How do today’s top countries of origin compare to those 50 years ago?
In 2019, Mexicans comprised 24 percent of all immigrants in the United States a decline from 30 percent in 2000. Immigrants from India and China (including those born in Hong Kong and Macao but not Taiwan) were the next two largest immigrant groups, each making up about 6 percent of the foreign-born population. Other top countries of origin include the Philippines (5 percent); El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic (each accounting for 3 percent); and Guatemala and Korea (each 2 percent). Together, these ten countries accounted for 57 percent of all immigrants in the United States in 2019.
The predominance of immigration from Latin America and Asia in the late 20th and early 21st centuries starkly contrasts with the trend in the mid-1900s, when immigrants were largely European. In the 1960s no single country accounted for more than 15 percent of the U.S. immigrant population. Italians were the top origin group, making up 13 percent of the foreign born in 1960, followed by Germans and Canadians (about 10 percent each).

How long have immigrants lived in the United States, and what are the leading sending countries?
Fifty percent of all immigrants in the United States in 2019 had entered the country prior to 2000 (29 percent entered before 1990 and 21 percent between 1990 and 1999), while 25 percent entered between 2000 and 2009 and the remaining 25 percent in 2010 or later.
While immigrants from Mexico have dominated the flows post-1970, the composition of new arrivals has changed since 2010. Recently arrived immigrants are more likely to come from Asia, with India and China leading the way. In fact, in 2013, India and China overtook Mexico as the top origin countries for new arrivals, displacing its longstanding position.
The number of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Cuba, Venezuela, Guatemala, and El Salvador also increased between 2010 and 2019. By contrast, the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States declined by more than 779,000 during the same period, representing the biggest absolute decline of all immigrant groups.
Among the origin countries with at least 100,000 immigrants in the United States in 2019, the top five that experienced the fastest growth between 2010 and 2019 were Venezuela (an increase of 153 percent), Afghanistan (143 percent), Nepal (140 percent), Myanmar (also known as Burma; 84 percent), and Nigeria (79 percent).

How many U.S. residents are of immigrant origin?
Immigrants and their U.S.-born children number approximately 85.7 million people, or 26 percent of the U.S. population, according to the 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS), a slight decline from 2019. The Pew Research Center has projected that the immigrant-origin share of the population will rise to about 36 percent by 2065.
Demographic, Educational, and Linguistic Characteristics
Definitions
College-educated persons are defined as adults 25 years and older with a bachelor's degree or higher.
Race as used by the Census Bureau reflects the race or races with which individuals most closely self-identify. Race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.
Hispanic and Latino are ethnic, not racial, categories. They include individuals who classified themselves in one of the specific Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino categories listed on the decennial census and American Community Survey questionnaire—"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban"—as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino origin." Persons who indicated that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino" include those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people who self-identify more generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on.
Read more about Census Bureau’s definitions on its website.
What is the median age for immigrants?
The immigrant population’s median age in 2019 was 45.7 years, making it older than the U.S.-born population, which had a median age of 36.5 years. Children of immigrants who are born in the United States contribute to the younger median age of the U.S.-born population compared to the immigrant population, which is comprised of people who immigrate largely as adults.
Fewer than 1 percent of immigrants were under age 5 in 2019, compared to 7 percent of the U.S.-born population in this age group. Children and youth ages 5 to 17 years accounted for 5 percent of immigrants and 18 percent of the U.S.-born population. People of working age (18 to 64 years) comprised 78 percent of the immigrant population, a much higher figure than the 59 percent of U.S. born in this category. Approximately 17 percent of immigrants were 65 years and older, similar to the 16 percent of the U.S. born in this age group.
What is the female share of the immigrant population?
In 2019, about 52 percent of all U.S. immigrants were female. The share has fluctuated slightly over the past four decades: 53 percent in 1980, 51 percent in 1990, 50 percent in 2000, and 51 percent in 2010.
What is the racial makeup of immigrants?
In 2019, 45 percent of immigrants reported their race as single-race White, 27 percent as Asian, 10 percent as Black, and 15 percent as some other race. About 2 percent reported having two or more races.
How many immigrants are Hispanic or Latino?
In 2019, 44 percent of U.S. immigrants (19.8 million people) reported having Hispanic or Latino origins.
Note: The Census Bureau classifies Hispanic and Latino as ethnic categories, separate from the racial categories listed above (see Definitions box for more information).
How many Hispanics in the United States are immigrants?
The majority of U.S. Hispanics are U.S.-born. Of the 60.5 million people in 2019 who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, 33 percent (19.8 million) were immigrants and 67 percent (40.6 million) were U.S.-born.

Which languages are most frequently spoken at home?
In 2019, approximately 78 percent (241 million) of all 308.8 million people ages 5 and older regardless of nativity reported speaking only English at home. The remaining 22 percent (67.8 million) reported speaking a language other than English at home.
Among those who reported speaking a language other than English at home, 62 percent were Spanish speakers. Other top languages were Chinese (5 percent, including Mandarin and Cantonese); Tagalog (almost 3 percent); and Vietnamese, Arabic, French (including Cajun), and Korean (about 2 percent each) (see Table 1).

Data for these 15 jurisdictions are from the U.S. Census Bureau pooled 2015-19 ACS.
How many immigrants are Limited English Proficient (LEP)?
In 2019, approximately 46 percent (20.7 million) of the 44.6 million immigrants ages 5 and older were Limited English Proficient (LEP). Immigrants accounted for 81 percent of the country’s 25.5 million LEP individuals.
Note: The term "Limited English Proficient" refers to persons ages 5 and older who reported speaking English "not at all," "not well," or "well" on their survey questionnaire. Individuals who reported speaking “only English” or speaking English "very well" are considered proficient in English.

What share of the immigrant population has a college education?
In 2019, 33 percent (12.9 million) of the 39.5 million immigrants ages 25 and older had a bachelor's degree or higher, similar to U.S.-born adults (see Figure 3). Notably, 48 percent of immigrants who entered the country between 2014 and 2019 held bachelor’s degrees or higher, compared to 33 percent of the U.S.-born and overall immigrant populations.

Immigrant Destinations
Which states have the largest number of immigrants and which ones have experienced the fastest growth of their immigrant populations?
In 2019, the top five U.S. states by number of immigrants were California (10.6 million), Texas (5 million), Florida (4.5 million), New York (4.4 million), and New Jersey (2.1 million).
When classified by immigrants' share of total population, the top five states in 2019 were California (27 percent), New Jersey (23 percent), New York (22 percent), Florida (21 percent), and Nevada (20 percent).

While traditional immigrant destinations have the largest absolute number of new immigrants, other states have seen much larger relative growth in their immigrant populations. In some cases this is because the states’ initial foreign-born populations were quite small, so a relatively small absolute increase has translated into high-percent growth (see Table 2).

Immigrants in the Labor Force
Definitions
The civilian labor force is comprised of civilians ages 16 and older who were either employed or unemployed but looking for work in the week prior to participation in the American Community Survey or decennial census.
How many immigrants are in the U.S. civilian labor force?
Immigrants constituted 17 percent (28.6 million) of the civilian labor force (166.3 million) in 2019. Immigrant participation in the labor force has more than tripled since 1970, when immigrants accounted for approximately 5 percent of the civilian labor force.
For more on the evolving share of immigrants in the labor force nationwide and by state, see Immigrant Share of the U.S. Population and Civilian Labor Force, 1980-Present.
What types of jobs do immigrants perform?
Of the 27.6 million employed foreign-born workers ages 16 and older in 2019, the largest share (35 percent) worked in management, professional, and related occupations (see Figure 4).

Income and Poverty
In 2019, immigrant households had a median income of $63,550, compared to $66,040 for native-born households.
Fourteen percent of immigrants were poor (that is, with family incomes below the official poverty threshold), compared to 12 percent of the U.S. born.
Health Insurance Coverage
What share of immigrants have health insurance?
In 2019, approximately 58 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance (compared to 69 percent of the U.S. born), and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage (compared to 36 percent of the U.S. born).
Since implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014, health insurance coverage rates improved for both the U.S. born and immigrants. From 2013 to 2017, the rate of uninsured immigrants fell from 32 percent to 20 percent, and the rate for the native born fell from 12 percent to 7 percent. In 2017, the Trump administration made a number of changes to policies initiated by the ACA, including removing the individual coverage mandate, ending cost-sharing subsidies to insurers, and cutting funding for navigator programs. In 2019, the share of uninsured among the immigrant population remained at about 20 percent.
Note: Health insurance coverage is calculated only for the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Since some people may simultaneously hold both private and public health insurance coverage, estimates of those with public health insurance and those with public coverage may overlap. Their sum therefore may be greater than the total number of people with health insurance.
Children of Immigrants
Definitions
Second-generation immigrant children are any U.S.-born children with at least one foreign-born parent.
First-generation immigrant children are any foreign-born children with at least one foreign-born parent.
Children with immigrant parents are both first- and second-generation immigrant children.
Note: The estimates in this section include only children under age 18 who reside with at least one parent.
How many U.S. children live with immigrant parents?
In 2019, approximately 17.8 million U.S. children under age 18 lived with at least one immigrant parent. They accounted for 26 percent of the 68.9 million children under age 18 in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2000 and 13 percent in 1990.
Second-generation children, who were born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent, accounted for 88 percent (15.6 million) of all children under age 18 with immigrant parents. The remaining 12 percent (2.2 million) were born outside the United States.
For state-by-state and age information on children living with immigrant parents, see the Children in U.S. Immigrant Families data tool.
How has the number of children in immigrant families changed over time?
Between 2000 and 2010, the number of children ages 17 and under with immigrant parents grew 30 percent, from 13.1 million to 17 million. Between 2010 and 2019, the number grew by another 5 percent, reaching 17.8 million.
The population of first-generation children, who were born outside the United States, declined by 12 percent between 2000 and 2010, from 2.7 million to 2.4 million. It then declined further by another 9 percent between 2010 and 2019, to 2.2 million.
In contrast, the number of second-generation children has grown steadily since 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, the number increased by 40 percent, from 10.4 million to 14.6 million, followed by a 7 percent increase between 2010 and 2019, reaching 15.6 million.
How many children living with immigrant parents are in low-income families?
In 2019, there were 25.6 million children under age 18 living in families with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold. Of them, nearly 8 million (or 31 percent) were children of immigrants.
Children of immigrants were more likely to be in low-income families (45 percent of the 17.8 million) compared to children of U.S.-born parents (35 percent of the 51.1 million).
For state-level estimates of children of immigrants and share in low-income families, see the Demographic and Social Profiles in the State Immigration Data Profiles.
Which states have the largest number of children in immigrant families and which ones have experienced the fastest growth of this population?
In 2019, the top five states by the total number of children under age 18 living with immigrant parents were California (4 million), Texas (2.4 million), New York (1.4 million), Florida (1.4 million), and New Jersey (769,000). These states accounted for 56 percent of the 17.8 million U.S. children with immigrant parents.
The five states with the largest share of children with immigrant parents in 2019 were California (47 percent of all children in the state), New Jersey (41 percent), Nevada (38 percent), New York (36 percent), and Texas (35 percent).
While traditional immigrant destinations experienced the largest absolute growth in children with immigrant parents over time, other states have seen much larger relative growth (see Table 3). In some states, this is because the initial number of children with immigrant parents was quite small. Thus, relatively small absolute increases in the immigrant population in these states have translated into high percent growth.

Permanent Immigration
How many immigrants obtain lawful permanent residence (also known as getting a green card)?
In fiscal year (FY) 2019, 1 million immigrants became lawful permanent residents (LPRs, also known as green-card holders). The number of new LPRs in FY 2019 decreased by 64,800 from the prior year (a 6 percent drop). In the past decade, the annual number of new green-card recipients has ranged from 991,000 (FY 2013) to 1.2 million (FY 2016).
In recent years, immigrants obtaining LPR status have been, on average, about evenly divided between those already living in the United States who are adjusting their status and those applying from outside the country. More than 55 percent (or 573,000) of the 1 million new LPRs in FY 2019 received green cards from within the United States. Many of these new permanent residents are spouses, minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens, or persons who arrived as refugees or as temporary workers.
About 459,000 of the new LPRs (nearly 45 percent) were granted this status from abroad in FY 2019, a slight dip from previous years when the share of new arrivals was higher (48 percent in FY 2018 and 51 percent the prior year). Most new arrivals are immediate family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs.
Trace changing immigration trends over time with the Legal Immigration to the United States, 1820-Present data tool.
Under which categories are permanent immigrants admitted?
There are four main pathways to obtain a green card: through a family relationship, employment sponsorship, humanitarian protection (for refugees and asylees), and the Diversity Visa (DV) lottery (also known as the green-card lottery).
Overall, of the 1 million immigrants who received green cards in FY 2019, 49 percent were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens (an uncapped visa category), followed by another 20 percent of family-related immigrants (whose admission is limited by visa and country caps).
Ten percent of new green-card holders adjusted from refugee or asylee status. About 14 percent of new LPRs were either sponsored by their employers or self-petitioned, including investors who create jobs. Approximately 4 percent were diversity lottery winners.
What are the top five countries of birth for new permanent immigrants?
The top five countries of birth in FY 2019 were Mexico (15 percent), mainland China (6 percent), India (5 percent), the Dominican Republic (5 percent), and the Philippines (4 percent). These countries represented about 36 percent of everyone who received a green card in FY 2019.
How many people are selected in the Diversity Visa lottery and where do they come from?
In FY 2019, 43,000 people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States received a green card as diversity immigrants, representing approximately 4 percent of the 1 million new LPRs.
The leading countries of birth of DV immigrants were Egypt and Nepal, together accounting for about 14 percent of DV entrants adjusting to LPR status. Other top countries of origin were the Democratic Republic of the Congo (6 percent), Russia (5 percent), Albania (5 percent), Ukraine (4 percent), and Ethiopia, Cameroon, Turkey, and Algeria (3 percent each).
For some countries, the Diversity Visa lottery represents a major share of all new LPRs. For example, out of all nationals of Tajikistan adjusting to LPR status in FY 2019, 72 percent were DV immigrants. Shares were also high for nationals of Algeria (58 percent) and Azerbaijan (55 percent). DV lottery winners represented between 40 percent and 50 percent of new LPRs originally from Turkmenistan, Sudan, Benin, and Albania.
Created in 1990, the lottery sets aside 55,000 green cards annually, of which 5,000 must be used for applicants under the Nicaraguan and Central America Relief Act of 1997. Interest in the lottery is significantly higher than the amount of available visas; about 6.7 million qualified applications were registered for the DV-2021, covering 11.8 million applicants and their spouses and minor children. This number was down from 14.7 million in DV-2020 and 14.4 million in DV-2019. (The application number varies each year in part because of which countries are eligible.) Before receiving permission to immigrate, lottery winners must provide proof of a high school education or its equivalent or show two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience. They also must pass a medical exam and a background check.

Temporary Visas
How many people have temporary visas?
According to the most recent Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates available at this writing, 2.3 million foreign nationals on various temporary visas resided in the United States during FY 2016, up from about 2 million in FY 2015. Almost half (1.1 million) were temporary workers and their families, followed by 40 percent who were foreign students and their families (870,000).
Sixty-one percent were from Asia. Nationals of countries in Europe and North America accounted for 15 percent each. The top five countries of origin—India, China, Mexico, Canada, and South Korea—accounted for 57 percent of all residents on temporary visas.
Note: This estimate of temporary visa holders includes temporary workers, international students, exchange visitors, diplomats, and representatives of foreign governments and international organizations. It excludes tourists and other short-term visitors. North America includes Canada, Bermuda, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Read about temporary nonimmigrant population trends in Temporary Visa Holders in the United States.
How many people entered the United States on nonimmigrant visas?
According to the most recently available data from DHS, 42.7 million individuals entered in FY 2016 as I-94 nonimmigrants on various temporary visas. On average, each I-94 nonimmigrant was admitted 1.8 times. This is the first time, and to date the only time, the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) has estimated the number of unique individuals who came temporarily, as opposed to the number of nonimmigrant admissions or entries.
Most of these nonimmigrants—34.2 million—entered as tourists, followed by 3.7 million as business visitors. Of these, 15 million tourists and 1.7 million business travelers were from Visa Waiver Program countries, meaning they did not need a visa to enter the United States. Further, approximately 1 million international students entered on F-1 visas. OIS additionally estimated that about 290,300 individuals were admitted on high-skilled worker H-1B visas (mostly from India, China, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Mexico) and 81,600 on nonagricultural temporary or seasonal worker H-2B visas (mostly from Mexico, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa, and Canada).
Read more on Nonimmigrant Admissions and Estimated Nonimmigrant Individuals.
How many nonimmigrant visas does the State Department issue?
In FY 2020, the annual number of nonimmigrant visas issued by the State Department decreased for the fourth time since 2015, to 4 million—a 54 percent decline from the 8.7 million issued in FY 2019.
Seventy-one percent of the 4 million nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2020 were temporary business and tourist visas (B and BCC visas). The next largest visa class was for temporary workers and trainees and their family members (H visa categories), who comprised 12 percent of nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2020. The third largest group was for academic students and exchange visitors and their family members (F and J visa categories), who comprised 6 percent of nonimmigrant visas.
In addition to the Trump administration’s travel ban, which was extended to six other countries in early 2020, the sharp decline in nonimmigrant visa issuances in FY 2020 can be attributed to the worldwide slowdown in mobility amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the administration’s accompanying immigration restrictions. On June 22, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending the issuance of certain nonimmigrant visas. This proclamation applied to H-1B visas (for temporary workers in specialty occupations), H-2B visas (for nonagricultural workers), certain J visas (for exchange visitors), and L visas (for intracompany transferees), as well as visas issued to the dependents of these nonimmigrants.
Note: The number of visas issued does not necessarily match the number of foreign nationals who entered the United States in the same year because some nonimmigrant visas may not be used.
Read the State Department’s Annual Reports of the Visa Office.
Read the State Department’s fact sheet on Visa Refusals.
How many nonimmigrant admissions does DHS grant in a year?
DHS granted 186 million nonimmigrant admissions in FY 2019, of which 105 million were admissions of Canadians and Mexicans traveling for business or pleasure. These travelers are exempt from completing the I-94 arrival/departure form at the port of entry, thus DHS does not provide characteristics for this group.
In FY 2019, there were 81.6 million total temporary admissions of I-94 nonimmigrants, similar to the 81.3 million a year earlier (see Table 4).

Refugees and Asylum Seekers
Notes on Refugees and Asylees
What is the difference between a refugee and an asylee? In the United States, the main difference is the person's location at the time of application.
Refugees are nearly always outside of the United States when they are considered for resettlement, whereas asylum seekers submit their applications while physically present in or at a port of entry to the United States.
Asylum seekers can submit an asylum request either affirmatively or defensively. The affirmative asylum process applies to persons who initially file an asylum application with USCIS as well as applicants who subsequently have their application referred by USCIS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The defensive asylum process applies to persons in removal proceedings who appear before EOIR and people who apply for asylum at U.S. borders and points of entry.
How many refugees entered the United States, and where were they from?
Every year, the president in consultation with Congress sets the annual refugee admissions ceiling and allocations by region of origin. The Trump administration set the annual ceiling at 18,000 in FY 2020 and 15,000 in FY 2021, down from the 30,000 ceiling of FY 2019 and the lowest since the resettlement program was formally created in 1980. The Biden administration has pledged to reverse the cuts, including by raising the FY 2022 ceiling to 125,000 refugees.
In FY 2020, more than 11,800 refugees were resettled in the United States, amounting to 66 percent of the admission ceiling allocated for the year. This represents a 61 decrease from the 30,000 admissions in FY 2019.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Myanmar (also known as Burma), Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq were the primary countries of nationality, accounting for 68 percent (8,100) of all refugees resettled in FY 2020. Rounding out the top ten were Syria, Eritrea, El Salvador, Moldova, and Sudan. Together, nationals of the top ten countries comprised 85 percent (10,000) of all refugee arrivals in FY 2020 (see Table 5).

What is the female share of the resettled refugee population?
In FY 2020, about 48 percent of all resettled refugees in the United States were female.
What are the most common religions of refugees?
Refugees who identified as Christian (including Pentecostalists, Catholics, and Baptists) made up 74 percent of all admitted refugees in FY 2020. Muslim refugees (including Sunni and Shiite) comprised 22 percent of resettled refugees. The remainder included Buddhists (1 percent) and Hindu (under 1 percent). About 1 percent of refugees reported not being affiliated with any religion or being atheists.
Overall, the United States admitted more Christian refugees in the past decade than Muslim ones. Between FY 2010 and FY 2020, Christians represented 48 percent (286,100) of the 601,000 refugees with known religion data. In comparison, 33 percent (201,000) of refugees admitted during the same period were Muslim.
FY 2016 marked the only time since 2010 when the United States resettled more Muslim refugees (38,900 individuals, or 46 percent of the total 85,000 refugees in FY 2016) than Christians (44 percent, 37,500 individuals). Since the Trump administration implemented restrictions on admissions of nationals of particular countries, additional vetting procedures, and historically low admissions ceilings, the proportion of resettled Muslim and Christian refugees has changed substantially in the last five years.
Note: Refugee demographic data is based on self-identification, so religious breakdowns include major religions as well as denominations.
What are the most common languages spoken among refugees?
In FY 2020, the top languages spoken by resettled refugees were Ukrainian, Russian, Arabic, and Kiswahili. Rounding the top ten were Spanish, Kinyarwanda, Sgaw Karen, Kibembe, Tigrinya, and Dari. Speakers of the top ten languages made up 71 percent of all refugees resettled that year.
How many asylum applications were filed and where are asylum seekers from?
Approximately 92,800 affirmative asylum applications were received by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in FY 2020, the lowest number in five years. This marked the third year of declining applications after eight years of growth, and is at least partly due to the pandemic-related closure of USCIS offices for nearly three months. Applicants for affirmative asylum must be present in the United States, and do not include those seeking asylum through the defensive asylum process while in removal proceedings.
Meanwhile, 151,800 defensive asylum applications were filed with the Department of Justice’s immigration court system, known as the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), in FY 2020—a similar number as FY 2019 and a 31 percent increase from the 116,000 applications filed in FY 2018.
What is the asylum approval rate?
According to USCIS data, 31 percent of affirmative asylum petitions adjudicated in FY 2019 were approved, a slight increase from the 30 percent in FY 2018 but a decline from the 37 percent in FY 2017 and 43 percent in FY 2016. (USCIS data for FY 2020 were not available at the time of writing.)
Asylum petitions handled by immigration courts have undergone a steadier downward trend. In FY 2020, 26 percent of such petitions were approved, versus 29 percent in FY 2019, 33 percent in FY 2018, 37 percent in FY 2017, and 43 percent in FY 2016.
How many people receive asylum status?
In FY 2019, 46,500 individuals, including principal applicants and their spouses and/or unmarried children under age 21, were granted asylum after seeking protection upon or after arrival in the United States—a 24 percent increase from 37,600 in FY 2018.  An additional 3,300 individuals received derivative asylum status in the United States as immediate family members of principal applicants and 6,300 were approved for derivative status outside the United States. (Note that this number reflects travel documents issued to these family members, not their arrival in the United States.)
Nearly 60 percent of asylum grants came through USCIS (rather than in the immigration courts), of which there were 27,600 in FY 2019, up 13 percent from 24,400 in FY 2018 and up 77 percent from 15,600 in FY 2017. This increase is partly a result of a January 2018 policy change by USCIS to begin adjudicating asylum applications on a last-in, first-out basis, which the agency has said discourages non-meritorious cases.
China was the top country of origin for those receiving asylum in FY 2019, with 7,500 people (or 16 percent of total asylum grants), followed closely by Venezuela, with 6,800 individuals (accounting for 15 percent). Other top countries of origin were El Salvador (with 3,200), Guatemala (2,600), and India (2,300). Together, nationals of these five countries made up 48 percent of those receiving asylum in FY 2019.
What is the current asylum application backlog?
Due to the large application volume and limited resources, both the affirmative and defensive asylum systems have extensive backlogs. As of December 2020, according to USCIS, there were 350,000 affirmative cases pending; EOIR reported over 570,000 pending asylum cases.
For more information, see the USCIS affirmative asylum quarterly reports, the workload and adjudication statistics data on asylum cases from EOIR, and the Refugees and Asylees Annual Flow Report from DHS’s Office of Immigration Statistics.
For more on the immigration court backlog and asylum share, see the MPI report The U.S. Asylum System in Crisis: Charting a Way Forward.
Unauthorized Immigrants
How many unauthorized immigrants are in the United States?
The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) has estimated there were about 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States in 2018. Almost half resided in three states: California (24 percent), Texas (16 percent), and New York (8 percent). The vast majority (81 percent) lived in 178 counties with 10,000 or more unauthorized immigrants each, of which the top five—Los Angeles County, CA; Harris County, TX; Dallas County, TX; Cook County, IL; and Orange County, CA—accounted for 19 percent of all unauthorized immigrants.
Read Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States: Stable Numbers, Changing Origins for an overview of the characteristics of this population.
Visit the Data Hub’s Unauthorized Immigrant Population Profiles for detailed sociodemographic information for the United States, 41 states and the District of Columbia, and 127 counties.

See also MPI Estimates of Potential Beneficiaries under the DREAM Act of 2021.
Where are unauthorized immigrants from?
Mexicans and Central Americans accounted for roughly two-thirds (68 percent, or 7.4 million) of U.S. unauthorized immigrants as of 2014-18, MPI estimates. About 1.5 million (14 percent) were from Asia; 783,000 (7 percent) from South America; 648,000 (6 percent) from Europe, Canada, or Oceania; 406,000 (4 percent) from the Caribbean; and 230,000 (2 percent) from Africa.
The top five countries of birth for unauthorized immigrants were Mexico (51 percent), El Salvador (7 percent), Guatemala (5 percent), and India and Honduras (4 percent each).

How many unauthorized immigrants live with children under age 18?
About 4.4 million unauthorized immigrants (42 percent of all unauthorized immigrants ages 15 and older) lived with one or more children under age 18 as of 2014-18, MPI estimates. Of this group, about 84 percent (3.7 million) resided with at least one U.S.-citizen child under age 18 and 16 percent (704,000) lived with only non-U.S.-citizen children.
How many children under age 18 live with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent?
Approximately 5.2 million children under age 18 lived with an unauthorized immigrant parent during the 2014-18 period, representing 7 percent of the U.S. child population. About 85 percent (4.4 million) of these children were U.S. citizens, another 14 percent (728,000) were themselves unauthorized, and 1 percent (63,000) were legally present, including LPRs and those with temporary visas.
How many people are eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program under original rules and how many applications have been received since its launch in 2012?
The DACA program, announced on June 15, 2012, offers a two-year grant of deportation relief and work authorization to eligible young unauthorized immigrants. Requirements for eligibility include:
being at least 15 years old;
having entered the United States before the age of 16;
having continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007;
being enrolled in school, having earned a high school diploma or its equivalent, or being an honorably discharged veteran; and
having not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors; or otherwise posing a threat to public safety or national security.
On September 5, 2017, the Trump administration announced the termination of DACA, with a six-month wind-down. Multiple court challenges over the decision led to preliminary injunctions that allowed DACA recipients to renew their protections starting January 2018, but only for current holders or those who held DACA in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2020 that the DACA recission violated federal law.
After additional federal district court rulings, including one in November 2020 invalidating a DHS policy memo seeking to bar new DACA applicants and shorten work authorization periods, USCIS has been accepting new DACA applications. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden announced his intent to preserve the DACA program.
MPI estimates that 1.7 million individuals were DACA-eligible as of December 2020, 1.3 million of whom were immediately eligible under the program’s age and educational requirements.
Between August 15, 2012 (when the government began accepting applications) and September 30, 2020, a total of 827,100 applicants were approved, suggesting this is the maximum number of people who have ever held DACA status at one point or another during the life of the program. The agency granted 90 percent of the 914,600 initial applications; 9 percent (82,400) were denied, and 4,000 remained pending.
The top five states of residence for accepted initial applications since the program’s inception are California (28 percent), Texas (16 percent), Illinois and New York (5 percent each), and Florida (4 percent). The top five countries of origin of accepted applicants are Mexico (78 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and South Korea (1 percent).
How many people still have DACA status?
USCIS reports as of September 30, 2020, 640,700 individuals had active DACA status.
The top states of residence for DACA active participants were California (29 percent), Texas (16 percent), and Illinois (5 percent), followed by New York, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona (about 4 percent each).
The top countries of origin of active DACA program participants were Mexico (81 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and Peru, South Korea, Brazil, and Ecuador (about 1 percent each).

How many people are covered by Temporary Protected Status?
Since the Immigration Act of 1990, the United States has occasionally granted a form of humanitarian relief called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) when the origin countries of foreign nationals in the United States experience natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other circumstances making return unsafe. TPS offers work authorization and protection from deportation for six- to 18-month periods. El Salvador was the first country to be designated for TPS, in 1990, to protect Salvadorans who had fled its civil war.
Since 1990, 22 countries have been designated for TPS. Ten countries currently are designated: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. In 2020, an estimated 319,000 people from these ten countries had maintained active status under TPS, with the largest groups being Salvadorans (195,000), Hondurans (57,000), and Haitians (46,000).
The Trump administration attempted to halt extension of TPS for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan; court cases challenged the effort and TPS protections have been extended for those countries through October 4, 2021.

How many unaccompanied children and families have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border?
Enforcement encounters at the Southwest border decreased significantly in FY 2020, dropping sharply during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing slightly in the last couple months of the fiscal year. (The term "enforcement encounters," used by DHS, covers both apprehensions and the expulsions of most Southwest border arrivals since a pandemic-related public-health order took effect in March 2020.) The U.S. Border Patrol made 52,200 encounters of children and adults travelling as families (known as “family units”) and about 30,600 unaccompanied children along the Southwest border in FY 2020. This represents an 85 percent decrease from the 474,000 family units and 76,000 unaccompanied minors apprehended in FY 2019.
The apprehensions in FY 2019 were the highest recorded since recordkeeping began in FY 2008 for unaccompanied children and in FY 2012 for family units. But the FY 2020 encounters were also much lower than the 107,200 family units and 50,000 unaccompanied children apprehended in FY 2018, pointing to the impact of COVID-19 on activity at the border. In April, shortly after adopting new restrictions in response to the pandemic, only slightly more than 700 family units were intercepted at the Southwest border, a 79 percent decrease from the previous month. These children and families were primarily from Mexico, with smaller numbers from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala
Note: The term “family unit” refers to individuals—either a child under 18 years old, parent, or legal guardian—apprehended with a family member by the U.S. Border Patrol.

Immigration Enforcement
Note: The government fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. All figures for immigration control and enforcement given here are for the fiscal year. The data presented here are the most recent offered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
How many apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants occur at the border annually?
CBP reported 405,000 enforcement encounters at both the southern and northern borders in FY 2020, a significant decrease from 859,500 a year earlier.
Note: Apprehensions and expulsions are events, not individuals. In other words, the same individual can be apprehended more than once, with each apprehension counted separately.The recidivism rate has increased sharply since the expulsions policy began, given intercepted migrants are not being put into formal removal proceedings that could trigger criminal sanctions upon a future re-entry.
How many people are arrested by ICE within the United States yearly?
ICE made 103,600 administrative arrests in FY 2020, down 28 percent from a year earlier. ICE has attributed the drop to a change in focus during COVID-19. An administrative arrest is the arrest of an individual for a civil violation of U.S. immigration law, which is subsequently adjudicated by an immigration judge or through other administrative processes.
How many people are deported per year?
Removals and returns, which are carried out both by ICE and CBP, result in the confirmed movement of inadmissible or deportable aliens out of the United States. DHS reported a total of 531,300 removals and returns during FY 2019. CBP carried out 264,100 removals and returns in FY 2019, up 39 percent from 190,300 a year earlier. ICE carried out 267,300 removals and returns in FY 2019, a 4 percent increase from the prior year.
CBP data on FY 2020 returns and removals were not available at the time of writing, but ICE effectuated 185,900 removals and returns, a 30 percent decrease from FY 2019.
For more information, see FY 2020 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report.
Naturalization Trends
How many immigrants are naturalized citizens?
In FY 2019, 23.2 million immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, accounting for approximately 52 percent of the total foreign-born population (44.9 million) and 7 percent of the U.S. population (328.2 million), according to ACS estimates.
Of the 23.2 million naturalized citizens, 32 percent were naturalized between FY 2010 and 2019, 28 percent between FY 2000 and 2009, and 39 percent prior to FY 2000.
Use this Naturalization in the United States, 1910-Present tool to learn more about naturalization population over time.
How many immigrants become U.S. citizens annually?
USCIS naturalized about 844,000 green-card holders in FY 2019, an 11 percent increase from the 762,000 in FY 2018. The number of petitions for naturalization filed in FY 2019 (831,000) fell by 1 percent from a year earlier (837,000). At the same time, the number of denied petitions increased by 6 percent, from 93,000 in FY 2018 to 98,000 the following year. USCIS is taking longer to process naturalization applications, with average processing time increasing from 5.6 months in FY 2016 to 9.9 months in FY 2019.
From a historical perspective, naturalizations have increased dramatically in recent decades. On average, fewer than 120,000 LPRs became citizens each year between 1950 and 1969, 210,000 in the 1980s, 500,000 in the 1990s, and 680,000 during the 2000s. Naturalizations reached an all-time high in FY 2008, increasing 59 percent from 660,000 the prior year to 1,047,000. This came as a result of impending application fee increases and the promotion of U.S. citizenship in advance of the 2008 presidential election. Between 2010 and 2019, an average 730,000 immigrants received U.S. citizenship annually.
For more historical data on naturalization, see Naturalization in the United States, 1910-Present.
For more information, see Naturalization Trends in the United States.
For more information on USCIS processing times, see Historical National Average Processing Time for All USCIS Offices.
How many foreign nationals become U.S. citizens through military naturalization?
In FY 2019, 3,800 foreign-born military personnel became U.S. citizens, a 16 percent drop from the prior year (4,500) and the lowest number since FY 2002.
For more information on the foreign born in the U.S. military, see Noncitizens in the U.S. Military: Navigating National Security Concerns and Recruitment Needs.
Where are newly naturalized citizens from?
Of the new U.S. citizens in FY 2019, 14 percent were born in Mexico, 8 percent in India, and 5 percent each in the Philippines and China (see Table 6). Immigrants from these four countries, together with those from Cuba, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Iraq, El Salvador, and Jamaica comprised the top ten countries of birth for newly naturalized citizens in FY 2019. These countries accounted for 48 percent of the 844,000 new U.S. citizens that fiscal year.
Table 6. Top Ten Countries of Origin of Newly Naturalized Citizens, FY 2019
Source: DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2019.
Where do newly naturalized citizens live?
In FY 2019, 55 percent of the newly naturalized lived in one of five states: California, with 18 percent (148,800); followed by 12 percent in Texas (97,700); 11 percent in Florida (96,100); 10 percent in New York (85,400); and 4 percent in New Jersey (36,700).
The top five metropolitan areas with the largest number of naturalizations were New York-Newark-Jersey City (108,000), Miami-Ft Lauderdale-Pompano Beach (60,600), Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim (56,900), Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land (33,800), and Washington-Arlington-Alexandria (30,800). These five metro areas accounted for 34 percent of all naturalizations in FY 2019.
How many green-card holders are eligible to naturalize?
According to the latest available DHS estimates, about 9.1 million of the 13.6 million green-card holders residing in the United States on January 1, 2019 were eligible to naturalize.
For more information, see Estimates of the Lawful Permanent Resident Population.
How long does it take on average for green-card holders to naturalize?
On average, immigrants held green cards for eight years before becoming U.S. citizens in 2019, unchanged from the year before. The time varied by country of origin: African-born immigrants spent an average six years in LPR status before naturalization, followed by those born in Asia (seven years), South America (eight years), Europe (nine years), and Oceania and North America (including Central America, ten years each).
In general, naturalization requires being at least 18 years of age, passing English and civic exams, and for most, residing in the United States with LPR status continuously for at least five years (three years for those married to a U.S. citizen).
For more information, see DHS Annual Flow Reports.
Read the USCIS Naturalization Eligibility Requirements.
Visa Backlogs
Notes on Visa Backlogs
Two types of backlogs impact the issuance of green cards.
The first is due to visa availability (with caps established in 1990):
Family-sponsored preferences are limited to 226,000 visas per year.
Employment-based permanent visas for foreign workers and their families are capped at 140,000 per year worldwide.
Also, no country can receive more than 7 percent of the total annual number of family-sponsored and employment-based visas (approximately 25,600 visas).
The second type of backlog is due to processing delays of applicants' documents, which is related to government processing capacity as well as increased background and criminal checks.
How many visa applications for permanent immigration (green cards) are backlogged?
Because of limits on certain visa categories and per-country caps, the U.S. government in some cases is still processing applications that are more than two decades old. In February 2021, the State Department was processing some family-sponsored visa applications dating to September 1996, and employment-related visa applications from April 2009.
According to data on petitions submitted to the State Department, there were almost 4 million applicants (including spouses and minor children) who were on the waiting list as of November 1, 2020, a 10 percent increase from the same point in 2019 (when there were 3.6 million applicants).
The overwhelming majority of backlogs were family-sponsored applicants (3.8 million, which includes the principal applicant and his or her immediate family members). About 216,000 were employment-sponsored applicants and their families.
Of the overall 4 million applicants, 1.2 million were citizens of Mexico, followed by those from the Philippines (318,000), India (310,000), mainland China (247,000), and Vietnam (218,000). Family- and employment-based prospective immigrants who are waiting to adjust their status to lawful permanent residence from within the United States are not included in the State Department estimates.
USCIS also publishes backlog statistics, but only for petitions approved in one of the five employment-based categories. As of November 2020, slightly more than 500,000 approved employment-based immigrant petitions were awaiting a priority date. The figure corresponds to the number of primary applicants covered by these petitions but excludes their dependents. To MPI’s knowledge, USCIS has not published backlog statistics on other types of green-card applications the agency adjudicates.
In other words, the overall number of people waiting for a green card—within and outside of the United States—is likely to be larger than the 4 million reported by the State Department and 500,000 reported by USCIS (as of November 2020).
For more details about wait times by immigration category and country of origin, see the State Department Visa Bulletin.

US Immigration Trends and Patterns
Immigration to the United States has seen periods of wild fluctuations throughout the history of America. Discover why immigrant groups came to the United States, when the groups came to America and how the immigrants were received by existing citizens. Discover facts about the history of immigration in the United States and how its natural resources, the economic climate and the Industrialization and urbanization of America affected the trends and patterns of different groups of immigrants.
The numbers of immigrants to the United States have been categorized into three waves of immigration, each of which has distinctive US Immigration Trends and Patterns which explain why the numbers rose and fell across the decades.
*** Early immigration (1700s - 1850)
*** Second wave (1850 - 1970)
*** Recent immigration (1970 - present)
US Immigration
US Immigration Trends and Patterns: Numbers and Dates
From 1820-1867, the government recorded only arrivals at seaports. By 1868 all immigrant arrivals into the United States were recorded and provide a more accurate picture of US Immigration Trends and Patterns.
US Immigration Trends: Summary of US Immigration Trends and Patterns
The US Immigration Trends reflect the trends and patterns of immigration to the United States.
*** The first immigrants (1700s - 1850) chose to settle in the 'New World' for religious, political and economic reasons. The First industrial revolution fueled the need for labor in the United States as workers in Europe were looking for employment.
*** The trends and patterns of the second wave of immigrants (1850 - 1970) were first dictated by the rise of Big Business and corporations during the industrialization of America when industries cried out for unskilled, cheap foreign labor. This Immigration period then saw great fluctuations when immigration policies and laws, especially in relation to Mexico, changed to accommodate labor shortages caused by Americans being drafted into the military during the First and Second World wars and the Korean War. At the end of each war immigration laws were tightened again. When the US economy was hit by occurrences such as the Great Depression immigration was again restricted.
*** The trends and patterns of recent immigration (1970 - present) saw the end of the quota system based on on national origin. This sparked an upward trend in immigration from Mexico and an increase of refugees from Southeast Asia
US Immigration Trends and Patterns: Opening and Slamming the Door on Immigration
US Immigration Trends and Patterns and each successive wave of immigrants tend to reflect the economic and social conditions experienced within the United States and elsewhere in the world. The immigration policy and laws in the United States has either opened its door to new immigrants during periods of financial prosperity only to slam the door shut when times became hard. US Immigration Trends and Patterns also show that with every wave of immigration new migrants have faced hostility from native-born or established residents.
Recent US Immigration Trends and Patterns - The Year 2000
The year 2000 saw the origins of migrants to the United States as follows:
47.2% of migrants came to the United States from the Americas of which 50% came from Mexico
31.8% of migrants came to America from Asia and Oceana, the main countries or sources of emigration being China, India and the Philippines
15.6% of migrants came to America from Europe
5.4% of migrants came to America from Africa or other countries
US Immigration Trends and Patterns by Decades
The US Trends and patterns increased or decreased according to government policy and laws that were defined by historical events in the United States and determined the trends in immigration. The factors, causes and reasons of the changes in immigration flows to the United States have been detailed in the following articles:
