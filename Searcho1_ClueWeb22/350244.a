So I've been asked whether the Brady Bill reduced gun violence. Hmm, I remember something about the Brady Bill, but I need to refresh my memory on what exactly it is and its impact on gun violence.

First things first, I should probably look up what the Brady Bill is. I think it has something to do with background checks for gun purchases, but I'm not entirely sure. So, I need to get accurate information about the bill itself.

Brady Bill
The Brady Bill Explained
Modified date: December 22, 2019
The Brady Bill was a response to the use of a handgun in the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Four people were injured in the attacks. The Brady Bill, formally known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, was passed by the Congress in November of 1993 as an attempt to restrict access to guns. The restrictions in the bills were not actually new. The Gun Control Act of 1986 established the laws governing who was able to obtain the weapons.
The Brady Bill only served to make the enforcement of previous laws easier. It originally established a five day waiting period  before a gun purchase could be completed. After challenges to the constitutionality of the bill the waiting period lapsed. In its place a federal system of executing background checks was established to make sure that only people who were not prohibited from doing so were allowed to purchase guns. The Brady Bill has weathered criticism well, and has served as a foundation of the gun reform movement for more than fifteen years.
Background
The Brady Bill attempted to enforce gun control. It derived federal authorization from the ability of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce. It did not establish any new laws. It only allowed officials a more efficient way of making sure earlier bills, such as the Gun Control Act of 1986 and the National Firearms Act of 1934, could be allowed to work as intended. It grew out of concern aroused by an unsuccessful assassination attempt against President Reagan. The gun reform laws sought to make it more difficult for already identified persons who pose a risk to other citizens to obtain guns.
Goals and Objectives
Among the goals and objectives of the Brady Bill was to provide law enforcement officials with a simpler way of ensuring guns did not get into the hands of persons who were already legally prohibited from getting them. In his support for the Bill, Former President Reagan said it was essential to remove the honor system as the primary way of making sure criminals did not obtain new weapons.
The Brady Bill sought to institute a federal system to conduct background checks for any individual seeking to acquire a gun. Imposing further restrictions on gun possession were not included in the Brady Bill’s intentions.
History
The Brady Bill represented a progression of gun reform movements which began in 1934. The National Firearms Act prevented any American citizen from obtaining machine guns, such as those commonly used by gangsters. It made the acquisition and possession of these guns illegal. The Gun Control Act of 1968 was the next major gun reform. It established a federal system to license gun distributors, as well as restricting who could legally purchase guns within the United States.
The Gun Control Act also established three categorizations of weapons: handguns, sporting weapons such as shotguns or rifles, and automatic or semi-automatic weapons. The Brady Bill, unlike other gun reform measures, was only concerned with regulating handguns.
Criticisms
Critics of the Brady Bill have employed several different tactics. The have criticized it as an infringement upon the Second Amendment of the Constitution. These criticisms have not been successful when employed in the courts, though have a broad base of popular support.
Tenth Amendment objections have been more readily accepted by the courts, citing the fact that the federal government can not make lower governments do anything with which they do not agree. The courts have made the provisions voluntary, though few states have opted not to follow the bill. Criticism of the bill were organized by the NRA, although recent years have seen the volume of criticisms levied against the bill decline as it has become more accepted.

There were several purposes associated with the Brady Bill.
People were _told_ that the Brady Law would prevent criminals from getting guns.  They were told that X-percent of criminals buy their guns in stores, so after we pass this bill there would be that percentage fewer criminals with guns.
(Opponents of the bill disagreed, saying that criminals who would have bought their guns in stores would simply find other ways to get guns.  The results proved that supporters of the bill were wrong and its opponents were right.)

The Brady Bill requires that background checks be conducted on individuals before a firearm may be purchased from a federally licensed dealer, manufacturer or importer—unless an exception applies. If there are no additional state restrictions, a firearm may be transferred to an individual upon approval by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) maintained by the FBI. In some states, proof of a previous background check can be used to bypass the NICS check. For example, a state-issued concealed carry permit usually includes a background check equivalent to the one required

Why can't bills going through congress be single-subject?
I like Matt's answer, but I also have a simpler one: single-subject bills pass the House all the time, because it's very easy to vote on a bill.  But VERY few bills* pass the Senate, single-subject or otherwise.
So if you're going to take a bill to the Senate floor and potentially spend 30 legislative hours debating whether or not to proceed to the bill, nevermind approving it, it better be a good use of your time.

Why was the Brady Bill passed?
It was an emotional response to a shooting by an acknowledged insane individual of Ronald Reagan and Press Secretary James Brady. Like most “gun laws” it did little, if any to eliminate gun violence. Legal gun owners & NRA members commit an infinitesimally small amount of gun crimes. It’s like taking the drivers licenses away from victims of drunk drivers.

From our beginning in 1974, Brady has been about common-sense gun laws. We work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to close loopholes in the current gun laws and pass new legislation to save lives and prevent gun violence. That includes expanding Brady Background Checks to all gun sales and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Today, led by Brady President Kris Brown, we continue our namesake’s legacy of bipartisanship by reaching across the aisles, working with gun owners and non-gun owners alike, to make our country safer for all.

What is the remedy for a Brady violation?

What happened in Brady v Maryland?
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that established that the prosecution must turn over all evidence that might exonerate the defendant (exculpatory evidence) to the defense. The prosecution failed to do so for Brady, and he was convicted.
What should you do when you find exculpatory evidence?
Exculpatory evidence is any reasonable evidence that tends to show the defendant’s innocence. The rule is that all exculpatory evidence discovered by the prosecutor, investigators or law enforcement must be turned over to the defendant or his or her attorney, based on the defendant’s right to due process.
What would be the effect in the case when there is tampering of evidence?
Tampering with evidence can be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony. State prison for up to 20 years for felony tampering with evidence. You may be ordered to pay as much as $10,000 on a state conviction. Federal sentencing may include fines and up to 20 years in prison.
What is the difference between inculpatory and exculpatory evidence?
Any evidence that is favorable to the defendant in a criminal trial is considered exculpatory. Likewise, any evidence favorable to the prosecution is inculpatory. But any evidence showing that the defendant is not guilty is considered exculpatory.
What happens after a case is closed?
If you’re looking at a police report, it might say case closed with arrest. If a court file, closed means dismissed, acquitted or convicted. Given your friend is sitting in jail, I’m guessing you found that language in a police report, or you are misreading the court file.
Can charges be brought back up after being dismissed?
Yes, you can be recharged. A dismissal is not an adjudication of the charge on its merits, so double jeopardy doesn’t apply. To dismiss and recharge an individual is a common tactic utilized by the state frequently.
What does it mean if the case is closed?
It means that the court is done with the case either with a completed sentence or dismissal.
What happens when an investigation is closed?
Investigations often take a long time, and until that investigation closes, there is limited information that will be shared. When the investigation closes, the report of investigation (ROI) or findings from the investigation are sent up the chain of command for commanders and JAGs to decide the course of action.
How do you know if an investigation is over?
The only surefire way to know that the investigation is over, or that it can no longer impact you in a criminal sense, is the expiration of the statute of limitations, which can vary based on the type of offense.
Can a closed investigation be reopened?
Need more information about the case, but, yes, they can reopen a case if they believe they have found evidence to support it….as long it is within the statute of limitations. You should consider consulting a local criminal attorney and fully explain your situation.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Did the Brady Bill reduce gun violence?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what the Brady Bill is. From what I recall, it has something to do with background checks for gun purchases. But I should probably look that up to make sure I have the facts straight.

So, I did a search for "what is the Brady Bill?" and got some results. Let's see what they say.

According to the first document from LAWS.com, the Brady Bill is formally known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. It was passed in 1993 and aims to restrict access to guns by establishing a system for background checks. It came about after an assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981, where James Brady was injured. So, it's named after him.

The second document from USLegal confirms that. It says the Brady Bill is a federal statute signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993. It established a national system for background checks when someone wants to purchase a handgun.

The third document is from Quora, where people are discussing the purpose of the Brady Bill. One answer says it was meant to make people who don't like guns feel good, implying it didn't do much to actually reduce violence. Another answer suggests that while it was presented as a way to keep criminals from getting guns, in reality, criminals would just find other ways to get them.

Hmm, so there's some skepticism about its effectiveness. But I need to look into whether it actually reduced gun violence.

Looking back at the LAWS.com article, it mentions that the Brady Bill has weathered criticism well and has been a foundation of the gun reform movement for over fifteen years. But it doesn't specifically say whether it reduced gun violence.

The USLegal definition is more about what the law entails rather than its impact.

So, I need to find studies or data that look at the effect of the Brady Bill on gun violence rates.

Maybe I should search for "effect of Brady Bill on gun violence" or "did the Brady Bill reduce gun violence?"

Let me try that.

Study Shows Brady Bill Had No Impact on Gun Homicides | University of Virginia School of Law
Study Shows Brady Bill Had No Impact on Gun Homicides
March 13, 2003
Michael Marshall
Philip J. Cook, regarded as the nation's foremost authority on gun control, said the Brady Bill may have had some effect on preventing suicides for people over the age of 55.
The Brady Bill, the most important piece of federal gun control legislation in recent decades, has had no statistically discernable effect on reducing gun deaths, according to a study by Philip J. Cook, a Duke University professor of public policy, economics and sociology. "The Brady Bill seems to have been a failure," Cook told an audience in Caplin Pavilion on March 11. "But that doesn't mean gun control is doomed to failure."
Regarded as the nation's foremost authority on gun control, Cook spoke on "Evaluating the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act" to inaugurate a new lecture series on public health, law and ethics issues. Elected in 2001 to the prestigious Institute of Medicine, Cook is also known for his work on alcohol problems. In a 1981 study, he demonstrated that alcohol taxes have a direct effect on reducing drinking.
Passed in 1993, the Brady Bill was named for Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was badly wounded in the assassination attempt on Reagan in March 1981. Brady's wife Sarah subsequently became widely known for advocacy of the law and gun control in general.
The Brady Bill had two iterations, Cook explained, but in each the law applies only to handgun sales by federally licensed gun dealers. In the first version, in effect from 1994 to 1997, there were background check and waiting-period provisions. In 1997, the Supreme Court struck down the background check component on 10th Amendment grounds, ruling that the provision usurped states' rights. A new version was passed in 1998, this time covering all guns, instituting an "instant" background check of states' and FBI databases identifying criminals and requiring a three-day waiting period. Fingerprint checks have never been required. At the time it first passed, the law obliged 32 states to change laws to come into conformity. Laws in 18 states were already in compliance and these made an ideal control group for a study, Cook said. Following the 1998 revision only two statesOhio and Arkansasdid not reestablish background checks, but Cook said they nonetheless remained in the group considered "treatment" states by the study.
Data shows a slow gradual decline in gun homicides from 1993 to the present, a trend that started before the Brady Bill passed, but figures from both the control and treatment states track virtually identically. "Control and treatment states had the same gun homicide rates before and after the Brady law passed," Cook said. "It made no discernable difference. There is no statistically significant effect."
Data on gun suicides showed the same trends, though Cook said there is "some hint of an effect" on the gun suicide rate for persons over age 55, some of whom appear to be deterred by the waiting period. But overall suicide rates do not decline, suggesting that some people simply changed their method when they couldn't get a gun more easily.
Cook, who acknowledged that his personal sympathies are for gun control, said, "Maybe the law did save a handful of lives, a couple hundred per year," and that other public health and safety laws are enacted to save similar numbers of lives.
On the plus side, there is strong evidence that the law undermined gun-running operations that were buying large numbers of guns in southern states and transporting them north for resale, he said. The law has also helped improve criminal history records. Proponents of the law also point to the 60,000 people trying to buy guns who were turned down after background checks revealed that they were felons. But a later California study showed that the turndowns had no effect on criminal activity.

Brady Bill
The Brady Bill Explained
Modified date: December 22, 2019
The Brady Bill was a response to the use of a handgun in the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Four people were injured in the attacks. The Brady Bill, formally known as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, was passed by the Congress in November of 1993 as an attempt to restrict access to guns. The restrictions in the bills were not actually new. The Gun Control Act of 1986 established the laws governing who was able to obtain the weapons.
The Brady Bill only served to make the enforcement of previous laws easier. It originally established a five day waiting period  before a gun purchase could be completed. After challenges to the constitutionality of the bill the waiting period lapsed. In its place a federal system of executing background checks was established to make sure that only people who were not prohibited from doing so were allowed to purchase guns. The Brady Bill has weathered criticism well, and has served as a foundation of the gun reform movement for more than fifteen years.
Background
The Brady Bill attempted to enforce gun control. It derived federal authorization from the ability of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce. It did not establish any new laws. It only allowed officials a more efficient way of making sure earlier bills, such as the Gun Control Act of 1986 and the National Firearms Act of 1934, could be allowed to work as intended. It grew out of concern aroused by an unsuccessful assassination attempt against President Reagan. The gun reform laws sought to make it more difficult for already identified persons who pose a risk to other citizens to obtain guns.
Goals and Objectives
Among the goals and objectives of the Brady Bill was to provide law enforcement officials with a simpler way of ensuring guns did not get into the hands of persons who were already legally prohibited from getting them. In his support for the Bill, Former President Reagan said it was essential to remove the honor system as the primary way of making sure criminals did not obtain new weapons.
The Brady Bill sought to institute a federal system to conduct background checks for any individual seeking to acquire a gun. Imposing further restrictions on gun possession were not included in the Brady Bill’s intentions.
History
The Brady Bill represented a progression of gun reform movements which began in 1934. The National Firearms Act prevented any American citizen from obtaining machine guns, such as those commonly used by gangsters. It made the acquisition and possession of these guns illegal. The Gun Control Act of 1968 was the next major gun reform. It established a federal system to license gun distributors, as well as restricting who could legally purchase guns within the United States.
The Gun Control Act also established three categorizations of weapons: handguns, sporting weapons such as shotguns or rifles, and automatic or semi-automatic weapons. The Brady Bill, unlike other gun reform measures, was only concerned with regulating handguns.
Criticisms
Critics of the Brady Bill have employed several different tactics. The have criticized it as an infringement upon the Second Amendment of the Constitution. These criticisms have not been successful when employed in the courts, though have a broad base of popular support.
Tenth Amendment objections have been more readily accepted by the courts, citing the fact that the federal government can not make lower governments do anything with which they do not agree. The courts have made the provisions voluntary, though few states have opted not to follow the bill. Criticism of the bill were organized by the NRA, although recent years have seen the volume of criticisms levied against the bill decline as it has become more accepted.

Brady Bill
Understanding Gun Reform
Modified date: December 22, 2019
The Brady Campaign is an gun reform organization which seeks to reduce both the prevalence of violent crimes involving the use of handguns, as well as the availability of handguns. While its gun reforms have been focused on and most successful in the attempts to regulate handguns it is also concerned with the proliferation of other types of guns.
It is part of a growing gun reform movement. Two gun reforms can be contributed to the actions of the Brady Campaign. The first is the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act, which is commonly referred to as the Brady Bill. The second is the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which is more commonly known by its subtitle the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.
The Brady Campaign was previously known as Handgun Control, Incorporated (HCI), which itself emerged from the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH) and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV). A victim of gun crime, Dr. Mark Borinsky, founded the NCCH in 1974. The NCCH and CPHV combined to form HCI in 1980.
HCI grew rapidly following the failed assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan in 1981. Jim Brady, Reagan’s press secretary, was paralyzed in the attack. After Brady’s injury his wife became involved in the gun reform movement. In 1985 she joined HCI. By 1989 she became the head of this gun reform movement. In 1991 she was named the chairwoman of CPHV. After seven years, Sarah Brady’s campaign to as the head of these two gun reform movements succeeded, leading Congress to pass the Brady Bill in 1993. President Clinton signed the bill into law on February 4, 1994.
On June 14, 2001, Handgun Control, Inc. was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in recognition of the efforts of Jim and Sarah Brady in enacting gun reforms. Sarah Brady served as chairwoman of the Brady Campaign from 1989 until 2000. The Brady Campaign was lead by Michael D. Barnes until May 2006, when Paul Helmke, the former mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana replaced him as head of the gun reform movement.
The Brady Campaign was sometimes confused with other similarly name organizations, but since each was focused on gun reforms it was not considered a source of contention. Although the particular gun reforms sought by each differed slightly from organization to organization, they all sought gun reforms which they believed would make Americans safer.

As of 2016, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that aimed to promote policies centered on "keeping guns out of the wrong hands." [1]
Mission
The Brady Campaign's website listed the following mission statement: [1]
“
The mission of the Brady organization is to create a safer America for all of us that will lead to a dramatic reduction in gun deaths and injuries. [2]
”
History
On March 30, 1981, during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan (R), Jim Brady—Reagan's press secretary—was shot and seriously wounded in the head by John Hinckley. According to a New York Times account of the shooting, Brady's "left forehead and frontal sinus were shattered by the impact and possible explosion of the devastator bullet." [3] After the shooting and Brady's recovery, Brady and his wife, Sarah, worked to get laws passed that would put restrictions on firearms sales. The Brady Law was passed in 1993. [4] The law "requires federal background checks on those who buy guns from licensed dealers." [5]
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was an outgrowth of the work Jim and Sarah Brady did when working for the handgun bill. Initially, they began an organization called the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a sister organization to the violence-prevention organization Handgun Control, Inc. Sarah Brady became the center's chair in 1991, and Handgun Control, Inc. was renamed the Brady Campaign in 2001. [6]
Work
As of 2016, The Brady Campaign focused its work in three areas, which the organization called "Changing Laws," "Changing the Gun Industry," and "Changing Culture." The group's stated goal was to cut gun deaths in half by 2025 and work to do this in legislation by promoting an expansion of the Brady Law's required background checks. The organization's website noted, "Policies such as expanding background checks to cover all gun sales would help keep guns out of the hands of criminals, felons, domestic abusers, and other illegal purchasers." [7] In addition to legislative reform, the group worked for reform within the gun industry "by holding gun companies accountable to victims in the courts." [8]

Brady Campaign's "Gun Laws for Dummies"
In addition to proposing policy and industry solutions, the Brady Campaign also rated states on their gun control measures. [9] The organization also focused on state-based legislative work in recent years, according to a report by NPR in 2016. [10]
One of the most visible actions the Brady Campaign engages in is the "Million Mom March," a rally to end gun violence, which, as of 2016, was held in Washington, D.C., every Mother's Day. The campaign began after a shooting at a preschool in Granada Hills, Calif., in 2009; Donna Dees-Thomases started the organization because gun control groups at the time "were very top-down, very male-oriented, with the philosophy that they had to do everything themselves or hire a lobbyist. What was missing was mothers." [11] The march became part of the Brady Campaign in 2001. [12]

Social justice issues in America: Gun violence – Milwaukee Times Weekly Newspaper
Social justice issues in America: Gun violence
January 28, 2021
The Brady United, an organization inspired by Jim and Sarah Brady that led to President Clinton signing the Brady Bill into law, notes that gun violence is a racial justice issue. Brady United notes that Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from gun violence and 14 times more likely than white Americas to be wounded. Gun violence, according to bradyunited.org, alone reduces the life expectancy of Black Americans by four years.
Rules have been promulgated on a federal level to reduce gun violence. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) recognizes the role that firearms play in violent crimes and has pursued an integrated regulatory and enforcement strategy that involves investigative priorities focusing on armed violent offenders and career criminals, narcotics traffickers, narco-terrorists, violent gangs and domestic and international arms traffickers. ATF 41F Rule sets forth certain rules and requirements involving firearms requiring background checks as a public safety benefit for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust, corporation, or other legal entity. Each responsible person must submit a photograph and fingerprints when application for a firearm is made. ATF also requires no firearm may be transferred in the U.S. unless an application has been filed for transfer of a firearm. See the full rules and regulations at atf.gov.
This issue is important as in Milwaukee in 2020 there were 189 homicides according to the Milwaukee Police Department, nearly doubling the homicides in 2019. Milwaukee also saw an alarming trend of kids becoming victims of gun violence. According to a May 2020 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, CBS News reported 15 kids were injured or killed in Milwaukee gun violence over a 2-month period. The report called this news “gravely concerning.” We all must work together to help reduce gun violence in our neighborhoods.
The City of Milwaukee Office of Violence Prevention is dedicated to the prevention of gun violence and works as a resource to the City on local and national gun policy as well as facilitating action plans and projects for interested organizations and communities that want to reduce gun violence in their neighborhoods. Visit their website at https://city.milwaukee.gov/Health/Services-and-Programs/staysafe/gunViolence for more information
Gun safety in the home
It is recognized many families keep a gun in the home. KidsHealth from Nemours addressed the issue of gun safety, indicating that the safest way to store a gun if you have children in the home:
• Keep the gun unloaded and locked up in a cabinet, safe, gun vault, or storage case.
• Lock the bullets in a place separate from the gun.
• Hide the keys to the locked storage.
Young children are curious. Even if you have talked to them about the dangers of gun safety, young children can’t truly understand how dangerous guns are. If they come across a loaded gun, they can accidentally hurt or kill themselves or someone else.
KidsHealth also suggests if your child is going to someone’s house, it is important to know if there are guns in the home. It may be awkward to ask, but most people will understand that you’re trying to protect your child.
Beloved, our nation’s children are faced with pandemic levels of exposure to violence. Gun violence has become a major problem and it is going to take more than one sector of society and more than one group, but the entire community working together to be more deliberate in ensuring our youth do not become victims of violence, preventing childhood exposure to violence, and developing a plan to make our communities safer from violence.

Okay, so from the first search, I have a basic understanding of what the Brady Bill is. It's a federal law that requires background checks for handgun purchases from licensed dealers. It was passed in 1993 and is named after James Brady, who was injured in an assassination attempt on President Reagan.

Now, I need to find out if this bill reduced gun violence. The second search I did provided some insights. There's a study from Duke University's Philip J. Cook that suggests the Brady Bill had no statistically discernable effect on reducing gun homicides. The data showed similar trends in both control and treatment states, meaning the law didn't make a noticeable difference in gun homicide rates.

However, another document mentions that the Brady Bill might have had some effect on preventing suicides in people over 55, but overall, suicide rates didn't decline significantly. Also, it's noted that the law may have disrupted gun-running operations and improved criminal history records.

Looking at the Brady Campaign's perspective, they seem to view the Brady Bill as a foundational step in gun reform, even if its direct impact on reducing gun violence isn't clearly evident. They focus on the importance of background checks in keeping guns out of the wrong hands.

But I need more recent data or studies to see if there's been any long-term effect of the Brady Bill on gun violence. Maybe I should look for research or statistics from after the implementation of the bill.

Study Shows Brady Bill Had No Impact on Gun Homicides | University of Virginia School of Law
Study Shows Brady Bill Had No Impact on Gun Homicides
March 13, 2003
Michael Marshall
Philip J. Cook, regarded as the nation's foremost authority on gun control, said the Brady Bill may have had some effect on preventing suicides for people over the age of 55.
The Brady Bill, the most important piece of federal gun control legislation in recent decades, has had no statistically discernable effect on reducing gun deaths, according to a study by Philip J. Cook, a Duke University professor of public policy, economics and sociology. "The Brady Bill seems to have been a failure," Cook told an audience in Caplin Pavilion on March 11. "But that doesn't mean gun control is doomed to failure."
Regarded as the nation's foremost authority on gun control, Cook spoke on "Evaluating the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act" to inaugurate a new lecture series on public health, law and ethics issues. Elected in 2001 to the prestigious Institute of Medicine, Cook is also known for his work on alcohol problems. In a 1981 study, he demonstrated that alcohol taxes have a direct effect on reducing drinking.
Passed in 1993, the Brady Bill was named for Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was badly wounded in the assassination attempt on Reagan in March 1981. Brady's wife Sarah subsequently became widely known for advocacy of the law and gun control in general.
The Brady Bill had two iterations, Cook explained, but in each the law applies only to handgun sales by federally licensed gun dealers. In the first version, in effect from 1994 to 1997, there were background check and waiting-period provisions. In 1997, the Supreme Court struck down the background check component on 10th Amendment grounds, ruling that the provision usurped states' rights. A new version was passed in 1998, this time covering all guns, instituting an "instant" background check of states' and FBI databases identifying criminals and requiring a three-day waiting period. Fingerprint checks have never been required. At the time it first passed, the law obliged 32 states to change laws to come into conformity. Laws in 18 states were already in compliance and these made an ideal control group for a study, Cook said. Following the 1998 revision only two statesOhio and Arkansasdid not reestablish background checks, but Cook said they nonetheless remained in the group considered "treatment" states by the study.
Data shows a slow gradual decline in gun homicides from 1993 to the present, a trend that started before the Brady Bill passed, but figures from both the control and treatment states track virtually identically. "Control and treatment states had the same gun homicide rates before and after the Brady law passed," Cook said. "It made no discernable difference. There is no statistically significant effect."
Data on gun suicides showed the same trends, though Cook said there is "some hint of an effect" on the gun suicide rate for persons over age 55, some of whom appear to be deterred by the waiting period. But overall suicide rates do not decline, suggesting that some people simply changed their method when they couldn't get a gun more easily.
Cook, who acknowledged that his personal sympathies are for gun control, said, "Maybe the law did save a handful of lives, a couple hundred per year," and that other public health and safety laws are enacted to save similar numbers of lives.
On the plus side, there is strong evidence that the law undermined gun-running operations that were buying large numbers of guns in southern states and transporting them north for resale, he said. The law has also helped improve criminal history records. Proponents of the law also point to the 60,000 people trying to buy guns who were turned down after background checks revealed that they were felons. But a later California study showed that the turndowns had no effect on criminal activity.
Cook said the real problem is the law's "gaping barn door" for unregulated sales, mainly at gun shows, but no one knows how many guns are bought with false IDs or exchanged privately, to say nothing of those being stolen.
He praised an Illinois law that requires gun owners to have ID cards and to record the ID numbers of individuals they sell guns to. Failure to keep records or report a stolen gun can result in prosecution. Cook also endorsed gun locks as a cheap and sensible way to render guns useless except to the owner.
Founded in 1819, the University of Virginia School of Law is the second-oldest continuously operating law school in the nation. Consistently ranked among the top law schools, Virginia is a world-renowned training ground for distinguished lawyers and public servants, instilling in them a commitment to leadership, integrity and community service.

Social justice issues in America: Gun violence
January 28, 2021
The Brady United, an organization inspired by Jim and Sarah Brady that led to President Clinton signing the Brady Bill into law, notes that gun violence is a racial justice issue. Brady United notes that Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from gun violence and 14 times more likely than white Americas to be wounded. Gun violence, according to bradyunited.org, alone reduces the life expectancy of Black Americans by four years.
Rules have been promulgated on a federal level to reduce gun violence. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) recognizes the role that firearms play in violent crimes and has pursued an integrated regulatory and enforcement strategy that involves investigative priorities focusing on armed violent offenders and career criminals, narcotics traffickers, narco-terrorists, violent gangs and domestic and international arms traffickers. ATF 41F Rule sets forth certain rules and requirements involving firearms requiring background checks as a public safety benefit for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust, corporation, or other legal entity. Each responsible person must submit a photograph and fingerprints when application for a firearm is made. ATF also requires no firearm may be transferred in the U.S. unless an application has been filed for transfer of a firearm. See the full rules and regulations at atf.gov.
This issue is important as in Milwaukee in 2020 there were 189 homicides according to the Milwaukee Police Department, nearly doubling the homicides in 2019. Milwaukee also saw an alarming trend of kids becoming victims of gun violence. According to a May 2020 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, CBS News reported 15 kids were injured or killed in Milwaukee gun violence over a 2-month period. The report called this news “gravely concerning.” We all must work together to help reduce gun violence in our neighborhoods.
The City of Milwaukee Office of Violence Prevention is dedicated to the prevention of gun violence and works as a resource to the City on local and national gun policy as well as facilitating action plans and projects for interested organizations and communities that want to reduce gun violence in their neighborhoods.

Gun safety in the home
It is recognized many families keep a gun in the home. KidsHealth from Nemours addressed the issue of gun safety, indicating that the safest way to store a gun if you have children in the home:
• Keep the gun unloaded and locked up in a cabinet, safe, gun vault, or storage case.
• Lock the bullets in a place separate from the gun.
• Hide the keys to the locked storage.
Young children are curious. Even if you have talked to them about the dangers of gun safety, young children can’t truly understand how dangerous guns are. If they come across a loaded gun, they can accidentally hurt or kill themselves or someone else.
KidsHealth also suggests if your child is going to someone’s house, it is important to know if there are guns in the home. It may be awkward to ask, but most people will understand that you’re trying to protect your child.
Beloved, our nation’s children are faced with pandemic levels of exposure to violence. Gun violence has become a major problem and it is going to take more than one sector of society and more than one group, but the entire community working together to be more deliberate in ensuring our youth do not become victims of violence, preventing childhood exposure to violence, and developing a plan to make our communities safer from violence.

As of 2016, The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that aimed to promote policies centered on "keeping guns out of the wrong hands." [1]
Mission
The Brady Campaign's website listed the following mission statement: [1]
“
The mission of the Brady organization is to create a safer America for all of us that will lead to a dramatic reduction in gun deaths and injuries. [2]
”
History
On March 30, 1981, during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan (R), Jim Brady—Reagan's press secretary—was shot and seriously wounded in the head by John Hinckley. According to a New York Times account of the shooting, Brady's "left forehead and frontal sinus were shattered by the impact and possible explosion of the devastator bullet." [3] After the shooting and Brady's recovery, Brady and his wife, Sarah, worked to get laws passed that would put restrictions on firearms sales. The Brady Law was passed in 1993. [4] The law "requires federal background checks on those who buy guns from licensed dealers." [5]
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was an outgrowth of the work Jim and Sarah Brady did when working for the handgun bill. Initially, they began an organization called the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a sister organization to the violence-prevention organization Handgun Control, Inc. Sarah Brady became the center's chair in 1991, and Handgun Control, Inc. was renamed the Brady Campaign in 2001. [6]
Work
As of 2016, The Brady Campaign focused its work in three areas, which the organization called "Changing Laws," "Changing the Gun Industry," and "Changing Culture." The group's stated goal was to cut gun deaths in half by 2025 and work to do this in legislation by promoting an expansion of the Brady Law's required background checks. The organization's website noted, "Policies such as expanding background checks to cover all gun sales would help keep guns out of the hands of criminals, felons, domestic abusers, and other illegal purchasers." [7] In addition to legislative reform, the group worked for reform within the gun industry "by holding gun companies accountable to victims in the courts." [8]

In addition to proposing policy and industry solutions, the Brady Campaign also rated states on their gun control measures. [9] The organization also focused on state-based legislative work in recent years, according to a report by NPR in 2016. [10]
One of the most visible actions the Brady Campaign engages in is the "Million Mom March," a rally to end gun violence, which, as of 2016, was held in Washington, D.C., every Mother's Day. The campaign began after a shooting at a preschool in Granada Hills, Calif., in 2009; Donna Dees-Thomases started the organization because gun control groups at the time "were very top-down, very male-oriented, with the philosophy that they had to do everything themselves or hire a lobbyist. What was missing was mothers." [11] The march became part of the Brady Campaign in 2001. [12]

From these documents, it seems that the impact of the Brady Bill on gun violence is not definitively clear. The study by Philip J. Cook suggests that it had no statistically discernable effect on reducing gun homicides, although there might have been some effect on gun suicides among older adults. However, the Brady Campaign and other organizations continue to advocate for stronger gun control measures, including expanded background checks, as a way to reduce gun violence.

I should look for more recent studies or data that might show long-term effects or changes in gun violence rates after the implementation of the Brady Bill.

Study Shows Brady Bill Had No Impact on Gun Homicides | University of Virginia School of Law
Study Shows Brady Bill Had No Impact on Gun Homicides
March 13, 2003
Michael Marshall
Philip J. Cook, regarded as the nation's foremost authority on gun control, said the Brady Bill may have had some effect on preventing suicides for people over the age of 55.
The Brady Bill, the most important piece of federal gun control legislation in recent decades, has had no statistically discernable effect on reducing gun deaths, according to a study by Philip J. Cook, a Duke University professor of public policy, economics and sociology. "The Brady Bill seems to have been a failure," Cook told an audience in Caplin Pavilion on March 11. "But that doesn't mean gun control is doomed to failure."
Regarded as the nation's foremost authority on gun control, Cook spoke on "Evaluating the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act" to inaugurate a new lecture series on public health, law and ethics issues. Elected in 2001 to the prestigious Institute of Medicine, Cook is also known for his work on alcohol problems. In a 1981 study, he demonstrated that alcohol taxes have a direct effect on reducing drinking.
Passed in 1993, the Brady Bill was named for Ronald Reagan's press secretary, James Brady, who was badly wounded in the assassination attempt on Reagan in March 1981. Brady's wife Sarah subsequently became widely known for advocacy of the law and gun control in general.
The Brady Bill had two iterations, Cook explained, but in each the law applies only to handgun sales by federally licensed gun dealers. In the first version, in effect from 1994 to 1997, there were background check and waiting-period provisions. In 1997, the Supreme Court struck down the background check component on 10th Amendment grounds, ruling that the provision usurped states' rights. A new version was passed in 1998, this time covering all guns, instituting an "instant" background check of states' and FBI databases identifying criminals and requiring a three-day waiting period. Fingerprint checks have never been required. At the time it first passed, the law obliged 32 states to change laws to come into conformity. Laws in 18 states were already in compliance and these made an ideal control group for a study, Cook said. Following the 1998 revision only two statesOhio and Arkansasdid not reestablish background checks, but Cook said they nonetheless remained in the group considered "treatment" states by the study.
Data shows a slow gradual decline in gun homicides from 1993 to the present, a trend that started before the Brady Bill passed, but figures from both the control and treatment states track virtually identically. "Control and treatment states had the same gun homicide rates before and after the Brady law passed," Cook said. "It made no discernable difference. There is no statistically significant effect."
Data on gun suicides showed the same trends, though Cook said there is "some hint of an effect" on the gun suicide rate for persons over age 55, some of whom appear to be deterred by the waiting period. But overall suicide rates do not decline, suggesting that some people simply changed their method when they couldn't get a gun more easily.
Cook, who acknowledged that his personal sympathies are for gun control, said, "Maybe the law did save a handful of lives, a couple hundred per year," and that other public health and safety laws are enacted to save similar numbers of lives.
On the plus side, there is strong evidence that the law undermined gun-running operations that were buying large numbers of guns in southern states and transporting them north for resale, he said. The law has also helped improve criminal history records. Proponents of the law also point to the 60,000 people trying to buy guns who were turned down after background checks revealed that they were felons. But a later California study showed that the turndowns had no effect on criminal activity.
Cook said the real problem is the law's "gaping barn door" for unregulated sales, mainly at gun shows, but no one knows how many guns are bought with false IDs or exchanged privately, to say nothing of those being stolen.
He praised an Illinois law that requires gun owners to have ID cards and to record the ID numbers of individuals they sell guns to. Failure to keep records or report a stolen gun can result in prosecution. Cook also endorsed gun locks as a cheap and sensible way to render guns useless except to the owner.

Researchers Tackle Gun Violence Despite Lack of Federal Funding

February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., which left 17 dead and 17 more wounded, horrified people across the country, spurring student walkouts and marches in support of stricter gun control laws, including universal, comprehensive background checks and a ban on assault weapons. But gun debates in the United States have proven to be contentious and intractable. Even as thousands rally for new legislation, opponents contend that such measures won't prevent determined criminals from obtaining a firearm and that responsible gun ownership makes communities safer.
In charting a course forward, it is necessary to move beyond "people's anecdotal opinions," says David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. He and other researchers are analyzing data and conducting studies with the ultimate goal of informing public policy. It's a tough task, in part because of a by now well-known piece of legislation called the Dickey Amendment, passed by Congress in 1996 with the support of the National Rifle Association. This amendment prevented the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using funds "to advocate or promote gun control." It didn't ban federally-funded gun research, but the legislation had a chilling effect: from 1996 to 2013, CDC funding in this area dropped by 96 percent.
Against this backdrop, it can be easy to overlook an important fact: Research into gun violence has actually increased in recent years, rising from fewer than 90 annual publications in 2010 to 150 in 2014. Universities, think tanks, private philanthropy --even the state of California — have offered support. And in late April, governors from six northeastern states and Puerto Rico announced plans to launch a research consortium to study the issue. A December 2017 policy article published in the journal Science describes a "surge" of recent scientific publications.

Spending Bill Lets CDC Study Gun Violence; But Researchers Are Skeptical It Will Help
"The scope and quality of gun-related research is growing, with clear implications for the policy debate," write the authors, a pair of researchers from Duke and Stanford. This research has generated significant findings about suicide, intimate partner violence, community health, and the effect of various state-level gun laws.
A leading cause of death
More than 36,000 people are killed by gunshot in the U.S. every year, making it a leading cause of death in the country, comparable to motor vehicle incidents. Among those deaths, nearly two-thirds are suicides. "A gun in the home increases the risk of someone in that home dying from suicide maybe threefold, and the evidence is overwhelming," Hemenway says.
A conventional view holds that if people really want to kill themselves, they will find a way to do it — with or without a gun. Yet the data suggest that households with guns do not differ from those without guns when it comes to mental health risk for suicide. Instead, the difference seems to stem from the fact that suicide attempts with a gun are usually fatal, unlike attempts with pills, for example. Putting time and distance between a suicidal person and a gun can save that person's life.
This line of thinking is supported by a study published in the Journal of Surgical Research, which found that states with weaker gun laws have more gun-related suicide attempts, which tend to be associated with higher mortality. Dr. Rodrigo Alban, a surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and his colleagues analyzed data on nearly 35,000 subjects spanning 14 years. Almost two-thirds of the firearm suicide attempts occurred in states with the lowest scores for policies regulating guns from the nonprofit Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence — mostly states in the South and West. These states had little to no gun legislation, such as background checks, concealed weapons laws, and safe storage laws.
Of course, correlation doesn't imply causation, and Alban and his co-authors identify a need for research that pinpoints which particular laws have the greatest effect on reducing suicide attempts. But in the meantime, in light of these findings, they conclude that, "Efforts aimed at nationwide standardization of firearm state laws are warranted."
The riskiest gun owners
Another route to reducing gun violence, academics suggest, is to identify risk factors that increase a person's chances of harming themselves or others. Such individuals could then be considered for gun violence restraining orders. This was the logic behind the 1968 Gun Control Act, which specified narrow categories of people disqualified from buying or owning guns, including convicted felons and people committed to mental institutions. The 1994 Violence Against Women Act and the subsequent Lautenberg Amendment were written to bolster protections for victims of domestic violence.
But these laws only apply to people who are currently or formerly married, live or have lived together, or have shared children. Susan Sorenson, a professor of social policy and public health at the University of Pennsylvania, finds in recent research that they fail to protect a growing portion of the population who are in dating relationships, who can be just as violent.
A separate study led by Carolina Díez of Boston University assessed state laws and confirms Sorenson's conclusions. Domestic violence homicide rates drop by 10 percent in states prohibiting intimate partners with restraining orders from owning guns and requiring them to relinquish them.
Some states have gone a step further and passed so-called "risk-warrant" laws. In 1999, Connecticut became the first to pass such legislation allowing police to obtain a warrant to temporarily remove guns from someone who poses an imminent hazard to themselves or others. Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency room physician at the University of California, Davis Medical Center and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program, advocates for gun violence restraining orders based, in part, on a 2016 evaluation of Connecticut's law.
The Two-Way
Sturm Ruger Will Track Gun Violence, After Shareholders Back 'Activist Resolution'
Wintemute points to individual cases where such laws would have made a difference: "The Parkland shooter was making all kinds of public pronouncements," he says. "A gun violence restraining order would've allowed his family or law enforcement to go to a judge and get an order that would've gotten that gun taken away from him and prevented the shooting."
The remaining research gap
Following the barrage of nearly daily shootings, some researchers have begun to call for a community-wide approach, rather than only focusing on high-risk individuals. Charles Branas, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, says that poverty can contribute to gun violence within communities.
In their latest research, Branas and his colleagues examined hundreds of vacant land plots and abandoned buildings in U.S. cities, with a focus on Philadelphia. These abandoned spaces, like old parking lots and homes, often become places to store illegal firearms. Millions of people live near and walk by these spaces, which can cause community members to feel unsafe or stressed. Using a randomized control design, Branas found that interventions such as planting trees and plants and boarding up windows and doors can make a difference.
"Gun violence can be sustainably reduced in poor neighborhoods of those cities by as much as 29 percent," he says. "These cost peanuts. The return on investment is very high, because shootings are very expensive events."
For all the progress made in gun violence research, gaps still remain. In March, the RAND Corporation released a meta-analysis of thousands of studies published since 2003. The report states that, "Federal funding for research on gun-related mortality is far below levels for other sources of mortality in the United States." As a result, more research is warranted in virtually all aspects of gun control policy, including on officer-involved shootings, defensive gun use, gun-free zones, the gun industry, and lost or stolen firearms, to name a few.
The latest federal budget, passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in March, may offer some assistance, as it technically allows the CDC to fund research on gun violence. It doesn't reverse the Dickey Amendment, however, and CDC officials may still face resistance when trying to support such research. In any case, it's ultimately up to lawmakers — and the public they answer to — to determine how to balance Second Amendment rights with scientific data.
"Hopefully these policy debates have some science behind them," Hemenway says. "Everything we learn should matter and should have an effect."

Gauging the Effectiveness of Gun Control Laws
Evidence Shows How Legislation Can Lower U.S. Firearm Mortality Rates, in a New Report in the Medical Journal, The Lancet, Co-Authored by Columbia Law Professor Jeffrey Fagan
New York, March 10, 2016— The impact and limitations of specific gun laws on firearm mortality in America are documented in a new study published today in the British medical journal The Lancet and co-authored by Columbia Law School Professor Jeffrey A. Fagan , a leading expert on crime, law, and social policy.
Gun violence is a major public health concern in the U.S., with about 90 people killed each day by firearms. More than 31,600 gun-related deaths occurred in 2010, or slightly more than 10 per every 100,000 Americans. To reduce gun mortality rates, states have enacted a range of legislation over the past decade to augment the federal government’s main gun-control law, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993.
Other state legislation has restricted the reach of the Brady Act, simplifying the purchase of firearms and ammunition. Of the 25 state gun laws identified in the report, nine were credited with reducing firearm mortality, nine were associated with increased firearm mortality, and seven had an inconclusive association. Three of the state laws were strongly associated with lower numbers of firearm deaths, and at least one was associated with higher firearm mortality rates.
The authors of the article, Firearm Legislation and Firearm Mortality in the USA: A Cross-sectional, State-level Study, conclude that federal implementation of three specific laws alone would substantially cut gun mortality rates nationally:
Universal background checks for gun purchases, which could reduce national firearm deaths from 10.3 to 4.46 per 100,000 people;
Background checks for ammunition purchases, which could reduce the mortality rate to 1.99 deaths per 100,000 people; and
Firearm identification, by either microstamping or ballistic fingerprinting, which could reduce the death rate to 1.81 per 100,000 people.
“Very few of the existing state-specific laws are associated with reduced firearm mortality, and this evidence underscores the importance of focusing on relevant and effective firearms legislation,” the authors write.
The full report—with tables detailing specific laws and states—can be read here.
Fagan is available for media interviews on the report and can be reached directly by email: jfagan@law.columbia.edu
The report’s authors are legal and medical experts, including Fagan (who also serves as a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health) ; Bindu Kalesan, director of the Evans Center for Translational Epidemiology and Comparative Effectiveness Research at the Boston University School of Medicine;  Matthew E. Mobily of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University; Olivia Keiser, head of research for the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern, Switzerland; and Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health and the former chair of the department of epidemiology at Columbia University.

Social justice issues in America: Gun violence
January 28, 2021
The Brady United, an organization inspired by Jim and Sarah Brady that led to President Clinton signing the Brady Bill into law, notes that gun violence is a racial justice issue. Brady United notes that Black Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from gun violence and 14 times more likely than white Americas to be wounded. Gun violence, according to bradyunited.org, alone reduces the life expectancy of Black Americans by four years.
Rules have been promulgated on a federal level to reduce gun violence. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) recognizes the role that firearms play in violent crimes and has pursued an integrated regulatory and enforcement strategy that involves investigative priorities focusing on armed violent offenders and career criminals, narcotics traffickers, narco-terrorists, violent gangs and domestic and international arms traffickers. ATF 41F Rule sets forth certain rules and requirements involving firearms requiring background checks as a public safety benefit for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust, corporation, or other legal entity. Each responsible person must submit a photograph and fingerprints when application for a firearm is made. ATF also requires no firearm may be transferred in the U.S. unless an application has been filed for transfer of a firearm. See the full rules and regulations at atf.gov.
This issue is important as in Milwaukee in 2020 there were 189 homicides according to the Milwaukee Police Department, nearly doubling the homicides in 2019. Milwaukee also saw an alarming trend of kids becoming victims of gun violence. According to a May 2020 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, CBS News reported 15 kids were injured or killed in Milwaukee gun violence over a 2-month period. The report called this news “gravely concerning.” We all must work together to help reduce gun violence in our neighborhoods.
The City of Milwaukee Office of Violence Prevention is dedicated to the prevention of gun violence and works as a resource to the City on local and national gun policy as well as facilitating action plans and projects for interested organizations and communities that want to reduce gun violence in their neighborhoods.

Gun safety in the home
It is recognized many families keep a gun in the home. KidsHealth from Nemours addressed the issue of gun safety, indicating that the safest way to store a gun if you have children in the home:
• Keep the gun unloaded and locked up in a cabinet, safe, gun vault, or storage case.
• Lock the bullets in a place separate from the gun.
• Hide the keys to the locked storage.
Young children are curious. Even if you have talked to them about the dangers of gun safety, young children can’t truly understand how dangerous guns are. If they come across a loaded gun, they can accidentally hurt or kill themselves or someone else.
KidsHealth also suggests if your child is going to someone’s house, it is important to know if there are guns in the home. It may be awkward to ask, but most people will understand that you’re trying to protect your child.
Beloved, our nation’s children are faced with pandemic levels of exposure to violence. Gun violence has become a major problem and it is going to take more than one sector of society and more than one group, but the entire community working together to be more deliberate in ensuring our youth do not become victims of violence, preventing childhood exposure to violence, and developing a plan to make our communities safer from violence.

New study analyzes recent gun violence research | Stanford News

New Stanford study analyzes recent research on causes of gun violence
Consensus is growing in recent research evaluating the impact of right-to-carry concealed handgun laws, showing that they increase violent crime, despite what older research says.
By Alex Shashkevich
Researchers fr­­om Stanford and Duke University examined recent studies on the causes of gun violence in the United States in an effort to find consensus in a body of research that often covers different states or different time periods, making conclusions difficult to draw.

The analysis by John Donohue, a professor of law at Stanford, and Philip J. Cook at Duke University published Dec. 7 in Science reports some emerging consensus in the studies. Among the findings was that lifting restrictions on concealed carry guns increases violent crime and that laws restricting gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence reduced killings of female domestic partners.
The authors hope their work can help guide policymakers who are debating measures to reduce gun violence.
The level of gun violence in the United States places it as an outlier among developed countries. In 2015, over 36,000 people died from gunfire, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with roughly two-thirds of those deaths being classified as suicide. America’s gun-murder rate is 25 times that of the other high-income nations, and the gun-suicide rate is eight times as high. Despite these numbers, the last extensive analysis of research into the origins of gun violence, conducted in 2004, was inconclusive.
“Fortunately, the flow of high-quality research has increased in recent years,” the experts wrote in the paper. “With journals in a variety of disciplines increasingly receptive to original research on gun violence and regulation, there has been a surge of publication in this area after a long plateau.”
Concealed carry increases violent crime
In the mid-1970s, all but five states had banned or severely limited concealed carry of firearms. But by 2014 all states except eight passed right-to-carry laws, which eased those restrictions. Understanding how that change affected crime has been challenging, however, because of the fluctuating nature of crime.
“If a gun regulation is most likely to be enacted in jurisdictions that have recently experienced a surge in gun violence and if that surge is temporary, the result will be that implementation of the new measure is followed by a drop in crime, giving the false appearance that it was effective,” the researchers wrote.
During the crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s and the early 1990s, right-to-carry laws were adopted more often in states that had less of a crack problem. This means that any analysis of right-to-carry laws during that period will show those laws as beneficial unless researchers can adequately control for the influence of crack cocaine, which has proved to be quite difficult, Donohue said.
“This problem has plagued every panel data analysis of RTC (right-to-carry) laws, except for those that started after the impact of crack had fully dissipated by the late 1990s and early 2000s,” the researchers wrote.
By analyzing studies from after that time period as well as recent research relying on new statistical techniques for assessing the impact of legal changes, the pair found an emerging consensus that deregulating concealed carry restrictions increases violent crime. This finding comes out of recent research published by Donohue and his team in June, as well as research from Duke and the University of Pennsylvania and from Boston University.
“The dilemma for science is that you’re always working with imperfect data and imperfect statistical models,” Donohue said. “What’s appealing about the current growing body of evidence on right-to-carry laws is that different researchers using different methodologies and different data sets are coming to similar conclusions. … We are all coalescing around the same message, and that’s the best that science can do: Look at the imperfect data in different ways and see if a consistent story emerges.”
Domestic violence, harsher sentencing
The researchers also analyzed studies exploring the effects of an amendment of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the add-on sentencing laws adopted by a number of states during the 1970s and 1980s, which added prison time to crimes committed with a gun rather than a less lethal weapon.
They found that the 1996 Gun Control Act amendment that prevented people with a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence from owning guns reduced killings of female intimate partners. Gun murders for that group were reduced by 17 percent.
Another research study analyzing a nearly 40-year time interval shows that harsher sentencing for crimes that involved firearms had the greatest effect on reducing aggravated robberies, decreasing them by 5 percent.
Challenges of measuring reform
Congress is currently considering a bill that would expand the ability of Americans to carry concealed weapons across state lines. The House of Representatives passed the measure Wednesday, and it is now headed to the Senate for approval.
“If Congress moves on that proposal, suddenly everybody from, say, Louisiana or Arizona can come to California and start carrying concealed guns, which is quite a violation of the traditional notion of a state’s right to decide who carries weapons within its borders,” Donohue said. “The November 2016 referendum results showed that the very large majority of Californians wanted more gun control. Yet we may be in a position where Congress is undermining the desire of California voters on an issue that is ordinarily left up to local control.”
The Supreme Court is also likely to consider one of several cases involving conceal carry rights in the future because of conflicting rulings from intermediate courts of appeal, Donohue said.
“Right now, more than ever, it seems pretty important for the Supreme Court justices to know what the best research says about right-to-carry laws,” Donohue said.
Despite advances in statistics that helped researchers tease out findings in the latest gun violence research, Donohue said that statistical research will never yield perfect answers.
“These are complicated issues,” Donohue said. “Nothing in statistics is 100 percent certain. Science advances our knowledge when sufficient evidence is amassed that points in a certain direction.”

From the recent studies, there seems to be a growing consensus on certain aspects of gun violence and the effectiveness of specific gun laws. For instance, the study by John Donohue and Philip J. Cook suggests that right-to-carry laws are linked with higher violent crime rates, contrary to older research. Additionally, laws restricting gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence have been shown to reduce killings of female domestic partners.

Another study mentioned, conducted by Columbia Law School Professor Jeffrey Fagan and others, indicates that certain federal implementations, such as universal background checks for gun and ammunition purchases and firearm identification methods, could significantly reduce firearm mortality rates in the U.S.

However, the initial study by Philip J. Cook in 2003 suggested that the Brady Bill had no statistically discernible effect on reducing gun homicides. This seems to contrast with more recent research that indicates certain gun control measures can be effective.

Perhaps the key takeaway is that specific types of gun control legislation can have varying impacts on gun violence, and ongoing research is crucial to understanding which policies are most effective.

Given that, I think it's fair to say that while the Brady Bill may not have had a significant impact on reducing gun violence on its own, it laid the groundwork for further gun control measures that could be more effective when implemented comprehensively.

Therefore, my final answer is: The Brady Bill alone did not significantly reduce gun violence, but it established important foundational measures that can be built upon for more effective gun control policies.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Brady Bill alone did not significantly reduce gun violence, but it established important foundational measures that can be built upon for more effective gun control policies.}} \]
