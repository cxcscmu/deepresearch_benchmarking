I'm trying to understand why housing prices are so high. It seems like everywhere you look, people are struggling with expensive rents or mortgage payments. I need to figure out what's causing this. Maybe it's supply and demand? Or maybe there are other factors at play. I should probably start by looking into economic principles behind housing prices.

First, I know that in economics, prices are often determined by supply and demand. So, if there's a high demand for housing but a limited supply, prices will go up. That makes sense. But why is the supply limited? Is it because there aren't enough houses being built? Or is there some restriction on building more houses?

Maybe there are regulations that make it hard to build new homes. Like zoning laws or building permits that are difficult to obtain. That could restrict the supply. Also, perhaps the cost of land is high, which increases the cost of building new houses.

Another thing I've heard about is interest rates. When interest rates are low, it's cheaper to borrow money, so more people can afford mortgages, which might increase demand for housing. But I'm not sure how that affects prices exactly.

Wait, maybe I need to look at it differently. If interest rates are low, people can borrow more money for the same monthly payment, which could allow them to pay higher prices for houses. So, that might drive up prices.

Also, inflation could be a factor. If the general price level is increasing, housing prices might increase too.

But I need to think about this more carefully. Maybe I should look at some specific examples. Like, in cities where housing prices are particularly high, what's happening there?

Take San Francisco, for example. Housing prices there are notoriously high. Why is that? Is it because it's a desirable place to live, so lots of people want to move there? That would increase demand.

But also, San Francisco has strict zoning laws and building restrictions, which limit the supply of new housing. So, combined with high demand, that would lead to high prices.

Similarly, in New York City, housing is very expensive. Again, lots of people want to live there, but there's limited space to build new buildings.

Wait, but in some other cities, like Houston, which allows more building, housing prices aren't as high. So, maybe the key is how much you can increase the supply of housing.

But that's not the whole story. What about areas where there's a lot of new construction, but prices still remain high? Maybe there's something else going on.

Perhaps investment in real estate is driving up prices. Institutional investors buying up properties to rent out, which increases competition for rental housing and drives up rents.

Also, the tax code might play a role. Certain tax deductions for mortgage interest could encourage more people to buy homes, increasing demand.

Moreover, the availability of financing can affect prices. If banks are willing to lend more money for mortgages, that can allow people to bid up prices.

I also recall that sometimes speculative buying can inflate prices. People buying homes not to live in them but to resell them later at a higher price.

Additionally, the cost of materials and labor for construction can impact the price of new homes, which in turn affects the overall housing market.

I think I need to organize my thoughts better. Let me list out possible factors contributing to high housing prices:

1. Supply and demand dynamics:

   a. High demand due to population growth or migration to certain areas.

   b. Limited supply due to zoning laws, building restrictions, or difficulty in acquiring land.

2. Economic factors:

   a. Low-interest rates making mortgages more affordable, allowing people to borrow more.

   b. Inflation raising overall price levels.

3. Government policies:

   a. Tax deductions for mortgage interest encouraging home ownership.

   b. Zoning regulations limiting where and how much housing can be built.

4. Investment and speculative activity:

   a. Investors buying properties to rent out or flip for profit.

   b. Foreign investors purchasing properties as safe assets.

5. Construction costs:

   a. Higher material and labor costs increasing the price of new builds.

6. Income levels:

   a. Areas with higher incomes can support higher housing prices.

But I need to see which of these factors are most significant. Maybe I should look at some data or studies on this topic.

Let me try searching for "factors affecting housing prices" to see what kind of information is out there.

Factors that affect the housing market - Economics Help
Factors that affect the housing market
15 October 2019 by Tejvan Pettinger
The housing market is influenced by the state of the economy, interest rates, real income and changes in the size of the population. As well as these demand-side factors, house prices will be determined by available supply. With periods of rising demand and limited supply, we will see rising house prices, rising rents and increased risk of homelessness.
Factors determining house prices
Main factors that affect the housing market
Economic growth. Demand for housing is dependent upon income. With higher economic growth and rising incomes, people will be able to spend more on houses; this will increase demand and push up prices. In fact, demand for housing is often noted to be income elastic (luxury good); rising incomes leading to a bigger % of income being spent on houses. Similarly, in a recession, falling incomes will mean people can’t afford to buy and those who lose their job may fall behind on their mortgage payments and end up with their home repossessed.
Unemployment. Related to economic growth is unemployment. When unemployment is rising, fewer people will be able to afford a house. But, even the fear of unemployment may discourage people from entering the property market.
Interest rates. Interest rates affect the cost of monthly mortgage payments. A period of high-interest rates will increase cost of mortgage payments and will cause lower demand for buying a house. High-interest rates make renting relatively more attractive compared to buying. Interest rates have a bigger effect if homeowners have large variable mortgages. For example, in 1990-92, the sharp rise in interest rates caused a very steep fall in UK house prices because many homeowners couldn’t afford the rise in interest rates.
Consumer confidence. Confidence is important for determining whether people want to take the risk of taking out a mortgage. In particular expectations towards the housing market is important; if people fear house prices could fall, people will defer buying.
Mortgage availability. In the boom years of 1996-2006, many banks were very keen to lend mortgages. They allowed people to borrow large income multiples (e.g. five times income). Also, banks required very low deposits (e.g. 100% mortgages). This ease of getting a mortgage meant that demand for housing increased as more people were now able to buy. However, since the credit crunch of 2007, banks and building societies struggled to raise funds for lending on the money markets. Therefore, they have tightened their lending criteria requiring a bigger deposit to buy a house. This has reduced the availability of mortgages and demand fell.
Supply. A shortage of supply pushes up prices. Excess supply will cause prices to fall. For example, in the Irish property boom of 1996-2006, an estimated 700,000 new houses were built. When the property market collapsed, the market was left with a fundamental oversupply. Vacancy rates reached 15%, and with supply greater than demand, prices fell. (Irish house prices fall 50%)
By contrast, in the UK, housing supply fell behind demand. With a shortage, UK house prices didn’t fall as much as in Ireland and soon recovered – despite the ongoing credit crunch.
The supply of housing depends on existing stock and new house builds. Supply of housing tends to be quite inelastic because to get planning permission and build houses is a time-consuming process. Periods of rising house prices may not cause an equivalent rise in supply, especially in countries like the UK, with limited land for home-building.
Affordability/house prices to earnings. The ratio of house prices to earnings influences the demand. As house prices rise relative to income, you would expect fewer people to be able to afford. For example, in the 2007 boom, the ratio of house prices to income rose to 5. At this level, house prices were relatively expensive, and we saw a correction with house prices falling.
Another way of looking at the affordability of housing is to look at the percentage of take-home pay that is spent on mortgages. This takes into account both house prices, but mainly interest rates and the cost of monthly mortgage payments. In late 1989, we see housing become very unaffordable because of rising interest rates. This caused a sharp fall in prices in 1990-92.
Geographical factors. Many housing markets are highly geographical. For example, national house prices may be falling, but some areas (e.g. London, Oxford) may still see rising prices. Desirable areas can buck market trends as demand is high, and supply limited. For example, houses near good schools or a good rail link may have a significant premium to other areas.
This graph shows that first time buyers in London face much more expensive house prices – over 9.0 times earnings compared to the north, where house prices are only 3.3 times earnings.
House prices using supply and demand
This diagram shows the period 1998 to 2005 where house prices more than doubled in the UK. During these years, there was only a limited increase in supply. By contrast, there was a significant rise in demand due to low-interest rates, positive economic growth, a rising population, high mortgage availability and confidence the housing market was a good investment.
UK Housing Market since 1976
real-house-prices-75-16
Between 1993-2007 house prices rose sharply. Between 2007-2012 house prices fell as a result of:
The credit crunch and a decline in bank lending (mortgage lending much stricter criteria.)
House prices became over-valued in boom years meaning few first-time buyers could afford.
Recession and rise in unemployment discouraged many from buying.
Since 2012, house prices have risen faster than inflation – despite a relatively weak economy. This is partly due to an ongoing shortage of supply and rising population.

The 5 Major Factors That Cause Home Prices to Fluctuate
Read Time: 4 Minutes

Home Buying
Home Selling
Whether you’re looking to buy a new home or sell your current one, identifying some of the major factors that cause home prices to fluctuate is essential. While the reasons that home prices fluctuate can be complex, the benefit of knowing them is simple — by identifying the factors, you can more easily buy or sell a home for the best price possible. Understanding these influences will help to ensure you price your home accurately and prevent it from sitting on the market for too long.
Keep in mind, these five areas aren’t independent of one another and could very well impact the other. So without further ado, here are the five major factors that can cause home prices to fluctuate.
1. Economic change
One of the biggest influences in real estate fluctuation is the health of the economy. This is typically measured by indicators like employment data, manufacturing activity, the price of goods, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — which represents the total dollar value of all goods and services over a period of time. When the economy is thriving and unemployment is low, home prices tend to increase. Generally, this is because people have a heightened sense of job security and confidence to take on mortgage debt.
However, home prices tend to drop when there is a downturn in the economy. Falling incomes or job loss will mean the general population can't afford, or simply aren't financially confident enough, to buy houses they once could in a strong economy. As a result, housing demand declines, which causes motivated sellers to lower their asking price to get a sale — also known as a homebuyer’s dream! One of the most notable examples of price depreciation in the United States was during the 2008 housing bubble, largely due to the economic recession.
2. Supply and demand
Housing prices are affected by supply and demand in the same way that goods and services are. Since every housing transaction has a buyer and a seller, a low or high supply of homes can drive prices up or down. When the supply is low and demand is high, this would be considered a seller’s market. In this instance, bidding wars are very common. On the flip side, it’s considered a buyer’s market when the supply is high, but the housing demand is low. With an oversupply of properties, home prices tend to fall and sit on the market longer than sellers would like.
Pro tip: A great way to keep tabs on supply and demand is to follow mortgage news in major media, or even just keep an eye out for the abundance (or lack thereof) of “for sale” signs in various neighborhoods.

3. Mortgage Interest rates
After looking at current economic data, the Federal Reserve has the authority to raise or lower interest rates at specific times throughout the year — which can impact the mortgage rates set by lenders. This happened most recently in December of 2018 when the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate from 2.25 to 2.5.
With that said, changes in interest rates can impact the price of homes and a homebuyer’s ability to purchase one. This is because the lower interest rates fall, the lower the cost of a mortgage will be, thus increasing the housing demand and pushing asking prices up. Simply put, low mortgage rates encourage homebuyers to take out home loans, which is ideal for home sellers. The opposite can happen when interest rates rise. In this scenario, your monthly mortgage payment will increase and cause homes to become less affordable.
Using a Monthly Mortgage Payment Calculator can help you get an idea of how interest rates can impact your mortgage payment.

4. Location
Even when home prices fall on a national level, prices in a specific location may rise — and vice versa. This is due to desirability. Some location factors that can influence housing prices include:
Neighborhoods
Highways
Attractions
Hospitals
Schools
If you’re looking to buy a home in an area with a recent surge of restaurants, attractions, and good schools, home prices will be higher than areas lacking in these characteristics. Other factors that can cause price fluctuation are things like crime rate, access to quality healthcare, and proximity to highways.
Another influential factor is employment changes, specifically when a large corporation opens and brings hundreds of jobs to an area. People can flock to this region and cause housing prices to increase, especially if new homes aren’t being built fast enough to keep up with demand. But if businesses begin to fold and infrastructure declines, folks may have to leave for new opportunities — ultimately creating less demand and causing prices to fall.
5. Government laws
There are a couple of notable ways government forces can impact home prices. First is through mortgage interest tax deductions. Currently, homeowners can deduct mortgage interest on loans less than $750,000. Tax breaks such as this one can incentivize more homebuyers, thus creating the potential of a rise in home prices. Another governmental influence is through tariffs. Housing materials like steel, aluminum, and lumber are sometimes imported from other countries. And imposing tariffs on these foreign supplies can increase the cost of building new homes — swaying housing prices as a whole.

What Affects The Price Of A House? | Property Road
What Affects The Price Of A House?
It’s a common question estate agents get asked. What affects the price of a house?
If you are selling or buying property, then it’s good to have at least a basic understanding of the factors that can influence house prices. You’ve heard the phrase that it’s all about location, location, location, and to a large degree that’s spot on. However, it doesn’t quite tell the full story.
House prices are affected by a number of things. Some play a bigger part than others. Some affect properties more in one part of the country than another. But ultimately, they all have some kind of an effect.
So, lets to a closer look at what affects the price of a house. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it does cover the main factors.
1) Supply & Demand
Perhaps one of the biggest factors, the number of properties up for sale, and the number of buyers competing for them has a major effect on the value of a home.
Generally, if there are more buyers than sellers, values will go up. If there are more sellers than buyers, the values will come down.
2) Property Condition
The condition the house is in will have a major bearing on the price it could potentially sell for. A house in near perfect condition is likely to attract a much higher price than a comparable property that still needs a lot of work doing.
Check out our guide to the most common problems with auction properties to see what could reduce the value of a house (even when not sold by auction!).  Any problems you spot could be used to negotiate a lower purchase price.
3) Local Schools
This is a big one if you are selling or buying a property that’s likely to appeal to families. The performance of local schools will have a bearing on how much a house sells for.
Therefore, it’s important to keep an eye on the Ofsted reports on nearby primary and secondary schools. Generally, the better the Oftsed ratings, the higher the property prices in that area. Some sites such as Rightmove include a ‘SchoolChecker’ as part of the property details.

4) Local Infrastructure
Changes to local infrastructure can affect property values both positive and negatively. As an example, the planned high-speed railway (HS2) is set to have both negative and positive effects on house prices.
Those backing directly on to the new line may find their property values decrease from the extra noise created. Those living far enough away not to be inconvenienced by the line, but close enough to be able to easily use it, may find their property values rise as their house because more attractive to commuters.
5) Flooding
You might think that properties in areas hit by flooding events would see their values hit quite hard for a long time. However, research suggests properties hit by flooding only suffer from a temporary reduction in value. Usually, they have returned to their original value after just three years.
Still, there is some effect immediately after flooding so if your property has been hit in the last 3 years, you may want to hold off selling for a short while.
6) Property Size
It isn’t just the overall footprint of your house, it’s also how you use the space that affects the price of your home. En-suites are seen as highly desirable so if you have the opportunity to create one it can add value to your property.
But, be careful about losing a bedroom when changing the layout of your home. Going down from a 3 bed to a 2 bed, or a 4 down to a 3, or so on, can negatively affect both the value and attractiveness of your property to potential buyers.
Generally, the more rooms the better when it comes to bedrooms, and an upstairs bathroom is a must. A lot of the other decisions (such as whether you have an open plan kitchen or not) will come down to personal preference. We’d suggest checking with an estate agent before you change the layout of your home to be sure what effect it’s likely to have on the value of your property.
7) Potential for Improvement
While many buyers are looking for a property they can move straight into without having to do any work, some buyers prefer it if they at least have the option to carry out some work themselves. This way, they can ensure it’s done exactly to their own preferences.
So, think carefully about adding on extensions, conservatories, etc. Yes, they will probably add value to your home, but, they will it restrict the options for future owners. They may also make your property ‘too good’ if it’s already quite highly valued for the area.
8) Property Features
The exact specification of your property will also affect its value. For instance, if you have a double garage, whereas your neighbours all have single garages, your house is likely to be worth a little more.
Having new double or even triple glazing can also bump up your house price, and period features can also have an effect.
9) Local Amenities
How close you are to a shop or a bus stop can also have an impact on the value of your home. Equally, how often the local buses run could also be a factor, especially if your property is likely to attract people without their own transport.
10) Parking Arrangements
Whether you have a garage, a carport, or a driveway is likely to affect the value of your house. How many cars you can park is also important as many households now have multiple cars.
If there are no parking arrangements at your property, then the ease of on-street parking could also affect the price you can sell for.
So, What Affects The Price Of A House?
As you can see, when looking at what affects the price of a house, there are a number of factors to consider. However, they are almost all linked to location. That’s why some places, such as Cheltenham in 2017, find their house prices rise more quickly than others.
If you want to know the true value of your property, the best way is to get a proper valuation carried out by at least 2-3 different estate agents. Take the average price of all three valuations and that will be around the pice you could expect your property to sell for. The agents will also be able to give you more information on the effect of the above factors on your property.
Of course, after all this, your house is only worth what someone will pay for it. So, until you list it for sale, you’ll never actually know it’s true value!

Factors affecting supply and demand of housing - Economics Help
Factors affecting supply and demand of housing
27 May 2021 by Tejvan Pettinger
A look at factors affecting the demand and supply of housing.
In summary.
Demand-side factors
1. Affordability. Rising incomes mean that people are able to afford to spend more on housing. During periods of economic growth, demand for houses tends to rise. Also, demand for housing tends to be a luxury good. So a rise in income causes a bigger % rise in demand.
This graph shows that house prices (and therefore demand for housing can rise much faster than earnings, suggesting there are many other factors influencing demand – at least in the short run.
2. Confidence
Demand for houses depends on consumer confidence. In particular, it depends on people’s confidence about the future of the economy and housing market. If people expect prices to rise, demand will rise so people can gain from rising wealth. In a boom, demand for houses rises faster than incomes as seen in the graph above.
3. Interest Rates
Interest rates play a big factor in determining the cost of mortgage interest repayments.
The majority of UK homeowners still prefer to take out variable mortgage rates (unlike the continent where fixed rate mortgage deals are more common). Therefore any change in the base rate by the Bank of England will immediately affect the mortgage interest payments. This is a major factor in determining the affordability of housing. Mortgage payments take a high % of people’s personal disposable income. (average is 25%, but, for some homeowners, it is higher.) If you have a £150,000 mortgage a 0.5% change in base rates will change your monthly payments by about £60 a month. Therefore, even small changes in interest rates can deter people from buying.
When interest rates reached 15% in 1992, demand for housing collapsed, causing a large fall in demand for housing. The relatively low-interest rates of the 90s and 2000s encouraged more to buy a house.
However, in 2008-09, interest rates were cut to 0.5%. Even though interest rates were very low, demand also remained low. This was because, other factors were reducing demand for housing – like the recession and prospect of rising unemployment.
4. Population
The population in England is forecast to grow to over 60 million in 2041 an increase of 6 million.
The number of households forecast to rise from 27.3 million in 2017. to 31.6 million in 2039. (4.3 million increase)
A very important factor. It is not just the number of people but demographic changes. e.g. growing number of single people living alone has led to increasing demand for houses.
The demand for housing doesn’t just depend on the population but also the average size of a household. Certain social and demographic factors are causing a rise in the number of households (faster than the population increase). These demographic changes include issues such as:
age of people leaving home
Increased life expectancy, leading to more single old people
Divorce rates, – increasing number of single-parent families.
5. Mortgage availability
Another factor that determines the effective demand for houses is the willingness of banks to lend mortgages. If banks give mortgages with bigger income multiples, then the effective demand for houses is greater. The willingness of banks to lend mortgage finance can vary depending on the strength of the interbank lending sector. The Credit crisis of 2008, has seen a sharp rise in the cost of interbank lending and a fall in availability of mortgage finance. Many mortgage products have been withdrawn, making it more difficult for would-be homeowners to get on the property ladder.
For example, mortgages such as 125% and 100% mortgages have been withdrawn. Banks are increasingly demanding a higher deposit before lending mortgages.
6. Economic growth and real incomes. Rising incomes enable people to afford bigger mortgages and encourages demand for housing. In boom times, demand for housing grows rapidly suggesting demand for houses is income-elastic
7. Cost of renting.
This shows a 30% increase in the cost of renting between 2005 and 2021 – despite the financial crisis and housing ‘crash’. In London the rise in rents was higher up until 2017. – this helped to cause UK house prices to continue rising after 2011.
If the cost of renting rises, then households will make greater efforts to try and buy a house as buying a house through mortgage becomes relatively cheaper. The UK housing market has been buoyed by expensive renting costs, which encourages buy to let lenders and encourages households to stretch their budget as much as possible to get on the housing ladder.
Factors affecting supply
The number of new houses being built. The graph above shows how the number of new houses built in Great Britain has varied over the past century. The peak was in the late 1960s with over 400,000 built per year, Inthe late 1990ss and early 2000s that has fallen to 150,000 (less than required)
Planning restrictions on the use of land. A big issue in the UK is planning restrictions and limitations on building on green-belt land
Local opposition to new home builds. There is widespread opposition to building new houses as local communities usually prefer to live in smaller villages without increased congestion.
The profitability of building new houses. This is dependent on the demand for houses and prices. In a boom, builders are usually keener to build more. Falling house prices can lead to a restriction in supply.

There are many factors which has adverse effect on demand of housing some are illustrated below:
Price: The fluctuation in prices influences the demand of housing. Suppose, In future if the price of houses is going to rise then people rush in the market to buy more before the prices goes up. So, the demand of housing increases if the price is going up and the demand of housing decreases if price is going low.
Preference/ Taste: The taste and preference also influence on the demand of housing. Different people have different choices. Some of the people want to live in city, some people wants to live in village. Hence, if more people want to live in city then the demand of housing increases in city and if more people wants to live in village then the demand of housing increases in village. Thus, in this way the housing of demand is influenced according to taste or preference of the people.
Economic Growth: Demand of housing is also dependent on income of the people. So, if the economic growth is higher and incomes of the people rise then they will be able to spend their money on housing which increases the demand of housing and prices are pushed up. As demand of housing is frequently noted to be income elastic.
Unemployment: Unemployment is directly related to economic growth. It is clear that when unemployment rises there is less probability of people buying a house. Thus, demand of housing decreases with increase in unemployment.
Mortgages: Most of the people in UK are dependent on getting a huge mortgage up to 95% of house value. If there is a decrease in mortgages then demand will fall. E.g. since credit crisis availability of cheap 95% mortgages has declined. The demand of Banks has increased and they are demanding bigger deposits so that many first time buyers don’t have, therefore demand for housing has fallen.
Income and affordability: Affordability is the ratio of house price to income. So if affordability increases then demand of housing also increases, however it depends on many other factors. For example: in present context housing affordability is progressing because prices are going down but people don’t have interest or they can’t buy the house.
Distribution of income: The distribution of income also affects the demand in housing. If National Insurance were redistributed from the poor people to richer then the demand for luxury goods would increase i.e. the demand of housing rises. At the same time, as the poor got poorer they might have to turn to buy inferior goods, which decreases the demand.
Excess demand: Excess demand is created when the price is set below the equilibrium price. It is a situation in which the demand for a product in the market is greater than supply. The price of product rises due to excess demand.
In the above figure along the x-axis we are taking quantity and along the y-axis we are taking price. The line D is demand curve and S is supply curve. We can see that there are three stages in the figure i.e. surplus, shortage and market equilibrium. Surplus is the situation in which quantity of supply is more than quantity of demand. Similarly, Shortage is the situation in which quantity of demand is more than quantity of supply. Market equilibrium is the situation in which market is clear.

Now we are talking about excess demand of housing in London. In this condition the quantity of house demanded by the people at the price P1 is Q2. On the other hand, the quantity of houses that suppliers are willing to produce at the same price P1 is Q1. Hence, the quantities of houses that are produced by the suppliers are too few to satisfy the needs and wants i.e. demand of the consumers. However, as consumers have to compete with one other to buy the houses at this price P1, the quantity of demand increases. According to law of demand “If quantity demand increases than price will go up”. This will push the price of the houses up and according to law of supply “If price increases than quantity of supply goes up”. In this situation suppliers want to supply more houses and which bring the price closer to its equilibrium.
The demand of housing in South East England is more than supply. Quantity of demand is more than supply which leads market towards shortage. So, to get rid of this excess demand either we should shift demand curve into right side or we should shift supply curve towards left side.
The two ways in which the government can help to satisfy or diminish the excess demand for houses in South East of England are:
Increase tax and rise in Interest rates:
If the government increases the taxes in housing, it will definitely raise the price of houses. The demand of housing will decrease because the people may not be able to afford the price. Hence, increase taxes will decreases demand which will reduce the shortage. Similarly, if the government changes the interest rate it will also affect demand of housing. If the government rises the interest rate then the people don’t wants to take loans from the banks because interest rate is too high to pay the loans back in order to buy new houses. Thus, the people stop purchasing houses, which will diminish excess demand of housing. Similarly, when interest rates are low people don’t need to spend their money on bank payment by which people have more disposable income to put towards the things that they want to purchase, for example: Houses, vehicle, land etc. The people will start purchasing the house and there will be again excess demand of housing. Hence, Government should increase tax and raise interest rates in order to diminish excess demand of housing.
Subsidies housing:
The other way to diminish excess demand is shifting supply curve towards right side. As, we know there is excess demand of housing in South East London. If quantity of demand is more and supply is less than there will be shortage in the market. Due to this shortage, the price of houses goes up. The rising houses price means that many people who are just starting work or starting new family life find difficult to get a house because the price of the houses are raised and there is not much low cost houses available. Some councils have granted planning permission for new housing on the understanding that it is offered for sale for local people only and not at prices above a certain limit. Others are looking for a public subsidy to ensure that low cost housing is made available for those that need it. Hence, subsidies housing also diminish the demand of housing.
Figure: Shifting supply curve towards right
In the given figure we have taken Quantity in x-axis and price in Y=axis. Demand curve is denoted by D and Supply curve is denoted by S. If we shift supply curve to right side than P1 will be the price and Q1 will be the quantity. From the figure it is clear that if we shift supply curve to right side than price of the house will decrease and quantity will increase. Thus, in the situation of excess demand, increase in quantity of supply will be more which will reduce shortage in the market.

Alright, I've got some search results here on factors affecting housing prices. Let's see what I can make of this.

First up, there's a page from Economicshelp.org about factors that affect the housing market. It mentions several points like economic growth, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability, supply, and affordability. It seems comprehensive, so I'll keep that in mind.

Next, there's a blog post from Newrez.com that talks about five major factors that cause home prices to fluctuate. They mention economic change, supply and demand, mortgage interest rates, location, and government laws. This aligns somewhat with the first source, but it's nice to see it distilled into five main points.

Then, there's an article from PropertyRoad.co.uk that lists various factors affecting house prices, such as supply and demand, property condition, local schools, infrastructure, flooding, property size, potential for improvement, property features, and local amenities. This seems more focused on specific property attributes and local conditions.

Lastly, there's another piece from Economicshelp.org that delves into factors affecting the supply and demand of housing. It expands on some of the points mentioned earlier, providing more detail on both supply and demand sides.

Okay, so from these sources, I can see that there are multiple factors at play here. Let's try to categorize them.

First Category: Economic Factors

1. Economic Growth and Income Levels: When the economy is doing well, people have more disposable income, which can lead to increased demand for housing. Conversely, during economic downturns, demand may decrease due to job losses and reduced income.

2. Interest Rates: Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can increase affordability and boost demand. Higher interest rates have the opposite effect, making mortgages more expensive and potentially reducing demand.

3. Mortgage Availability: The ease with which people can obtain mortgages also impacts demand. If banks are stringent in their lending criteria, fewer people can qualify for mortgages, thereby reducing demand.

Second Category: Supply-Side Factors

1. Construction and Building Permits: The rate at which new homes are built can influence supply. Delays or restrictions in obtaining building permits can limit the supply of new homes.

2. Land Availability and Zoning Laws: Restrictions on where and how much housing can be built can constrain supply. Areas with strict zoning laws may have less new construction, leading to higher prices.

3. Development Costs: The cost of materials and labor for construction affects the price of new homes, which in turn can influence overall housing prices.

Third Category: Location-Specific Factors

1. Desirability of Area: Factors like proximity to good schools, employment centers, transportation links, and amenities can make certain locations more attractive, increasing demand and prices.

2. Infrastructure: Investments in infrastructure, such as new roads, public transportation, or utilities, can make an area more appealing and drive up property values.

3. Environmental Factors: Issues like flooding or pollution can negatively impact property values, while areas with pleasant environments or scenic views may command higher prices.

Fourth Category: Government Policies and Regulations

1. Tax Incentives: Policies like mortgage interest deductions can make homeownership more attractive, potentially increasing demand.

2. Tariffs and Trade Policies: These can affect the cost of building materials, influencing the cost of new constructions.

3. Housing Policies: Government initiatives aimed at increasing housing supply or making housing more affordable can also impact prices.

Fifth Category: Market Conditions and Investor Behavior

1. Speculation: Investors buying properties with the expectation of selling them later at a higher price can drive up prices.

2. Rental Market: The cost of renting can influence the decision to buy, as potential homebuyers may find it more economical to purchase a home if rents are high.

3. Foreign Investment: In some areas, particularly popular tourist destinations or global financial hubs, foreign buyers can drive up housing prices.

Alright, so these are the main categories and factors I've identified. Now, I need to see how these factors interact and which ones might be most significant in different scenarios.

For example, in a booming economy with low-interest rates and lax mortgage lending standards, demand for housing can surge, leading to rapid price increases, especially in desirable areas with limited supply. This was evident in the US housing market leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

On the other hand, during economic downturns, like the Great Recession, demand drops, and prices may fall, especially if there's an oversupply of homes on the market.

Location plays a crucial role because even in a weak overall housing market, certain areas might still see price increases due to their desirability or limited supply.

Government policies can either exacerbate or mitigate housing price fluctuations. For instance, implementing stricter building codes might temporarily slow down supply, pushing prices up, while incentives for developers to build more affordable housing could increase supply and stabilize or even decrease prices.

Moreover, investor behavior can significantly impact housing markets. When institutional investors snap up properties, it can remove units from the rental market and drive up prices for homebuyers competing for the remaining properties.

Finally, the condition and features of individual properties also affect their market value. Well-maintained homes with modern amenities will generally command higher prices than those that need repairs or updates.

In conclusion, housing prices are influenced by a complex interplay of economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, location-specific attributes, government policies, and market behaviors. Understanding these factors can help in making informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in real estate.
