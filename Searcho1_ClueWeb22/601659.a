Alright, so I need to figure out why Britain left the European Union. This is a pretty big topic, and there's a lot of information out there, so I need to approach this step by step. First, I should probably understand what the European Union is and what Britain's relationship with it was like before they left.

So, the European Union, or EU, is a political and economic union of European countries. It was started after World War II to foster cooperation and prevent future conflicts. Over time, it has grown in membership and in the scope of its regulations and policies. Britain, which is short for the United Kingdom, joined the EU in 1973.

Now, I know that in 2016, there was a referendum in the UK where voters decided whether to stay in the EU or leave. The leave campaign won, and eventually, Britain left the EU in 2020. But why did people want to leave? That's what I need to find out.

I think there were several key reasons behind the Brexit vote. One of the main issues was immigration. The EU has a policy of free movement, which means that citizens of any member country can live and work in any other member country. Some Britons were concerned about the number of immigrants coming into the UK, particularly from Eastern Europe, and they felt that this was putting pressure on public services and driving down wages.

Another issue was sovereignty. Some people in the UK felt that being a member of the EU meant that too many laws and regulations were being imposed by Brussels, the seat of the EU, rather than being made by the British government. They wanted more control over their own affairs.

There were also concerns about the EU's bureaucracy and spending. Some Britons felt that the UK was contributing too much money to the EU budget and not getting enough in return. They argued that this money could be better spent on domestic priorities like healthcare and education.

Additionally, there was a feeling among some that the EU was moving towards greater integration and possibly even a federal Europe, which they didn't support. They wanted to preserve the independence of the UK and prevent further loss of national sovereignty.

It's important to note that these were the main arguments put forward by the Leave campaign. On the other side, the Remain campaign argued that membership of the EU brought economic benefits, such as access to the single market, and that leaving would lead to uncertainty and potential economic damage.

The referendum result was quite close, with 51.9% voting to Leave and 48.1% voting to Remain. Given how divided the country was, it's clear that these issues were deeply felt by many people.

To get a better understanding, maybe I should look up some statistics on immigration and see how it affected the UK. Also, perhaps looking at the reasons given by prominent Leave campaigners would help clarify the main motivations.

Let me try searching for some information on this.

The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is termed as Brexit. On 23 June 2016, a referendum held which was passed by the people of Britain by 51.9 % votes. The term Brexit was formed by merging two words Britain and Exit.
A similar word was coined when Greece demanded an exit from the European Union, it was Grexit. The Britain joined the EU in 1973 and by a referendum, its membership was confirmed in 1973 followed a referendum passed by 67% votes in favor of joining the EU. Through the Maastricht Treaty of November 1993, the European Communities formed the EU.
Under the Article 50 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union, the procedure is mentioned for any country which wants an exit from the EU. The passage of the bill nullifies the  European Communities Act 1972 and the UK domestic Law will come into being.
Consequences:
The exit resulted in the economic, social and political changes. The Prime Minister David Cameroon resigned and the home secretary Mrs. Theresa May took over as a new PM of Britain.
The day Britain bids adieu from the EU, the value of pound fell and remained at 15% low against the US dollar and its value fell down by 10% against the Euro. Inflation rose by 2.3%, highest in last three and a half years. The employment ratio plunged same as earlier and touched its lowest at 4.8% in last 11 years.
Reasons behind the Britain’s Exit:
Issues like employment, competition, immigration, and sovereignty always concerned the Britain and finally, they took a call for the separation. Being a part of EU, there were many restrictions on the Britain. The countries in the EU are forced to follow the rules of the EU in the economic and other sectors. The Britishers think that they are losing their identity as a country. Every decision is taken by the Brussel, the capital of the European Union. It was a common thinking among the people that if they exit from the EU, they will get much freedom in deciding their issues.
The European countries, part of the EU had to go through an immigration process if they want to move from one country to another. If a person is from France and wants to move to Britain to work and live, legal immigration process was a necessity.
The entire Europe was combined together under one rule of the EU. This was an added burden to countries who are doing well economically. If one country suffers, the entire continent had to suffer. This is what happened in the 2008 economic recession.
After the formation of the EU, the population of foreigners rose in the Britain which affected the local population of the Britain. The employment ratio declined and the issues which no one could think started in the country.
Immigration or race relation became the major problem for them. The European countries came together after the second World War when a need was felt that the European countries should fight united rather than fighting with each other.

United Kingdom’s Exit from the European Union
Abstract
This paper discusses the recent decision and vote in the United Kingdom (UK) to break from the European Union (EU) after being a member for over 40 years.  Many factors went into the people’s decision to leave the EU and even then, the vote to leave was very close, with the majority winning by a relatively slim number.  Those who voted to leave think it is the correct move for the UK, just as those who voted against the separation think there could be negative effects. Even though the majority of voters voted to leave the EU, it will still take years before the process can be completed due to legal aspects that must be adhered too.  This does not include that fact that no country has ever left the EU, so there are some areas of uncertainty as well .  Even then, there is still a possibility that the British Prime Minister may over rule the vote and decide to remain in the EU, even if against voters’ wishes.

United
Kingdom Exit from the European Union
When
it comes to politics, everyone has their own opinion on what is best and what
is not.  To each individual, they feel that
their views are correct, and often times the other side is incorrect in their
way of thinking.  Now imagine taking that
to a much larger scale and instead of just having a difference of opinion in
politics and what political party should run a country for the coming years,
include the actual fate of a country. 
This is exactly what the United Kingdom (UK) did in June 2016.  They held a vote for what direction the UK
would take for the years to come.  This
vote was to determine whether or not to remain a part of the European Union
(EU), which they had been a member of for over 40 years.  As with any major decision that impacts a
country, there are those that feel the move to break away was the right
decision and the UK will be better off, since they will not have to abide by
the rules that have been imposed by the EU. 
Just as there are those that feel that leaving the EU is a major mistake
and feel that the break from the EU will be disastrous.  This exiting of the United Kingdom has been
called Brexit, which is essentially short for Britain and exit.
Being
part of the EU has many advantages for those living in the UK.  It is not just financially advantageous or
beneficial to have strength in number to being a member a of the EU.  According to Occupytheory.org (2014), six
advantages of being a member of the EU are:
Low prices of goods – there exists a ‘Single Market’ for all member countries wherein products are low-priced and there are no charges when it comes to custom tax; custom tax is usually charged when goods are transported or sold between states/countries but this is not applied among member countries.
Citizens are free to move from one member country to another – citizens can freely travel, study, work, or live in any European country of their choice.
More jobs are generated – more or less than 3.5 million jobs have been generated over the years.
Development of deprived regions – some member countries of the EU are economically deprived and through the ‘European Structural Funds’, deprived regions are developed.
Louder voice – the EU is able to ensure that all their concerns are taken seriously and heard internationally since it speaks in behalf of millions of people.
Workers are protected – this is made possible through the European Working Time Directive; the directive includes regulations regarding holidays, working hours, breaks, etc.
Essentially,
the EU is what is known as a single market. 
What that means is that members of the EU have free roam of all EU
nations.  They can free travel between
countries without having to have a passport or other travel documents required
by people from outside the EU.  It also
allows for people to more easily work and live outside of their home
country.  It also helped with trade among
EU nations as they did not have to pay tariffs for trade amongst each other.
Just
as there are advantages of being a member of the EU, there are also
disadvantages.  According to Tejvan
Pettinger (n.d.), six disadvantages of being a member of the EU are:
Cost.  The costs of EU members to the UK is £15bn gross (0.06% of GDP) – or £6.883 billion net.
Inefficient policies.  A large percentage (40%) of UE spending goes on Common Agricultural Policy.
Problems of the Euro.   Members of the EU doesn’t necessarily mean membership of the EURO.
Pressure towards austerity.  Since 2008, many southern European countries have faced pressure from the EU to pursue austerity – spending cuts to meet budget deficit targets, but in the middle of a recession these austerity measures have contributed to prolonged economic stagnation.
Net migration.  Free movement of labour has caused problems of overcrowding in UK cities.
More bureaucracy less democracy.  It is argued that the EU has created extra layers of bureaucracy whilst taking away decision making process further from local communities.
When it came time for the referendum, or vote, for whether or not to stay within the EU, nearly 30 million people voted, which equated to an approximate 71.8% voter turnout.  Once the votes were in, the margin of victor was relatively small.  The percentage of votes to Leave was 51.9% and percentage of votes to stay was 48.1%, which means that the Leave vote only won by only 3.8 percent.  It was not just Great Britain that was voting and would be impacted by the UK leaving the EU, due to the UK being made up of three other countries as well:  Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.  With the exception of the vote in Scotland, votes from the other three countries taking part in the UK vote were fairly close.  The over breakdown was “England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.  Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.  Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.  Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.”  (Hunt & Wheeler, 2017).
Considering the vote, why did the vote to leave the EU come about in the first place?  For years, the UK Independence Party has campaigned to leave the EU.  They felt that the UK was being held back by the EU due to the rules and restrictions that were placed on businesses.  There was also the matter of the amount of money that the UK paid annually to be a member of the EU.  They were paying billions of pounds each year, but they did not feel that they were getting enough in return for what they paid.  Border control was another issue that was used as part of the Leave campaign.  Due to EU borders rules, the UK was limited on what they could do in regards to controlling their border and the amount of immigration.  Since members of the EU had open borders to other EU nations, people from poorer countries wanted to move to richer countries to live and work, thus creating a influx of people.  There was also concern that this influx of people was taking needed resources and jobs from those already living in the UK.  This in turn took away jobs and added to the welfare system.  The members of the Independence Party and their supporters are not opposed to immigration, that just wanted to be able to control the numbers and who came into the country and they were unable to do that under EU rules.  When it came to the Leave campaign the Independence Party had support from other public officials.  They had approximately half of the Conservative Party Members of Parliament (MP) and some of the Labour Party MPs.  One other group that was significant was the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) out of Northern Ireland.  Although Northern Ireland voted to Remain, the DUP most likely helped to keep the vote closer then it could have been, similar to how the vote went in Scotland.  There was also a concern that the EU was trying to create more a single country, similar to the Untied States of America.  This would then take away individual countries identities, as they would be unified.  “One of the major sticking points in the conversation has been immigration concerns, as some Brits worry that the country’s employment market and social services will drown under the weight of too many new residents. There’s also the worry that upper-crust elites and Brussels bureaucrats are pushing for a continental identity that diminishes the U.K.’s own sense of self.”  (Rosenfeld, 2016).
When it came for the campaign to stay in the EU, there was no real added bonus, besides remaining a member of the EU.  The argument was that being a member of the EU helped economically due to single market trade.  They tried to battle to immigration fears by saying that the people that were immigrating to the UK where helping and were not creating a burden, since they came to work which in turn helped the economy.  The strongest argument to Remain was that they are more powerful in numbers.  The UK on its own does not have as big a voice, since they would be a single entity, as opposed to being one of 27 other countries who could stand together as one, thus making them more powerful due to numbers and economics.
Although the exact numbers are not known on what demographic voted the most and whether or not they voted for Leave or Remain, there is an idea due to polling that was conducted after the referendum.  “The results found that 64% of those young people who were registered did vote, rising to 65% among 25-to-39-year-olds and 66% among those aged between 40 and 54. It increased to 74% among the 55-to-64 age group and 90% for those aged 65 and over. It is thought that more than 70% of young voters chose to remain in the EU.”  (Helm, 2017).  What this shows is that the highest voter percentage turnout was from the older generation, increasing with each age group.  What was the most surprising though is the high number of voter turnout for young voters, with young voters being between the age of 18-24.  There was even some speculation as to what would have happened if 16-17 year olds had been allowed to vote due to that being a possible 1.6 million additional voters, which could have made the referendum a lot closer.  Even with these numbers, there is no way to know if it would have been enough to sway the vote to Remain.
Since the outcome of the referendum has been determined and the UK will leave the EU, what are the steps for this to take place since it is not as easy as just not being part of the EU one day?  The uncertainty of it all is that this has never been done, due to  Article 50 only came into existence in 2009.  Article 50 is what created a way for a member country of the EU to leave. To start, it will take at least two years for everything to be negotiated for its withdrawal from the EU.  During this time the UK will still abide by EU rules, but they will not be able to take part in any decision-making process.  According to Hunt & Wheeler (2017), as posted on BBC News, the following are the steps needed for the UK to leave the EU, to include a legal challenge to invoke Article 50:
November 2016:  Legal challenge to government’s right to invoke Article 50 without consulting Parliament succeeds.  MPs approve bill in March 2017.
Two year time limit begins.
29 March 2017:  UK invokes Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.
Remaining 27 EU countries meet 29 April to discuss withdrawal.
Negotiations begin between UK and EU.
Draft deal put to European Council (27 members).
Needs approval from at least 20 countries with 65% of the population.
Ratification by European Parliament
UK introduces Great Repeal Bill to revoke the 1972 European Communities Act.
After two years, negotiations can be extended if all 27 countries agree but if not EU treaties cease to apply to the UK.
The UK leaves the European Union
Great Repeal Act comes into force, copying EU laws into UK law, to give time for UK to amend or repeal them.
Besides the political and bureaucratic process that has to be completed by the politicians, as well as questions they need answered, there are still questions from the voter as to what happens next and these questions will need to be answered during the two year exit process.   Some people are worried about the safety of their products, but this is unlikely to change due to creating two items.  Others are worried about their health care and if they will be able to continue with their health care if they live abroad.  That in of itself is another question.  What happens to the people from the UK that already are living or working in another EU country or those from another country working in the UK.  For UK citizens working outside of the UK and non UK citizens working in the UK, most likely nothing will change.  They will be able to continue working where they are.  For those planning on retiring outside of the UK, that could be another question and will have to be part of the decision making process for all those involved within the UK government and the EU, since this type of movement was under the freedom of movement that was allowed as a member of the EU.  People are concerned about the housing market being impacted.  There has been a slight decrease in the housing market from June to December 2016.  Business owners are worried about having to pay tariffs once Brexit takes effect, since they have not had to pay tariffs as part of the EU.  This is another situation that will have to be negotiated during the exit process between the UK and the EU.  “People are also worried about the economy itself. The U.K.’s Treasury itself reported that its analysis showed the nation “would be permanently poorer” if it left the EU and adopted any of a number of likely alternatives. Productivity and GDP per person would be lower in all these alternative scenarios, as the costs would substantially outweigh any potential benefit of leaving the EU” (Rosenfeld, 2016).  Some people even think that the economy will become weaker due to reduced contributions from immigrants.  The Internationla Monetary Fund, along with the Bank of England, have said that there could be long term economic impacts.
Besides the EU, it is possible that the financial impact to be felt globally. “In Europe, the EU could run into economic trouble for a couple of reasons. The lengthy and as-yet ambiguous exit negotiations could cripple investment, as mentioned above, but they could also lead to more exits.”  (Rosenfeld, 2016).  With the EU being a single market when it comes to trade, it has been advantageous for businesses due to no tariffs when crossing European country lines.  However, businesses are concerned that due to the UK’s exit, they channels of free trade could go away, thus making it more expensive to ship goods in and out of the UK.  This may make companies want to leave the UK for other European countries who still are in the single market.  This could impact billions of dollars.  Brexit could also end up impacting the U.S.  “In the U.S., billions, if not trillions, of dollars could be called into question by a British exit: In 2014, American direct investment into the EU totaled about 1.81 trillion euros, and about 1.99 trillion euros flowed in the opposite direction, according to the European Commission.”  (Rosenfeld, 2016).  It is not just Europe and the U.S. that have these fears, but multiple other global companies that do business with the UK and the EU.  Just like with the stock market, when something bad happens in one country, it can be felt in various forms across the globe, due to the would be more globalized and working together.  With many of those that voted to Leave, they are not concerned with global corporations or investors in these companies that are looking at the bottom line, not what people think is best for their country.
Based on how a member of the UK voted, Leave or Remain, it is fairly easy to determine what they thought about Brexit itself.  However, with the UK exiting the EU and the potential impact it can have on other EU countries, gauging how they feel could either help or hinder the transition and negotiation process due to emotions.   “A 16-country poll by Ipsos Mori showed that almost half — 48 per cent — of respondents from Sweden said they were dismayed by the UK’s decision. It was a different story in France, where only a quarter of respondents said they were sad about Brexit.” (Mertens, 2016).  The US and Russia were also polled on their feelings of the UK leaving the EU.  Of those polled, in the US, approximately 20% said they were dismayed and the UK’s decision.  In Russia, only about 6% of Russians polled were dismayed, with 54% thinking that the UK deciding to part ways with the EU was a good idea and in their own best interest.  However, “a majority of respondents in most countries felt that Brexit would be bad for the UK economy.  Japan was especially gloomy, with more than two-thirds of respondents expecting Britain to experience an economic downturn.” (Mertens, 2016).  Polls that were conducted can give a general idea of what the common people thought of Brexit, but there were also mixed and neutral thoughts from world leaders.  The following quotes from world leaders, as posted on BBC news Brexit: World reaction as UK votes to leave EU (2016), are just a few of the world leader reactions.
“This is a painful choice and it is deeply regrettable both for the UK and Europe. But this choice is theirs and we must respect it, accepting all the consequences.” Francois Hollande, French President
“We take note of the British people’s decision with regret. There is no doubt that this is a blow to Europe and to the European unification process.” Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany
“The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom’s membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security, and economic policy.” Barack Obama, US President
“Victory for freedom! The British people have given to Europeans and to all the people of the world a shining lesson in democracy. Geert Wilders, Dutch Freedom Party leader
“It’s an explosive shock. At stake is the break-up pure and simple of the union.
“Now is the time to invent another Europe.” Manuel Valls, French Prime Minister
Depending on who one asks, there is a difference of opinions on whether or not the UK can survive Brexit.  Tom Campbell (2017) quoted the research director at the Centre for London as saying “Brown agrees that London will retain its dominance – even if terms are less favourable: “London has an unrivalled agglomeration of financial and other service firms. Some may relocate, some may choose to expand elsewhere, but many will remain in London.”  Just as Richard Brown thinks that the UK will be ok after Brexit, others still hold a different opinion and feel that Brexit will be detrimental for the UK.  Direcctor of World Cities Cultural Forum, Paul Owens, is one of these peole that feels Brexit was bad.  He stated “There’s no doubt the decision to leave the EU poses a threat to London’s creative economy. The sector has prospered on diversity, free movement of artistic talent and international supply chains. London’s cultural assets are considerable, but it is likely to be diminished over the next decade unless there is a suitable policy response.” (Campbell, 2017).  Ashoka Mody is another believer that the UK will survive Brexit and even points out that much of the UK’s trade is outside of the EU.  “Following Brexit, productive British trade with the European Union will survive just fine wherever it is based on long-lasting economic gains and social relationships. At the same time, the shift toward trade with the faster-growing United States and Asia will continue.” and “Almost all new British trade is being created outside of Europe.” (Mody, 2016).  So even if members of the EU are initially upset with the UK and make trade difficult initially, the UK still has other sources of economic stability.  Another aspect of why the UK will survive is literally about money. “As Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman points out, the U.K. has a significant advantage compared to other nations:  they have the British pound.” (Tepper, 2016).  Even with some people thinking that the UK leaving the EU could ending up irreversibly harming the UK, there are still others that have a good understanding of what is going on and understand that although there may be some set backs, thing will not be as bad as some would like things to appear at face value.

There are also those that look at whether or not the EU will be able to survive the UK’s departure.  Realistically, those that think the EU can’t not survive without the UK, do not know history, since the UK was not initially part of the EU.  Plus, there multiple other counties that want to the EU.  A potential issue with the countries that want to join, and may be the reason they have not been allowed to join yet, is these countries are poorer countries.  Due to this they would most likely not provide as many resources to into the EU as they would receive.  This is part of the reason the UK voted to Leave, paying more into the EU then they received back.  “The EU can certainly survive without Britain – but it cannot survive without buy-in from the public. Without a substantial change in how the EU communicates to the people in member countries, there will be a much greater threat to the EU than Brexit – and that threat is the EU itself.” (Can the EU survive after Brexit?, 2017).
Even though the some people do not feel that the future of the UK is a bleak as others would have people believe, they still have an up hill battle ahead of him.  Especially when it comes to to having to renegotiate trade deals within the EU, since the other 27 countries that the UK just divorced are likely to not be overly happy about their departure.  With the EU being the more powerful entity, they may have an upper hand when it comes to the negotiating table.  In an opinion poll that was conducted in 2016, French, German, Swedish, and Finnish feel that when it comes to post-Brexit negotiations, the UK should not receive any favors.  “Germans and the French were the most opposed to offering Britain a “generous deal” that pays tribute to Britain’s role as a neighbour and “important trading partner”, according to the YouGov survey.
In both countries, 53 per cent of respondents said it
should not expect any favours, compared to 27 per cent who said the EU
should offer Britain a “generous deal”.” (Sims, 2016).  One the flip side of that, people are willing
to take a softer stance if the UK is still willing to continue with the free
movement of workers and to keep with the pre-Brexit agreements about letting EU
citizens to work and live in the EU. 
Although that could potentially alleviate some of the Brexit negotiation
headaches, at the same time it goes against one of the big reasons that many
people wanted to vote Leave.  That is the
free movement of people into the UK and not have control of their own border.
No matter how it is looked at, the topic of the UK wanting to leave the EU is a hot topic item.  People on both sides of the fence have strong opinions of whether to Leave or Remain, and rightly so considering the referendum was and probably will be one of the most impactful decisions they will see in their life.  It is also hard to say which side is correct in their way of thinking.  One could look at it as the older more experienced generation, choose to leave due to what they have seen and experienced in their life time and tend to have more of a nationalistic point of view.  Just as the younger generation tended to vote to remain, although they do not have as much life experience or have seen as much, they tend to have more of an open mindset of how things should be.  When it came to the vote to leave and the two sides were campaigning for what they thought was right, there seemed to be two main reasons.  The first was the immigration issue and not having conrol of their own borders.  Whether or not the huge influx of immigrants actually took many jobs or economically taxed the UK systems, could be a matter of opinion, depending on how the numbers were spun and ones point of view.  Some even cited the immigration issue as a threat to society due to not border control, so extremists could more easily travel and hide within EU contries.  The other main topic was that many people felt that the EU was holding the UK back due to their rules and regulations.  They felt that it restricted business and did not allow them to thrive they way they felt they could.
No matter what the reason, a big concern for many people is whether or not the UK can survive Brexit.  The answer is yes.  Will they be as strong or globally powerful as they were when part of the EU, that is yet to be seen as only time will tell.  However, the UK is still an economic power with many resources and the UK failing would spell global disaster.  So even with the EU being upset up what is going on, it is not in their best interest for the UK to fail.  This does not mean that it will be an easy road for the UK during the two years leading up to their actually departure date.  There are a multitude of negotations that much be completed, with the UK possibly having to not get as good of deals as they would prefer.  There are also many laws within the UK that will need to be looked at and either used, amended, or be thrown out based on what is in their best interest.  All in all, the situation is overcomeable and there will not be any major catastrophic outcomes that topples a government, although some would believe that is the case.  However, a very real possibility, based on how the transition for the UK goes from being a member of the EU to not being a member of the EU, is if other EU countries will follow suit.  As it is very possibily that the UK could be paving the way for others to follow.  After all, Article 50 came about in 2009 and it only took eight years for an EU member country to use it.  Whose to say that once this divorce of the UK and EU is done, someone else doesn’t follow suit.  That is the EU’s biggest fear.

Brexit - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Brexit
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Brexit (/ˈ b r ɛ k s ɪ t,ˈ b r ɛ ɡ z ɪ t/) is a movement that promotes that the United Kingdom (UK) leave the European Union (EU). The name "Brexit" is a portmanteau (merging two words together) of "British" and "exit".
On 23 June 2016, the UK made a referendum that asked whether the UK should leave the EU. The result was that 51.9% of the UK electorate (the main region of the UK) voted that the UK should leave the EU. The rest wanted the UK to stay in the EU. On 29 March 2017, the UK government said that they will definitely be leaving the EU.  This started the procedure of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, a law that deals with countries that leave the EU.  The UK was expected to fully leave the EU on 29 March 2019 at 11 p.m. UTC.[1] The deadline to leave was later changed to 31 October 2019. [2]
On 15 January 2019, Theresa May 's government was defeated in the House of Commons by 230 votes in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union. [3]
On 24 December 2020, a post-Brexit trade deal was made. [4]

Shock, bewilderment, awe: Britain reacts to Brexit
Is India prepared for Brexit?

I ndia woke up to the Brexit shock on Friday, June 24, with the United Kingdom deciding in a referendum to move out of the European Union.
The stock markets crashed, and the rupee fell. Even as panic was slowly setting in, finance ministry officials stepped in with words of assurance. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex, which had crashed 1,000 points in the morning, recovered enough to close reasonably well.
So what are the implications of Brexit for India? What needs to be done?
Ummu Salma Bava, professor of European studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, shares her thoughts with Syed Firdaus Ashraf/ Rediff.com
What will be the implications of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union?
There are multiple implications: Economical, social and political.
As you can already see, the markets are falling and they are calling it 'Black Friday.' Markets across the globe are tumbling; the British pound is falling dramatically.
This is the immediate impact and it will take a while to adjust (to it ). It also means that Britain will now formally initiate the process for getting out of the EU.
Now that the referendum is done, it is a policy issue for the government to take. There is a whole procedure under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (external link) on how the State will get out, and all of those modalities will have to be worked out.
Why did those who voted to opt out of the EU do so? What were their apprehensions?
There were four major issues. The first: Competitiveness; the second: Jobs; the third: Immigration; and the fourth: Sovereignty.
Common Britishers think they were losing power as a country because everything gets decided in Brussels (capital of the EU ), and if they get out of the EU they would be more independent.
Or that they would do their own trade deals and decide their own laws -- basically, having their sovereignty back.
But do everyday people actually understand this issue?
Politicians packaged sound bytes that sold very well. A very interesting perception that jobs were going to return was played out by the 'Leave' lobby. Also, stuff such as the economy would become more buoyant and social handouts to immigrants would go down went down well with the common man.
But will it actually happen? That has to be seen.
What about Scotland? Do you think it will part ways with the UK in the future because Scots voted to remain with the EU?
At this point, they are not going anywhere.
What about the future of the EU? Do you think other countries will follow suit?
No country can demand it unless the leadership of that country decides to take the matter to the people.
This (the British vote) could lead to an increase in the sentiment of those political forces in the remaining 27 (EU) countries where it can have some kind of domino effect.
Will be there a similar effect? I don't think so. Britain always had a very special relationship with the EU -- it always was an on/off relationship. It retained its own currency and visa.
Britain always had what you call in EU lingo 'opt out clauses', which other countries don't have.
Denmark and Sweden have their own currencies though they are a part of the EU. The leaders will have to respond because if people feel that Brussels and the EU are interfering, then people will say 'Let us also have a referendum.'
It has never happened that a State has left the EU. As you said, if one State leaves, it encourages the other States to do so too. It would be called the 'British formula,' but this leaving could be a very painful and cumbersome process.
Do you think it was political suicide for British Prime Minister David Cameron (who stepped down after the referendum) to call for the Brexit vote?
When you are a politician, you put different things at stake thinking they would pay off, which Cameron probably thought.
If you look at the margin, it is not dramatic for a difference between those who wanted to exit and those who wanted to remain. It could also be a miscalculation. He must have thought he would convince the population of the benefits (of staying with the EU ).
He tried to negotiate a deal in February with the EU where he was partially successful.
The weather too played spoilsport. There was a huge storm and some polling stations were flooded. It was a game of chance.
What will be the impact on India?
There are more than 800 Indian companies in the UK. For certain companies such as the Tatas who have Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, Britain was a good market where they produced cars and sold it across the market in Europe.
It was a single market. Now they will have to technically 'export' from Britain to Europe, which will raise their costs. It would not be immediate, though. Earlier, the most immediate reaction the Indian government gave was that the economy would be able to take the shock because the British pound was falling.
That confidence has been shattered. The markets will stumble and settle at a new low, and then come back.
In layman terms, what is the link between the Indian rupee's fall and Brexit?
There is a basket of currencies and the rupee is not fully convertible. There is a median value at which the rupee is pegged against, say, the dollar or the pound. A lot of things are based on how the market would function and the state of the economy on both sides.
Since Brexit, the markets are in turmoil because they don't know what the ramifications would be. When a crisis like this happens, there is greater speculation. There is a fear that imports and exports would be hit in some way -- and when that happens, the rupee falls.
It will take time because the confidence of investors is down as they don't know what is next. This is one of those mysteries where you don't know the ending. And when everyone is speculating, it leads to currency fluctuation. This is what is known as the 'crisis of confidence.'
What does Brexit mean to the immigration and the refugee crisis?
Because of the civil war in Iraq and Syria, the EU had decided that they would distribute the refugees all across its member States, and Britain was against it.
There are two issues here: One was internal mobility, which meant that anybody could move from one part of the EU to another.
In the last one year there was a lot of movement from Central and Eastern Europe, Poland and Hungary. More recently, mobility was opened up for Bulgaria and Romania. A lot of these people from Central and Eastern European countries were moving to the UK because of better job prospects.
So all of that will stop. Britain will no longer be bound by EU regulations to take any more refugees. That comes as a surprise because Britain has a history of migration post 1945.
It took in massive numbers of people in the '50s, the '60s and the '70s from India and South Asia. It also took people from Uganda (after Idi Amin drove Indians out in 1972 ). Britain was always open about taking people in.
Do you think the refugee crisis played a role in Brexit?
You can say that it allowed the 'naysayers' to especially heighten the emotional perception. 'Okay, if you get out all of this will be over.'
Does that mean Britain will close their doors permanently to those who want in?
That will not happen. People will still go to Britain.

Brexit: the 7 most important arguments for Britain to leave the EU - Vox
Brexit: the 7 most important arguments for Britain to leave the EU
By Timothy B. Lee tim@vox.com Updated Jun 25, 2016,  9:32am EDT
The United Kingdom is leaving the EU. Here's what that means.
Watch on
On Thursday, Britain voted to leave the European Union — an option dubbed "Brexit ." Almost 52 percent of Britons voted in favor of leaving.
Although the "leave" campaign often focused on emotional arguments about immigration, there are in fact many reasons those in favor of leaving believed it would benefit the UK. They came from across the political spectrum, and some of the arguments even contradict others. Here are seven of the most significant.
Argument 1: The EU threatens British sovereignty

This is probably the most common argument among intellectual-minded people on the British right, expressed by Conservative politicians such as former London Mayor Boris Johnson and Justice Minister Michael Gove.
Over the past few decades, a series of EU treaties have shifted a growing amount of power from individual member states to the central EU bureaucracy in Brussels. On subjects where the EU has been granted authority — like competition policy, agriculture, and copyright and patent law — EU rules override national laws.
Euroskeptics emphasize that the EU’s executive branch, called the European Commission, isn’t directly accountable to voters in Britain or anyone else. British leaders have some influence on the selection of the European Commission’s members every five years. But once the body has been chosen, none of its members are accountable to the British government or to Britons’ elected representatives in the European Parliament.
Argument 2: The EU is strangling the UK in burdensome regulations
Critics like Johnson say the EU’s regulations have become increasingly onerous:
Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous, like the rule that you can’t recycle a teabag, or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons, or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating – like the time I discovered, in 2013, that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks, to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level, and the French were opposed.
Many British conservatives look at the European bureaucracy in Brussels the same way American conservatives view the Washington bureaucracy. Gove has argued that EU regulations cost the British economy "£600 million every week" ($880 million). (Though this figure is disputed .)
Argument 3: The EU entrenches corporate interests and prevents radical reforms

This is the mirror image of the previous two arguments. Whereas many British conservatives see the EU as imposing left-wing, big-government policies on Britain, some on the British left see things the other way around: that the EU’s antidemocratic structure gives too much power to corporate elites and prevents the British left from making significant gains.
"The EU is anti-democratic and beyond reform," said Enrico Tortolano, campaign director for Trade Unionists against the EU, in an interview with Quartz. The EU "provides the most hospitable ecosystem in the developed world for rentier monopoly corporations, tax-dodging elites and organized crime," writes British journalist Paul Mason.
This left-wing critique of the EU is part of a broader critique of elite institutions more generally, including the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Brexit supporters on the left would have a lot in common with Americans who are against trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Argument 4: The EU was a good idea, but the euro is a disaster
The United Kingdom has had a significant faction of euroskeptics ever since it joined the EU in 1973. But until recently, this was a minority position.
"There are nearly 130 Conservative MPs who have declared for leaving the EU," economist Andrew Lilico told me last week. "If you went back 10 years, you would have struggled to find more than 20 who even in private would have supported leaving the EU."
So what changed their minds? The global recession that began in 2008 was bad around the world, but it was much worse in countries that had adopted Europe’s common currency, the euro. The unemployment rate shot up above 20 percent in countries like Greece and Spain, triggering a massive debt crisis. Seven years after the recession began, Spain and Greece are still suffering from unemployment rates above 20 percent, and many economists believe the euro was the primary culprit.
Luckily, the UK chose not to join the common currency, so there’s little danger of the euro directly cratering the British economy. But the euro’s dismal performance still provides extra ammunition to Brexit supporters.
Many economists believe that deeper fiscal and political integration will be needed for the eurozone to work properly. Europe needs a common welfare and tax system so that countries facing particularly severe downturns — like Greece and Spain — can get extra help from the center.
But that makes Britain’s continued inclusion in the EU awkward. Britain is unlikely to go along with deeper fiscal integration, but it would also be unwieldy to create a set of new, parallel eurozone-specific institutions that excluded the UK.
So, the argument goes, it might be better for everyone if the UK got out of the EU, clearing the path for the rest of the EU to evolve more quickly into a unified European state.
Argument 5: The EU allows too many immigrants

The intellectual case for Brexit is mostly focused on economics, but the emotional case for Brexit is heavily influenced by immigration. EU law guarantees that citizens of one EU country have the right to travel, live, and take jobs in other EU countries.
British people have increasingly felt the impact of this rule since the 2008 financial crisis. The eurozone has struggled economically, and workers from eurozone countries such as Ireland, Italy, and Lithuania (as well as EU countries like Poland and Romania that have not yet joined the common currency) have flocked to the UK in search of work.
"In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans have come to Britain to do a job," British journalist and Brexit supporter Douglas Murray told me last week. This, he argues, has "undercut the native working population."
The UK absorbed 333,000 new people, on net, in 2015. That’s a significant number for a country Britain’s size, though according to the CIA the UK still received slightly fewer net migrants, relative to population, than the United States in 2015.
Immigration has become a highly politicized issue in Britain, as it has in the United States and many other places over the past few years. Anti-immigration campaigners like Nigel Farage, the leader of the far-right UK Independence Party, have argued that the flood of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe has depressed the wages of native-born British workers. Some voters are also concerned about immigrants using scarce public services.
"One of the causes for the great public disgruntlement," Murray argues, is that Labour governments at the turn of the century "massively understated the numbers [of immigrants] to be expected," creating public distrust of current pledges to keep migration under control.
Argument 6: The UK could have a more rational immigration system outside the EU
While many Brexit supporters simply want to reduce the amount of immigration overall, others argue that the UK could have a more sensible immigration system if it didn’t have the straitjacket of the EU.
EU rules require the UK to admit all EU citizens who wants to move to Britain, whether or not they have good job prospects or English skills.
"Leave" advocates argue that the UK should be focused on admitting immigrants who will bring valuable skills to the country and integrate well into British culture. They mention the point-based immigration systems of Canada and Australia, which award potential migrants points based on factors like their language and job skills, education, and age. That, "leave" advocates argue, would allow the UK to admit more doctors and engineers who speak fluent English, and fewer unskilled laborers with limited English skills.
Argument 7: The UK could keep the money it currently sends to the EU
The EU doesn’t have the power to directly collect taxes, but it requires member states to make an annual contribution to the central EU budget. Currently, the UK’s contribution is worth about £13 billion ($19 billion) per year, which is about $300 per person in the UK. ("Leave" supporters have been citing a larger figure, but that figure ignores a rebate that’s automatically subtracted from the UK’s contribution.)
While much of this money is spent on services in the UK, Brexit supporters still argue that it would be better for the UK to simply keep the money and have Parliament decide how to spend it.

Alright, so I've read through these articles, and I'm starting to get a better grasp on why Britain decided to leave the European Union. It seems like there were multiple factors at play here. Let me try to summarize what I've understood.

First off, the European Union is a political and economic union of European countries. It was established to promote cooperation and prevent future conflicts after World War II. Britain joined the EU in 1973, but over time, there were growing sentiments among some Britons that being part of the EU was more of a hindrance than a help.

One of the main reasons for wanting to leave, or Brexit, was concerns over immigration. The EU has a policy of free movement, which allows citizens of any member country to live and work in any other member country without restrictions. This led to an influx of immigrants from other EU countries, particularly from Eastern Europe, into the UK. Some Britons felt that this was putting pressure on public services and driving down wages for本地工人。他们认为，通过离开欧盟，英国可以更好地控制移民数量，并保护本国工人的利益。

另一个重要原因是主权问题。一些人认为，作为欧盟的成员，英国在许多政策和法规上受到布鲁塞尔的过度干预，失去了国家自主权。他们希望英国能够独立制定自己的法律和政策，而不受欧盟的束缚。

此外，还有人对欧盟的官僚主义和支出表示不满。他们认为英国向欧盟支付了过多的资金，但没有得到相应的回报。这些人认为这些资金可以更好地用于国内优先事项，如医疗保健和教育。

另外，一些人担心欧盟正朝着更加一体化的方向发展，甚至可能最终形成一个类似美国的联邦欧洲，这会进一步削弱英国的国家身份和独立性。他们希望保留英国的独立性，防止进一步丧失国家主权。

当然，支持留在欧盟的人也有他们的理由。他们认为欧盟成员国身份带来了经济上的好处，比如单一市场的准入，这促进了贸易和经济增长。他们还担心，离开欧盟可能会导致经济不确定性，对英国的金融和贸易地位产生负面影响。

最近的公投结果显示，51.9%的选民支持英国退出欧盟，而48.1%的选民支持留在欧盟。这个结果相对接近，反映出英国社会在这个问题上的深刻分歧。

从我查阅的资料来看，英国脱欧的过程将是复杂和漫长的。根据欧盟条约的第50条，启动退出程序需要经过一系列谈判和法律步骤，预计整个过程将持续数年。而且，由于这是历史上首次有国家选择退出欧盟，所以其中很多环节都是未知数。

总的来说，英国脱欧是一个多方面因素综合作用的结果，包括经济、政治和文化等方面的考虑。对于英国和欧盟来说，这都将是一个重大的转变，其长期影响仍有待观察。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Britain left the European Union primarily due to concerns over immigration, sovereignty, EU bureaucracy and spending, and fears of increased EU integration.}} \]
