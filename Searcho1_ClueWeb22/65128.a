I'm trying to understand why gender roles were created. This is a complex topic, and I need to approach it carefully. First, I should probably define what gender roles are. Gender roles are the set of social and behavioral norms that are considered appropriate for individuals based on their assigned sex. So, typically, there are roles associated with being male or female, and these roles can vary widely across different cultures and time periods.

Now, to understand why these roles were created, I need to look into the history and sociology behind them. I think it's important to consider both biological and cultural factors. Biologically, there are differences between males and females, particularly in terms of reproductive roles. Maybe these biological differences led to the development of gender roles.

Let me try to structure my thoughts. Perhaps initially, gender roles evolved as a way to divide labor based on physical abilities. For example, males might have been stronger and therefore took on more physically demanding tasks like hunting, while females handled gathering and childcare, which require different kinds of strength and endurance.

But I also know that in many societies, gender roles go beyond just division of labor and extend into areas like education, politics, and social interactions. So, there must be more to it than just physical capabilities.

Maybe I should look into anthropological studies of early human societies to see how gender roles developed over time. Perhaps examining hunter-gatherer societies could provide some insights into the origins of these roles.

Alternatively, maybe gender roles were created to maintain social order and stability. By assigning specific roles to each gender, societies could ensure that all necessary tasks were covered, and there was a clear hierarchy and structure.

But that seems a bit simplistic. I suspect that the reasons are more multifaceted and influenced by various factors including biology, culture, economics, and even religion.

Let me consider the role of religion in shaping gender roles. Many religious texts and traditions prescribe specific roles for men and women, which have had a profound impact on societies around the world. For instance, in some religions, women are expected to be subservient to men, while in others, there is more equality.

However, it's important to note that not all religions view gender roles in the same way, and there is diversity even within religious traditions.

Perhaps economic factors also played a role in the creation of gender roles. In agricultural societies, for example, certain tasks might have been more suited to one gender over the other based on physical strength or other considerations.

Moreover, as societies became more industrialized, gender roles may have adapted to the needs of the industrial economy. For instance, during World War II, women took on jobs traditionally held by men who were away fighting, which shifted gender role perceptions to some extent.

But I need to focus on the original creation of gender roles, not their evolution over time. Maybe I should look back to prehistoric times to get a better understanding.

I recall that in some primitive societies, gender roles were more fluid, and individuals could move between different roles based on their skills and abilities, regardless of their gender. So, perhaps the rigid gender roles we see in many modern societies are a relatively recent development.

Wait a minute, that contradicts my earlier thought that gender roles evolved based on biological differences. If roles were more fluid in some societies, then there must be other factors at play.

Maybe I need to consider the concept of gender essentialism versus social constructivism. Essentialists believe that gender roles are inherent and biologically determined, while social constructivists argue that they are created and reinforced by society and culture.

Given the variation in gender roles across different cultures and historical periods, it seems more likely that they are socially constructed rather than biologically determined.

But biology certainly plays a role, especially in reproduction. Childbirth and breastfeeding are exclusive to women, which may have led to the development of gendered caregiving roles.

However, even in this area, there is room for variation. For example, in some societies, childcare is shared more equally between genders, or extended family members participate in childcare.

Perhaps power dynamics also play a significant role in the creation of gender roles. By assigning certain roles to one gender over another, societies can maintain power imbalances and control over resources and decision-making.

This ties into feminist theories that argue gender roles are a means of oppressing women and maintaining male dominance in society.

But not all gender roles are about oppression; some may have developed as a way to optimize efficiency and cooperation within groups.

Moreover, in some cultures, gender roles can be seen as complementary, with each gender contributing different strengths and perspectives to society.

On the other hand, strict gender roles can also lead to limitations and inequalities, restricting individual potential and causing social injustices.

Perhaps the creation of gender roles was a combination of biological predispositions, cultural adaptations, and power dynamics.

To get a more informed answer, I think I need to do some research. Maybe look up scholarly articles on the origins of gender roles or read about anthropological studies on the subject.

Let me try formulating a search query for this.

Gender - Anthropology - iResearchNet
Gender
Gender is a social and cultural categorization defined by the meanings given to biological differences between the sexes. Gender roles are the social skills, abilities, and ways of acting thought appropriate to members of a society depending upon their sex.
Since the 1970s, there has been a growing anthropological interest in the construction of gender relations and the significance attached to gender. Anthropologists compare the similarities and differences found in various societies and look for explanations for them. The way in which gender intersects with other kinds of “difference” has become another focus of the work on gender.
History of the Gender Category in Anthropology
Until the 1970s, few anthropologists had given detailed attention to gender (Margaret Mead was one of the few). But in the 1970s, feminist anthropology started to investigate women’s situations in different social, political, and economic order; the roots of women’s subordination; and the general roles of women in different cultures and economies. In the 1980s, the focus shifted from “women” to “gender.” “Gender” appeared to provide the key for talking about sex/gender differences without relying upon linked dichotomies based on Western ideas, which were seen as culturally specific. As the focus shifted from “women” to “gender,” “men” and “masculinity” also came to be studied in their own right and investigated as cultural constructions. Both were considered as complex and changing categories, with masculinity itself viewed as just as problematic as femininity. Finally, during the 1990s, the distinction between sex and gender itself became murky. Increasingly, studies presented the sexed body itself as historically and culturally constructed.
Traditional Gender Roles
In Western and some non-Western societies, gender roles are traditionally strictly divided into feminine and masculine and are assigned to males and females at latest at the moment of birth. Powerful cultural mechanisms operate to ensure that “boys will be boys and girls will be girls.” The process of training girls to be feminine and boys to be masculine is largely unconscious. Boys are supposed to grow up to be powerful, to hide their weaknesses, to be independent, demanding, and aggressive. Occupations thought appropriate for men are therefore mainly in politics, economics, and sports. Girls are encouraged to be good mothers and expected to become what is needed to fulfill this role, such as being giving, emotional, and intuitive. They are expected to sacrifice their ambitions and personal needs in order to please and care for others. If they do not adhere to these gender roles—if they are, for example, ambitious, demanding, and tough or rough—they are considered unfeminine. Males who do not evince the expected traits of masculinity are called “feminine” or “effeminate.” As the system is a hierarchical one, these men and boys are degraded. Although these roles have diversified, gender roles limit what men and women can feel, think, and do.
Gender and Biology/Nature
Is gender determined by biology/nature, or is it the result of culturally given meanings to biological sex differences? Many cultures have a “natural attitude” with respect to gender. This attitude is made up of the assumptions that (a) gender behavior is the result of sex, not the result of cultural interpretations; (b) that there are only two genders; and (c) that one’s gender is invariant and permanent. The question is not settled, but the data demonstrating that a gendered behavior is unquestionably biologically determined do not exist today.
The simple picture is complicated by the fact that biological sex itself is not set on a simple male/female switch, but may be composed of a variety of chromosomal and morphological “anomalies.” Biological conditions in which a child’s genetic sex (chromosomes) and phenotypical sex (genital appearance) do not match, or are somehow different from the “standard” male or female, are called intersex.
Gender Crossing, Third Genders
There are people who feel that their true gender is at variance with their biological sex. Some have sex change surgery or undergo medical treatment aimed at changing their sexual anatomy. These people are termed transsexual. Others take on opposite gender roles without changing their sex. The best-known case in the ethnographic literature is the so-called berdache, found in a number of societies indigenous to North America. Berdaches are individuals who take on gender roles in opposition to their anatomical sex by adopting the dress and performing the activities of members of the other group. The case of berdache and other cases raise the questions of whether we should think of such phenomena in terms of a basic two-gender system, with the possibility of individuals transferring from one to the other, or whether it is more appropriate to think of them as constituting a distinct third gender. Among the Hijras of northern India, for example, males who dress in women’s clothing and act more like women than men are considered neither male nor female.
Cross-Cultural Perspectives
Ethnographic evidence supports the notion that gender is a cross-cultural phenomenon, and the vast majority of individuals can easily be differentiated into sex classes on the basis of their genitalia. Nevertheless, in looking at different societies, past and present, anthropology has discovered a wide range of variation in gender construction and gender roles, in the value placed on activities performed by men and women, and in men’s and women’s access to important social resources.
Gender and the Future of Anthropology
There are now few if any areas of anthropological inquiry that have not been subjected to a “gendered” inquiry. Gender is an element in theories of biological, cultural, and linguistic anthropology, and of archaeology. The range covered by gender questions has come to parallel that of anthropology itself. The way in which gender intersects with other kinds of “differences,” such as race, class, ethnicity, sexual preference, and physical ability, has become another focus of the work on gender. Although a woman may not outrank a man of her class, she may outrank men of lower classes. Nevertheless, some go as far as to argue that women and men do not exist anywhere, and therefore the responsible anthropologist will not even assume that there are women and men or third genders in a given culture until it has been shown that these are relevant social categories.

European History & The Origin of Gender Roles
European History & The Origin of Gender Roles
June 19, 2016 Othala 20 Comments
My original question was: “What was the origin of the idea of gender roles in our society?” Below is a compilation of what I found, and basically the idea that women should stay home and be the caregiver because they are the weaker sex, while the men, because they are stronger, would run the home, rule the tribe and then the world, does not reflect the attitudes of our Ancestors. My sources mostly include books which cite historical accounts of the people encountered within our race and our pre-Christian lore.
I will begin with a non-peer reviewed scientific essay (which cites peer-reviewed sources) that describes how the introduction of the plow within communities over time, changed the view of the community regarding male and female “roles”. What this research shows is that there is a correlation between agriculture advancement (the introduction of the plow) and the eventual subjugation of women and that it originated in the middle east around 4,000 BC and not in Europe. In fact we do not see this ideology (gender roles) reflected within Europe (and especially within tribes that had no contact with the Arabs) until after 1,100 AD and the introduction of the plow during the Roman Empire days.
Here I will give some quotes from the paper.
…We find that, consistent with existing hypotheses, the descendants of societies that traditionally practiced plough agriculture, today have lower rates of female participation in the workplace, in politics, and in entrepreneurial activities, as well as a greater prevalence of attitudes favoring gender inequality…
…Men tended to work outside of the home in the fields, while women specialized in activities within the home. This division of labor then generated norms about the appropriate role of women in society. Societies characterized by plough agriculture, and a resulting gender-based division of labor, developed the belief that the natural place for women is within the home…
…A particularly interesting example is Fernand Braudel’s (1998) description of how gender relations, culture, and society were impacted by the adoption of the plough in Mesopotamia between 4,000 and 6,000 BC. He writes: “Until now, women had been in charge of the fields and gardens where cereals were grown: everything had depended on their tilling the soil and tending the crop. Men had been first hunters, then herdsmen. But now men took over the plough, which they alone were allowed to use. At a stroke, it might seem that the society would move from being matriarchal to patriarchal: that there would be a shift away from the reign of the all-powerful mother goddesses. . . and towards the male gods and priests who were predominant in Sumer and Babylon. . . and was accompanied with a move towards male domination of society and its beliefs”…
You can download the paper here.
So within the paper we can see the research that links plow use between 4,000 and 6,000 BC in Mesopotamia, to when ideologies started to change regarding women. It should be no surprise that within the cultures present in “Mesopotamia” (Modern day Iraq and surrounding areas) where the plow was first introduced, that women today are treated the worst in the world, in fact they are quite literally 2nd class beings, sometimes regarded as less than “human”. These ideologies are well rooted by time… we are talking some 8,000 years.
This idea that women are less than their male counterparts is reflected within all of their religious belief systems. According to the Old Testament and/or the Torah we are told that the MALE god created man first and from man he created woman to be man’s servant (help mate).
The Creation of Eve
Genesis 2:7 Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.
Genesis 2:21 … but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him.
Genesis 2:22 The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man.
Genesis 3:16 To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you.”
This attitude that man is first continues and is expounded upon within the Christian books:
1 Corinthians 11: 8 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.
1 Corinthians 11:9 Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
1 Corinthians 14:34 women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.
1 Timothy 2:11-13 A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.…
Titus 2:5 to be self-controlled, pure, managers of their households, kind, and subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be discredited.
Ephesians 5:22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
To summarize the above:
We learn that the idea that there should be gender roles is linked to the introduction of the plow and men working in the field, women spending more time within the home.
The introduction of the plow has its origins in Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq, not Europe.
The ideology that women belong to men is reinforced within the desert dwelling peoples “Laws” and religions all the way to today (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). I quoted the Christian scriptures because our people are mostly under its influence, however, you can find in each of the three the same ideology regarding females, ie: Sharia within Islam.
We already know that the Semitic god (Jehovah, Jesus, Allah) is male and has no female counterpart.
Note: I think it is absolutely deplorable that we as a people know more about these nasty non-white invaders’ history than we do of our own history. And what is even more disgusting is that some (well a fair majority anyway) of our race actually believe that the history in the bible is their race’s history.
Now when we look upon our history, the pieces that were not destroyed by the introduction of Christianity, we see an entirely different view of women, a view that does not reflect “gender roles”. Below I will offer proof, though limited in scope, for which I do believe counters the above and leaves no doubt in my mind that our folk never thought of our women in any way like the Semitic people do, in fact it is completely opposite.
Note: The introduction of the plow and the introduction of Christianity are, get this, during the same time frame. The heavy plow came to Europe in the early Middle Ages from around year 900 to 1300 AD. [Source]
Christianity, as we all know, even though it was introduced to our folk starting in the year 350 AD, didn’t take hold of all of our people until around 1200 to 1300 AD.
Now I will attempt to show that before the introduction of the plow and Christianity our folk valued women. Women were leaders, priestesses, warriors, and sought after for healing (doctors) and were highly respected for their counsel. I will show by example that men and women worked together, fought together and ruled together, and that we had Priestesses as well as Priests. That the old Gods, the True Gods of our folk, included both Male and Female and that the Feminine is what rules our lives and determines our fate. That the aspect of our “higher self” is female, yes even if you are a male.
I’ll begin with a few excerpts from a book entitled “History of the Northmen”
Things I noted: Both men and women hunted together:
men and women hunted together
We all know of the infamous “Berserkers”, well women also became “mentally diseased” with what they describe as an illness…
Martial Insanity = Berserker
Even the female sex did not escape the “martial fury”
From this one source we can see that men and women shared work, and shared the battle field both on land and at sea. We were together.
The above is just one source, we have others. The “myth” of the Amazon Women actually has historical basis, as we can see with the blonde hair, blue eyed people who ruled a vast area of Europe for many thousands of years. They were known as the Sarmatians. Historical documents tell us about these people. One thing to note is that women played a prominent role in warfare.
The Sarmatians emerged in the 7th century BC in a region of the steppe to the east of the Don River and south of the Ural Mountains in Eastern Europe. For centuries they lived in relatively peaceful co-existence with their western neighbors the Scythians. Then, in the 3rd century BC, they fought with the Scythians on the Pontic steppe to the north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians were to dominate these territories over the next five centuries. Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) wrote that they ranged from the Vistula River (in present-day Poland) to the Danube.
Herodotus (4.110–117) credits the unusual social freedoms of Sauromatae women, including participation in warfare, as an inheritance from their supposed Amazon ancestors. Later writers refer to the “woman-ruled Sarmatae” (γυναικοκρατούμενοι).
Hippocrates explicitly classes them as Scythian and describes their warlike women and their customs:
Their women, so long as they are virgins, ride, shoot, throw the javelin while mounted, and fight with their enemies. They do not lay aside their virginity until they have killed three of their enemies, and they do not marry before they have performed the traditional sacred rites. A woman who takes to herself a husband no longer rides, unless she is compelled to do so by a general expedition. They have no right breast; for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm.
Another tribe called the Cimbri who were classified as a Germanic People (tall and blue eyed) that lived in the North, aka: Jutland, shows a similar relation between men and women, and that the women accompanied the men on their expeditions:
Cimbri footnotes, Teutonic Mythology Volume 1 by Jacob Grimm
Strabo gives this vivid description of the Cimbric folklore (Geogr. 7.2.3, trans. H.L. Jones):
Their wives, who would accompany them on their expeditions, were attended by priestesses who were seers; these were grey-haired, clad in white, with flaxen cloaks fastened on with clasps, girt with girdles of bronze, and bare-footed; now sword in hand these priestesses would meet with the prisoners of war throughout the camp, and having first crowned them with wreaths would lead them to a brazen vessel of about twenty amphorae; and they had a raised platform which the priestess would mount, and then, bending over the kettle, would cut the throat of each prisoner after he had been lifted up; and from the blood that poured forth into the vessel some of the priestesses would draw a prophecy, while still others would split open the body and from an inspection of the entrails would utter a prophecy of victory for their own people; and during the battles they would beat on the hides that were stretched over the wicker-bodies of the wagons and in this way produce an unearthly noise.
The Cimbri are depicted as ferocious warriors who did not fear death. The host was followed by women and children on carts. Aged women, priestesses, dressed in white sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood, the nature of which allowed them to see what was to come.
Something we need to note here is the age of the women priestesses – they were OLD, they had long GREY hair. This counters the argument I hear all the time that a woman is all washed up by the time she is 30 definitely by the time she is 40 because she can no longer bear children. Such a shame that the Semitic thought footprint is so engraved upon our folk that our men would actually think the only thing women were good for or best at was furthering the race.
Next we can enter the Icini tribe of Britian who led by their Queen Boudica, attacked the Romans.
Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was campaigning in Wales, Boudica led the Iceni and the neighbouring Trinovantes in a large-scale revolt:
…a terrible disaster occurred in Britain. Two cities were sacked, eighty thousand of the Romans and of their allies perished, and the island was lost to Rome. Moreover, all this ruin was brought upon the Romans by a woman, a fact which in itself caused them the greatest shame… But the person who was chiefly instrumental in rousing the natives and persuading them to fight the Romans, the person who was thought worthy to be their leader and who directed the conduct of the entire war, was Buduica, a Briton woman of the royal family and possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women… In stature she was very tall, in appearance most terrifying, in the glance of her eye most fierce, and her voice was harsh; a great mass of the tawniest hair fell to her hips; around her neck was a large golden necklace; and she wore a tunic of divers colours over which a thick mantle was fastened with a brooch. This was her invariable attire.
Statue of Boudica by Thomas Thornycroft near Westminster Pier, London, with her two daughters upon a chariot
In the above I have used just 3 sources that show before the Christian influence was forced upon our folk (from all regions of Europe) that men and women worked TOGETHER especially when it meant defending one’s tribe or community. It is plain to see that no one scoffed at the idea of a male leader or warrior, nor did they scoff with a female leader or warrior. Why should we scoff at this idea today? Have we been looking at the relationship between men and women with a Semitic lens?
What about the Vikings? Well, in my opinion, the Vikings arrive near the end of our folk, right at the cusp of complete Christian takeover. We know the Vikings were a well traveled people. We can see within their laws (from 920’s called the Grey Goose Laws) the Jewish and possibly Islamic influences, which were, get this, introduced by an immigrant. Even so, we can however find bits of the Heathen way within the Sagas. Here is one example:
In the first few chapters of Laxdæla saga tells the story of Unnur djúpúðga (the Deep Minded), who was already widowed when she left Norway for Scotland with her father and son. When they, too, were killed, she felt that she had to leave Scotland and join the remainder of her family in Iceland. She arranged for a ship to be built, gathered her family and followers, and sailed for Iceland. Once in Iceland, she claimed land, settled there, arranged for a farm to be built, and then ran the farm. Over the years, she gave away portions of her land holdings to supporters, and arranged marriages for her daughters. When she died, she was laid in a ship in a burial mound, an honor by that time, usually reserved for men.
What about the rest of our lore, our Native Spirituality? What examples does it give us on how men and women regarded each other? Does it show a submissive female, one who is bound to the duty of her husband? One who if it was not for the man would not have been created? Or does it show and promote strong women, women who were not just beautiful but also revered for their wisdom?
In our creation story we are told that the first two humans were created out of trees. In case you think this is a wild concept, remember that trees represent DNA. They were both created at the same time from different types of trees. One was not made from the other. In reality and within all of nature it takes a male and a female TOGETHER to create human life, (in fact all animal life) which proceeds forth only from the female. The whole idea that woman came out of a man is absolutely ludicrous, is totally unnatural and serves only one purpose.
The creation of Ask and Embla
All of our Ancestor’s major Gods were married to Goddesses and they all brought forth children. The fact that they had children did not hinder in any way the role of either God or Goddess.
For instance, Odin was married to Frigg and both sit TOGETHER on the high seat that overlooks the world.
In Grímnismál, Odin and Frigg are both sitting in Hliðskjálf
Next we will look at what is known as Sedir, a Norse term for a form of Shamanism. We can see that the “gender role” has crept in during the Viking Age because supposedly it was unmanly for a man to be a Sedir; it was looked at as solely a woman’s job (as part of her “gifts” from the Gods). But what does our Godly example show? Two of the Aesir and Vanir deities are noted masters of seidr: the Goddess Freya and the God Odin. Both can be seen as the Godly models of seidr practitioners among their respective genders. That Odin was seen as a master also shows us that there was not a distinction between male and female roles, especially godly ones until a later time within our lore.
The roles of the Seidr
We also have a term for the Chief and Priest of the klan or folk. Again this position was not limited to men. We know this because of the words used, a A goði or gothi is the Old Norse term for a priest and chieftain. Gyðja signifies a priestess. Again we see no separation between males and females.
While men were remembered for their deeds (Heroes) the females were highly revered for their wisdom in our history:
Teutonic Mythology Volume 1 by Jacob Grimm
In contrast the Semitic attitude is that woman should remain silent, especially in church and are not allowed to become priests. In fact it was our beloved, wise and much sought after Seidr who by doctrine (law) were made into witches and devils and burned alive in the name of Christianity. And since it was customary for this profession to be mostly female, it was a direct assault against our wise and gifted women folk.
Another example we have of teamwork is our Gods and Goddess of War.
Freya is a goddess of war (she also has other attributes). The name of her house in Asgard is Sessrumnir placed on the field Fólkvangr, which means “field of the host”, “people field” or “army field” It is a place where half of those that die in a battle go for the afterlife, while Odin will receive the other half. Freya is always given the first choice. After she had picked the ones she wanted, the rest were sent to Odin.
Odin is a god of war (he also has other attributes). Odin is in charge of a place called Valhalla, where the dead warriors that are chosen by the Valkyries go. These dead warriors train daily until the great battle arrives that they partake in called Ragnarok.
Valkyrie, a group of maidens who served the god Odin and were sent by him to the battlefields to choose the who were slain and of those, who were worthy of a place in Valhalla. While the theme is that Freya gets first choice and Odin second, it is only through the Valkyries that this choice is made. Odin does not choose these warriors himself.
Our beloved primordial beings collectively known as the “Norns” the weavers of fate are all female beings.
Also found within our lore is a primordial female being called a Hamingja (pronounced “HAHM-ing-ya”). Today she would be considered your guardian angel or your higher self (she is actually a combination of the two). She knows everything about you and she carries the memories of your ancestors. It is she who speaks for you at death. She is not bound to you. If you are a wicked, evil person she can rip herself away from you and when that happens you are basically doomed to the dark regions of Hel. (Note: our Hel, unlike the Christian hell has many regions.) This is the “SHE” that Miguel Serrano is referring to in all of his works, his “beloved”.
Your Hamingja is what can “reincarnate” today as one of your ancestors. Because of her, we are not only connected through blood (DNA) but through her we also connect our Higher Self – Soul – Guardian Angel to our Ancestors. It is she who has the power of restoring blood memory and gives guidance (intuition).
According to Serrano, men have a soul – their Hamingja and women ARE a soul.
Now even though we can see that within our history, men and women had shared duties including on the battlefield, that women were not created to be a man’s subject, and that women were revered for their wisdom even in old age, this does not mean that men were not required to be “Manly”. Men were expected to be strong “he men” warriors, not the sissified puff masters we see trolling the streets today. What the faggots call a “White Knight” or “Alpha Male” was normal for our men. We know this because of the 3 main swear words that if one was called unjustly would require the recipient to avenge himself by killing the accuser. Being too feminine was not allowed. Having male gay relations was not allowed. The swear words are ragr, strodinn, and sordinn, all three meaning the passive role of a man included in same-sex activities among males.
Our men also treated their female counterparts with the utmost respect and adoration. Never do we read within our pre-Christian history of men who mistreated, berated or placed their wives under subjection.
This should bring new light to the verse of the bible (a book from our enemy) which says at 1 Corinthians 1:19 For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate”. How ironic is it that our wise were our women? How ironic is it that these enemies of ours instilled a belief so strong that our highly valued women, women who were revered second only to the Gods for their wisdom and advise would be demoralized and destroyed?
Teutonic Mythology Volume 1 by Jacob Grimm
Teutonic Mythology Volume 1 by Jacob Grimm
How could we allow as a people this foreign influence about women to poison our very souls? And we wonder what happened, how did things get so bad? Well when you take away the “wisdom” of the people, our greatest gift, and turn them into demons and sinners bound for hell it sure makes for a dumber society, doesn’t it? Enough is enough!
In conclusion I will say this, one of the most important duties a woman has is in bringing forth life and rearing her children. One of the most important duties of a man is in making sure his family is safe and is not wanting. Procreation is our #1 goal, second should be in rearing our children with our TRUE traditional values. Especially today, when we are facing extinction as a race. We must not allow our children to continue to fall into the Semitic cultural trap, a trap that was devised and perfected a long time ago to destroy the unity of family bond, and within this bond the working together of both male and female for a stronger family and by extension, race. Our men and women have, before the Christian influence, worked together in all aspects of life. No one was ever denied a position, high or low, based on their gender. No one, not even the Gods… and this is what made us stronger. Today we can plainly see that the effects of the Semitic “gender role” ideology the separation of the male and female that was forced upon our folk, has made us weaker as a family, as a folk and as a race.

Though women have played an integral part in the history of the discipline of anthropology, it was not until the early 1970’s that the field of anthropology and gender, or feminist anthropology emerged. Sex and gender roles have always been a vital part of any ethnographic study, but the contributors of this theory began to address the androcentric nature of anthropology itself. The substantial gap in information concerning the study of women was perceived as a male bias, a prejudice made more apparent because what little women-centered fieldwork was done received insufficient attention from the academic community. While anthropology was considered one of the more egalitarian fields of study, it was dominated by white, Western males who …show more content…
One of Slocum’s contemporaries, Eleanor Leacock (1922-1987) chose to differently analyze gender research, focusing on distinctions in power as it relates to society, the economy, and politics (2011: 397). She concentrated on North American natives and aboriginal Australians and their changing gender roles as the result of Western influence. Another feminist trend gave emphasis to gender identities, analyzing the ways in which race, class and gender converge. David Valentine, born in 1966, illustrates such an emphasis in his work which concerns the cross-cultural variations on the westernized concepts of gender identity and sexuality, by which we categorize sexual desire (2011:398). As evidenced by the variety of emphases within the theory, feminist anthropologists were fully committed to assessing all previously ignored facets of the subjugated female within numerous cultures worldwide.
Several decades ago the idea of women as subordinate was considered to be a universality by the aforementioned white, Western male anthropologists who lead the field.  Despite an anthropologist’s endeavor to be unbiased, the fact is these traditional anthropologists came from a culture where many aspects of human life were male dominant. Though many studied

Introduction
Gender is a key concept in the discipline of anthropology. Sex and gender are defined differently in anthropology, the former as grounded in perceived biological differences and the latter as the cultural constructions observed, performed, and understood in any given society, often based on those perceived biological differences. Throughout the 20th century and the rise of sociocultural anthropology, the meaning and significance of gender to the discipline has shifted. In early ethnographic studies, gender was often synonymous with kinship or family, and a monograph might include just a single chapter on women or family issues. Despite early female pioneers in the field, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s and the real rise of feminist anthropology that gender as a distinct area of theoretical and methodological interest took hold within the discipline. Women were no longer seen as a category of culture and society outside of the realm of the everyday. While some focused on divisions between the domestic and the public, feminist anthropologists and those interested in the study of gender began to challenge the simple “add women and stir” model of ethnography and sought to bring attention to structural inequalities, the role of economic disparities, global dimensions to gender politics, the role of language, sexuality and masculinity studies, and health and human rights. Gradually the most recent works in gender and anthropology came to encompass a wide range of perspectives that challenge Western or monolithic assumptions about women and the experience of gender. For example, non-Western writing on gender illustrates how varied the experience of feminism can be in contemporary contexts where religious beliefs, development experiences, and the very role of language can influence understandings of gender. The study of women, men, and the intersections of gender across cultures has become a key aspect of any holistic study or methodological approach in anthropology today.
Early Ethnography
Many early monographs in anthropology were grounded in perspectives determined by the interests of largely male ethnographers. Studies of women or the concept of gender were generally included in chapters or notes on family and kinship. With the work of pioneers such as Ruth Benedict (Benedict 2006) and Margaret Mead (Mead 2001a, Mead 2001b ), the study of gender in anthropology took a more central place. Particularly for Benedict, ethnographic studies of gender were grounded in culture and personality studies. For Mead, a student of Benedict, research dealt much more with biological versus cultural conditioning of individuals, particularly in the areas of male and female temperament and cultural constructions of male and female traits. Her work was one of the first to critique a universal assumption of biologically determined male or female traits or roles. As anthropology continued to broaden its scope and become a more comparative ethnological enterprise, studies grew that suggested that women and gender were topics not only worthy of study but also valuable for the new perspectives they yielded on the ubiquitous androcentric bias in the discipline and throughout early ethnography. Later ethnographies began to challenge the classic monographs and interpretations of gender and culture by situating women’s work at the center of anthropological study. Strathern 1990 and Weiner 1983 challenged the idea that only goods produced by men were imbued with cultural significance. Universal patriarchy and assumptions about women as gatherers and innate nurturers throughout history emerged in Sacks 1982 and Zihlman 1989. These studies are useful as they provided the foundation of later work in gender studies that more closely examined the ethnographic evidence, exploring and then returning to the question of whether female subordination was universal or largely a product of male observer bias and privilege. Challenges to early ethnography and the assumption that all women experienced gender similarly did emerge (and continue to) with the publication of Mohanty, et al. 1991, a collection that remains an essential starting point for the debates over the status of women in anthropology in non-Western contexts. As Western feminism grew and influenced anthropology, an equally essential aspect of the field has been the recognition of both differences between women (not simply between the sexes) and the necessity for recognition of different interpretations of gendered experience, not simply a homogenous one, which Mohanty’s book describes.
Benedict, Ruth. 2006. Patterns of culture. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.
Classic ethnography that emphasizes the role of culture in human behavior; a pioneer study in diversity, Benedict’s work is useful in considering those aspects of culture that have to do with psychological factors and gender development. Originally published in 1934.
Mead, Margaret. 2001a. Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilisation. New York: Harper Perennial.
A controversial study that builds on Mead’s earlier work in New Guinea, this ethnography explores the cultural construction of sexuality, tackling behaviors such as masturbation as situated within particular cultural contexts. It has been a highly debated text but remains a central point of discussion in the emergence of the study of gender as social construction. Originally published in 1930.
Mead, Margaret. 2001b. Sex and temperament in three primitive societies. New York: Harper Perennial.
This classic study of three cultures in New Guinea challenged the idea of fixed, sex-based masculine or feminine characteristics and set the stage for Mead’s lifelong study of the cultural construction of gender. Sets the stage for her later work Male and Female: A Study of the Sexes in a Changing World (Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin, 1941), a comparative study of these cultural differences in the United States and cross-culturally. Originally published in 1928.
Mohanty, Chandra Talpade, Ann Russo, and Lourdes Torres, eds. 1991. Third World women and the politics of feminism. Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press.
Includes essential articles that emerged from challenges by non-Western female scholars to a homogeneous and monolithic understanding of women cross-culturally. Mohanty’s article “Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses,” Feminist Review 30 (Fall 1988): 61–88 is a foundation for debate in the field over Eurocentric experiences of gender and liberation.
Sacks, Karen. 1982. Sisters and wives: The past and future of sexual equality. Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press.
This edition challenged some of the earlier ethnography that characterized women’s roles as inherently tied to sex differences across cultures. With a focus on modes of production and power difference, it offers more complex ways of understanding the myriad roles that women play in societies across cultures and history.
Strathern, Marilyn. 1990. The gender of the gift: Problems with women and problems with society in Melanesia. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.
In this book and later works, Strathern explores the complex meaning of gifting in society. Using Melanesia as the basis of a rich ethnographic account, Strathern’s classic text proves essential to feminist and anthropological understanding of gender and exchange.
Weiner, Annette. 1983. Women of value, men of renown: New perspectives in Trobriand exchange. Austin: Univ. of Texas Press.
One of the first ethnographers to re-examine the Trobrianders as discussed by Bronislaw Malinowski, Weiner suggests that women’s work was essential to Trobriand society, heralding a closer examination of women’s roles in society across the discipline.
Zihlman, Adrienne. 1989. Woman the gatherer: The role of women in early hominid evolution. In Gender and anthropology: Critical reviews for teaching and research. Edited by Sandra Morgan, 21–40. Washington, DC: American Anthropological Association.
A very useful and important challenge to archaeology and evolutionary sciences that presupposed fixed gender roles. Zihlman’s work is essential to the development of the study of gender within archaeology and feminist anthropology.

The Origin of Gender Roles

The year is 2017, and there are still closets for girls filled with pink and toy chests for boys filled with trucks. A reasonable wish for the future is to see clothing, colors, and toys as genderless. Before we can obliterate gender roles entirely, we must understand their origin.
The allocation of gender roles dates back to the Industrial Revolution, which started in the nineteenth century. The men worked with machines as farmers and apprentices, while the few employed women worked in factories and cottage industries. Men went to work every day to make money, while women managed the household. Sound familiar? Many of the stereotypes associated with being a female come from “ The Cult of True Womanhood ,” which is an idea that originated in 1820. The four facets of True Womanhood were piety, purity, submissiveness, and domesticity. These values carried into teachings from magazines and social/religious leaders, who told women that their value lied in their virginity and that education other than religion would detract from their femininity.
Masculinity came from the Victorian ideal of manhood, which is described as the “ Male Gender Role Identity .” The four topics branching out from the “Male Gender Role Identity” are called No Sissy Stuff, The Big Wheel, The Sturdy Oak, and Give ‘em Hell. According to the details of these topics, men were seen as strong, aggressive, successful, and seemingly immune to emotion. It was seen as controversial to even send boys to school because being well-behaved was a sign of femininity. Industrialization, exploration, and civil wars all laid out the foundation of modern masculinity as far back as the sixteenth century.
Gender roles began to become more specific at around the time of WWI. Before WWI, the stereotypical colors for boys and girls were switched. Little boys donned pink, while little girls wore blue. During the women’s liberation movement, girls refused to wear blue because of the color association. Instead of eradicating the stereotypes, blue became the color for boys instead. It wasn’t until around 1980 when gendered colors expanded from clothes to diapers, toys, and more. Video games were even considered gender neutral until they switched from the electronic aisle to the toy aisle. Since the toy aisles are sorted by gender, the video game companies had to pick a gender to market to. Lo and behold, video games are seen as a boy’s occupation. Since boys were seen as the more athletic sex, boys were told to wear shorts and pants. Since girls were not seen as athletic, they were told to wear dresses and skirts.
The roles and stereotypes that have been assigned for centuries all stem from the same rules laid out centuries ago. With a society that is constantly growing and changing, it is simply ridiculous to accept rules from as far back as the sixteenth century. While gender roles may have served a purpose during the Industrial Revolution, there is no place for them now in 2017.

Alright, I've got some search results here on the origins of gender roles. Let me try to make sense of this.

First, from Doc 1, which seems to be from an anthropology website, it explains that gender roles are social and cultural categories based on biological differences between sexes. It mentions that until the 1970s, few anthropologists focused on gender, but then feminist anthropology emerged to study women's situations and gender relations across cultures. The document also discusses how gender roles have been traditionally divided into masculine and feminine categories, with specific expectations for males and females, but notes that these roles have diversified over time.

It's interesting that the document talks about the "natural attitude" towards gender, where people assume that gender behavior is determined by biology and that there are only two genders, with one's gender being invariant and permanent. However, it also points out that biological sex isn't as straightforward as people think, with intersex conditions existing. Additionally, it mentions cases like the berdache in North American indigenous societies and the hijras in India, where there are third-gender categories, challenging the binary view of gender.

Cross-culturally, gender roles vary, and anthropology has shown that gender is a universal phenomenon, but its expressions differ widely. The document suggests that while gender is a cross-cultural phenomenon, the specific roles and expectations attributed to men and women vary significantly.

Moving on to Doc 2, which is from a website called Renegade Tribune, it presents a specific perspective on the origin of gender roles, linking their development to the introduction of the plow in agriculture around 4,000-6,000 BC in Mesopotamia. The author references a scientific essay that suggests a correlation between the adoption of the plow and the subjugation of women, as men took over plowing while women stayed at home. This division of labor led to cultural norms where women were seen as belonging in the home, while men ruled society.

The author also connects this historical development to religious texts, particularly the Judeo-Christian tradition, which portrays women as subordinate to men. The author argues that these ideologies have deep roots and have influenced European societies after the introduction of the plow and Christianity.

Furthermore, the document provides examples from European history and mythology to counter the idea that gender roles were always rigid and that women were subservient to men. It mentions instances where women held leadership positions, participated in warfare, and were revered for their wisdom and skills. Examples include the Sarmatians, where women participated in warfare, and the Iceni tribe led by Boudica in Britain.

The document also references Norse mythology and sagas, highlighting figures like Unnur djúpúðga from Laxdæla saga, who was a powerful and independent woman who led migrations and managed her own affairs. It also mentions the role of seidr, a form of shamanism, which was considered unmanly for men but was practiced by women, although gods like Odin also practiced it.

Overall, the author argues that in pre-Christian European societies, men and women worked together, shared responsibilities, and had more egalitarian relationships, and that the introduction of Christianity and the plow led to the subjugation of women and the establishment of rigid gender roles.

Doc 3 appears to be an excerpt from an essay on anthropology and gender, likely from a university assignment. It discusses the emergence of feminist anthropology in the 1970s, addressing the androcentric bias in anthropology and the lack of attention to women's issues. The essay mentions key figures like Sally Slocum and Eleanor Leacock, who focused on different aspects of gender research, such as power relations and cross-cultural variations in gender identity and sexuality.

The essay acknowledges the variety of emphases within feminist anthropology and notes that despite anthropology being considered an egalitarian field, it was dominated by white, Western males who imposed their biases in their studies. The rise of feminist anthropology aimed to correct this imbalance by centering women's experiences and challenging the universal assumptions about gender roles.

Doc 4 is from Oxford Bibliographies and provides an overview of gender studies in anthropology. It traces the development of gender as a key concept in anthropology, from early ethnographies where gender was often synonymous with kinship to the emergence of feminist anthropology in the 1970s and 1980s. The bibliography highlights how feminist anthropologists challenged the "add women and stir" approach to ethnography and instead sought to explore structural inequalities, economic disparities, global dimensions of gender politics, language, masculinity studies, health, and human rights.

The document also mentions the importance of non-Western perspectives in gender studies, showing the diversity of feminist experiences worldwide and how religious beliefs, development contexts, and language influence understandings of gender. Overall, it underscores the centrality of gender studies in contemporary anthropology.

Lastly, Doc 5 is from Affinity Magazine and discusses the origin of gender roles, tracing them back to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. The author explains how during this period, men worked in factories and farms, while women managed the household, reflecting the "Cult of True Womanhood" that emphasized piety, purity, submissiveness, and domesticity.

The article also touches on the Victorian ideal of manhood, which valued strength, aggression, success, and emotional stoicism. It notes how colors associated with genders have changed over time, with pink originally being for boys and blue for girls, but these associations flipped around the time of WWI.

The author argues that gender roles established during the Industrial Revolution are outdated and no longer applicable in the modern world, advocating for a future where clothing, colors, and toys are gender-neutral.

Reflecting on all these documents, it's clear that gender roles have deep historical and cultural roots, with significant variations across different societies and time periods. The introduction of agriculture and specific technologies like the plow seems to have played a role in shaping gender roles, as suggested in Doc 2. Religious and cultural norms have also reinforced these roles, with some traditions promoting more egalitarian relationships between genders, while others have institutionalized gender hierarchies.

Anthropological studies, as discussed in Docs 1, 3, and 4, have been crucial in challenging the notion that gender roles are universal or biologically determined, highlighting instead their cultural construction and variability. The emergence of feminist anthropology has been particularly important in centering women's experiences and questioning the androcentric biases in the discipline.

In contemporary society, there is a growing recognition of the need to move beyond traditional gender roles and to promote more inclusive and equitable understandings of gender. This is reflected in calls for gender-neutral toys, clothing, and societal expectations, as seen in Doc 5.

In conclusion, the origins of gender roles are complex and multifaceted, involving biological, cultural, economic, and historical factors. Understanding their evolution and impact is essential for fostering more inclusive and just societies.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Gender roles have deep historical and cultural roots, shaped by factors such as agriculture, religion, and cultural norms. Anthropological studies have highlighted their cultural construction and variability, challenging universal assumptions and promoting more inclusive understandings of gender.}} \]
