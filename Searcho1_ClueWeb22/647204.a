Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects sea levels. I know that climate change is a big topic, and sea levels are rising, but I'm not exactly sure how one causes the other. Maybe I should start by understanding what climate change is and then see its connection to sea levels.

First off, climate change refers to long-term alterations in statistical distributions of weather patterns over multiple decades or longer. It's primarily driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming.

Now, how does this relate to sea levels? Well, one direct effect of increased global temperatures is thermal expansion of seawater. As water warms, it expands, which increases the volume of the oceans, leading to higher sea levels. Additionally, warmer temperatures cause polar ice caps and glaciers to melt. The melted water from these ice sources flows into the oceans, further increasing their volume and thus raising sea levels.

Hmm, so there are at least two main ways climate change affects sea levels: thermal expansion and melting of ice. Maybe there are other factors as well. Let me think about this.

Another possible factor could be changes in precipitation patterns. With climate change, some areas might experience increased rainfall, which could lead to more water runoff into the oceans. However, I'm not sure how significant this effect is compared to thermal expansion and ice melt.

Also, there's the concept of ocean currents and circulation patterns. Climate change could alter these patterns, potentially affecting sea levels in specific regions. For example, changes in the Gulf Stream could influence sea levels along the eastern coast of the United States.

Wait a minute, I recall that in some places, land itself is sinking or rising due to geological processes, which can affect local sea levels. This is known as land subsidence or uplift. So, while global sea levels are rising due to climate change, local variations can be influenced by these geological factors.

Maybe I should look into some specific examples. For instance, in cities like Miami, which are already experiencing flooding during high tides, both sea-level rise and land subsidence are likely contributing factors.

Furthermore, extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, can also impact sea levels. Storm surges from hurricanes, for example, can cause temporary but significant increases in sea levels, leading to coastal flooding.

I should also consider the long-term projections for sea-level rise. Scientists have been modeling future scenarios based on different emissions pathways. From what I've read, if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, sea levels could rise by over a meter by the end of this century. That would have catastrophic implications for coastal communities and ecosystems.

But, to get a better grasp of the science behind sea-level rise, maybe I should look up some specific data or studies on the topic. Perhaps there are more detailed explanations or additional factors that I haven't considered yet.

Let me try conducting a search to find more information.

How is sea level rise related to climate change?
How is sea level rise related to climate change?
A warming climate can cause seawater to expand and ice over land to melt, both of which can cause a rise in sea level.

Many  people are interested in climate change and how a changing climate will affect the ocean. With the majority of Americans living in coastal states, rising  water levels can have potentially large impacts. Global tidal records from 1900 to 1990 show an estimated four to five inch rise in global mean sea level. Then, in the 25 years from 1990 to 2015, this global tide gauge network showed global sea level rising three inches, agreeing with measures by satellite altimeters taken since 1992. Currently, sea level is rising about one-eighth of an inch per year but is projected to rise in the future. By 2100, sea levels may rise another one to eight feet .
Sea level can rise by two different mechanisms with  respect to climate change. First, as the oceans warm due to an increasing  global temperature, seawater expands—taking up more space in the ocean basin  and causing a rise in water level. The second mechanism is the melting of ice  over land, which then adds water to the ocean.
Global sea level trends and relative sea level trends are different measurements. Just as the surface of the Earth is not flat, the surface of the ocean is also not flat—in other words, the sea surface is not changing at the same rate globally. Sea level rise at specific locations may be more or less than the global average due to many local factors: subsidence, upstream flood control, erosion, regional ocean currents, variations in land height, and whether the land is still rebounding from the compressive weight of Ice Age glaciers.
Sea level is primarily measured using tide stations and satellite laser altimeters. Tide stations around the globe tell us what is happening at a local level—the height of the water as measured along the coast relative to a specific point on land. Satellite measurements provide us with the average height of the entire ocean. Taken together, these tools tell us how our ocean sea levels are changing over time.

Sea Level Rise
Sea levels around the world are rising because of climate change. As humans burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, which warm the Earth and the oceans. Because water expands as it warms, the oceans are rising higher as they heat up. Climate change is also melting glaciers and ice sheets, adding more water to the oceans.
Worldwide, sea levels have gone up roughly eight to nine inches in the last century, and sea levels in some places have gone up much more than that. 1 In the past two decades, sea level rise has been speeding up as more ice and glaciers melt. 2
Even if humans significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions, we can still expect one to two feet of additional sea level rise by the end of the century because of past emissions. 3 But to a certain extent, how much the sea level continues to rise beyond that is up to us—and how much we keep burning fossil fuels.
How does sea level rise affect us?
The rate of sea level rise in a particular place depends on a number of factors, including ocean currents, the movement of the Earth’s crust, and whether coastal land is rising or sinking. The eastern United States is one example of a sea level rise hot spot, where the ocean along some coastal cities is already a foot and a half higher than it was before the industrial revolution. 4
We can already see how sea level rise is affecting coastal areas. For example, cities like Norfolk, Virginia and Venice are seeing many more high tide (or “sunny day”) floods, which damage roads, sewer systems and other infrastructure, than they used to. 5,6
Sea level rise is also making hurricanes and other storms more damaging—and more deadly. The high winds from hurricanes push a wall of water, known as a “storm surge,” toward shore. Sea level rise gives those waves a head start, propelling them further inland.
Scientists warn that, depending on how much sea levels continue to rise, certain islands and coastal cities could go underwater. This is especially concerning because over 10% of the world’s population lives in coastal areas that are less than ten meters (about 33 feet) above sea level 7 —meaning sea level rise could displace tens to hundreds of millions of people. Sea level rise also threatens to flood large areas of farmland in countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Egypt, and make freshwater in some areas too salty to drink.
Preparing for sea level rise
If sea levels rise a little bit, people living in some coastal areas can, to a certain extent, adapt. Some coastal communities are doing this by building or fortifying sea walls or seawater pumping systems, and raising roads and other critical infrastructure. Coastal regions can also restore wetlands and other coastal ecosystems that act as natural storm buffers, and limit new development in at-risk areas.
But sea level rise, combined with worsening storms and erosion, has already rendered certain coastal areas uninhabitable. The southwestern Louisiana peninsula of Isle de Jean Charles is one such place, where community leaders are working to resettle residents inland. 8
As sea levels continue to rise, coastal communities around the world will likely face similar hard choices. Experts are concerned that poorer communities, or poorer people living within wealthier areas, will not have the money and other resources needed to safely relocate. That’s why leaders from some of these areas, like the island nation of Kiribati, argue that wealthier nations that are most responsible for causing climate change should help fund the resettlement of people pushed from their homes by sea level rise.

Sea-level rise (SLR) due to climate
            change is a serious global threat: the scientific evidence
            is now overwhelming. The rate of global sea level rise was
            faster from 1993 to 2003, about 3.1 mm per year, as compared
            to the average rate of 1.8 mm per year from 1961 to 2003
            (IPCC, 2007); and significantly higher than the average rate
            of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/yr increase recorded by geological data
            over the last 3,000 years. Anthropogenic warming and SLR
            will continue for centuries due to the time scales
            associated with climate processes and feedbacks, even if
            greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilized. This
            paper reviews the scientific literature to date on climate
            change and sea level rise. There appears to be a consensus
            across studies that global sea level is projected to rise
            during the 21st century at a greater rate than during the
            period 1961 to 2003 and unanimous agreement that SLR will
            not be geographically uniform. Ocean thermal expansion is
            projected to contribute significantly, and land ice will
            increasingly lose mass at an accelerated rate. But most
            controversial are the mass balance loss estimates of the
            Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets and what the yet
            un-quantified dynamic processes will imply in terms of SLR.
            Recent evidence on the vulnerability of Greenland and west
            Antarctic ice sheets to climate warming raises the alarming
            possibility of SLR by one meter or more by the end of the
            21st century.

Global climate change and sea-level rise
Climate and sea levels are changing as a result of human activity and will continue to change into the future.

At a glance
Earth’s climate has changed over the past century due to the unprecedented scale and speed at which greenhouse gases have been added to the atmosphere by human activities.
Even if all emissions from human activities suddenly stopped, the climate would continue to change. This is because the oceans, which store heat, take many decades to adjust.
Under a scenario with high atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (RCP8.5), we estimate that global temperatures by 2081-2100 will increase by between 2.6 and 4.8°C compared to 1986-2005. Under a low greenhouse gas scenario (RCP2.6) the increase is between 0.3 and 1.7°C.
Warming is expected to be accompanied by changes in extreme events including more severe heatwaves, storminess, droughts and floods.
Global sea levels have risen and will continue to rise. We estimate that the increase by 2081-2100, compared to 1986-2005, will be 45-82 cm for the high greenhouse gas scenario, and 26-55 cm for the low greenhouse gas scenario.
Extreme high sea level events will occur more frequently in future, increasing the risks of flooding and erosion in coastal areas.
Ocean waters are becoming more acid due to increases in CO 2, and this trend will continue.
Main text
Earth’s climate has changed in the past and will continue to change in response to the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as a result of human activities (Read more about Causes of climate change ).
Future climate changes are expected to include a warmer atmosphere, a warmer and more acidic ocean, higher sea levels, changes in rain and snowfall patterns and changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events. These changes are expected to have impacts on ecosystems, coastal systems, fire regimes, food and water security, health, infrastructure and human security.
Global changes in temperature
Computers models that simulate the climate system make it possible to estimate future changes in global temperatures (see Understanding climate scenarios ). Changes over the course of the 21 st century are summarised in Table 1.

By 2081-2100, projections show increases in the range 0.3°C to 4.8°C relative to the period 1986-2005. The range is broad because changes in temperature are estimated for four different greenhouse gas scenarios. These are the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), explained in Understanding climate scenarios. Following the high scenario RCP8.5 could lead to a global average warming of 2.6°C to 4.8°C by the end of the century, whereas if we reduce our emissions to follow the RCP6.0 pathway or better, the temperature increase, and the associated changes in our climate, will be lower.
Figure 1 shows how global temperatures are expected to change over the 21 st century for two of the RCPs, the high greenhouse gas scenario RCP8.5, and the low scenario RCP2.6.

Figure 1: Global average surface temperature change relative to 1986-2005, from climate models. Source: IPCC 2013 (Fifth Assessment Report, Working Group 1, Summary for Policy Makers, Figure 7a).
Changes in temperature will not be regionally uniform. Some parts of the world will experience larger temperature increases than others. Figure 2 shows maps of the change in temperature expected by 2081-2100 for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. The warming is greatest over continents and at high latitudes, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.
The reason why warming is greatest at high latitudes is because of ice melt. The highly reflective ice surface is replaced by a darker soil surface which absorbs more sunlight, leading to more warming and more melting – a positive feedback.  The effect is less over Antarctica where very low present-day temperatures limit the amount of ice melt expected to occur with the projected warming by 2100.
Warming is greatest over the continents primarily because there is no mechanism, such as ocean currents, to take the heat away from the surface.

Avoiding ‘dangerous’ climate change
Limiting global warming to no more than 2°C, and possibly a lower threshold, has become the policy target to avoid future dangerous climate change.  The 21 st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015 led to the Paris Agreement, which states:
“This Agreement … aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change … by … holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 o C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 o C above pre-industrial levels” Paris Agreement Article 1
Table 1 and Figure 1 show that an increase of at least 2°C is expected for both the medium-high greenhouse gas scenario (RCP6.0, orange in Figure 1) and high greenhouse gas scenario (RCP8.5, red in Figure 1). Only RCP2.6 meets the policy target of 2 o C at 2100 with any certainty.
Global changes in precipitation
Changes in precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) are much more difficult for climate models to simulate than temperature. This is because rainfall is more variable in space and in time, and because the processes that build clouds and cause rainfall are small-scale (smaller than the grid square of a climate model, explained in Understanding climate scenarios ).  Figure 3 shows maps of model estimates of future precipitation change.
Figure 3 shows that, under RCP8.5, high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by 2100.  In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, whereas many mid-latitude wet regions will see an increase by the end of the century. Under RCP2.6 the changes are generally small, less than 10 percent.
T2I2_Figure-3.jpg

Global changes in sea level
Sea level has risen by about 19 cm since the early 20 th century and will continue doing so for centuries, even if greenhouse gas emissions are dramatically reduced.  The IPCC Fifth Assessment estimates for future sea-level rise are shown in Table 1 and Figure 4. These indicate, by 2081-2100, a global average increase in sea level of 26-55 cm for RCP2.6, and 45-82 cm for RCP8.5 (compared to 1986-2005 levels).
The major causes of sea-level rise are warming of the oceans causing thermal expansion of seawater, together with loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets. These two explain about 87% of the observed rise since the early 1970s (39% from thermal expansion, 48% from ice loss). Looking forward, increasing contributions are expected from melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. (For more technical details see the Information Manual: Understanding sea-level rise ).

The change in sea level that is experienced at a particular place is influenced by factors in addition to global sea-level rise. These include the geology of the coast (how soft the sediments are, and how prone to erosion) as well as isostatic adjustment – the vertical movement of the land in response to loading and unloading due to processes such as erosion, deposition, water loading, desiccation, ice accumulation, and deglaciation.  Large-scale systems such as El Niño events can also affect sea levels over timescales of a few years, for example sea levels rise during El Niño and fall during La Niña around Australia.

Changes in extreme events
Extreme events (heatwaves, droughts, floods and windstorms etc.) will change in their frequency and severity in future as a result of climate change.  Some expected changes (in order of decreasing confidence) include the following.
Heatwaves will become more intense, more frequent and of longer duration.
Extreme high sea level events are very likely to become more common, through a combination of sea-level rise and storm surge.
Heavy rainfall events, and associated flooding, are likely to occur more frequently, especially in the mid-latitudes and wet tropical regions.
The intensity and duration of droughts are likely to increase.
Intense tropical cyclone activity may become more common in the western North Pacific and North Atlantic.
Looking beyond 2100
Temperature increases will not cease in 2100, simply because the majority of graphs such as Figure 1 only go to that date.  Warming is projected to continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6.
Even if we suddenly stopped emitting greenhouse gases, warming and sea level rise would continue for many decades. This is because of the climate commitment, due primarily to the role of the oceans in climate change.  Because ocean water can move vertically and so store heat at depth, it takes the oceans many decades to adjust to warming at the surface and achieve a new equilibrium. This means that some of the atmospheric warming, ice melt and thermal expansion of the oceans due to increased greenhouse gases emissions is delayed, also by decades.

Sea level rise
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the current and projected rise in the world's average sea level associated with climate change. For sea level rise in general, see Marine transgression.

Satellite observations of sea level rise from 1993 to 2021.
Tide gauge measurements show that the current global sea level rise began at the start of the 20th century. Between 1901 and 2018, the globally averaged sea level rose by 15–25 cm (6–10 in). [1] More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements reveal an accelerating rise of 7.5 cm (3 in) from 1993 to 2017, [2] : 1554  for an average  rate of 31 mm (1 1 ⁄ 4 in) per decade. This acceleration is due mostly to climate change, which heats the ocean and melts the land-based ice sheets and glaciers.[3] Between 1993 and 2018, the thermal expansion of water contributed 42% to sea level rise; melting of temperate glaciers, 21%; Greenland, 15%; and Antarctica, 8%. [2] : 1576  Climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st century, with the latest measurements saying the sea levels are rising by 3.7 mm per year. [4]
Projecting future sea level is challenging, due to the complexity of many aspects of the climate system and to long time lags in sea level reactions to Earth temperature changes. As climate research into past and present sea levels leads to improved computer models, projections have consistently increased.  In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected a high-emissions estimate of 60 cm (2 ft) through 2099, [5] but their 2014 report raised the high-emissions estimate to about 90 cm (3 ft). [6] A number of later studies have concluded that a global sea level rise of 200–270 cm (6 ft 7 in – 8 ft 10 in) this century is "physically plausible". [7] [2] [8] A conservative estimate of the long-term projections is that each Celsius degree of temperature rise triggers a sea level rise of approximately 2.3 meters (4.2 ft/degree Fahrenheit) over a period of two millennia (2,000 years): an example of climate inertia.[9] In February 2021, a paper published in Ocean Science suggested that past projections for global sea level rise by 2100 reported by the IPCC were likely conservative, and that sea levels will rise more than previously expected. [10]
The sea level will not rise uniformly everywhere on Earth, and it will even drop slightly in some locations, such as the Arctic.[11] Local factors include tectonic effects and subsidence of the land, tides, currents and storms. Sea level rises can affect human populations considerably in coastal and island regions. [12] Widespread coastal flooding is expected with several degrees of warming sustained for millennia. [13] Further effects are higher storm-surges and more dangerous tsunamis, displacement of populations, loss and degradation of agricultural land and damage in cities. [14] [15] [16] Natural environments like marine ecosystems are also affected, with fish, birds and plants losing parts of their habitat. [17]
Societies can adapt to sea level rise in three different ways: implement managed retreat, accommodate coastal change, or protect against sea level rise through hard-construction practices like seawalls or soft approaches such as dune rehabilitation and beach nourishment. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand, but at other times choices have to be made among different strategies. [18] For some human environments, such as so called sinking cities, adaptation to sea level rise may be compounded by other environmental issues such as subsidence. Natural ecosystems typically adapt to rising sea levels by moving inland; however, they might not always be able to do so, due to natural or artificial barriers. [19]

Past changes[edit]
Changes in sea level since the end of the last glacial episode
Understanding past sea level is an important guide to current and future changes. In the recent geological past, thermal expansion from increased temperatures and changes in land ice are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time that the Earth was 2 °C (3.6 °F) warmer than pre-industrial temperatures was 120 thousand years ago, when warming because of changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit caused the Eemian interglacial; sea levels during that warmer interglacial were at least 5 m (16 ft) higher than now. [20] The Eemian warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years, and the magnitude of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. [21] : 1139  Further into the past, a report by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research states that, around three million years ago, levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere similar to today's levels increased temperature by two to three degrees Celsius and melted one third of Antarctica's ice sheets. This in turn caused sea-levels to rise 20 metres over their present values. [22]
Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the sea level has risen by more than 125 metres (410 ft), with rates varying from less than a mm/year during the pre-industrial era to 40+ mm/year when major ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia melted. Rapid disintegration of these ice sheets led to so called 'meltwater pulses ', periods during which sea level rose rapidly. The rate of rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before present; the sea level was then almost constant in the last 2,500 years, before the recent rising trend that started at the end of the 19th century or in the beginning of the 20th. [23]
Measurement[edit]
A stripe graphic assigns ranges of annual sea level measurements to respective colors, with the baseline white color starting in 1880 and darker blues denoting progressively greater sea level rise. [24]
Sea level changes can be driven either by variations in the amount of water in the oceans, the volume of the ocean or by changes of the land compared to the sea surface. Over a consistent time period, conducting assessments can source contributions to sea level rise and provide early indications of change in trajectory. This type of surveillance can inform plans of prevention. [25] The different techniques used to measure changes in sea level do not measure exactly the same level. Tide gauges can only measure relative sea level, whilst satellites can also measure absolute sea level changes. [26] To get precise measurements for sea level, researchers studying the ice and the oceans on our planet factor in ongoing deformations of the solid Earth, in particular due to landmasses still rising from past ice masses retreating, and also the Earth's gravity and rotation.[2]
Satellites[edit]
Jason-1 continued the sea surface measurements started by TOPEX/Poseidon. It was followed by the Ocean Surface Topography Mission on Jason-2, and by Jason-3
Since the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, an overlapping series of altimetric satellites has been continuously recording the sea level and its changes. [27] Those satellites can measure the hills and valleys in the sea caused by currents and detect trends in their height. To measure the distance to the sea surface, the satellites send a microwave pulse which reflects on the ocean's surface and record the time it takes to return. Microwave radiometers correct the additional delay caused by water vapor in the atmosphere. Combining these data with the precisely known location of the spacecraft determines the sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch). [28] Current rates of sea level rise from satellite altimetry have been estimated to be 3.0 ± 0.4 millimetres (1 ⁄ 8 ± 1 ⁄ 64 in) per year for the period 1993–2017. [29] Earlier satellite measurements were previously slightly at odds with tide gauge measurements. A small calibration error for the Topex/Poseidon satellite was eventually identified as having caused a slight overestimation of the 1992–2005 sea levels, which masked in the satellite measurements the ongoing sea level rise acceleration that was visible in the tide gauge timeseries. [30]

The visualization is based on data collected from the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 satellites. Blue regions are where sea level has gone down, and orange/red regions are where sea level has gone up. [31]
Satellites are useful for measuring regional variations in sea level, such as the substantial rise between 1993 and 2012 in the western tropical Pacific. This sharp rise has been linked to increasing trade winds, which occur when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) change from one state to the other. [32] The PDO is a basin-wide climate pattern consisting of two phases, each commonly lasting 10 to 30 years, while the ENSO has a shorter period of 2 to 7 years. [33]
Tide gauges[edit]
Between 1993 and 2018, the mean sea level has risen across most of the world ocean (blue colors). [34]
The global network of tide gauges is another important source of sea-level observations. Compared to the satellite record, this record has major spatial gaps but covers a much longer period of time. [35] Coverage of tide gauges started primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, with data for the Southern Hemisphere remaining scarce up to the 1970s. [35] The longest running sea-level measurements, NAP or Amsterdam Ordnance Datum established in 1675, are recorded in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.[36] In Australia record collection is also quite extensive, including measurements by an amateur meteorologist beginning in 1837 and measurements taken from a sea-level benchmark struck on a small cliff on the Isle of the Dead near the Port Arthur convict settlement in 1841. [37]
This network was used, in combination with satellite altimeter data, to establish that global mean sea-level rose 19.5 cm (7 3 ⁄ 4 in) between 1870 and 2004 at an average rate of about 1.44 mm/yr (1.7 mm/yr during the 20th century). [38] Data collected by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia show that the global mean sea level currently rises by 3.2 mm (1 ⁄ 8 in) per year, at double the average 20th century rate. [39] [40] This is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which predicted that sea level rise would accelerate in response to climate change.
Some regional differences are also visible in the tide gauge data. Some of the recorded regional differences are due to differences in the actual sea level, while other are due to vertical land movements. In Europe for instance, considerable variation is found because some land areas are rising while others are sinking. Since 1970, most tidal stations have measured higher seas, but sea levels along the northern Baltic Sea have dropped due to post-glacial rebound.[41]
Contributions[edit]
Earth lost 28 trillion tonnes of ice between 1994 and 2017, with melting grounded ice (ice sheets and glaciers) raising the global sea level by 34.6 ±3.1 mm. [42] The rate of ice loss has risen by 57% since the 1990s−from 0.8 to 1.2 trillion tonnes per year. [42]
The three main reasons warming causes global sea level to rise are: oceans expand, ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall, and glaciers at higher altitudes also melt. Sea level rise since the start of the 20th century has been dominated by retreat of glaciers and expansion of the ocean, but the contributions of the two large ice sheets (Greenland and Antarctica) are expected to increase in the 21st century. [3] The ice sheets store most of the land ice (∼99.5%), with a sea-level equivalent (SLE) of 7.4 m (24 ft 3 in) for Greenland and 58.3 m (191 ft 3 in) for Antarctica. [2]
Each year about 8 mm (5 ⁄ 16 in) of precipitation (liquid equivalent) falls on the ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, mostly as snow, which accumulates and over time forms glacial ice. Much of this precipitation began as water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. Some of the snow is blown away by wind or disappears from the ice sheet by melt or by sublimation (directly changing into water vapor). The rest of the snow slowly changes into ice. This ice can flow to the edges of the ice sheet and return to the ocean by melting at the edge or in the form of icebergs. If precipitation, surface processes and ice loss at the edge balance each other, sea level remains the same. However scientists have found that ice is being lost, and at an accelerating rate. [43] [44]
Ocean heating[edit]
Main article: Ocean heat content
Ocean heat content (OHC) between 1957 and 2017, NOAA
Most of the additional heat trapped in the Earth's climate system by climate change is stored in oceans. They store more than 90% of the extra heat and act as a buffer against the effects of climate change. The heat needed to raise an average temperature increase of the entire world ocean by 0.01 °C would increase the atmospheric temperature by approximately 10 °C. [45] Thus, a small change in the mean temperature of the ocean represents a very large change in the total heat content of the climate system.
When the ocean gains heat, the water expands and sea level rises.  The amount of expansion varies with both water temperature and pressure.  For each degree, warmer water and water under great pressure (due to depth) expand more than cooler water and water under less pressure. [21] : 1161  This means that cold Arctic Ocean water will expand less compared to warm tropical water. Because different climate models have slightly different patterns of ocean heating, they do not agree fully on the predictions for the contribution of ocean heating on sea level rise. [46] Heat gets transported into deeper parts of the ocean by winds and currents, and some of it reaches depths of more than 2,000 m (6,600 ft). [47]
Considering an increase in average global temperature of 2 °C above preindustrial levels, and not considering the potential contributions from ice-sheet processes with limited agreement (low confidence) among modeling approaches, the probability of exceeding 0.5 m rise of sea level globally (0.7 m along the CONUS coastline) by 2100 is about 50%. With 3°–5 °C of warming under high emissions pathways, this probability rises to >80% to >99%. [48]
Antarctica[edit]
The Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica's largest, is about the size of France and up to several hundred metres thick.
The large volume of ice on the Antarctic continent stores around 70% of the world's fresh water. [49] The Antarctic ice sheet mass balance is affected by snowfall accumulations, and ice discharge along the periphery. Under the influence of global warming, melt at the base of the ice sheet increases. Simultaneously, the capacity of the atmosphere to carry precipitation increases with temperature so that precipitation, in the form of snowfall, increases in global and regional models. The additional snowfall causes increased ice flow of the ice sheet into the ocean, so that the mass gain due to snowfall is partially compensated. [50] Snowfall increased over the last two centuries, but no increase was found in the interior of Antarctica over the last four decades. [51] Based on changes of Antarctica's ice mass balance over millions of years, due to natural climate fluctuations, researchers concluded that the sea-ice acts as a barrier for warmer waters surrounding the continent. Consequently, the loss of sea ice is a major driver of the instability of the entire ice sheet. [51]
Processes around an Antarctic ice shelf
Different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change are in good agreement, and combining methods leads to more certainty about how the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the Antarctic Peninsula evolve. [52] A 2018 systematic review study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatons (Gt) per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002, but has accelerated to an average of 220 Gt per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017. [53] Most of the melt comes from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, but the Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctic Ice Sheet also contribute. The sea-level rise due to Antarctica has been estimated to be 0.25 mm per year from 1993 to 2005, and 0.42 mm per year from 2005 to 2015. All datasets generally show an acceleration of mass loss from the Antarctic ice-sheet, but with year-to-year variations. [2]
A May 2021 study projected that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C would reduce the land ice contribution to sea level rise by 2100 from 25 cm to 13 cm (from 10 to 6 in.) compared to current mitigation pledges, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level rise contribution. [54] The physical uncertainty of the Antarctic contribution was more significant than the uncertainty due to the choice of mitigation pathway. [54]
East Antarctica[edit]
The world's largest potential source of sea level rise is the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 53.3 m (174 ft 10 in). [55] The ice sheet has historically been considered to be relatively stable and has therefore attracted less scientific attention and observations compared to West Antarctica. [51] A combination of satellite observations of its changing volume, flow and gravitational attraction with modelling of its surface mass balance suggests the overall mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was relatively steady or slightly positive for much of the period 1992–2017. [53] A 2019 study, however, using different methodology, concluded that East Antarctica is losing significant amounts of ice mass. The lead scientist Eric Rignot told CNN: "melting is taking place in the most vulnerable parts of Antarctica ... parts that hold the potential for multiple meters of sea level rise in the coming century or two." [51]
Methods agree that the Totten Glacier has lost ice in recent decades in response to ocean warming [56] [57] and possibly a reduction in local sea ice cover. [58] Totten Glacier is the primary outlet of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, a major ice reservoir in East Antarctica that could rapidly retreat due to hydrological processes. [59] The global sea level potential of 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) flowing through Totten Glacier alone is of similar magnitude to the entire probable contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. [60] The other major ice reservoir on East Antarctica that might rapidly retreat is the Wilkes Basin which is subject to marine ice sheet instability.[59] Ice loss from these outlet glaciers is possibly compensated by accumulation gains in other parts of Antarctica. [53]
West Antarctica[edit]
A graphical representation of how warm waters, and the Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability processes are affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
Even though East Antarctica contains the largest potential source of sea level rise, it is West Antarctica that currently experiences a net outflow of ice, causing sea levels to rise. Using different satellites from 1992 to 2017 shows melt is increasing significantly over this period. Antarctica as a whole has caused a total of 7.6 ± 3.9 mm (19 ⁄ 64 ± 5 ⁄ 32 in) of sea level rise. Considering the mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet which was relatively steady, the major contributor was West Antarctica. [53] Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment may have contributed to this increase. [61] In contrast to East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, temperatures on West Antarctica have increased significantly with a trend between 0.08 °C (0.14 °F) per decade and 0.96 °C (1.73 °F) per decade between 1976 and 2012. [62]
Multiple types of instability are at play in West Antarctica. One is the Marine Ice Sheet Instability, where the bedrock on which parts of the ice sheet rest is deeper inland. [63] This means that when a part of the ice sheet melts, a thicker part of the ice sheet is exposed to the ocean, which may lead to additional ice loss. Secondly, melting of the ice shelves, the floating extensions of the ice sheet, leads to a process named the Marine Ice Cliff Instability. Because they function as a buttress to the ice sheet, their melt leads to additional ice flow (see animation one minute into video). Melt of ice shelves is accelerated when surface melt creates crevasses and these crevasses cause fracturing. [64]
The Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers have been identified to be potentially prone to these processes, since both glaciers bedrock topography gets deeper farther inland, exposing them to more warm water intrusion into the grounding zone.[65] [66] With continued melt and retreat they contribute to raising global sea levels. [67] [68] The Thwaites glacier itself will cause a rise of sea level by 65 centimeters if it will completely collapse, but this can also destabilize other glaciers in west Antarctica. [69] [66] The Thwaites Ice Shelf can collapse in three to five years which can destabilize the entire Thwaites glacier.[70]
The melting of these 2 glaciers had accelerated at the beginning of the 21st century. It can destabilize the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the process will probably not be finished in this century. [71] Most of the bedrock underlying the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies well below sea level. [59] A rapid collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise sea level by 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in). [72] [73]
Greenland[edit]
Greenland 2007 melt, measured as the difference between the number of days on which melting occurred in 2007 compared to the average annual melting days from 1988 to 2006 [74]
Most ice on Greenland is part of the Greenland ice sheet which is 3 km (10,000 ft) at its thickest. The rest of the ice on Greenland is part of isolated glaciers and ice caps. The sources contributing to sea level rise from Greenland are from ice sheet melting (70%) and from glacier calving (30%). Dust, soot, and microbes and algae living on parts of the ice sheet further enhance melting by darkening its surface and thus absorbing more thermal radiation; these regions grew by 12% between 2000 and 2012, and are likely to expand further. [75] Average annual ice loss in Greenland more than doubled in the early 21st century compared to the 20th century. [76] Some of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers, such as Jakobshavn Isbræ and Kangerlussuaq Glacier, are flowing faster into the ocean. [77] [78]
A study published in 2017 concluded that Greenland's peripheral glaciers and ice caps crossed an irreversible tipping point around 1997, and will continue to melt. [79] [80] The Greenland ice sheet and its glaciers and ice caps are the largest contributor to sea level rise from land ice sources (excluding thermal expansion), combined accounting for 71 percent, or 1.32 mm per year during the 2012–2016 period. [81] [82]
A study published in 2020 estimated that the Greenland Ice Sheet had lost a total of 3,902 gigatons (Gt) of ice between 1992 and 2018, corresponding to a contribution to sea level rise of 10.8 mm. The sea-level rise due to the Greenland Ice Sheet has generally increased over time, rising from 0.07 mm per year between 1992 and 1997 to 0.68 mm per year between 2012 and 2017. [83]
Estimates on future contribution to sea level rise from Greenland range from 0.3 to 3 m (1 to 10 ft), for the year 2100. [75] By the end of the century, it can contribute 2-10 centimetres annually. [84] The contribution of the Greenland ice sheet on sea level over the next couple of centuries can be very high due to a self-reinforcing cycle (a so-called positive feedback ). After an initial period of melting, the height of the ice sheet will have lowered. As air temperature increases closer to the sea surface, more melt starts to occur. This melting may further be accelerated because the color of ice is darker while it is melting. There is a threshold in surface warming beyond which a partial or near-complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet occurs. [85] Different research has put this threshold value as low as 1 °C (2 °F), and definitely 4 °C (7 °F), above pre-industrial temperatures. [86] [21] : 1170  A 2021 analysis of sub-glacial sediment at the bottom of a 1.4 km Greenland ice core finds that the Greenland ice sheet melted away at least once during the last million year, and therefore strongly suggests that its tipping point is below the 2.5 °C maximum positive temperature excursion over that period. [87] [88]
Glaciers[edit]
Main article: Retreat of glaciers since 1850
Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. Still, mountain glaciers have contributed appreciably to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century. [89] The roughly 200,000 glaciers on earth are spread out across all continents. [90] Different glaciers respond differently to increasing temperatures. For instance, valley glaciers that have a shallow slope retreat under even mild warming. Every glacier has a height above which there is net gain in mass and under which the glacier loses mass. If that height changes a bit, this has large consequences for glaciers with a shallow slope. [91] : 345  Many glaciers drain into the ocean and ice loss can therefore increase when ocean temperatures increase. [90]
Observational and modelling studies of mass loss from glaciers and ice caps indicate a contribution to sea-level rise of 0.2-0.4 mm per year, averaged over the 20th century. [92] Over the 21st century, this is expected to rise, with glaciers contributing 7–24 cm (3– 9 1 ⁄ 2 in) to global sea levels. [21] : 1165  Glaciers contributed around 40% to sea-level rise during the 20th century, with estimates for the 21st century of around 30%. [2]
Sea ice[edit]
Sea ice melt contributes very slightly to global sea level rise. If the melt water from ice floating in the sea was exactly the same as sea water then, according to Archimedes' principle, no rise would occur. However melted sea ice contains less dissolved salt than sea water and is therefore less dense: in other words although the melted sea ice weighs the same as the sea water it was displacing when it was ice, its volume is still slightly greater. If all floating ice shelves and icebergs were to melt sea level would only rise by about 4 cm (1 1 ⁄ 2 in). [93]
Land water storage[edit]
Trends in land water storage from GRACE observations in gigatons per year, April 2002 to November 2014 (glaciers and ice sheets are excluded).
Humans impact how much water is stored on land. Building dams prevents large masses of water from flowing into the sea and therefore increases the storage of water on land. On the other hand, humans extract water from lakes, wetlands and underground reservoirs for food production leading to rising seas. Furthermore, the hydrological cycle is influenced by climate change and deforestation, which can lead to further positive and negative contributions to sea level rise. In the 20th century, these processes roughly balanced, but dam building has slowed down and is expected to stay low for the 21st century. [94] [21] : 1155 
Projections[edit]
Historical sea level reconstruction and projections up to 2100 published in 2017 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program for the Fourth National Climate Assessment. [95] RCP 2.6 is the scenario where emissions peak before 2020, RCP4.5 the one where they peak around 2040, and RCP8.5 the one where they keep increasing.
Different sea level rise projections for the 21st century
There are broadly two ways of modelling sea level rise and making future projections. In one approach, scientists use process-based modelling, where all relevant and well-understood physical processes are included in a global physical model. An ice-sheet model is used to calculate the contributions of ice sheets and a general circulation model is used to compute the rising sea temperature and its expansion. A disadvantage of this method is that not all relevant processes might be understood to a sufficient level, but it can predict non-linearities and long delays in the response which studies of the recent past will miss.
In the other approach, scientists use semi-empirical techniques that use geological data from the past to determine likely sea level responses to a warming world in addition to some basic physical modelling. [3] These semi-empirical sea level models rely on statistical techniques, using relationships between observed past (contributions to) global mean sea level and global mean temperature. [96] This type of modelling was partially motivated by most physical models in previous literature assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) having underestimated the amount of sea level rise compared to observations of the 20th century. [21]
Projections for the 21st century[edit]
In its fifth assessment report (2013) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated how much sea level is likely to rise in the 21st century based on different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  These projections are based on well-known factors which contribute to sea level rise, but exclude other processes which are less well understood. If countries make rapid cuts to emissions (the RCP 2.6 scenario), the IPCC deems it likely that the sea level will rise by 26–55 cm (10– 21 1 ⁄ 2 in) with a 67% confidence interval. If emissions remain very high, the IPCC projects sea level will rise by 52–98 cm (20 1 ⁄ 2 – 38 1 ⁄ 2 in). [21] In August 2020 scientists reported that observed ice-sheet losses in Greenland and Antarctica track worst-case scenarios of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report's sea-level rise projections. [97] [98] [99] [100]
Since the publication of the 2013 IPCC assessment, attempts have been made to include more physical processes and to develop models that can project sea level rise using paleoclimate data. This typically led to higher estimates of sea level rise. [64] [59] [101] For instance, a 2016 study led by Jim Hansen concluded that based on past climate change data, sea level rise could accelerate exponentially in the coming decades, with a doubling time of 10, 20 or 40 years, respectively, raising the ocean by several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years. [101] However, Greg Holland from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who reviewed the study, noted: "There is no doubt that the sea level rise, within the IPCC, is a very conservative number, so the truth lies somewhere between IPCC and Jim."[102]
In addition, one 2017 study's scenario, assuming high fossil fuel use for combustion and strong economic growth during this century, projects sea level rise of up to 132 cm (4 ft 4 in) on average — and an extreme scenario with as much as 189 cm (6 ft 2 1⁄ 2 in), by 2100. This could mean rapid sea level rise of up to 19 mm (3 ⁄ 4 in) per year by the end of the century. The study also concluded that the Paris climate agreement emissions scenario, if met, would result in a median 52 cm (20 1 ⁄ 2 in) of sea level rise by 2100. [103] [104]
The Fourth (2017) National Climate Assessment (NCA) of the United States found that it is very likely sea level will rise between 30 and 130 cm (1.0–4.3 feet) in 2100 compared to the year 2000. A rise of 2.4 m (8 feet) is physically possible under a high emission scenario but the authors were unable to say how likely. This worst-case scenario can only come about with a large contribution from Antarctica; a region that is difficult to model. [9]
The possibility of a collapse of the West-Antarctic ice sheet and subsequent rapid sea level rise was suggested back in the 1970s. [64] For instance, Mercer published a study in 1978 predicting that anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming and its potential effects on climate in the 21st century could cause a sea level rise of around 5 m (15 ft) from melting of the West Antarctic ice-sheet alone. [105] [64]
In 2019, a study projected that in low emission scenario, sea level will rise 30 centimeters by 2050 and 69 centimetres by 2100, relative to the level in 2000. In high emission scenario, it will be 34 cm by 2050 and 111 cm by 2100. There is the probability that the rise will be beyond 2 metres by 2100 in the high emission scenario, which will cause displacement of 187 million people.  Sea level rise anticipated for 2050 will generate an intense rise in the frequency of coastal flooding (four "moderate" flooding events per year in the US), despite the absence of storms and/or heavy rainfall. [106] [107] [108]
In September 2019 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report about the impact of climate change on the oceans including sea level rise. It found that if humanity will drastically reduce Greenhouse gas emission in the next decades the problem will be tough but manageable. If the rise in emission will continue the problem will become unmanageable. [109]
In February 2021, researchers suggested that past projections for global sea level rise by 2100 reported by the IPCC were likely conservative, and that sea levels will rise more than previously expected. [10]
According to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2021 in the very low-emissions scenario, by 2100 the sea level will rise by 28–55 centimetres, in the intermediate scenario by 44–76 centimetres and in the very high emissions scenario by 63–101 centimetres. Rise of approximately two metres cannot be ruled out in the very high emissions scenario. [110]
Long-term sea level rise[edit]
Further information: Long-term effects of global warming
Map of the Earth with a long-term 6-metre (20 ft) sea level rise represented in red (uniform distribution, actual sea level rise will vary regionally and local adaptation measures will also have an effect on local sea levels).
There is a widespread consensus among climate scientists that sea level rise lags well behind the temperature increase that triggers it, and that substantial long-term sea-level rise will continue for centuries to come even if the temperature stabilizes. [111] Models are able to reproduce paleo records of sea level rise, which provides confidence in their application to long-term future change. [21] : 1189 
Both the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica have tipping points for warming levels that could be reached before the end of the 21st century. Crossing such tipping points would mean that ice-sheet changes are potentially irreversible: a decrease to pre-industrial temperatures may not stabilize the ice sheet once the tipping point has been crossed. [112] Quantifying the exact temperature change for which this tipping point is crossed remains controversial. For Greenland, estimates roughly range between 1 and 4 °C (2 to 7 °F) above pre-industrial. [112] [21] As of 2020, the lower of these values has already been passed. A 2021 analysis of sub-glacial sediment at the bottom of a 1.4 km Greenland ice core finds that the Greenland ice sheet melted away at least once during the last million year. This strongly suggests that its tipping point is below the 2.5 °C maximum positive temperature excursion over that period, and is therefore within the lower half of its range of estimates. [87] [88] Melting of the Greenland ice sheet would contribute 4–7.5 m (13– 24 1 ⁄ 2 ft) of sea level rise over thousands of years. [13]
A 2013 study estimated that each degree of temperature rise translates to a 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) commitment to sea level rise within the next 2,000 years. [113] More recent research, especially into Antarctica, indicates that this is probably a conservative estimate and that the true long-term sea level rise might be higher. [9] Warming beyond the 2 °C (3.6 °F) target potentially leads to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from Antarctica. Continued carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise, over the next millennia, and the available fossil fuel on Earth is even enough to ultimately melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, causing about 58 m (190 ft) of sea level rise. [114] After 500 years, sea level rise from thermal expansion alone may have reached only half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within ranges of 0.5–2 m (1 1 ⁄ 2 – 6 1 ⁄ 2 ft). [115]
In the next 2,000 years the sea level is predicted to rise by 2–3 metres if the temperature rise will peak at 1.5 degrees, by 2–6 metres if it will peak at 2 degrees and by 19–22 metres if it will peak at 5 degrees. [110] : SPM-28  If temperature rise will stop at 2 degrees or at 5 degrees, the sea level will continue to rise for about 10,000 years. In the first case it will reach 8–13 metres above pre-industrial level and in the second 28–37 metres. [116]
By region[edit]
Further information: Climate change in the Middle East and North Africa § Sea level rise, and Climate change in South Asia § Sea level rise
Sea level rise is not uniform around the globe. Some land masses are moving up or down as a consequence of subsidence (land sinking or settling) or post-glacial rebound (land rising due to the loss of the weight of ice after melting), so that local relative sea level rise may be higher or lower than the global average. There are even regions near current and former glaciers and ice sheets where sea level falls. Furthermore, gravitational effects of changing ice masses and spatially varying patterns of warming lead to differences in the distribution of sea water around the globe. [117] [21] The gravitational effects comes into play when a large ice sheet melts. With the loss of mass, the gravitational pull becomes less and local water levels might drop. Further away from the ice sheet water levels will increase more than average. In this light, melt in Greenland has a different fingerprint on regional sea level than melt in Antarctica. [26]
Many ports, urban conglomerations, and agricultural regions are built on river deltas, where subsidence of land contributes to a substantially increased relative sea level rise. This is caused by both unsustainable extraction of groundwater (in some places also by extraction of oil and gas), and by levees and other flood management practices that prevent accumulation of sediments from compensating for the natural settling of deltaic soils. [118] Total human-caused subsidence in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta (Netherlands) is estimated at 3–4 m (10–13 ft), over 3 m (10 ft) in urban areas of the Mississippi River Delta (New Orleans ), and over 9 m (30 ft) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.[119] On the other hand, post-glacial isostatic rebound causes relative sea level fall around the Hudson Bay in Canada and the northern Baltic.[120]
The Atlantic is set to warm at a faster pace than the Pacific. This has consequences for Europe and the U.S. East Coast, which received a sea level rise 3–4 times the global average. [121] The downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been also tied to extreme regional sea level rise on the US Northeast Coast. [122]
Effects[edit]
Further information: Regional effects of climate change
Current and future sea level rise is set to have a number of impacts, particularly on coastal systems. Such impacts include higher and more frequent high-tide and storm-surge flooding, increased coastal erosion, inhibition of primary production processes, more extensive coastal inundation, changes in surface water quality and groundwater characteristics. This is projected in turn to increase loss of property and coastal habitats, increased flood risk and potential loss of life, loss of non-monetary cultural resources and values, impacts on agriculture and aquaculture through decline in soil and water quality, and loss of tourism, recreation, and transportation functions. [14] : 356  Many of these impacts are detrimental. Owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space. River deltas in Africa and Asia and small island states are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. [123]
In addition to rising sea level, other effects of climate change that can heavily impact the influence on populations. This includes, for example, loss of coastal ecosystems such as corals due to ocean warming or increasing extreme precipitations caused by climate change. Coastal flooding impacts are exacerbated by land use changes such as urbanisation or deforestation of low-lying coastal zones. Regions that are already vulnerable to the rising sea level also struggle with coastal flooding washing away land and altering the landscape. [124] People in these areas struggle increasingly because of these different effects of climate change. Climate change influenced storms also create greater frequency of coastal flooding. Addressing the flooding issues that a region, city, or country is experiencing will be based off the efforts of the affected country. Without much effort these coastal regions could continuously degrade and thus greatly affect the size and influence of a country.
Globally tens of millions of people will be exposed in the latter decades of the century if greenhouse gases are not reduced drastically. Many coastal areas have large population growth, which results in more people at risk from sea level rise. The rising seas pose both a direct risk: unprotected homes can be flooded, and indirect threats of higher storm surges, tsunamis and king tides. Asia has the largest population at risk from sea level with countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam having very densely populated coastal areas. [125] The effects of displacement are very dependent on how successful governments will be in implementing defenses against the rising sea, with concerns for the poorest countries such as sub-Saharan countries and island nations. [126]
A 2019 study found that the number of people exposed to sea level rise during the 21st century is three times higher that was previously thought. By 2050, 150 million will be under the water line during high tide and 300 million will live in zones with floodings every year. By the year 2100, those numbers differ sharply depending on the emission scenario. In a low emission scenario, 140 million will be under water during high tide and 280 million will have flooding each year. In high emission scenario, the numbers arrive to 540 million and 640 million respectively. Seventy per cent of them are from eight countries in Asia: China, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines.[127] [128]
A 2020 review of 33 publications found that "most global estimates are in the order of tens or hundreds of millions of people exposed to coastal inundation and coastal flooding for different timeframes and scenarios" due to sea level rise. [129]
Coastal areas[edit]
See also: Human impacts on coasts, Coastal and oceanic landforms, Coastal development hazards, Coastal erosion, Coastal engineering, and Coastal morphodynamics
Tidal flooding in Miami during a king tide (October 17, 2016). The risk of tidal flooding increases with sea level rise.
Due to numerous factors, sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate, which poses a great threat to the human environment, both now and in the future. Although this is a slow and continuous process, its long-term cumulative effects on the world, especially in coastal areas, pose a serious threat. In recent years, some coastal areas have already had to cope with effects accumulated over a long period of change. These areas are sensitive to rising sea levels, changes in the frequency and intensity of storms, increased precipitation, and rising ocean temperatures. Ten percent of the world's population live in coastal areas that are less than 10 metres (33 ft) above sea level. Furthermore, two thirds of the world's cities with over five million people are located in these low-lying coastal areas. [130] In total, approximately 600 million people live directly on the coast around the world. [131] Using remote laser scanning called LiDAR to measure elevation on the Earth's surface, researchers found that in the year 2021 267 million people worldwide lived on land less than 2 metres above sea level and that with a 1-metre sea level rise and zero population growth, that number could increase to 410 million people. [132] [133]
The advantage coastal region populations have is that they would technically have other parts of the country or region that they could move or migrate to.  Also, the idea with these countries is that they can possibly have assistance from their government or the public.  The challenges for people in low-lying nations is that they must uproot their entire lives and culture to move to safer areas.  Populations that move from the coasts would also be impacted by loss of livelihoods and could become a heavy strain on the regions or cities that they come to inhabit. [134] Further, both their original government or the receiving countries may lack or withhold resources to help these climate migrants, which compounds their level of poverty.
Present effects[edit]
Sea-level rise favors chronic flooding at high-tide, as evidenced e.g. in the US East Coast. [135] Similarly, Florida, which is extremely vulnerable to climate change, is experiencing substantial nuisance flooding and king tide flooding. [136] One other area in danger is Venice which has experienced significant flooding. The city is located on islands in the delta of the Po and Piave rivers. Sea level rise causes an increase in frequency and magnitude of floodings in the city that already spent more than $6 billion on the flood barrier system. [137] [138]
Food production in coastal areas is affected by rising sea levels as well. Due to flooding and salt water intrusion into the soil, the salinity of agricultural lands near the sea increases, posing problems for crops that are not salt-resistant. Furthermore, salt intrusion in fresh irrigation water poses a second problem for crops that are irrigated. Newly developed salt-resistant crop variants are currently more expensive than the crops they are set to replace. [139] The farmland in the Nile Delta is affected by salt water flooding, [140] and there is now more salt in the soil and irrigation water in the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. [139] Bangladesh and China are affected in a similar way, particularly their rice production. [141]
Rising seas has also been tied to an increased risk from tsunamis, potentially affecting coastal cities in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.[15]
Future effects[edit]
Major cities threatened by sea level rise. The cities indicated are under threat of even a small sea level rise (of 1.6 foot/49 cm) compared to the level in 2010. Even moderate projections indicate that such a rise will have occurred by 2060. [142] [143]
Future sea level rise could lead to potentially catastrophic difficulties for shore-based communities in the next centuries: for example, millions of people will be affected in cities such as Miami, Rio de Janeiro, Osaka and Shanghai if following the current trajectory of 3 °C (5.4 °F). [16] The Egyptian city Alexandria faces a similar situation, where hundreds of thousands of people living in the low-lying areas may already have to be relocated in the coming decade. [140] However, modest increases in sea level are likely to be offset when cities adapt by constructing sea walls or through relocating. [144]
Nonpartisan think tank Resources for the Future describes Miami as "the most vulnerable major coastal city in the world" to damages associated with storm-related coastal flooding and sea-level rise. [145] Storm surge will be one of the important disasters caused by sea level rise in the future that can cause the largest loss of life and property in the world's coastal areas. Storm surges have been affected in recent years by rising sea levels, which have increased in frequency and intensity. For example, one of the most severely affected areas is New York City, where study simulations show that the impact of sea level rise on the New York area will be reduced from 100-year flooding to 19–68 years by 2050 and 40–60 years by 2080. [146]
Island nations[edit]
Further information: Alliance of Small Island States and Small Island Developing States
Atolls, low islands and low-lying coastal areas on islands are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Possible impacts include coastal erosion, flooding and salt intrusion into soils and freshwater.  None are more vulnerable than small island nations, particularly those with population concentrations on atolls.  Atolls on average reach three to six feet above sea level. [147] This type of island is a final stage in the geologic history of an island of volcanic origin (all volcanic islands usually become an atoll, eventually).  With climate change causing sea levels rise, the process of atoll formation has sped up.  Since atolls are low-lying islands, they are vulnerable to rising waters or storms covering them in water.  Atolls are vital because they are the home to many distinct cultures and sovereign nations. As ocean water prematurely covers atolls, saltwater can intrude into drinking water supplies and undermine the ecosystems that the population utilizes to survive. [148] Sea level rise has the potential to devastate tourism and local economies; a sea level rise of 1.0 m (3 ft 3 in) would cause partial or complete inundation of 29% of coastal resorts in the Caribbean. A further 49–60% of coastal resorts would be at risk from resulting coastal erosion. [149] It is difficult to assess how much of past erosion and floods have been caused by sea level change, compared to other environmental events such as hurricanes. Adaptation to sea level rise is costly for small island nations as a large portion of their population lives in areas that are at risk. [150]
Millions of people in these island nations or nations with a lot of islands are incredibly vulnerable to the rising sea level.  Some countries and regions will become submerged, which will push the people that are living there to struggle, adapt, or relocate.  Developed countries could see a giant wave of refugees arrive due to the loss of the refugee's homes and thus have safety issues. [151] While islanders around the world have been very adaptive people, they also have been heavily dependent on the resources they acquire from their islands.  While it may seem that oceans are bountiful and can provide everything, they also tend to be very hard environments in which to thrive.  Of interest is how the rising sea level will affect children in these communities.  Being a child that doesn't have stability at home and their community can create a variety of issues in their development.  Already, children in small island states are encountering hampered access to food and water, displacement, and resulting mental and social disorders from these stressors. [152]
Maldives, Tuvalu, and other low-lying countries are among the areas that are at the highest level of risk. At current rates, sea level would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100. [153] [154] Geomorphological events such as storms tend to have larger impacts on reef island than sea level rise, for instance at one of the Marshall Islands. These effects include the immediate erosion and subsequent regrowth process that may vary in length from decades to centuries, even resulting in land areas larger than pre-storm values. With an expected rise in the frequency and intensity of storms, they may become more significant in determining island shape and size than sea level rise. [155] The Island nation of Fiji is being impacted by sea level rise. [156] Five of the Solomon Islands have disappeared due to the combined effects of sea level rise and stronger trade winds that were pushing water into the Western Pacific.[157]
In the case all islands of an island nation become uninhabitable or completely submerged by the sea, the states themselves would also become dissolved. Once this happens, all rights on the surrounding area (sea) are removed. This area can be significant as rights extend to a radius of 415 kilometres (224 nautical miles) around the entire island state. Any resources, such as fossil oil, minerals and metals, within this area can be freely dug up by anyone and sold without needing to pay any commission to the (now dissolved) island state. [158]
Ecosystems[edit]
Bramble Cay melomys Melomys rubicola. In 2016 declared extinct on Bramble Cay, where it had been endemic, and likely also globally extinct, with habitat loss due to sea level rise being the root cause.
Coastal ecosystems are facing drastic changes as a consequence of rising sea levels. Many systems might ultimately be lost when sea levels rise too much or too fast. Some ecosystems can move land inward with the high-water mark, but many are prevented from migrating due to natural or artificial barriers. This coastal narrowing, sometimes called 'coastal squeeze' when considering human-made barriers, could result in the loss of habitats such as mudflats and marshes.[19] [159]
The mangrove ecosystem is one of the ecosystems affected by rising sea levels. It is an ecological whole composed of mangrove plants growing in and around the mudflats of the tropical coast. Its ecological value is high because it is an ideal home for many species. In recent years, mangroves have been moving inland, but their success depends on various environmental information such as topography and geology. The warmer the climate, the bigger they grow.  The mangrove's breathing roots or pneumatophores might grow to be half a metre tall. [160] [161] Mangroves and tidal marshes adjust to rising sea levels by building vertically using accumulated sediment and organic matter. If sea level rise is too rapid, they will not be able to keep up and will instead be submerged. [162] More specifically, if the rate of mangrove deposition does not keep up with sea level rise, the key to the extinction of the mangrove ecosystem is the relationship between the rate of inland migration and the rate of sea level rise. If sea levels rise faster than the mangroves can move to land, this can lead to the loss of ecosystems. [163] The ability of mangroves to survive sea-level rise events depend on their ability to migrate inland. [161] As both ecosystems protect against storm surges, waves and tsunamis, losing them makes the effects of sea level rise worse. [164] [165] Human activities, such as dam building, may restrict sediment supplies to wetlands, and thereby prevent natural adaptation processes. The loss of some tidal marshes is unavoidable as a consequence. [166]
When seawater reaches inland, problems related to contaminated soils may occur. Also, fish, birds, and coastal plants could lose parts of their habitat. [17] Coral, important for bird and fish life, needs to grow vertically to remain close to the sea surface in order to get enough energy from sunlight. It has so far been able to keep up the vertical growth with the rising seas, but might not be able to do so in the future. [167] In 2016, it was reported that the Bramble Cay melomys, which lived on a Great Barrier Reef island, had probably become extinct because of inundation due to sea level rises. [168] This report was confirmed by the federal government of Australia when it declared the Bramble Cay melomys extinct as of February 2019, making this species the first known mammal to go extinct as a result of sea level rise. [169]
Adaptation[edit]
Further information: Climate change adaptation and coastal management
Placard "The sea is rising", at the People's Climate March (2017).
Adaptation options to sea level rise can be broadly classified into retreat, accommodate and protect. Retreating is moving people and infrastructure to less exposed areas and preventing further development in areas that are at risk. This type of adaptation is potentially disruptive, as displacement of people might lead to tensions. Accommodation options are measurements that make societies more flexible to sea level rise. Examples are the cultivation of food crops that tolerate a high salt content in the soil and making new building standards which require building to be built higher and have less damage in the case a flood does occur. Finally, areas can be protected by the construction of dams, dikes and by improving natural defenses. [18] [170] In more detail, the existing problems are divided into two parts: one is water pollution, and the other is storm surges and floods. [171] Besides, storm surges and flooding can be instantaneous and devastating to cities, and some coastal areas have begun investing in storm water valves to cope with more frequent and severe flooding during high tides. [171]
These adaptation options can be further divided into hard and soft. Hard adaptation relies mostly on capital-intensive human-built infrastructure and involves large-scale changes to human societies and ecological systems. Because of its large scale, it is often not flexible. Soft adaptation involves strengthening natural defenses and adaptation strategies in local communities and the use of simple and modular technology, which can be locally owned. The two types of adaptation might be complementary or mutually exclusive. [170] [172]
Sea trade is the dominant form of resource and good trade throughout the world.  When talking about the rising sea level there is the possibility for major issues to arise for sea-based trade and the ports that are utilized.  What is also of importance for these ports is that we don't yet know how the rising sea level will continue to impact them over time. [173] A variety of factors play into the investment of seaports for this means. Factors that are important for seaports in reference to the rising sea level are where will the important trade ports be in the future, can we alter and protect the ports that are currently being used, how much is needed to protect trade without wasting time or money.  The rising sea level for seaports is a concern, but is hard to decipher what changes need to be made since sea levels do not rise at the same rate all over the world. [174]
Beach nourishment in progress in Barcelona.
Many countries are developing concrete plans for adaptation. An example is the extension of the Delta Works in the Netherlands, a country that sits partially below sea level and is subsiding. [175] In 2008, the Dutch Delta Commission, advised in a report that the Netherlands would need a massive new building program to strengthen the country's water defenses against the rising sea for the following 190 years. This included drawing up worst-case plans for evacuations. The plan also included more than €100 billion in new spending through to the year 2100 for precautionary measures, such as broadening coastal dunes and strengthening sea and river dikes. The commission said the country must plan for a rise in the North Sea up to 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) by 2100 and plan for a 2–4 m (7–13 ft) rise by 2200. [176]
To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched in 2018. [177] [178] As of 2020, it was seen falling short of most of its initial targets. [179] The progress is being monitored.[180]
U.S. coastal cities conduct beach nourishment, also known as beach replenishment, where mined sand is trucked in and added, in addition to other adaptation measures such as zoning, restrictions on state funding, and building code standards. [181] [182] Some island nations, such as the Republic of Maldives, Kiribati and Tuvalu are considering international migration of their population in response to rising seas. Moving to different countries is not an easy solution, as those who move need to have a steady income and social network in their new country. It might be easier to adapt locally by moving further inland and increasing sediment supply needed for natural erosion protection. [183] In the island nation of Fiji, residents are restoring coral reefs and mangroves to protect themselves against flooding and erosion, which is estimated to be more cost-efficient than building sea-walls. [184]
Adaptation to sea level rise often has to account for other environmental issues, such as land-subsidence or habitat destruction. In 2019, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, declared that the city of Jakarta is sinking to a degree that requires him to move the capital to another city. [185] A study conducted between 1982 and 2010 found that some areas of Jakarta have been sinking by as much as 28 cm (11 inches) per year [186] due to ground water drilling and the weight of its buildings, and the problem is now exacerbated by sea level rise. However, there are concerns that building in a new location will increase tropical deforestation.[187] [188] Other so called sinking cities, such as Bangkok or Tokyo, are vulnerable to these compounding subsidence with sea level rise. [189]
Stabilizing global mean sea level rise[edit]
Strategies, technologies and practices to reduce Sea level rise exist. These are for example greenhouse gas reduction, afforestation, technical carbon capture and storage or the removal of the hidden carbon subsidy. These measures, if applied on a global scale, could stabilize global mean sea level rise at current rates (4 mm/year). The Blue-Carbon strategy, namely afforestation of coastal ecosystems particularly efficient in long term carbon storage in soils, is one example. The seawater farming approach is another successful strategy. Several infrastructure projects have been proposed like the Restoration of the Salton Sea [190] [191] [192] which combine both of the strategies of Sea-water farming and reforestation with Ocean-water withdrawal. Large scale Desert-Greening with Ocean-water and industrial scale use of Desalination, or Seawater Greenhouses are more examples.
