Alright, I need to figure out why Amazon initially considered expanding internationally. I don't remember the exact reasons off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information.

First, I should probably look into Amazon's history and see when they started expanding internationally. I think Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, and initially, it was an online bookseller. Over time, it expanded into other product categories and eventually started operating in other countries.

I need to find out what motivated Amazon to look beyond the US market. Maybe it was to reach more customers and increase sales. But I need to dig deeper to understand the specific reasons and perhaps some strategic goals behind their international expansion.

Let me start by searching for information on Amazon's international expansion. I'll look for articles or official statements from Amazon about why they decided to expand overseas.

1. Why did Amazon consider international expansion in the first place? Is international expansion a key success factor in Amazon´s industry? Internet growth was 2,300 per cent in 1994. Amazon’s main strategy considered keeping low amount of inventory stock (to minimize the inventory risk) in many strategically important locations, as the U.K. or Japan, which allowed them quick access to vast amount of countries all around the world. That makes international expansions a key strategy to success for amazon.
International expansion has always been a key factor for any industries or companies to expand their markets across the globe. The increasing purchasing power of people outside the domestic market led e-commerce site Amazon to expand their services globally.
International expansion has always been a key factor for any industries or companies to expand their markets across the globe. The increasing purchasing power of people outside the domestic market led e-commerce site Amazon to expand their services globally. Many countries promote international companies to expand their services in their countries which make companies easy to establish their markets. The selection criteria was basically high GDP and good internet penetration and this got them involved early in UK, Germany, France, Japan, China, in addition to the US.
2. Why did Amazon choose the United Kingdom as its first foreign entry location? Why not other countries such as Canada and Australia? I think, particular reasons for Amazon choosing UK as the first country to entry and the success of Amazon in UK are: 1. Diverse suppliers operated in UK were selling different groups of goods, which made them weak against Amazon’s approach, and made UK market more attractive.
A complete response to the question is as posited below. Kindly have a look at it.
I believe that Amazon chose the United Kingdom as its first overseas market to enter, rather than Canada or Australia, since doing business in the UK will offer the corporation with greater visibility. Perhaps they were also comparing the differences using the CAGE (Cultural, Administrative, Geographic, and Economic) framework. Notably, we can see how much the US and the UK share.
They share comparable languages, ethnic origins, faiths, and values. In terms of administrative ideals, they are political allies, have colonial roots, and are institutionally similar and powerful influencers.
Geographically, they are separated and lack a shared border, but the network would be simpler due to the UK's small size and excellent transportation and communication linkages. Finally, in terms of economic distance, GDP per capita is comparable and robust; this also means that consumer income is comparable and infrastructure is in place, as similar enterprises already exist.
3. What strategies did Amazon use in the United Kingdom? Did these strategies make sense?
1. Amazon suggested best selection of most popular (among the UK citizens) goods (Books, CD, computer hardware, software and videos), which was a smart step. 2. Amazon was importing these groups of products one after another, which looks as a strategy to minimize the risks, and it fully justified itself. 3. Smartly planned promotions and free-delivery campaigns made Amazon primary supplier of various products for affordable price and conditions, which perfectly suits the UK middle class group, which is big there.
To get into a new market, Amazon utilized acquisition, which resulted in their purchasing the market leader in book retailers in the United Kingdom. These tactics were highly successful, but the issue was the large amount of initial capital required. The technique was similar to what they employed at home, with the goal of progressively moving from selling books through the store to other markets after the initial expense was paid. They understood the evolution of the business since they used this technique, thus their strategy makes sense.
Developing a methodology for acquiring investment opportunities that creates benefits for the acquirer is the goal of acquisition strategy. An acquisition strategy might prevent a leadership team from purchasing enterprises in which there is no realistic path to profitability. Whole Foods was Amazon's most costly acquisition in 2017, costing $13.7 billion, it is an acquisition that will provide it with a considerable number of Stores across the UK and a platform from which to motivate retail supremacy in the area. It gave Amazon with a physical retail location as well as knowledge regarding elevated customers. Therefore, the strategies that Amazon did really do make sense and is considered as effective.
4. Why did the company choose to enter Japan after the United Kingdom and Germany?
Amazon.co.jp became the first website in an Asian language and the fourth international store for Amazon. Prior to the entry, Japan was Amazon’s largest export market, bringing annualized sales of $34 million. – Which means there was no western company operating in that market before Amazon focused on customer service to grow its customer base. Over 70 per cent of the population in Japan used the Internet. Approximately 99 per cent of the population fully comprehended only website content in the Japanese language. Amazon developed a Unicode-enabled platform for its Japanese language site, in collaboration with Basis Technology, a software service provider with expertise in Asian- language information processing. While Japanese consumers enjoyed Western products and lifestyle, most goods were attached to their own culture. In July 2003, Amazon launched an electronic store with tens of thousands of products, and later that year opened the home and kitchen market.
Amazon is a globally recognized company, whose origin is America. It is a company entrenched in technology and deals with, among others, e- commerce, Artificial intelligence, and digital streaming. Amazon has continuously grown and offers its e- commerce platforms to numerous countries globally.
Japan had a wide market, as it was already using millions of dollars to import goods especially books from Amazon, which led to Amazon entering the Japanese market, to meet its needs and widen its scope of operations and overall returns. As amazon was already a large company in the e-commerce sector in Japan, it launched a website in the Japanese language (Amazon.co.jp) to enable it offer services in Japanese and English services, thus reaching an even wider audience. Japan is viewed as the leading markets for Amazon products. This was a great benefit to the Japanese population as a significant proportion of this population only comprehensively understood the website in the Japanese language.
It was easy for Amazon to penetrate the Japanese market, as over 70 percent of the Japanese population was already using internet, and therefore proper customer service from Amazon led to exponential growth of customer base
5. To extent the competition power of Amazon, Amazon used:  Offered books in English at a bargain compared with Japanese retailers.  Amazon focused on customer service to grow its customer base, developed a Unicode- enabled platform for its Japanese language site to service Japanese.  Formed alliances and made acquisitions. By using these methods, Amazon could increase its core power to complete. 6. From all the international entries of Amazon, there is a very distinct model or usual practice of how Amazon gets into that market. First of all, while Amazon enters a certain market it will only sell parts of its whole products (books). Then will develop into other kinds of goods (CDs, games). After that, will launch services, which cater to local customers through setting up services, opening fulfillment and customer service centers. Although, to perform better at the local market and also to impair its local competitors. Amazon will acquire certain retail companies, In the UK, China, India. It is very helpful for the company to enter a new market by acquiring local competitive companies. 7. Nowadays, the oversea expansion is no longer successful as it did in the past 10 years for Amazon. The company now faces a very common dilemma of globalization, such as the markets of China possess a unique environmental and cultural distinction, what is more. Amazon could slow down the step to expand with international strategies to handle the difficulty in America and Europe with foreign markets. Amazon could lose pertinence towards each of them.

From an Australian perspective, Australia has had Parallel Import Restrictions or tariffs on printed books since the 1980s.  If a book qualifies under those restrictions, the book is released Australia  within 30 days of it being published elsewhere in the world, and the local supplier maintains a capacity to resupply it within 90 days, then there is essentially a monopoly market and the publisher can charge whatever they like. This makes retail prices for many books in Australia much higher than overseas.  If books are bought online, these restrictions can be bypassed and the consumer also sa

International business expansion can be influenced by more factors than a local one. Here are the potential factors you should get alert to:

Why is Amazon more successful than eBay?
Amazon is more successful than ebay because they are more greedy (yes, I said it). They cater to shoppers at ANY cost, which in many cases means stealing from their sellers (said it again). Example: One of the items we used to sell is magazine subscriptions. We had in our descriptions to contact us in the event there is any problem with delivery within 90 days, which is generous. Many of the subscribers were prisoners, which get moved to different locations occasionally. One fine upstanding citizen contacted me at 11 months into his 12 month subscription letting me know he never got his magazi

Is Amazon’s success America's failure?
That is a very interesting question and one that is difficult to answer. In some aspects, Bezos is an embodiment of the American dream. He was the son of a teenage mother who learned the merits of a good work ethic on his grandfather’s farm. He went on to study at Princeton, work on Wall Street, and then quit the game in disgust in order to feed his appetite for invention and entrepreneurship. It’s easy to dismiss him assuming that he was born rich but he did have fairly humble origins.
This leads into the question as to what is a failure and a success for America. As a mixed economy; that is,

The Amazon One system is a classic play out of Amazon’s playbook.

I think I am qualified to answer this question.
Amazon believes that customers will always want widest selection, lowest prices and faster delivery -  these three things won't ever change in the retail business. Amazon's mission statement and tenets are built around these aspects.
Although I cannot divulge much information, Amazon has systems in place to continuously monitor and study the competition both in terms of selection and pricing and beat them on both these aspects. On faster delivery, there is a lot of innovation and development underway such as Prime Air etc.

The Seller's Strategy for Amazon International Expansion

The Seller’s Strategy for Amazon International Expansion
by Tara Johnson | Aug 10, 2016 | Amazon & Marketplaces
Successful Amazon International Expansion Tactics
Amazon international expansion poses a vast opportunity for sellers to expose their products to new markets and increase sales.
However, with opportunity comes risks and costs that need to be calculated before rushing into foreign marketplaces. With any business decision, sellers should do their due diligence to make sure their products are a fit in those international markets and that their current operations allow them to successfully sell within Amazon’s strict requirements.
We spoke with The Friendly Swede , an Amazon storefront with a focus on sports and outdoor gear – who was able to successfully expand to 7 Amazon marketplaces on 3 continents in approximately a year and a half.
In the following Q&A, Jonas Carlsson, CEO of The Friendly Swede, shares his company’s rapid international growth tactics and how advertising efforts contributed to the overall success of his business on the Amazon Marketplace.
Q. How would you describe the early stages of building a business?
A. “John Lundqvist founded “ The Friendly Swede ” from China back in 2011. The first time it was very hectic since he was the only one in the company but the main priorities from the start were to learn Amazon and have a clear focus on sales and taking care of the customers,” Carlsson said.
“John became aware of Amazon through contacts back in 2011. After discussions and our own investigations, he soon realized the power Amazon had as a sales platform and the potential there was for the future.”
Q. Which Amazon advertising platforms have you seen the most success from?
A. “We’ve seen the most impact from Sponsored Products and Deals, but the success of each depends on the situation.”
“Sponsored Products are mostly used to get more visibility in a product which will lead to sales, and deals are given more direct boost in sales. Both important to grow the business.”
“When investing you need to analyze each product separately regarding sales rank, reviews, price etc. to determine what kind of marketing the product needs. I would like to say that you need to build up an experience over time to do the correct evaluation and get the most out of the marketing dollars.”
“Of course, it’s also important to look at actual figures of sales and ACOS (average cost of sales) which you can collect from Amazon.”
The factors that have contributed the most to The Friendly Swede’s success on the Marketplace include:
Knowledge of Amazon
Products with a high demand on the market
Customer focus in all aspects
Collecting reviews
High quality products
Great people in the TFS team
“Our customers are the best product developers there are – we read every single review – the good ones, the bad ones, taking in all the feedback that we get and we are constantly trying to make it better,” Anna Nordlander, former CEO and now co-owner of The Friendly Swede said in an interview with Amazon (see below).
Day One: Stories of Entrepreneurship | Anna Nordlander, The Friendly Swede
Watch on
By 2012, The Friendly Swede had almost 4 million dollars in sales and by 2015, they closed out the year with over 10 million in sales – largely thanks to their international expansion efforts.
Q. Tell us about the Amazon International Expansion Process
A. In approximately a year and a half, The Friendly Swede expanded to 7 Amazon Marketplaces on 3 continents (as seen below).
“An initial challenge was that the market is different in each country – this due to national differences. This has an affect on how to handle customer support, contact with Amazon but also on the demand on our products .”
“As an example, just because you have a product that sells well in US doesn’t automatically mean it will go well in Japan. You need to spend time and find methods in how to handle the market in each country,” Carlsson said.
Amazon operates 11 online marketplaces (websites) worldwide, allowing sellers to grow their business internationally, independent of where their business is physically established. With Amazon, sellers can introduce their brand and products to millions of customers in Amazon’s marketplaces.
These marketplaces represent many of the world’s largest e-commerce opportunities. When you register to sell in one of these Amazon marketplaces, you gain immediate access to customers who know and trust the Amazon buying experience.
There’s a lot of advantages to expanding sales to one or more of Amazon’s marketplaces. One of the biggest benefits is that sellers can leverage the Amazon brand without having to foot the upfront costs of building business name recognition on their own in a brand new sales environment.
“Amazon’s European Fulfillment Network (EFN) is a powerful way to reach customers across Europe from a single marketplace account,” Pat Petriello, Marketplace Manager at CPC Strategy said in a recent interview.
“Amazon will handle picking, packing, and shipping your products across Europe from a single pool of inventory without you having to worry about importing or customs for each nation within the EFN.”
It’s important to note that market reach is not limited to these countries — Amazon customers come from 178 countries around the world. By expanding globally with Amazon’s international marketplace, the number of potential customers increases from 100 million in the U.S. to 250 million worldwide.
If retailers are already selling in one European marketplace, such as Amazon.co.uk, and are looking to expand to other European international marketplaces in Germany, Italy, Spain, and/or France, Amazon European Marketplaces allows businesses to expand without having to set up individual accounts in each new country. This account option allows retailers to handle operations in all European markets from one central account.

To learn more, check out what the experts have to say: “ How to Sell Internationally on Amazon “
According to Carlsson, 3 tips he offers Amazon sellers interested in international expansion:
Take advantage of the Amazon knowledge that you have, but handle each country individually.
Secure that you have personnel that can handle the local language.
Analyze if the products you have are appropriate for the market you will enter.
“We have been able to have a faster expansion but we have also lower our risk since we now are less dependent on the development in a single market,” he said.
According to Carlsson, the target is to continue to grow The Friendly Swede across Amazon’s international marketplace from year to year.
“The basis to be able to continue our growth is to continuously develop products with high customer demand within our product areas outdoor gear and stylus pens. Of course with high quality and competitive prices,” he said.
“We will also continue to have a strong customer focus in all aspects, continue to have a friendly atmosphere so that we can keep and attract the right coworkers which is essential to grow a business. Our focus sales platform will in the future also be Amazon but we are also evaluating other platform for the future.”

8 Reasons Why Companies Expand Globally
July 30, 2021
ByNiv Schwartz
Expanding globally is almost a natural process for companies who wish to take their business to the next level. The ‘global expansion goal’ was once only deemed to be achievable for large companies. However, the international market is now open for small businesses, as well. It is now truly an attainable, accessible process. Many companies, big and small, are jumping for the opportunity to expand their business around the globe.
While it is true that achieving this expansion goal may be obtainable for many companies, it is still not the easiest of tasks. Many fail to achieve this goal because they were not prepared enough for the potential complications ahead. Although it may take some time and effort, internalization benefits are worthwhile in the short and long term. This article aims to highlight the benefits of global expansion and explain why companies wish to make their company international, despite the potential hurdles of said process.
Reason No. 1: Increase in Revenue
An increase in revenue is one of the main benefits of globalization. Marketing your product overseas exceeds the number of potential clients, thus providing a better increase in revenue. Global expansion equals business growth, which is not limited to the average income your home market can offer for your company.
Reason No. 2: Increase in Savings
While expanding globally offers better opportunities for gaining profit, it also allows for cheaper costs. Usually, it is cheaper to do business abroad because you can reduce production costs in more affordable countries. Likewise, the wage that you must pay for your international employees may be less than the salary you pay for your local employees, considering the distinction in minimum wage around the world. For example, one of the reasons that Apple outsources its manufacturing in China is to increase labor savings.
Reason No. 3: A More Extensive Customer Base- More Opportunities for Growth
Growth and reinvention are the keywords associated with international expansion. For the most part, a product or a convenient service in one market will not necessarily suit another. To cater to the needs of your new customer base there must be some adjustments made. These meaningful adjustments will most likely increase the chances of growth and development of your current product, thus allowing the investment and introduction of improved products or services. For example, Mcdonald’s had adjusted their meal options to cater to the needs of their customers all around the world, thus upgrading their original menu.
Reason No. 4: The Importance of Stability
A stable economy is not guaranteed; that is a fact that has become unfortunately apparent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is an extreme case, nothing is inevitable, and nothing should be taken for granted, especially in the business world. Hence why it is so important to not depend on the economic stability of one country alone, but rather raise your chances of economic survival by diversifying your markets.
Reason No. 5: Access to More Talents
Gaining access to a broader, more diverse pool of talents can only improve a company for the better. Different talents from different parts of the world can hold on to new sets of valuable skills that your current, local talents may lack. Access to new talents offer diversity, a cultural outlook, and language variety. Following that, it is safe to say that international talent comes with a unique point of view and improves innovation within a company, raising its prestige. Netflix is an excellent example of the usage of new talents in strengthening its brand. Netflix successfully created series and films in many different languages and cultural backgrounds, reaching a larger audience of viewers as a result.
Reason No. 6: Reputation and Prestige
It is a well-known fact that a good reputation is critical for any business, for it approves your company’s reliability and makes for an attractive brand. International expansion is the stamp of approval that shows that your company and product are successful, credible, and of high quality – all thanks to the added prestige that comes from going global. Since this process of international expansion is not an easy one to achieve, once you succeed in building a multinational cooperation, you gain recognition for your worldwide brand.
Reason No. 7: Gain a Competitive Edge
In this fast age of innovation, companies must use any advantage they have to stay relevant in the face of today’s competitive market. Globalization is just the competitive edge that your company needs for it to get ahead of your competitors in entering a new marketing field. Besides the fact that globalization gives your company the reputation and prestige that others may lack, globalization also grants access to new technologies and industry ecosystems that you can use to your advantage.
Reason No. 8: It is Easier Now Than Ever Before
While expanding internationally is not a hassle-free process, it is now a more straightforward thing to achieve than in the past. Globalization is so popular now because it has become a more convenient and much more achievable goal. With today’s technology and fast internet connection, it is now feasible to trade worldwide without being physically present in the country you wish to expand to. Many companies are now hiring teams they will never meet in person, and it is perfectly reasonable in today’s working culture. Other than that, Westernization has become more permanent in the last few decades, allowing for a more straightforward trade among different countries that wish to stay in touch with the trends of the West. Therefore, it is safe to say that Western companies are more appealing to a broader set of audiences than in the past.
Conclusion- Is it All Worth it?
The answer is yes. It is not by chance that the most successful and influential companies are the ones that gained international recognition. Today’s world is smaller than it was in the past, and even that is a good enough reason to decide to expand globally. Now that you grasp the benefits of globalization and wish to begin the process of expanding, it is essential to note that a strategic expansion plan is in order. To avoid being underprepared, there is a valid need to have a thorough, step-by-step plan for your global expansion.

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let me try to piece together why Amazon initially considered international expansion.

From Doc 1, which seems to be a course assignment, it mentions that Amazon considered international expansion due to the high growth of the internet in 1994 and their strategy of maintaining low inventory by having strategically located warehouses in places like the UK and Japan. It suggests that international expansion was a key strategy for success for Amazon.

Another point in Doc 1 is that international expansion is a common strategy for industries to expand their markets globally, driven by the increasing purchasing power of people outside the domestic market. Amazon was attracted to countries with high GDP and good internet penetration, which is why they entered markets like the UK, Germany, France, Japan, and China.

Doc 2 is from Quora, where different users provide answers. One user mentions that Amazon focused on countries with high GDP and good internet penetration, which aligns with what I read in Doc 1. Another user talks about political and economic stability being important factors for international expansion, which makes sense for any company looking to enter new markets.

Doc 3 is from Study.com, and it poses the same question but doesn't provide an answer directly. It seems like it's setting up for an explanation, but perhaps the full answer is behind a paywall.

Doc 4 is from Tinuiti.com, a blog about Amazon and marketplaces. It discusses Amazon's international expansion from the perspective of a seller who has expanded to multiple Amazon marketplaces. The seller, The Friendly Swede, expanded to seven Amazon marketplaces in about a year and a half. They mention that Amazon's European Fulfillment Network (EFN) made it easier to reach customers across Europe from a single marketplace account.

Lastly, Doc 5 is from Xinergy Global, which provides reasons why companies expand globally. While it's not specific to Amazon, it gives general benefits of international expansion, such as increased revenue, savings, a larger customer base, stability, access to more talents, reputation and prestige, a competitive edge, and the ease of expansion in today's connected world.

So, synthesizing these points, it seems that Amazon initially considered international expansion for several reasons:

1. High internet growth and the potential for reaching more customers beyond the US market.

2. Strategic placement of warehouses in key locations like the UK and Japan to minimize inventory risks and quickly access vast markets.

3. Attraction to countries with high GDP and good internet penetration, indicating a higher purchasing power and readiness for e-commerce.

4. The general benefit of diversifying markets to ensure economic stability and growth.

5. Access to a broader talent pool and new technologies.

6. Enhancing the company's reputation and prestige by becoming a global brand.

Additionally, Amazon's own infrastructure, like the European Fulfillment Network, facilitated easier expansion into multiple European markets.

I should probably look for more sources to confirm this, maybe some official statements from Amazon or articles from reputable business journals. But based on these documents, these seem to be the key reasons for Amazon's initial consideration of international expansion.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Amazon initially considered international expansion due to high internet growth, strategic warehouse placements, attraction to high GDP and good internet penetration countries, market diversification for stability and growth, access to broader talent pools, and enhancing reputation as a global brand.}} \]
