So I need to think about how technology has changed jobs. Hmm, this is a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down. First off, technology has been advancing at an incredible pace over the past few decades, and it's had a huge impact on the way we work. I guess I should start by considering different industries and seeing how technology has affected them.

Let me think about manufacturing. In the past, a lot of manufacturing jobs were manual labor—people assembling products on a factory floor. But now, with the introduction of robots and automated systems, many of those tasks are being done by machines. So, in a way, technology has replaced some jobs in manufacturing. But at the same time, it's created new jobs for people who maintain and program those robots. So, it's a mix of job loss in some areas and creation in others.

Moving on to office jobs. Traditionally, offices were filled with paper—files, memos, reports, etc. But with the advent of computers and digital document management, a lot of that paper has gone away. Now, most documents are created, stored, and shared electronically. This has made offices more efficient, but it's also changed the skills required for many jobs. People need to be proficient with computers and various software programs now, whereas before, typing and filing skills might have been more important.

In the service industry, technology has also had a big impact. For example, in restaurants, many places now have digital menus or even let you order directly from a tablet at your table. This can make the ordering process faster and more efficient, but it might also reduce the need for as many waitstaff. Similarly, in retail, self-checkout kiosks are becoming common, which could reduce the number of cashiers needed.

Looking at the healthcare sector, technology has revolutionized the way medical professionals do their jobs. There are now advanced diagnostic tools like MRI machines, electronic health records, and even robotic surgery. These advancements have improved patient care but also require medical staff to be trained in using this new technology. So, again, it's changing the skill sets required for these jobs.

In the field of education, technology has also played a significant role. With the rise of online learning platforms, teachers can now reach students all over the world without being physically present in a classroom. This has democratized education to some extent, but it's also changed the dynamics of teaching and learning. Teachers need to be adept at using digital tools and managing online classrooms.

Speaking of digital tools, the internet and social media have created entirely new job categories that didn't exist before. For example, social media managers, content creators, SEO specialists, and data analysts are all roles that have emerged due to the growth of the digital landscape. These jobs require specific skills that weren't necessary in the pre-internet era.

Moreover, technology has enabled remote work, which has become increasingly popular, especially with the pandemic. Tools like Zoom, Slack, and Google Workspace have made it possible for people to work from anywhere, which has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it provides flexibility and can lead to a better work-life balance. On the other hand, it can blur the lines between work and personal life, leading to overwork in some cases.

Another aspect is the gig economy, facilitated by apps and platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Upwork. These technologies have created new opportunities for people to earn income on their own terms, but they also often lack the benefits and stability of traditional employment.

I should also consider the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies are being integrated into various jobs, from customer service (through chatbots) to financial analysis. AI can automate routine tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative work. However, there's also concern that AI could replace certain jobs entirely, particularly those involving repetitive tasks.

Looking at the bigger picture, technology has led to increased productivity and efficiency in many sectors. This can lead to economic growth and the creation of new jobs, but it can also displace workers in certain areas. Therefore, there's a need for continuous learning and adaptation in the workforce to keep up with technological changes.

In terms of specific statistics, I think it would be helpful to look up some data on how many jobs have been created or displaced by technology. Maybe I can find some reports from organizations like the World Economic Forum or the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The Impact of Technology on Employment
New technologies are increasingly being adopted in manufacturing, retail and clerical work, and in many professions including education, law, medicine and financial services. Many people argue that automation, software and robots will replace people in manufacturing. Other people argue that technology creates jobs. Still, others argue that it is destroying jobs faster than it is creating them. However, the widespread adoption of technology is destroying jobs and causing widespread unemployment.
Advanced automation has been very common in manufacturing for decades, especially in China and the United States (Rogers, Takegami and Yin). Fewer people work in car factories than in the last century. Industrial robotics was adopted around 1980s (Rogers, Takegami and Yin). Most car factories routinely employ machines to weld and paint body parts. These tasks were mostly handled by humans. In the modern world, industrial robots are more far cheaper and flexible than their predecessors: They are even performing simple jobs in a variety of sectors (Rogers, Takegami and Yin).
Majority of economists believe that technology enhances productivity and creates wealth in the society but has a negative impact: it eliminates the need for many categories of jobs. For example, technological advancements such as Google’s driverless car are a good indicator of the further impact of what technology might do in the future. In economics, productivity of labor is a vital indicator of growth. It is also an indicator of wealth creation and a measure of progress. Therefore, there is improved productivity of labor but the number of employees needed in increasingly smaller: this leaves the today’s typical worker worse off than in yester years.
There are less dramatic changes created by technological advancement in clerical work and professional services but the changes have potentially far larger impact on employment. For example, Web technologies, databases, improved analytics and artificial intelligence are replacing human beings in the performance of many routine tasks. Technological advancements are making it possible to replace human effort in countless traditional white-collar jobs, including customer service and post office services (Batt, Lloyd and Weinkopf). For example, it is common for customer care departments in many public institutions to address clients through automated public address systems (Batt, Lloyd and Weinkopf). Many researchers claim that such systems are “digital versions of human intelligence” (Batt, Lloyd and Weinkopf). The technologies are being adopted in jobs once thought to require people.
Digital technologies cause slow job creation, reduce the number of jobs and cause painful shock to workers as they are forced to adjust their skills. Additionally, entrepreneurs tend to exploit new technologies, causing existing skills to become redundant. Businesses may be forced to invest more in the training of workers (Spitz-Oener). The need to reduce the total costs will also force them to hire fewer workers (Spitz-Oener). The exploitation of digital technologies is being facilitated by the availability of data, personnel and enough computing power. The large-scale adoption of digital technologies is causing long-term involuntary unemployment.
There are many scientists who argue that robots need to be manufactured and run by humans and will not lead to job loss (Youndt). Others argue that robots may not be adopted easily as it takes long to teach a robot to recognize an object especially in a moderately unstructured environment like an office. Some organizations may not readily adopt robots as people may be far better at responding to changes and unexpected events in their environment. Human beings are also good at packaging various items together.
The middle class has been the most affected by automation; computer technologies have increasingly replaced people in such tasks as bookkeeping, and other repetitive production jobs especially in the manufacturing sector. Robots increasingly need minimal training to work on simple tasks. They are being used in work places where there is much risk to employees. Computer-aided jobs requiring problem-solving skills and creativity have multiplied; these jobs attract high pay. Scientists predict that automated processes and robots with superhuman skills will take over wide variety of human tasks within the next 50 years (Spitz-Oener). The evidence is based on the increasingly few workers required in factories and the adoption of advanced computing.
There is an increasingly trend of pushing advanced computing into many spheres of professions such as finance, as medicine and customer service. The rapid adoption of advanced computing has created a huge gap between economic winners and losers. Such technologies tend to promote “technology experts” (Rogers, Takegami and Yin). For example, an organization that creates a tax preparation system or software might eliminate the need for many accountants while it makes millions or billions of dollars.
There are a few jobs that may that benefit from computer assistance, but many others are likely to be negatively affected in the future (Lohr). Jobs that involve engineering, design and programming; they entail the use of basic problem-solving abilities that humans have over machines. Those that do not need less problem-solving abilities such as attending to customers, packaging, dusting and spraying may be greatly affected in the future (Lohr).
Labor-displacing technologies can be classified under automation, mechanization and process improvement (Youndt). While automation and mechanization involve transfer of tasks from humans to machines, process improvement entails the elimination of tasks altogether (Youndt). The three have led to the decrease in the number of average working hours and the number of workers. Some economists argue that technological unemployment may lead to structural unemployment.
While there is an obvious enthusiasm for advanced technologies, people are not very conscious about the loss of jobs: yet the jobs may vanish forever. People are likely to purchase cars that consume more machine hours than man-hours to manufacture; there are likely to ignore the real impact of such purchases. Furthermore, some people claim that there are other factors associated with slow job creation in the 21st century including, the 2008 economic regression and events related to global trade (Youndt).
Many economists do not consider the impact of technology in employment; they only consider it as a vital factor of production. Some argue that technology enables a firm lower labor inputs and consequently lower profits, leading to more sales and higher managers. Other economists argue that the additional purchasing power causes an increase in aggregate demand, thereby increasing employment due to the expansionary effect of technology on the economy. Other economists argue that the automation can destroy jobs in a disturbing way as most workers do not have the capabilities to take up the new jobs. Still, some economists fail to notice that short-run unemployment may be as a result of lack of competition in products and labor markets, among other artificial imperfections. Lohr (2011) argues that although a hesitant economy has caused job shortage in America, advancing technology has harshly magnified the effect. Therefore, different attitudes toward technology lead to a scenario where people ignore the role of technology in destroying jobs.
Conclusion
Technological advancement has enabled organizations to employ people while still producing at higher-than-subsistence levels of output. Using simple technologies or no technologies at all can lead to full employment but cannot lead to efficient production or improve standards of living. Therefore, technology is important. However, the rate at which technological advancements are embraced leaves little to be desired as many people may end up unemployed. It would be more prudent to control the adoption of technologies in some productivity areas.

The impact of technology on labor markets
Summary written by: Richard Works
Decades ago, renowned economists John Maynard Keynes and Wassily Leontief foretold a time when artificial intelligence would produce “technological unemployment.” In their view, labor would become less important and workers would be replaced by machines. Science fiction writers often capitalize on plots where robots take over tasks traditionally performed by humans. In such a scenario, what would be the implications on today’s labor market? According to “ Robots and jobs: evidence from US labor markets ” (National Bureau of Economic Research working paper no. 23285, March 2017) by Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, the use of industrial robots may reduce employment and wages in the U.S. economy.
An industrial robot does not need a human operator. The authors’ review of the literature shows that, in the United States, the number of robots increased from 1993 to 2007 and, by 2007, amounted to 1 robot for every thousand workers. There are an estimated 1.5–1.75 million robots in operation, with the number expected increase to 4–6 million by 2025. Industries employing many robots include the automotive industry, electronics industry, metal products industry, and plastic and chemical industry. The Acemoglu and Restrepo study analyzed the effect that industrial robot usage had on labor markets from 1990 to 2007.
The model used in the study built on prior research but extended the framework to account for the varying share of tasks performed by robots across industries. The model regressed the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots (exposure to robots is calculated as the national penetration of robots into each industry times the employment share of that industry in the local labor market). The analysis showed a negative and positive effect on wages and employment from increasing the number of robots into the economy. The negative effect is that robots displace current workers from their occupations. The positive effect is the price-productivity effect. Increasing the number of robots decreases the cost of production, thus expanding the industry and increasing the demand for labor.
The analysis also considered gender, industry, occupation, education, and wage percentiles. It found that the employment impact for men is 1.5–2 times greater than for women, and the effects are concentrated in manufacturing industries. Negative effects are seen in all occupations except for managerial positions. Not surprisingly, large decreases are found within blue-collar jobs that have routine manual operations, such as assembly workers, transportation workers, and machinists. The negative impacts slightly diminish as a worker’s education level increases, and no impact exists for workers with graduate degrees. The authors note an unexpected finding in that no positive impact was found with workers who had more than a college degree. The authors suggest that this finding may indicate that industrial robots may not be complementing any particular occupation group. The study found the effects on wages similarly were concentrated around the bottom half of the distribution.
The authors acknowledge that because relatively few robots currently exist, robots have caused the loss of only a limited number of jobs. As the use of robots is anticipated to spread, however, future employment and wages would likely be affected. Little evidence exists of the equilibrium impacts that this spread may cause. This study is viewed by the authors as a first step in evaluating how robots influence labor market equilibriums. The authors provide an empirical methodology to address the lack of research in this area. Their research concludes by stating that if the spread of robots continues, there could be sizable future declines in the employment–population ratio.

Impact of technology on jobs
The Creator @TheDailyYou Jul 06, 2021,  18:58  IST
In today’s world, the use of technology is inevitable. So instead of cursing it or badmouthing it, we should learn to live with it and make the most out of it. It raises the bar of efficiency, productivity, and safety which is not achievable by humans alone. Also, it will not be for the first time when there will be a shift in employment due to technology. History has been evidence of the fact that technology has been the creator of jobs than the destroyer.
The industrial sector all over the world is adopting technology for higher efficiency and productivity. Machines can reduce the production of default products to a fault and also decrease the production time. Although, this may lead to job loss for the unskilled and semi-skilled labor if they remain uneducated and untrained. But if they become skilled through training and development programs, there would be better job opportunities. Workers will have more employment opportunities if their occupation undergoes some degree of computer automation. As long as they can learn to use the new tools, automation will be of their benefit.
For example, when ATMs automated the tasks of bank tellers and when barcode scanners automated the work of cashiers, rather than contributing to unemployment, the number of workers in these occupations grew. With the advent of new technologies industry, experts see the need for skilled workers increasing in the short run and persisting for at least another decade. The experts call for training programs with a new curriculum and certifications to standardize emerging job classifications. Technological innovations result in improved lifestyles. If we take the example of 3D printing technology, building houses by 3D printing is a great technological innovation. This innovation will create more affordable homes hence, more and more people may want to buy a house. And so, with more consumers, more houses will be built and hence will create so many jobs but of a different kind.
Technology changes the nature of jobs but it does not completely cause unemployment. Therefore, there is no need to cause panic rather prepare for the future by constant updating and learning.

Context:
Technology has made a number of traditional jobs redundant. For example, ATMs replaced some bank jobs. The new wave of technologies like automation and artificial intelligence is a threat to many jobs. There is an impact of technology on employment opportunities in almost every sector. So, this GD topic – ‘Impact of technology on Jobs’ is one of the most famous GD Topics.
The positive impact of Technology on jobs:
Technological innovations result in improved lifestyles, and hence consumerism increased and thereby results in more employment opportunities. For example, the industrial revolution created more jobs than it eliminated. If we take the example of 3D printing technology, building houses by 3D printing is a great technological innovation. Eventually, it will result in some job losses in the construction industry at least in the starting. But this innovation will result in creating more affordable homes and hence more and more people may want to buy a house. And so, with more consumers, more houses will be built and hence will create so many jobs but of a different kind.
Technology increases productivity and hence reduces the burden on workers and eliminates the burden of doing repetitive tasks. For this, workers need to learn some skills to stay employed. It’s just that the workers should be given training for the newly created jobs. If the government takes care of the reskilling of low-skilled workers, we can take advantage of the impact of technology on jobs.
Due to technology, demand for technically skilled youth is increasing and hence more jobs available for educated youth. This can solve the problem of educated unemployment to some extent.
Technology helps in the growth of the economy.  Companies that use technology will save so much money by replacing human labour with technological innovations. And thereby they expand their services. And as a result, they create more jobs. More employees will be added to the economy, and more revenue by taxes will come to the government. So, there will be economic growth. This economic growth can be utilised by the government to create more employment opportunities with better pay.
Technologies have the potential to create large scale jobs in rural areas and hence addresses the rural unemployment issue. Till now, jobs with better pay are concentrated in urban areas.

Watch on
The negative impact of Technology on jobs:
The immediate result of new technologies will be job losses because some jobs will become redundant. Machines and automation are replacing low-skilled workers. If any company do not replace human labour with technology, it is susceptible to losses due to heavy competition from other companies which use technology. So, it is inevitable for companies to catch up with the technologies. In this process, low-skilled workers will be the first section to be removed from the jobs. As a consequence of that, income inequalities are further widening.
Not just the low-skilled, and semi-skilled jobs, even high skilled job are at threat due to the new wave of technologies like Artificial intelligence. This can reduce the employment opportunities available for technically skilled persons.
At present, a gap in the career will be a big disadvantage due to changing and constantly improving technologies. This may force some women to stay at home after taking maternity leaves.
Technical advancement is forcing people to continuously update their knowledge to sustain themselves in the job market. This can be too overwhelming for some to balance work and personal life.
Conclusion:-
Technology changes the nature of jobs. Even though some jobs will become redundant, technological advancement has the potential to create many more employment opportunities than it eliminated. Continuous learning and updating the skills is the need of the hour.

What Impact Does Technology Have on Jobs?

Download the chapter
In keeping with the mood of economic despondency, there
has been lots of pessimistic talk in the U.S. and the rest of
the industrial world about innovation in today’s economy, or
the lack thereof. For instance, Tyler Cowen’s best-selling e-book
The Great Stagnation argues that innovation is occurring at a
slowing rate and that the innovation that is taking place, such
as through the application of the Internet, has had a relatively
limited impact on living standards and job creation. In a similar
vein, the economist Bob Gordon hypothesizes in a recent paper
that the presumption of continuous growth can no longer be
taken for granted when today’s innovations do not generate
sustained improvements in labor productivity. One area
where everyone agrees that technological change is making a
difference is in driving a wedge between high- and low-skilled
wages, leading to widening inequality and a stagnant median
income since the 1990s.
One of the questions posed at the Brookings Blum
Roundtable was to what degree these concerns have salience
in the developing world, especially in low-income countries.
Because developing countries stand some distance from
the global productivity frontier, a speculative slowdown in
technological development or a decline in the impact of these
technologies should not concern them. They can continue to
raise their prosperity by harnessing the existing technologies
employed in the West. However, that still leaves the question
of the impact of technology on jobs.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what they say.

The first document is from DissertationMasters.com, and it's titled "The Impact of Technology on Employment." It seems like a persuasive essay arguing that technology is destroying jobs and causing widespread unemployment. It mentions examples like industrial robots in manufacturing and how technology is replacing human effort in various white-collar jobs. The essay also touches on the idea that while technology enhances productivity and creates wealth, it does so at the cost of eliminating jobs faster than it creates them. It cites the adoption of driverless cars as an indicator of future job displacement and discusses how digital technologies are causing slow job creation and reducing the number of jobs.

Interesting. So, this source presents a somewhat pessimistic view of technology's impact on jobs, emphasizing job destruction over job creation.

The second document is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Monthly Labor Review, titled "The impact of technology on labor markets." This seems more authoritative and data-driven. The study by Acemoglu and Restrepo looks at the effect of industrial robots on employment and wages in the U.S. from 1990 to 2007. They found that increased use of robots had both negative and positive effects: negatively, by displacing workers, and positively, by decreasing production costs and expanding industries, which could increase labor demand.

The analysis shows that the negative effect was stronger, leading to reduced employment and wages, especially among men, in manufacturing industries, and particularly in blue-collar jobs with routine manual operations. Interestingly, the impact was less severe for higher-educated workers, and there was no impact on those with graduate degrees. The study suggests that if the use of robots continues to spread, there could be significant future declines in employment.

This seems like a balanced view, acknowledging both the displacement and the potential for new job creation, but suggesting that, at least in the period studied, displacement was more pronounced.

The third document is from The Times of India, titled "Impact of technology on jobs." The author argues that instead of fearing technology, we should adapt to it and see it as a tool that can ultimately create more jobs, albeit different ones. The example given is 3D printing technology for houses, which might initially replace some construction jobs but could lead to more affordable housing, increasing demand and thus creating new jobs.

This perspective is optimistic, emphasizing that technology changes the nature of jobs rather than eliminating them entirely. It highlights the importance of education and training in adapting to new technologies.

The fourth document is from GroupDiscussionIdeas.com, discussing the impact of technology on jobs in a more general sense. It presents both positive and negative impacts, similar to the previous sources. On the positive side, technology can lead to improved lifestyles, increased consumerism, and thus more employment opportunities. It can also increase productivity and reduce the burden on workers. Moreover, it can create more jobs for educated youth and contribute to economic growth, which can be used to create more employment opportunities.

On the negative side, technology can make some jobs redundant, leading to job losses, especially among low-skilled workers. There's also the concern that even high-skilled jobs are at risk due to advances like artificial intelligence. Additionally, the need for continuous learning and updating of skills can be overwhelming for some workers.

This source seems to offer a balanced view, recognizing both the benefits and challenges brought about by technology in the job market.

The fifth document is from the Brookings Institution, titled "What Impact Does Technology Have on Jobs?" It's a report discussing the impact of technology on jobs, particularly in the context of developing countries. The report suggests that while concerns about slowing innovation may not directly affect developing countries, which can still benefit from adopting existing technologies, there is still the question of how technology affects job creation and destruction in these economies.

The report acknowledges that technology can lead to job displacement but also points out that developing countries can harness technology to raise their productivity and prosperity. It seems to suggest that the impact varies and depends on how countries manage the transition.

Overall, from these sources, it appears that technology has both positive and negative impacts on jobs. On one hand, it can lead to job displacement and unemployment, particularly among low-skilled and routine-based jobs. On the other hand, it can create new jobs, increase productivity, and stimulate economic growth, which can lead to more employment opportunities.

A key factor seems to be the ability of workers to adapt through education and training to acquire the skills needed for new types of jobs created by technology. Additionally, policies that facilitate this transition, such as reskilling programs and support for displaced workers, are crucial.

In conclusion, while technology does change the job landscape, leading to some jobs becoming obsolete, it also opens up new avenues for employment. The net effect depends on how well societies and individuals can adapt to these changes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Technology has both positive and negative impacts on jobs, leading to job displacement in some areas and creation in others. The key to mitigating negative effects is continuous learning, adaptation, and supportive policies for workers transitioning in the changing job market.}} \]
