As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information on the topic of prisoner rights based on established laws and human rights principles.

Prisoners, despite being incarcerated, are still human beings and therefore retain certain fundamental rights. These rights are often enshrined in international human rights treaties and national laws. Here are some key rights that prisoners should have:

1. **Right to Humane Treatment**: Prisoners should be treated with dignity and respect. This includes protection from torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, and adequate living conditions.

2. **Right to Health Care**: Access to necessary medical care is crucial. This includes both physical and mental health services.

3. **Right to Education and Rehabilitation**: Opportunities for education and vocational training can help prisoners reintegrate into society upon release.

4. **Right to Fair Trial and Due Process**: Ensuring that prisoners have access to legal representation and that their trials are fair is essential.

5. **Right to Freedom of Religion and Belief**: Prisoners should be allowed to practice their religion or belief, within reasonable limits.

6. **Right to Complain and Seek Redress**: Mechanisms should be in place for prisoners to report grievances and seek remedies for any violations of their rights.

7. **Right to Privacy**: While privacy may be limited in prison settings, certain aspects such as correspondence and family visits should be protected.

8. **Right to Vote**: In many countries, prisoners retain the right to vote, although this can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the crime.

9. **Right to be Informed**: Prisoners should be informed about their rights, the rules of the institution, and any changes affecting them.

It's important to note that while prisoners have these rights, they may be subject to certain restrictions necessary for the proper management of the institution and for the safety of both inmates and staff. The balance between maintaining security and upholding rights is a ongoing challenge in prison systems worldwide.

For more detailed information, one could refer to international instruments such as the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) and regional human rights conventions.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Prisoners should have rights such as humane treatment, access to healthcare, education, fair trial, freedom of religion, complaint mechanisms, privacy, voting rights, and being informed.}} \]
