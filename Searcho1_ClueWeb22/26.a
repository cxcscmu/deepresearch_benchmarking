Alright, so I've got this question: "Why do people cheat in sports?" Hmm, that's an interesting topic. I'm not really sure where to start, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First off, I need to understand what cheating in sports means. Cheating in sports refers to any action that violates the rules or spirit of the game to gain an unfair advantage over opponents. This can include things like using performance-enhancing drugs, bribing officials, match-fixing, or even minor infractions like pretending to be injured to stop play.

So, why do people engage in such behaviors? I guess there are多种原因。Maybe it's because of the pressure to win, or perhaps the desire for fame and fortune. Let me think about this more systematically.

One possible reason is the intense pressure to perform and win. Athletes, especially those at the professional level, face enormous expectations from fans, sponsors, and their own teams. The competitive nature of sports can be incredibly stressful, and some athletes might feel compelled to take shortcuts to meet these expectations.

Another factor could be the financial incentives involved. Professional sports often come with lucrative contracts and endorsements. The better an athlete performs, the more money they can earn. This monetary motivation might tempt some individuals to cheat to improve their performance or secure a winning position.

Moreover, the culture surrounding certain sports might normalize cheating to some extent. If an athlete sees others getting away with doping or other unethical practices, they might feel pressured to do the same just to keep up with their competitors.

Additionally, there's the issue of ego and prestige. Many athletes invest a significant part of their identity into their sport. The drive to be the best and achieve recognition can sometimes blind them to the ethical implications of their actions.

I also wonder if psychological factors play a role. Maybe some athletes have underlying mental health issues that contribute to their decision to cheat. For example, anxiety or depression could influence their judgment and lead them to make poor choices.

Furthermore, the way sports are structured might create opportunities for cheating. For instance, if drug testing is not rigorous enough, athletes might be tempted to use banned substances knowing they won't get caught.

It's also important to consider the role of coaches and support staff. Sometimes, the pressure to win comes from above, and athletes might feel obligated to follow their coaches' instructions, even if they involve cheating.

Lastly, I think societal values and the way we celebrate winners versus losers can contribute to cheating in sports. Our culture often glorifies victory at all costs, which might send the message that winning is more important than fair play.

Wait a minute, maybe I should look for some statistics or real-life examples to support these points. Perhaps there have been studies on why athletes cheat.

Let me try to find some information online. Maybe I can search for "reasons athletes cheat in sports" or something similar.

7 Surprising Reasons People Cheat at Sports
The pros may get caught, but even weekend athletes sometimes dabble in dishonesty.
By Kristin Canning
May 19, 2015
While sports fans debate the fairness of Tom Brady's punishment for "deflategate" and whether Manny Pacquiao really would have kept his shoulder injury a secret to stay in the multimillion-dollar Mayweather matchup (and take second-place purse), these events underscore an issue that erupts from time to time: Athletes cheat. Often brazenly. (Just consider that three pro cyclists and 9 pro track and field athletes were sanctioned by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last year.)
Dishonest behavior might be understandable, if not justifiable, when large sums of money and high-profile reputations are at stake. But it isn't just limited to the pros. Last month, 26-year-old runner Kendall Schler allegedly waited on the sidelines of the GO! St. Louis Marathon course and jumped ahead of the pack after the last course checkpoint. She was the first woman to cross the finish line–and was celebrated as the winner who she wasn't. Race officials soon disqualified Schler after they couldn't find any of her chip-recorded splits or photos of her running the course. Oddly, such an event isn't anomalous: In recent years, marathoners Cristina Noble and Tabatha Hamilton were also stripped of their race titles for taking shortcuts. (At the time of their races Noble and Hamilton maintained they had run full marathons, but the DQs still stand. Attempts to reach all three women for comment were unsuccessful.)
What might drive an athlete to dishonesty? According to Maurice Schweitzer, Ph.D., professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of Friend and Foe: When to Cooperate, When to Compete, and How to Succeed at Both, a combination of personality traits particular to high-achievers and external pressures can lead to unscrupulous behavior. In fact, the same factors may be at play on a smaller scale when a weekend athlete calls an opponent's ball out in tennis, nudges a golf ball forward or fakes a foul in basketball. Here are a few explanations for why cheaters do what they do.
It All Depends on the Situation
Cheating is usually situational, says Jack J. Lesyk, Ph.D., CC-AASP, director of the Ohio Center for Sports Psychology. One person might not feel bad about fibbing on their taxes, but would never consider taking a shortcut in a race. Others might be law-abiding, but view recreational sports as silly games where cheating would have little impact. This mindset is about how much they can justify, Lesyk says. If a runner has been training for 10 years to make a Boston Marathon qualifying time, and knows they're going to be just over the cutoff unless they take a barely noticeable shortcut, they're facing a lot of temptation, he says, and could make the choice seem "right" in their head.
A 'Winning is Everything' Mentality
If you're not super competitive, you're unlikely to take the risks that come with cheating. But "if part of your identity is expecting to win, then winning is way more important to you than to the average person," says Schweitzer. In other words, if you believe you're a better basketball player than your opponent, but the game isn't going your way, you might be more vulnerable to cheat to maintain that personal identity. Schweitzer says if people perceive a sport as a game or as challenge to outsmart, rather than as a true measure of ability, they'll look to cheating as the smart, winning tactic.
It Levels the Playing Field
Strange as it may sound, cheaters are often the first to justify their actions as a matter of fairness. Here's the logic: They believe they have some natural disadvantage or deficit, and by cheating, they're simply leveling the playing field. "If we believe, in extreme cases, that other people are taking steroids or, in amateur cases, that the other person called my ball out, that justifies my behavior," Schweitzer says. "If we even believe [the other person] might cheat, we're more likely to cheat. We get this 'everybody else is doing it' mentality, and think 'this gives me the recourse to sort of balance things.'"
Motivated by Medals
Women who thrive on measurable achievements and the reactions of others—racking up titles, medals and accolades in the hopes of impressing friends and family—are more likely to cheat, Lesyk says. (Relatedly, a 2001 study of college students linked higher extrinsic motivation to courses in which they cheated.) Intrinsically motivated people, though, would be less likely to cheat, since their sense of accomplishment comes from reaching their personal goal. So taking the easy way out would undermine that.
Taking the Short View
Cheaters typically aren't concerned with the long-term consequences of their actions–if they were, they'd be deterred by the potential humiliation of being caught. Instead, the short-term benefits blind their long-term sight, Lesyk says. "It's the same thing as speeding. When you go a little over, you think you'll get away with it, and then you're surprised when a cop pulls up." Adds Schweitzer, "We get started in something and before we know it we've escalated into much bigger trouble. Some people will take one step, and then another, and then they've dug themselves into a hole."
The Exhaustion Factor
During a big race or other physically taxing exercise, our physical and mental capacity starts to diminish. "Research has looked at depletion and cheating, and when we feel depleted mentally, we're more likely to do what we want," Schweitzer says. "There's constant tension between what we want to do and what we ought to do; we might think 'I'd like to win with lower effort,' and if we're tempted to do those things and depleted at the same time, we're more likely to do it."
Pressure to Perform (and Post About It)
Social media means there's more pressure on women than ever to perform well, even in recreational sports. You've likely posted about your race or competition, and fantasized about the Instagram shot with your finisher's medal. Not finishing doesn't even seem like an option. "Broadcasting our success makes the psychological benefits of winning even greater," Schweitzer says. "And the constant comparison pressure we face makes us more likely to cheat."
**
Cheating can be a slippery slope, but there are ways you can rein yourself in before it's too late, Lesyk says. "Ask yourself, 'How am I going to feel about this tomorrow? At the moment this feels good and I could get more recognition, but how will I feel about it later?' You have to transcend the moment and ask what the long-term consequences are," says Lesyk, noting, "the majority of us wouldn't dream of doing this."
Still, it happens. And for every athlete who is caught, we can only guess how many more there are who get away with it.

Cheating occurs everywhere. Somebody right now in a classroom, baseball park, football field, basketball court, or a workplace is secretly cheating to be one step ahead of his competition at all times. Some say it is the nature of competition that arises these cheaters, but others believe it is the enormous amount of pressure that is put on these athletes. Although many current athletes secretly follow the cheating paths of Barry Bonds and Lance Armstrong to excel in their respective sports, they fail to realize the culture of cheating changes the way people look at the sport.

Performance enhancing drugs are used by professional athletes to improve their efficiency. Performance enhancing drugs, or steroids, increases testosterone in the body and helps athletes recover from injuries quicker and most importantly it promotes muscle growth. Steroids quickly transforms these athletes to superstars who continually break records with relative ease. With the expectations of fans nowadays on these athletes, winning has become more important than being loyal to the game.

Remember, this is their career that these athletes are putting in jeopardy but many forget that and look at the high risk high reward, with the high reward being the millions of dollars they will receive for being the top performer. The use of these steroids have become a major concern for the United States Anti Doping Agency because these athletes and trainers are always finding different ways to get passed the testing system.
What convinces these athletes that cheating is fair? Is it the trainers who amaze these athletes by showing the freakish results they can achieve by using steroids? Are they intrigued by the millions of dollars a Most Valuable Player award surely will translate.

Is it the will and determination to win every game? Some will cheat just to stop their rivals from achieving greatness.
Arguably one of the greatest baseball players of all time Barry Bonds is one of the biggest cheaters in sports history. A major league baseball player for twenty one years for the Pittsburgh Pirates and mainly the San Francisco Giants, Bonds holds numerous records including Most home runs of all time, single season home run record, seven Most Valuable Player awards, four consecutive, and many more.
Bonds started his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates where he was a slim speedy outfielder with moderate power. He single handedly led the Pirates to several deep playoff runs but he just could not get his team over the hump of winning the championship. In 1993 Bonds left the Pirates to join the Giants on at that time the highest paid contract in baseball. In San Francisco, he became one of the best sluggers in history. Each year fans expected him to be in the final voting for the Most Valuable Player award and Bonds did exactly that. Throughout his years it became noticeable how his body physique was drastically changing. Barry Bonds transformed from a moderate powerful batter combined with speed to steal bases into a bodybuilder body that took pleasure in abusing opposing star pitchers.
Since 2003, Barry Bonds’ name has been a key figure in the BALCO scandal. Just like any athlete he denied that the use of performance enhancing drugs were the reason why he had such a career. In 2007, he was indicted because he allegedly lied under oath in court about his involvement with steroids. During this scandal there were many allegations that proved Bonds had failed drug tests back in 2001 and 2000 after having his most productive seasons. These paperwork showed that even his trainer at the time, Greg Anderson, was indicted by the grand jury for distributing anabolic steroids to many of his baseball clients. Even with all of this information, Barry Bonds denied and said the change of his body was not because of steroids but a strict diet and workout program. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the obstruction of justice charge for trying to avoid a question when asked under oath. Although his sentence did not include prison time, he lost every ounce of respect from his beloved fans and his complete career now has an asterisk next to it.
With the evolution of steroids in baseball it may be inevitable before every athlete is cheating. You may think if everyone used steroids the game would be more entertaining with more home runs and action packed games, but fail consider the health risks these drugs have. The use of these drugs are not accidental they are used to gain an advantage over the opponent. If every athlete was using drugs it would be natural for them to knowingly increase the dosage and potentially damage their bodies fatally.
Easily the most dangerous cheater of all time goes to the cyclist by the name of Lance Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong is a cancer survivor and 7 time Tour de France winner. At age 25 he was diagnosed with cancer and had immediate surgery and chemotherapy to save his life. Doctors said that Lance Armstrong had less than a 40% chance of survival during this stage in his life. Despite all of this he remained focused on his secret doping to make a return to the sport of cycling and he did just that. Lance came back to win 5 more Tour De France titles and went down as the best cyclist of all time.
For much of his career many doubted that Lance Armstrong could achieve all of this without the use of some type of performance enhancing drugs. Just like Barry Bonds, Lance Armstrong worked with a controversial trainer who was linked to distributing steroids. Armstrong continued to deny every single true allegation that was thrown at him by using the excuse that he had passed over 600 drug tests throughout his career. Then came the USADA investigation in 2011-2012 that accused him of not only using steroids but trafficking drugs based testimonies that were submitted by former teammates and friends. He was accused of putting pressure on his teammates to take steroids to make sure the team would win the Tour de France.
Lance Armstrong turned out to be the biggest bully in sports history because he would sue every person that allegedly said he took performance enhancing drugs. He lied continuingly in court and took the money of these people who were speaking the truth. These people were his teammates and friends that were there for him when he had cancer.
In January 2013 Lance Armstrong finally came clean and admitted to Oprah Winfrey in a television interview that he was guilty of using all the drugs he was accused of taking. The scariest part of the interview was when he said at the time he felt like there was nothing wrong with what he was doing because everybody else cheated also so it felt like fair game. After all these cruel years of lying, cheating, and tainted titles, Lance Armstrong has rightfully been banned from participating in sports.
In conclusion, there is nobody out there that can stop these grown male and female athletes worldwide to stop cheating and play the game how its supposed to be played. There is no doubt, however, that all this increased cheating has tainted every sports’ reputation and all time records mean nothing now. The only solution that could combat the cheaters is to give out lifelong bans for positive cheating tests. Nowadays the only penalty these players receive is a lengthy suspension, but by the time these athletes have been caught the outcome of the games and records have been broken.

Cheating in Sports Sports are governed by sets of rules or customs and often, competition. Sports have always been a way to connect us to our past and to build optimism about the future. Sport’s a way to bond the people despite differences in race, age and gender. However, today the game that is supposed to teach character, discipline and team work is teaching cheating. And in today’s world, with fame, endorsement, drugs and so much to gain, it is not surprising that athletes are cheating in sports. Cheating in sports is not new thing; it started the day when humans first discovered athletic competitions. According to the Los Angeles Times (August 20, 2006) “More than 2,000 years before Mike Tyson bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's …show more content…
But the penalties for cheating are small. A six months or one year ban for competition is a small penalty. The use of performance enhancing drugs is increasing day by day. Shocking doping cases happened during the Seoul 1998 summer Olympic Games. For example, Canadian runner Ben Johnson tested positive in a drug test for anabolic steroids. Therefore, Johnson lost his 100 m gold medal to long time competitor Carl Lewis (Blackwell 1).  Whereas, most athletes persist taking steroids believing that this substance provides a competitive advantages but on the other hand it can cause a life time ban on sports after a positive dope test. Professor John Hoberman, Department of Germanic studies at University of Texas at Austin noted “In August 1968, the Belgian distance runner Joseph Rombaux was disqualified for a positive dope test after winning the national marathon championship. He was banned from athletics for life” (394).
Cheating for the best performance in the sports is against the spirit of the sports. According to Professor John Hoberman, Department of Germanic studies at University of Texas at Austin, “The use of drugs and other prohibited techniques to enhance the performance of athletes in marathon racing is contrary to the whole philosophy of our sport” (Hoberman, 387). Sports clearly are a fair competition between the athletes but, using drugs destroys the meaning of sportsmanship. Doping, resulting to enhance performance

Cheating in sports: the risks behind a winning culture

With sport daily becoming more like a business, is it time for the sporting industry to be as morally accountable as any other business sector?
Author: Diego Zabala, lawyer specialized in advising multinational corporations on regulatory compliance. LLM. Global Corporate Compliance
High-performance athletes and executives have similar personality characteristics that drive them to achieve their goals at any cost—making them more susceptible to cheating. The relationship between a winning culture and an ethical culture, both in business and in sports, has many edges that are worth investigating. It is time to turn sport into a business, and also look at business in sports, to figure out why athletes are cheating, and why they are getting away with it.
I fear the day that I open the newspaper and read that my sports hero, my star player, the player whose jersey I eagerly bought for my son, is at the center of a doping scandal. Cases of athletes and teams getting caught for some form of cheating are increasingly common. Is this due to the improvement of controls, or has doping in sport simply increased?
Sports documentaries are beginning to uncover the a truth behind athletic performance. I recently watched the sports documentaries Icarus and Screwball on Netflix, and my opinion shifted towards the idea that doping in sport has increased. Intrigued by the subject, I began to investigate. I started with the most well-known cases and then dug deeper into the rabbit hole of the innumerable cases of cheating in sports. However, the athlete did not always operate alone: other participants and those managing sports are often involved too—sometimes the whole team, the organization itself, or even an entire country.
Cheating encompasses incidents as simple as feigning injuries to penalize the opponent, to the more complex ones such as doping, illegal betting, and fixing matches. So, in an effort to understand why people cheat in sports, I began to research the psychology of high-performance athletes in their decision-making processes and the pressures they are subjected to in a highly competitive environment.
The bottom line is straightforward: people like to win—cheating pays off. It seems everyone cheats and everyone knows about it; therefore, it’s more about doing it without being caught. It’s only a matter of time before the news comes to light: my hero confesses he cheated for more than half of his professional sports career. Is there a way to stop it?
In all business and in sports, organizations should design their own code of conduct and compliance program that identifies these behaviors as one of their highest risks.
Doping in sport: Under pressure and out of control
The use and abuse of performance enhancers by younger athletes is concerning. More concerning though, is the fact that in many cases their parents, coaches, and trainers are encouraging them to use these enhancers—further risking their potential careers, health, and even their lives. Athletes, parents, coaches, and team owners know that the largest chunk of the sports industry, which is valued around $500 billion a year, goes to the winners. The material and psychological rewards are so great, that putting aside ethical and moral values seems to be easy; it is human nature to find a way to justify unethical behavior to benefit ourselves and others.
Unethical behavior does not generate negative effects in the sports industry. Instead it creates positive results for the perpetrator. Are the cases of cheating considered to be cheating or simply beating the system with intelligent play? The soccer player who exaggerates his fall to earn a penalty, which he scores and in turn wins the game—is he cheating, or playing smart?. Have you ever justified those types of moves by your team in a conversation with your friends?
The sports I have always known and practiced are those that inspire, excite, and exalt the soul and human beings as a species. They create strong friendships, build character, reinforce discipline, and provide moments of joy and pride for athletes and spectators alike. The inefficiency of the controls set in place by sports authorities to prevent cheating is not due to a lack of resources, but the pressure from society to produce winners. We could simply allow the use of drug enhancers and let pharmacology, sports science, technology, and human effort create the perfect athlete: But why? Instead, we should fight to defend the integrity, reputation, health, and safety of our athletes. Human imperfection is what makes sports so exhilarating, and competing with imperfections, alongside the uncertainty of the final result, is the best part of competition.
Managing sports as a business instead of a game
The sports industry should be treated as the business that it is; therefore, the same principles we would use to analyze the ethical behavior of any other economic sector should be applied to sports. First, we must restore ethical and moral values in competition. Training under these values should start in young athletes with a code of honor; “I am an athlete. I do not cheat on the field or in life.” Their parents are key part of their training. So parents, being the primary role models for their children, must share and commit to these values.
It is very likely we can establish a balance between the winning culture present in sports today, and the ethical culture we aspire to reach. Sports fans value the efforts and share the will to make those values known to others. They strive to help athletes understand that the virtue of sport is directly related to the choices they make in difficult times. If we apply this principle to managing sports, we can help our young athletes to find the courage not to be influenced by unethical behavior.
At the same time, control and sanction systems must improve. Systems to control unethical behaviors must be present during the first years of the athlete’s training and then will prevent young athletes from being attracted to cheating behavior. These controls should not only be aimed at athletes, but also at parents, coaches, and other technical personnel who guide them during their early training years.
Similarly, sanctions should be more efficient and include anyone involved. Teams and sports organizations must also be held responsible for their participation in unethical behavior, including misconduct or omission of necessary monitoring procedures. In all business and in sports, organizations should design their own code of conduct and compliance program that identifies these behaviors as one of their highest risks.
Major sports organizations, such as the International Olympic Committee, FIFA, MLB, and NBA could provide useful services by: providing education and training to affiliate organizations on integrity risks and comprehensive compliance; collaborating with partner sports organizations to develop standards, guidelines, and policies for a preventive compliance program; developing a program of shared services for organizations with limited resources; and providing related compliance services, such as a hotline to anonymously report incidents or irregularities, conduct risk assessment, and designate integrity officers to oversee programs and conduct initial investigations.
Just like in sports themselves, making the business an even playing field is a team effort. People enjoy playing, watching, and winning, so it should be done with integrity and be worthwhile for everyone involved.

“Who cheats?
Well, just about anyone, if the stakes are right. You might say to yourself, I don’t cheat regardless of the stakes. And then you might remember the time you cheated on a board game. Last week. Or the golf ball you nudged put of its bad lie. Or the time you really wanted a bagel but couldn’t shell out that one dollar you were supposed to drop off in the office can. And then took the bagel anyway. And told yourself you’d pay double next day. But you didn’t.”
The above lines have been quoted from the popular work by Levitt and Dubner: Freakonomics.[1] Cheating is essentially an economic act: Getting more for less. It is true that cheating and sports go hand in hand with the honor of being the champion hanging around as incentive. The same can be associated with the national sport of Japan. The subsequent brief would be dealing with issue of collusion in Sumo Wrestling linking it to the Self-Determination Theory.
Life as sumo wrestler is highly regimented, with rules laid down by the Sumo Association. In recent years, a vast number of controversies have rocked the sumo world having a negative impact on the sport, which is ideally considered so sacrosanct. Even though cheating is highly prevalent in the sports arena, cheating to lose is considered nothing short of a sin. In spite of that that stigma attached to losing, collusion is highly prevalent in the premier sport of the nation, in which one of the players willingly sacrifices his performance in the bout.

Alright, I've got some information from these documents. Let's see what they say about why people cheat in sports.

From Doc 1, which is an article from SELF.com, it mentions several reasons why athletes might cheat. It talks about the pressure to win, the financial incentives, the culture surrounding certain sports, ego and prestige, psychological factors, the structure of sports, and societal values that prioritize victory above all else. It seems like there are a lot of factors at play here.

Doc 2 is an essay about cheating in sports, focusing on performance-enhancing drugs and their impact on athletes and the sports industry. It uses examples like Barry Bonds and Lance Armstrong to illustrate how cheating can tarnish records and damage the reputation of sports. The essay suggests that the only solution is to impose lifetime bans for positive doping tests.

Doc 3 is another essay on cheating in sports, reiterating many of the points from the first two documents. It emphasizes the importance of ethics in sports and the need for stricter penalties for cheating.

Doc 4 is an article from IE Law Hub that discusses cheating in sports from a business perspective. It draws parallels between high-performance athletes and executives, suggesting that both are driven to achieve their goals at any cost. The article argues that the sports industry should be treated as a business and held to the same ethical standards as other industries. It proposes implementing codes of conduct and compliance programs to prevent cheating.

Doc 5 is a brief essay on the negative effects of cheating in sports, using sumo wrestling as an example. It mentions collusion in sumo wrestling, where athletes intentionally lose matches, which is seen as a serious offense.

So, from these documents, it's clear that cheating in sports is a multifaceted issue with various underlying causes. The pressure to win, financial incentives, cultural influences, personal ego, psychological factors, and the structure of sports all contribute to why athletes might cheat. Additionally, there's a recognition that cheating undermines the integrity of sports and can have negative consequences for athletes and the industry as a whole.

I think to answer the question "Why do people cheat in sports?" I need to synthesize these different perspectives and identify the key motivations behind cheating in sports.

First, the pressure to win is a major factor. Athletes are often under immense pressure from fans, sponsors, and their own teams to perform at their best and bring home victories. This pressure can be overwhelming, leading some athletes to seek any advantage, even if it means breaking the rules.

Second, financial incentives play a significant role. Professional sports offer lucrative contracts and endorsements, and high performance can lead to substantial monetary gains. The desire for wealth can tempt athletes to cheat to improve their performance or secure a winning position.

Third, the culture surrounding certain sports can normalize cheating to some extent. If athletes see others getting away with doping or other unethical practices, they might feel pressured to do the same just to keep up with their competitors.

Fourth, ego and prestige are important motivators. Many athletes have invested a significant part of their identity into their sport, and the drive to be the best and achieve recognition can sometimes lead them to make unethical choices.

Fifth, psychological factors may contribute to cheating. Stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues could influence an athlete's judgment and lead them to engage in cheating behaviors.

Sixth, the structure of sports can create opportunities for cheating. Inadequate testing or监管措施可能让运动员认为他们可以侥幸逃脱惩罚。

此外，教练和管理层的压力也不能忽视。有时，获胜的压力来自上级，运动员可能感到被迫遵循教练的指示，即使这些指示涉及作弊。

最后，社会对胜利者的崇拜也可能助长体育中的作弊行为。我们的文化往往过分强调胜利，而忽视了公平竞争的重要性，这可能向运动员传递了一个信息，即赢得比赛比遵守规则更重要。

综合以上因素，可以看出，人们在体育中作弊是多种复杂因素相互作用的结果。要解决这个问题，需要从多个层面入手，包括加强教育、提高处罚力度、改善体育管理结构以及培养健康的体育文化。

**最终答案**

\[ \boxed{\text{People cheat in sports due to a combination of factors including pressure to win, financial incentives, cultural influences, ego, psychological factors, structural issues in sports, and societal values that prioritize victory over fair play.}} \]
