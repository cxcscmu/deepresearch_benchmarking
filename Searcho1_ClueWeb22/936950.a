So I need to talk about how conflict is presented in Romeo and Juliet. I haven't read the play in ages, so I need to refresh my memory. Let me think about what I remember.

I know that Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy by William Shakespeare about two young lovers whose families are feuding. So, the main conflict seems to be between the Montagues and the Capulets. But there are probably other conflicts within the play as well.

Maybe I should start by identifying the different types of conflict in the play. I recall that conflict in literature can be between characters, between a character and society, or even within a character themselves.

First, there's the obvious conflict between the Montague and Capulet families. They hate each other, and this feud affects everyone in their households, including Romeo and Juliet. This is an external conflict between groups.

Then, there's the conflict within Romeo himself. He's torn between his love for Juliet and his loyalty to his friends, especially after Mercutio is killed. Similarly, Juliet struggles with obeying her parents' wishes and pursuing her love for Romeo.

Also, there's the conflict between the young lovers and their families. Since the families hate each other, their love is forbidden, which creates a lot of tension and problems for Romeo and Juliet.

Moreover, there are conflicts between characters, like Romeo and Tybalt, who represent the rival families. Their animosity leads to fatal consequences.

I should probably look up some quotes or scenes that illustrate these conflicts to make my points clearer.

Let me try to structure this. Maybe I can discuss the play act by act, highlighting where conflicts are presented.

In Act 1, Scene 1, we see the Montagues and Capulets' servants fighting in the streets of Verona. This shows the longstanding feud between the families. Even the Prince warns them that further disturbances will result in severe punishment.

Then, Romeo is melancholic because he's in love with Rosaline, who doesn't reciprocate his feelings. This is an internal conflict for him.

In Act 1, Scene 2, Paris asks Lord Capulet for Juliet's hand in marriage, but she's only thirteen and her father suggests waiting a bit. This sets up a potential conflict between Juliet and her family regarding her marriage.

In Act 1, Scene 5, Romeo and Juliet meet at the Capulet ball and fall in love instantly, not knowing each other's identities. When they discover who each other are, they realize the conflict between their families.

Romeo decides to secretly marry Juliet, with Friar Lawrence's help, hoping to end the feud. But this act only complicates things further.

In Act 3, Scene 1, Tybalt challenges Romeo to a duel, but Romeo refuses to fight because he's now related to Tybalt through his marriage to Juliet. Mercutio steps in and fights Tybalt, leading to Mercutio's death. Then, Romeo kills Tybalt in revenge, which leads to his banishment.

This scene illustrates multiple conflicts: between Romeo and Tybalt, between Mercutio and Tybalt, and internally for Romeo, who has to choose between his friendship with Mercutio and his new alliance with Juliet's family.

In Act 3, Scene 2, Juliet is desperate to see Romeo before he's exiled. Their love is tested by the external conflict of their families' hatred.

In Act 3, Scene 3, Friar Lawrence gives Romeo advice and a plan to be with Juliet, showing another aspect of the conflict: the characters trying to find a way out of their problematic situation.

In Act 4, Scene 1, Paris visits Lord Capulet to discuss marrying Juliet, but Juliet refuses, leading to a conflict with her father.

In Act 4, Scene 2, Juliet is in distress and seeks help from Friar Lawrence, who gives her a potion to fake her death to avoid marrying Paris. This adds another layer of conflict and danger to the plot.

In Act 5, Scene 1, Romeo mistakenly hears that Juliet is dead and buys poison to kill himself.

In Act 5, Scene 3, everyone converges at the Capulet tomb, leading to a series of tragic events.

So, throughout the play, conflict is presented in various forms: familial feuds, romantic obstacles, internal struggles, and fatal duels. These conflicts drive the plot forward and lead to the tragic ending.

Perhaps I should also consider the themes that Shakespeare explores through these conflicts. For example, the theme of hate versus love, where the enduring hate between the families contrasts with the powerful love between Romeo and Juliet.

Additionally, the theme of fate plays into the conflicts, as the characters seem to be destined for tragedy despite their efforts to overcome their circumstances.

I might want to look up some critical analyses or summaries of the play to get a better understanding and perhaps some quotes that emphasize the conflicts.

Wait, maybe I should perform a web search to find more information about conflict in Romeo and Juliet.

Let me try that.

The main conflict in the play is undoubtedly that between the two warring Verona families, the Montagues and the Capulets. These noble houses have been at each other's throats for years and there's no sign of their monumental feud coming to an end any time soon.
It is against the backdrop of this epic, never-ending conflict that the action of the play takes place. Virtually everything in Romeo and Juliet, whether it's the illicit nature of the eponymous characters' relationship, the killing of Mercutio and Tybalt, or the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet themselves, would be impossible without the existence of the raging feud that has wrought such merry havoc on the streets of Verona.
To be sure, there is much conflict in the play, but practically all of it ultimately derives from the biggest and most damaging conflict of all: that between the Montagues and the Capulets. This highlights the extent to which the feud contaminates all aspects of life in Verona. It also shows us the ultimate impossibility of Romeo and Juliet's passionate relationship becoming accepted in society, despite the extraordinary power of their love. They are both doomed to suffer a tragic death because their families detest each other.

In my opinion, the major conflict in Romeo and Juliet is the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets. Evidence for this theory is given in the prologue to the play.
"Two households, both alike in dignity
(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove."
The conflict is described as ancient, and the play opens with a new mutiny born of this ancient grudge. The prologue suggests that their love is doomed from the start by Romeo and Juliet's parents' anger, which nothing could stop, except for the deaths of their children.
The events of the play begin with a brawl in the town center between servants of the house of Montague and Capulet. The prince threatens both families with the punishment of death if the streets are disturbed in this way again.
The conflict between Tybalt and Romeo comes from the feud between these two families. Tybalt is insulted that Romeo and his friends come uninvited to a party thrown by the Capulets. He entices Romeo to fight, but Romeo refuses. Romeo's quick-tempered friend Mercutio doesn't resist fighting, and Mercutio is tragically killed when Romeo tries to stop the fight.
In response to his friend's death, Romeo seeks revenge and kills Tybalt. This results in his banishment from Verona. Romeo and Juliet have already secretly married at this point, so the friar concocts a plan to fake Juliet's death so that she can escape with Romeo because the two are inconsolable. This plan would have worked, but the communication the friar sends to Romeo never reaches him. When Romeo finds Juliet dead, he kills himself. She awakens to find him dead and kills herself. They are so desperate to be together that they can't imagine life without each other. They can't tell anyone in their family about their love because of the feud between the families.
In the end, through the death of the two young lovers, their parents are able to make peace. But this peace comes at a tragic price. At the root, all the deaths in this play are a result of the ancient conflict between the Capulets and the Montagues.

The central conflict in Romeo and Juliet is different from the central conflict in most of Shakespeare's plays. In this play the conflict is not between Romeo and Juliet or between one of them and some other character. They are two young lovers whose lives are ruined by a conflict that has been going on between their families, the Montagues and the Capulets, for many years. In this respect the play resembles an epic in which the lives of relatively powerless humans are affected by the clash of powerul forces, such as the war between the Greeks and Trojans in Homer's Iliad or the war between the North and South in Gone With  the Wind. Neither Romeo nor Juliet can be called the protagonist or antagonist in Shakespeare's play. The heads of their families are the protagonist and antagonist, and it would seem that the head of the Capulet family (Juliet's) would be considered the protagonist and the other the antagonist, because the Capulet's cause the problem by trying to force their daughter to marry Paris. Tolstoy's masterpiece War and Peace is another example of a literary work in which the protagonist and antagonist, France and Russia, are clashing over greater issues than those affecting the small, individual characters portrayed.

The Theme of Conflict in…
In the play Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare examines the conflict between the Montagues and Capulets both internally and externally; displaying various types of conflict which can be seen in the deaths of Tybalt, Mercutio, and Paris due to toxic masculinity and male bravado. Romeo and Juliet’s relationship faces obstacles due to the animosity and predestined fate between the Montagues and Capulets, despite their affection and sensualism.
Shakespeare wrote the play between 1591-1595 and has set it in Verona and Mantua, Italy, during the Italian renaissance period however the audience was from the Elizabethan era specifically in the 1300s or 1400s thus this is important because it highlights the setting that the play was set in, explaining the culture, religion and closed mindset of the audience.

The prologue of Romeo and Juliet represents the theme of conflict through various language and structural techniques. Composed as a sonnet that is made up of 14 lines; 3 quatrains and a couplet. The couplet portrays how Romeo and Juliet will commit suicide together in the denouement, which additionally acts as a break between the consistent quatrains of the prologue.
Shakespeare uses synecdoche ‘where civil blood makes civil hands unclean’ implying how the individual’s hands and blood are linked through death, displaying the use of foreboding because it reiterates how the use of word choice could display the impact of actions later in the play. Repetition of “civil” could refer to the people that the family feud affects and how it leads to dire consequences; therefore, emphasising how societal conflict has an impact on the conflict of power and how the patriarchy was divided in 1597, as Catholicism supports patriarchal societies; the most prominent and powerful positions in this religion are only awarded to males.
The use of the metaphor ‘where civil blood makes civil hands unclean’ reveals that people’s emotions can cause conflict. The predicative adjective ‘unclean’ reveals that many of these people are to blame for these ongoing violent feuds, it could also highlight how this behaviour is contagious. The second quatrain shifts to internal conflict relating to Romeo and Juliet’s death conveying emotional and moral conflict. In addition, societal conflict is linked to religious conflict, the metaphor ‘a pair of star-cross’d lovers’ emphasises that they are destined to be together as it is written in the stars – Calvinism was widespread by the mid 16th century which became the centre of the highly organized missionary movement due to his theory of Predestination based on how our fate has been written before we were born.
The Elizabethan audience would be able to perceive ‘pre-destined’ fate as the prologue introduces the theme of tragedy where the lovers are named ‘star-cross’d’ and’ death-mark’d’. In the 1st quatrain the conflict focuses on external and physical conflict as it displays the hunger for power between the Montagues and the Capulets. Shakespeare rhymes ‘dignity’ with ‘mutiny’ displaying the connotations of compliment or prestige while mutiny shows the true character of the families, as when there is good there is also evil. Juxtaposition between grudge (passive) and mutiny (active) reveals this conflict is irreversible because of the word choice displaying passive and active; relates to the conflict being inevitable.
The third quatrain is focused on the aftermath of Romeo and Juliet’s death causing internal conflict between the parents – this shift occurs because it portrays the different conflicts that the characters are exposed to, this is displayed when stated ‘And the continuance of their parents’ rage’, the noun “rage” signifies the internal conflict that the parents are facing after the death of Romeo and Juliet.
Catholicism in Verona, Italy held a strong belief in damnation because of moral sin such as bigamy and suicide; the fact that Juliet commits suicide implies how religious conflict is going to be displayed throughout the play. This displays religious conflict as Juliet’s actions against Catholicism in Verona had a big impact on the feud between the families, as it was more fuel being added to the fire.
The iambic pentameter displayed throughout the prologue creating a heartbeat rhythm due to the 10 syllables which is consistent through the sonnet, displaying the theme of emotional conflict as the heartbeat symbolises the flow of love throughout the prologue juxtaposed with the word choice and semantic field of violence, creating an emotional conflict.
On the contrary, there are parts in the quatrain where the syllables don’t flow, forming a break portraying the conflict that is going to be faced within Romeo and Juliet’s love, such as parental conflict and emotional conflict.
As it breaks away from the normal conventions of a sonnet which displays how it goes against romanticism. The direct address to the audience in the final couplet draws back the audience’s attention and enforces them to engage with the play; even though love is positive however it is still doomed hence explains the stopping of the heart. Trochee rhyme is used to help certain words appear more prominent; this is seen in the first line through the vocabulary ‘Two’, ‘alike’ and ‘dignity’.
The rhyme scheme focuses on stressed syllables such as ‘dignity’ and ‘mutiny’ which are juxtaposing nouns as part of the rhyme scheme. Thus, to a certain extent the word choice is alternating. The juxtaposition of word choice between negatives and positives as it portrays where there is good, there is always evil. Vocabulary used such as ‘life’ and ‘strife’ displays a sense of conflict as strife means conflict, so by rhyming life and strife this displays that there is conflict in their lives, which is presented between the parents as well as Romeo and Juliet’s love.
In Act 1 Scene 1, women are represented as derogatory individuals at the bottom of the social patriarchy; toxic masculinity and male bravado causes internal and external conflict throughout the first act, due to the superior gender of males. When Sampson is arguing with Gregory, he states, ‘women being the weaker vessels’ as ‘weaker’ is part of the lexical field of weakness ‘weakest’ and ‘weak’ thus diminishing their reputation as it is highly offensive; it foreshadows conflict of power between the two genders.
Shakespeare has a direct link to the Book of Genesis from the noun ‘vessels’ when Cain was in exile implying which direction the play will flow in as it portrays how Romeo might get exiled. Sampson then states ‘thrust his maids to the wall’ this portrays male bravado as well as sexual bravado, the verb ‘thrust’ portrays sexual connotations which links to when Lamech brags about killing the younger of his two wives. The audience would perceive this as foreshadowing the events that might occur with Romeo, such as Cain being exiled.
Furthermore, it is a direct link to how Shakespeare portrays toxic masculinity and how women are perceived as a stereotype for the men to provide the children as Eve from the Bible is portrayed in a negative light as she commits a sin as well as misleading mankind. Gregory on the other hand states ‘while you live, draw your neck out of collar.’
The nouns ‘neck and collar’ display a semantic field of zoomorphism in which there is a modification of human to animal suggesting a ‘dog’ where the repetition of the noun ‘dog’ displays egotistical aggressiveness; a ‘dog’ is usually on the bottom of the social hierarchy. The ‘neck and collar’ is also a semantic field of a noose where he is warning that his actions could lead to his downfall, so the playful boisterous tone encourages an impulsive nature.
The adjective “fair” has two different meanings: “beautiful” and “just.” This second meaning indicates that the Prince of Verona (who enforces the law) does not favour one family over the other as both families are treated equally; this opening line reveals that the two families have equal social status and respect. It is like fate that one house has never been able to rise above the other.
Whenever one house attempts to gain social standing or wealth, like when Capulet tries to marry off Juliet to Paris, it leads to destruction (Romeo murders Paris), therefore physical conflict. Both households slowly erode their honor until it is crushed by the death of both heirs, Romeo of Montague, and Juliet of Capulet.
‘Two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, ‘grace and rude will’ the use of juxtaposition in ‘Where there is good there is evil’ which links to the prologue to display a consistent theme of conflict of word choices. In addition, the nouns ‘dignity’ and ‘mutiny’ display juxtaposition implying conflict which could be natural due to the use of herbs, a natural factor, implying that grace and rude will are natural to mankind. The structure of the play portrays good and evil, throughout the play from the prologue to Act 2, scene 3 with Friar Lawrence, further displaying religious conflict.
‘Kings’ could represent an ideology behind the word king to represent the social patriarchy and the 2 families. “For this alliance may so happily prove to turn your households’ rancor to pure love’ displays a positive semantic field of happiness in the words ‘happily, pure and love’ as Friar Lawrence is a character that tries to maintain the peace.
Friar Lawrence foreshadows and forebodes their ending while marrying them which links to Calvinism and how Romeo and Juliet’s fate is written in the stars; ‘star cross’d lovers’. In addition, ‘star cross’d lovers’ defines Romeo and Juliet’s fate which links to Freudian’s Theory. Freud states that the unconscious mind controls behaviour to a greater level than people suspect. In addition, Freud found that after experiencing trauma, people are more aggressive, violent and display self-destructive behaviour.
Thus, foreboding the death of the couple and how Juliet stabbed herself displaying the misery and agony she was in. Furthermore, Pyramus and Thisbe were Babylonian star crossed lovers that are described by Ovid; they commit double suicide. This symbolises the double suicide Romeo and Juliet which is a direct link to Pyramus and Thisbe; Shakespeare modified Pyramus and Thribe’s tragedy into Romeo and Juliet in Medieval Verona.
In Act 2 Scene 3, Tybalt displays his hate towards Romeo by insulting him in a public place. Tybalt states ‘the love I bear thee’ portraying the use of metaphor and implying the lack of love he holds for Romeo. The reason Tybalt insults him in a public space to further display toxic masculinity and male bravado. Tybalt is holding in his anger, the buildup of rage and intensity over the scenes caused him to unleash his anger. The reason he insults him is because he was held back by Lord Capulet from Romeo at the Capulet’s party so when he encounters him he unleashed his anger.
READ:
Romeo and Juliet: Act III, Scene V Analysis
Dramatic irony is present in the marriage of Romeo and Juliet which is portrayed through the vehicle of Tybalt, where he states ‘It will be endured’ in Act 2, Lord Capulet to Tybalt, as the verb ‘endure’ implies suffering so Tybalt foreshadows that Romeo and Juliet will face obstacles and difficulties along their journey. In Act 3 Scene 1, the use of word choice affects the tone of the scene which also impacts the atmosphere. Thus, the semantic field of love is displayed when Romeo is talking to Tybalt explaining his love to the Capulets; such as ‘love, tender and satisfied’.
Romeo states ‘which name I tender’ displays dramatic irony as the audience knows Romeo and Juliet are married but Tybalt doesn’t know. This is juxtaposed with a semantic field of violence; which is presented through the vehicle of Tybalt. Tybalt uses nouns such as ‘villain, injuries and draw’. Tybalt continues to diminish Romeo’s status by using the noun ‘boy’, the derogatory language represents toxic masculinity as it portrays that Romeo isn’t masculine enough to be considered as a man.
The audience engages with the play through Mercutio’s dramatic tone when saying ‘O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!’, the use of the exclamation mark further displays the violence in Mercutio’s tone as the stressed vowels and caesura demonstrates the climax within Mercutio’s vigorous tone as it exemplifies his anger, throughout the scene Mercutio builds up tension through his tone and word choice as the climactic parts of the play fluctuate in order to keep the audience engaged.
Therefore, he calls Tybalt ‘Good King of Cats’ to taunt him by stating that Tybalt is a cat and a coward, complementary to ‘Reynard the Fox’ where the first extant versions were published mid of the 12th century. Mercutio does this in order to emasculate Tybalt thus provoking a fight. In addition, Mercutio also yells to Tybalt saying ‘you rat-catcher’ which portrays how Tybalt is at the bottom of the social hierarchy, as when the Black Plague occurred between 1347 – 1351 the cats would catch rats.
Therefore, spreading the disease which is why it insults Tybalt as Shakespeare continuously embeds toxic masculinity and the rivalry between the Capulets and Montagues. Romeo juxtaposes this attitude as he says to Tybalt ‘To such a greeting. Villain am I none;’ the use of personal pronouns ‘I’ and ‘thee’ to show how he is connected to the Capulets; displaying dramatic irony as the audience knows that Romeo and Juliet are married so they are connected.
Romeo shows toxic masculinity but isn’t stereotypical as the rest so he could possibly be representing Shakespeare’s emotions and ideology as Romeo breaks away from normal conventions.
Juliet’s soliloquy delivered in the opening of Act 3 Scene 2 makes allusions to Phoebus as she displays her strong desire for nightfall; ‘Toward Phoebus’ lodging. Such a wagoner’. Phoebus is an allusion to Apollo, the Greek god of the sun. Apollo is portrayed in myth as driving a chariot, Phaeton, that regulates the sun’s rising and setting. Juliet wishes for the sun to fall in this beginning of her monologue and the night to come. She is also asking the, metaphorical, horses of Apollo to go to his home; which is another way of suggesting that she needs the sun to go down. She needs the “steeds” of Apollo to go west quickly and “bring in a cloudy night”.
She hopes to rush away for the rest of the day so that she can see Romeo earlier. That night, they made a date to meet, and Juliet is excited to step towards that moment and is eager to wait. Using metaphor and personification, Juliet goes on to speak in praise of the night. She equates Romeo with night: “Come, night. Come, Romeo.” Juliet needs the aid of Apollo, for as soon as she wishes it to, the day will not naturally end. How desperately Juliet needs to be with Romeo displays internal conflict and dilemma between her thoughts which is emphasized by the allusion to Greek mythology.
In Act 3 Scene 5, internal and external conflict displayed through the vehicle of Juliet while gender conflict, parental conflict is displayed between Juliet and her parents.
The reason Juliet faced parental conflict with her father mainly is because she refused to marry Paris. Elizabethan women had very little choice in husbands as marriages were arranged by their families in order to bring prestige or wealth to the families involved; women were required to be subservient to their husbands as it was believed men were more intelligent than women so many young men and women didn’t meet their spouses until their wedding day.
Marriage was considered more of a business arrangement between the families than a relationship between a man and a woman. Elizabethan law gave men full control over their wives. Married women were considered to be the property of their husbands and were expected to bring a dowry or marriage portion (property, money and various goods) to the marriage. Elizabethan wives were also required to run the household and bare children. Marriage in Elizabethan times was considered a necessity.
Women who didn’t marry were considered sacrilegious, and for lower class women, the only alternative was a life of servitude to wealthier families. Marriage allowed them social status and children. While the husbands received the marriage portion from their wives, marriage allowed a woman to maintain a certain status even if she became a widow. Widows were allowed to own property and run businesses.
When Lady Capulet states ‘That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;’ the use of caesura allows the reader to focus on Tybalt’s name which triggers Juliet’s internal conflict as Juliet is haunted by Tybalt’s death as she feels guilt towards his death. The metaphor of death and pathetic fallacy is displayed through the vehicle of Lord Capulet but it could be foreshadowing the disaster which will unfold ‘When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew’ the alliteration of ‘D’ creates a dismal effect on the audience suiting the character of Lord Capulet.
Religious symbolism is displayed when Juliet is appearing to pray to her father as she begs for mercy; ‘Good father, I beseech you on my knees,’. Juliet represents that the patriarchal society and the feud between the families is causing her internal conflict. In a dramatic irony context, the way Lord Capulet
is treating Juliet is in a way punishing her for marrying Romeo. Her marrying Romeo is considered morally wrong due to society’s views on women. However, ethically it is not wrong and therefore it is not a sin. Thus, she has not committed a sin despite that she is desperate for her father’s forgiveness.
When Lord Capulet yells at Juliet saying, ‘Disobedient wretch!’ obedience is associated with tamed animals suggesting zoomorphism where she is an animal that is tamed going out of control. An extended metaphor that Lord Capulet is the master of the dog. In the Elizabethan era the dogs were at the bottom of the social hierarchy and so Lord Capulet is implying that his daughter is also a dog. Therefore, degrading her position in social hierarchy.
The patriarchy is also displayed through the ‘Book of Genesis’ 30:3 ‘Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her’ which further displays Juliet’s action of going on her knees and begging for her father’s mercy similarly to how the ‘Book of Genesis’ states that the maid Bilhah ‘shall bear upon my knees’. Juliet yells at her mother saying, ‘Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him!’ an intense atmosphere is portrayed due to the exclamation marks in the caesura which emphasises the building up of tension.
Also, the term ‘slaughter’d, baggage, wretched and hang’ displays connotations of death which forebodes Juliet’s suicide in addition to further emphasising the negative and tense atmosphere in the scene. Lord Capulet is not sympathetic towards Juliet’s situation and he implies that she is a burden with the use of inclusive pronouns in ‘And that we have a curse in having her.’; Capulet is revealing to his daughter how he and his wife may be regretful about not having a son.
Furthermore, Syntactic parallelism is presented through ‘Speak not, reply not’ to further emphasize how Juliet’s voice and opinion is unwanted, gender conflict was displayed through the play as the Elizabethan audience would understand why Lord Capulet and Lady Capulet would want a son over a daughter.
However, a modern audience would not understand why men are preferred over women: which would be classified as male dominance, toxic masculinity, and patriarchal issues: they are displayed through Lord Capulet as he is speaking for his wife. Juliet could be a catalyst to Shakespeare’s marriage as Shakespeare’s own ideology is embedded through the vehicle of Juliet.
In conclusion, there are various ways of interpreting Romeo and Juliet; some may think Shakespeare is projecting the fact that no one is immune to conflict therefore we all have resentment within us as conflict is unavoidable as we see it in terms of opposites, human beings will still be in conflict with each other: good and evil, right and wrong, however, the need for reconciliation is conveyed by Shakespeare.
For the Elizabethan audience, the play successfully dramatizes conflict as they were familiar with conflict around them, while today the play is important as it highlights conflicts in matters such as family feud, politics, culture, and religion. Both Romeo and Juliet died at the end of the play, there is an immense amount of irony that death meant peace between the Montagues’ and the Capulets’ two homes. Eventually, these lovers manage to unite the family in sorrow and settle the long-standing dispute.

Theme of conflict William Shakespeare “Romeo and Juliet”
Romeo and Juliet
Introduction
Life has got many challenges that often lead to never ending forms of conflicts. The conflicts could be between different families, various persons, dissimilar ideas or even internal conflict when a person is in a given dilemma. This study discusses the theme of conflict as built by William Shakespeare in his play “Romeo and Juliet” particularly focusing on the conflict between parents and their children.
Romeo and Juliet
Williams Shakespeare builds up the plot of his play based on numerous conflicts that cloud the play from the start to the end.  The disputes are of varied nature ranging from family versus family conflict to parent versus child conflict and the language versus internal conflict within the act (“The Conflict in Romeo and Juliet English Literature Essay”, 2018). This author builds this theme of conflicts as a way of reminding his audience of the Renaissance period where there were existing wars amongst the European nations resulting from the heated political atmosphere at that time.

Shakespeare highlights the conflict between the children and their parents as one of his key area of conflicts. The entire play is characterized by cases of conflicts between parents and their children. Some of the cases where the concept of the conflict between the parent and the children is evident are in the Capulet’s family where there is major disagreement between Juliet and her parents. The epitome of this discord is brought to the fore when Lord Capulet dares to disown Juliet after they had a major dispute concerning the choice of a suitor for Juliet.  This is because he felt he had every right as a father to choose a husband that would match Juliet.  Lord Capulet was utterly angered that he uttered abusive words towards Juliet as he confronted her saying, “Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch…”  (“The Conflict in Romeo and Juliet English Literature Essay”, 2018).Again, he almost clinched his fist for a physical fight. Lord Capulet says “My fingers.” Implying that he felt like clinching his fist for a physical fight with anyone.  According to him, he had chosen the correct man of valor for Juliet, yet she rejected the man chosen for her. A woman going against the will of her father was uncalled for during these Elizabethan times, yet Juliet was boldly countering her father that she did not want his choice. As it were during those days, Juliet was supposed to obey her father and follow his wishes.
Furthermore, William Shakespeare shows the conflict between Romeo and his parents whereby Romeo does not believe he can open up to his parents about his troubles. Lord Montague tries in vain to convince Romeo to tell them what was troubling him after they noticed sudden changes in his moves.  His parents had seen him cry and he stayed till late outside and slept during day time. The fact that Romeo could not trust his parents with his hard times conveys a message of conflict and mistrust between them. When Benvolio asks Lord Montague if he had implored Romeo regarding his state, he says,” As is a bud bit with an envious worm…” thus comparing Romeo’s young age with a bud that he is troubled by his sorrows(“Shakespeare’s Words | Romeo and Juliet | William Shakespeare”, 2018). In this conversation, he admits that he does not understand what is bedeviling Romeo.
Conclusion
In conclusion, William Shakespeare uses his prowess in the work of art to portray the effects of family feuds. Throughout this play, the consequences of not letting children be independent in their own choices are shown as prolonged family feuds. Romeo and Julie convey messages of various forms of conflicts between parents and their children which bring about unhealthy relationship within the family.

Conflict in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and…
During 1591 and 1595, William Shakespeare wrote the play “Romeo and Juliet” set in thirteenth-century Verona. As one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays out of thirty-eight, it tells of the tragedy of two star-crossed lovers who meet and fall in love. However, as pure as their love is, in the end, everything goes wrong because of the bitter feud between the two houses, Montague and Capulet.
The sixteenth-century play explores how conflict causes verbal, physical, and emotional conflict. The Elizabethan play explores the link between the effects of the character’s relationship through conflict. Conflict is an important theme in the play as it creates drama to keep the audience interested. Many of the scenes contain various conflicts such as Act 3 scene 1, Act 3 scene 2, Act 4 scene 2 and Act 5 scene 3.

In Act 3 scene 1, Shakespeare explores the nature and aftermath of conflict through Mercutio and Tybalt hubris showing it has an effect of drama and rage on the characters. For example, Mercutio says,” Tybalt you rat-catcher, will you walk?”
This shows an attempt to lower Tybalt’s pride. The reason for this sudden outburst is because of Romeo’s refusal to fight because he is married to Juliet therefore he does not want to fight his cousin-in-law. Mercutio tries to protect Romeo’s pride by challenging Tybalt to a duel.
Although the brawl between Tybalt and Mercutio is to demean each other’s pride, the main reason is to stand up for Romeo, Mercutio’s friend. As a prestigious young man, Mercutio is egotistical in his ways causing him to challenge people especially Tybalt who he finds arrogant and annoying.
The phrase “Will you walk” is a conventional phrase meaning let’s go someplace where we can settle this. Although Mercutio doesn’t want to “Walk” anyplace-he wants to fight Tybalt in the street. This is driven by Mercutio’s short-temper and hubris.
The word “Rat-catcher” is a sneer at Tybalt’s name because it is the same name given to the King of Cats in the beast fable of Reynard the Fox. Another interpretation of the word “rat-catcher” implies that Mercutio is witty as it is a metaphor for Tybalt’s name. Tybalt is not a “rat-catcher” but his name suggests that of a cat.
Like Tybalt himself, the name origin is the Medieval form of Theobald meaning “from bold people” which suggests where Tybalt gets his aggressive and confident personality. This creates an effect on the audience by creating the link between drama and conflict. It was important to create drama within the Shakespearean plays so as to not bore the audience.
It also magnifies the atmosphere of a tragedy creating that pull and engaging feeling to the audience. Another way of showing this is when Mercutio declares,” Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives that I mean to make bold withal.” This suggests the rise in Mercutio confidence. Mercutio sees another opportunity to deliver a witty insult towards Tybalt so he does. Mercutio threatens to take “one of your nine lives”. He says this with confidence as if it is necessary to do so.
Once again this is an attempt to damage Tybalt’s hubris. During the thirteenth century, men’s hubris was taken very seriously. Every man wanted more pride than the other and you were thought of as unworthy if you didn’t try to protect your honour. Damaging another man’s pride increased your own which is why both Mercutio and Tybalt end up fighting.
To refuse a fight would be unheard of in the 1200s. Mercutio is a loyal and good friend so he steps up to the challenge of defending Romeo by being his witty and optimistic self. The phrase, “Good king of cats” suggests Mercutio’s ongoing wit. He uses this metaphor to try and win over Tybalt with wordplay.
The phrase, “one of your nine lives” has two interpretations. The first is Mercutio’s use of wordplay to gain validation and the second is he uses it as a threat. Tybalt doesn’t have nine lives so Mercutio is basically telling Tybalt that he will beat him down. Mercutio then follows this with “and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight.” He is telling Tybalt that if he isn’t satisfied with the way Tybalt treats him, then he will “dry-beat” the rest of him.
The effect on the audience is it excites them as it creates lots of drama. Therefore, Shakespeare presents conflict in Act 3 scene 1 as verbal conflict due to the brawl between Mercutio and Tybalt in an attempt to damage each other’s Hubris.
Alternatively, In Act 3 scene 1, Shakespeare presents conflict through the Irony and Humour of Mercutio. For example, once Mercutio has been stabbed he says, “A plague a’both your houses! I am sped” With a hole in his heart, Mercutio will be dead in less than three minutes and he begins to suspect the truth at once.
Mercutio feels cheated and chagrined. He then curses the two houses. He implies that neither the house of Capulet nor the house of Montague is worth dying for. Mercutio is neither Capulet nor Montague but he is related to the prince as well as County Paris. He “plagues” the houses because Romeo did not stand up for his honor and he feels annoyed that Tybalt got away without a scratch.
He blames his death on the feud. He then repeats this curse, it not only reinforces the damage caused by the families’ conflict but it also emphasizes that the curse is intended for both Capulet and Montague -each house must take responsibility to end the conflict. Mercutio becomes the voice of fate. The phrase, “I am sped”, means I am finished, this shows that Mercutio understands that he is going to die so he tells Romeo and Benvolio who seem to remain clueless about his wound.
Mercutio sends his page for a Doctor while Romeo reassures his friend by saying, “Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.” This suggests that Romeo doesn’t understand that Mercutio’s wound is that bad. Clothes during the thirteenth century especially for a rich man like Mercutio would be thick with lots of layers so the wound would not be that noticeable. He says to Mercutio to have the courage and stay strong. The use of pathos in “The hurt cannot be much,” suggests that Romeo is trying to laugh it off by saying it’s not that bad.
This creates an effect on the audience by making them feel sorry for Mercutio. Pity during the Shakespearean plays was crucial as it often made the audience cry. Crying reduces stress which is why so many people went to the theatre in the 1500s. Even though Mercutio can feel his life slipping away, he continues to pun about himself and fate.
For example, he says, “Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.” This shows that even his characteristic wit turns bitter as he treats the subject of his own death with humorous wordplay. Mercutio knows that his life is going to end very shortly but he continues to be his joking and skeptical self. Rather than tell Romeo upfront that he is going to die, he hides it behind humor which suggests that Mercutio is scared to die and does not want to look weak in front of his friend.
The word “grave” suggests that Mercutio is once again using humor to hide the truth. The word “grave” is an adjective meaning serious, which is the opposite of Mercutio who is more like the class clown. This creates an effect on the audience by making them cry. Mercutio is such a loving character that they would be sad to see him die. Therefore, Shakespeare creates conflict in the humor and death of Mercutio.
In Act 3 scene 2, Shakespeare presents the theme of conflict through the dramatic irony used by Juliet. For example, Nurse says, ”Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead!” This suggests the use of dramatic irony.  The nurse is lamenting Tybalt’s death. The audience knows that Romeo is not dead but Juliet doesn’t.
This in turn makes Juliet even more worried, and she pushes the nurse to tell her more. Little does she know that Tybalt has been killed by Romeo. Juliet doesn’t know what to feel causing her to become hysterical. In this scene, the Nurse makes it worse by crying. Juliet thinks that Nurse is grieving for Romeo. This makes Juliet even more worried.
The use of the rule of three in “He’s gone, he’s killed, he’s dead,” exaggerates the fact that the Nurse is misleading Juliet into thinking Romeo is dead. This creates an effect on the audience as to slightly hate Nurse for making Juliet feel torn. The nurse doesn’t ease Juliet’s fears until “Romeo that killed him-he is banishèd.” Juliet feels lots of emotions in that one sentence. She can’t decide whether to hate Romeo or still love him. She is torn between her husband, Romeo, and her beloved cousin, Tybalt.
The word “banishèd” is used to create an iambic pentameter. An iambic pentameter is a phrase with one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable. Shakespeare writes his plays using blank verse and iambic pentameter because it was the trend in Elizabethan times. To make his sentence iambic pentameter he needed an extra syllable so he put an accent on the “e” to make it unstressed. Alternatively, the word “banishèd” makes Juliet confused. The prince stated that anyone who fought in the streets of Verona would be executed yet Romeo is just banished. This stirs up confusion as Juliet doesn’t know that Tybalt killed Mercutio.
Juliet’s first reaction to this is to curse Romeo, “O serpent heart hid with flowering face!” This shows the hatred towards her traitorous husband. She compares Romeo as beautiful like that of the evil serpent in The Garden of Eden. She describes him as a snake disguised as a flower. Juliet now loves and hates Romeo. The word “flowering face” is a metaphor for beautiful and handsome.
Juliet hopes that she has not been deceived by Romeo as he is handsome but has a “Serpent’s heart” that would be cruel enough to slay her cousin. Juliet follows this metaphor with a dozen more, all of which express shock and amazement that Romeo could look so good but be so bad.  Most of this emotional rant contains contradictions. Juliet uses oxymorons such as “Beautiful Tyrant” and “Fiend angelical,” to let her mind process whether Romeo is good or evil.

The Theme of Conflict in Romeo and Juliet
Seeing that Juliet is insulting Romeo Nurse joins in but Juliet defends Romeo with “Blistered by thy tongue for such a wish! He was not born to shame.” She tells Nurse that she hopes sores cover your tongue for a wish like that. She goes on to tell her that Romeo was not born to shame but destined only to experience great and total honor. The word “Thy” was used by Shakespeare as it was the language of the sixteenth century. In modern English “Thy” means “your”.
Juliet is using direct address to strengthen her insult, causing Juliet to forgive Romeo.  The effect on the audience is it adds pathos to the scene. The audience feel empathy towards Juliet as her cousin is dead and her husband is banished.  Therefore, Shakespeare presents conflict in Act 3 scene 2 as emotional conflict due to the grief of both Romeo and Tybalt.
In Act 4 scene 3, Shakespeare presents conflict through the emotional trauma Juliet experiences. For example, “God knows when we shall meet again.” Juliet is having second thoughts about drinking the potion that will put her in a deep slumber. This is heartbreaking because of the abundance of foreshadowing in the play.
She senses that she will never see her mother and her wet-nurse again. Juliet feels the dread of death. This makes her doubt her decision. She wonders whether she should call Nurse back but Juliet needs her privacy to take a stand against society. It’s important for Juliet to do this because it symbolizes the escape from the feud. She goes against everything she knows to find love and it makes her strong. The word “God” suggests that Juliet needs guidance. The belief in God was obligatory in the 1200s.
Juliet feels like she has no one to turn to so she asks for guidance from her faith. This creates an effect on the audience by making them feel sorry for Juliet. Shakespeare uses Pathos to appeal to emotion. This is a way of convincing an audience of an argument by creating an emotional response.  Once they leave, Juliet says, “I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life.”
This suggests that Juliet is nervous. She feels a slight cold fear cutting through her veins.  Juliet’s soliloquy is her expressing her inner conflict about faking her death.  She feels as though she’s freezing up inside. Juliet doesn’t know whether she can do it and has a battle against herself. This makes her hysterical as she is torn between her family and her love.
The word “Thrills” means pierce and also shiver. This suggests the amount of nerves that she is feeling. Juliet continues to battle herself by saying, “What if it be poison, which the friar subtly hath ministered to have me dead.” Juliet worries that the Friar had put poison in the potion to kill her as to save Romeo.  Juliet fills her head with different subjects that could go wrong and it drives her mad.
She is questioning whether a holy man such as the friar would poison her. You can see the depth of Juliet’s love for Romeo is visible in her willingness to drink the potion despite her profound fears. The phrase “What if,” suggests the ongoing questions that are racing through Juliet’s mind. She creates so many sceneries it drives her insane. For example, she says, “Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost seeing out Romeo that did spit his body upon a rapier’s point.”
This implies that Juliet is becoming delusional because she pictures Tybalt’s ghost coming to kill Romeo. Juliet’s imagination is working ever more strongly that she believes Tybalt has risen from the dead. Her mind has become fully hysterical now and it would be dangerous to go near Juliet.  The word “Spit” implies that she views Tybalt skewing Romeo on a “Rapier’s point.
This would become horrifying to Juliet which is why she is going crazy. To end her thoughts she says, “Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink- I drink to thee.” This shows Juliet’s final decision. She drinks to Romeo. She drinks to love. She drinks so she can see Romeo again. Juliet’s vision symbolises fate battling love. Juliet, steeled by love, stares down fate and drinks to Romeo.
The phrase “Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!” is a form of the rule of three. Juliet does this to make sure she wants to be with Romeo. Saying a word over and over again creates semantic satiation. Juliet wants to feel before she goes into a deep slumber as in her soliloquy she wasn’t feeling rather she was thinking. She wants to feel love for Romeo one last time in case anything goes wrong.
The effect on the audience creates an on the edge moment. Everyone wants to know whether Juliet will drink the potion or go mad and kill herself with the dagger.  Therefore, Shakespeare presents the theme of conflict in Act 4 scene 3 as an inner conflict because of the hysterical behavior of Juliet.
In Act 5 scene 3, Shakespeare presents conflict through the mourning of County Paris. For example, “Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones” This shows Paris scattering flowers over Juliet’s grave because of his love for her. This suggests that Paris didn’t marry Juliet solely on economic and social circumstances.
His love for Juliet is true even if no one else thinks so. The tomb itself is compared to her “Bridal bed” and the canopy of that bed is now made up of dust and stones. The phrase “Sweet flower” is an epithet and metaphor. Juliet is not a “Sweet flower” but Paris views Juliet as having the characteristics of a “Sweet flower.” Juliet is both sweet and kind as well as beautiful. This creates an effect on the audience by making them understand that Paris is not the villain.
Paris vows to, “Which with the sweet water nightly I will dew, or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.” This shows that Paris has such a kind heart. He declares that he will water her grave every night with sweet water or if he doesn’t do that he will cry on her grave instead. These tears will be wrung out of him by his moans of grief for Juliet. The word “nightly” suggests that his grief for Juliet will never stop.
He will do this ritual every night forever because of his love for Juliet. In the line, “Or, wanting that, with tears …,” the word “wanting” is used in the sense that “that” something is not there, but should be: if the “that” is not there, then the situation is “wanting” it. It’s an old-fashioned use of the word “want.” Nowadays, we don’t generally think of mere situations as being able to want anything. Another example of this is, “The boy gives me warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way tonight.”
This suggests that Paris does not want to be seen by Juliet’s grave because he is ashamed to have someone see him like this. The way the language is used portrays that he is nervous and in a hurry. He questions why anyone would be out this late at night.  The word “Doth” is used by Shakespeare because it was relevant during the Elizabethan reign. “Doth” means “Do” in old English. Continuing his questioning, Paris says, “To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite? What with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.”
This implies that Paris is angry that someone has interrupted his “Obsequies” and “True love’s rite” because he wanted to be alone to grieve. He seems surprised that the person has brought a torch as he thought they would be more discreet. He sees that they would be able to spot him so he hurries away, hiding in the darkness for a while. The word “Muffle” suggests that Paris wants to be enveloped in the darkness. The effect on the audience is it creates tension.
The audience is eager to find out what happens to Romeo and what Paris will do to defend Juliet. After Paris watches Romeo for a while he declares, ”And here is come to do some villainous shame to the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.” This suggests that Paris supposes that Romeo means to continue the feud with the Capulets. Paris believes that Romeo has come to commit an awful crime against the dead bodies of the Capulets.
This would intensify the feud as the Capulets would assume that the Montagues did the crime, therefore, creating conflict. To stop this Paris decides to catch Romeo. The word “Apprehend” shows that Paris is certain Romeo is going to commit a crime. Apprehending someone is to arrest them.
Paris wants to make a citizen’s arrest which is an arrest made by a citizen when there is no other option without someone getting hurt. During the 1200s and even in today’s world it is legal to do so. Therefore, Shakespeare presents the theme of conflict in Act 5 scene 3 as inner conflict due to the passion Paris holds in his heart for Juliet.
In conclusion, Shakespeare presents conflict in “Romeo and Juliet” by showing how the conflict between characters can affects events in the play. The family feud between the Capulets and the Montagues is the main reason for all the conflict and is responsible for six deaths in the span of five days.
Shakespeare shows that loyalty to one side often leads to conflict against the other side. This can cause tension between the characters. Also, he shows that language is a powerful tool and verbal conflict can lead to physical conflict. Romeo and Juliet show that love and passion can lead to hate and conflict and the two most powerful forces of nature are love and hate.
Overall, Shakespeare shows that the effects of conflict can have disastrous consequences for the people involved.

Alright, I've got some information from these search results. Let me see what I can gather.

First, there's a weebly page that lists different types of conflict in Romeo and Juliet. It mentions internal conflicts, like Friar Lawrence's struggles and Juliet's doubts, and external conflicts, such as the feud between the Montagues and Capulets, and specific character clashes like Mercutio vs. Tybalt.

Then, there's an eNotes page that discusses the major conflict in the play. It says that while there are many conflicts, the main one is the feud between the Montagues and Capulets, and that all other conflicts stem from this. The eNotes expert emphasizes that the feud is the root cause of the tragic events, including the deaths of Romeo and Juliet.

Another source from SchoolWorkHelper delves deeper into the theme of conflict, connecting it to societal and religious aspects of the Elizabethan era. It analyzes the prologue and various scenes to show how conflict is presented through language and structure, and how it relates to themes like toxic masculinity and fate.

There's also a piece from Eddusaver that focuses on the conflict between parents and children, particularly in the Capulet household, and how this contributes to the overall悲剧.

Lastly, another SchoolWorkHelper article looks at conflict in specific scenes, like Act 3 Scene 1 and Act 3 Scene 2, providing detailed analysis of dialogue and its implications.

So, from these sources, it's clear that conflict is a central theme in Romeo and Juliet, manifesting in various forms and driving the plot towards its tragic conclusion. The main conflict is the feud between the Montagues and Capulets, but there are also conflicts within characters, between characters, and between generations.

I think to answer the question "How is conflict presented in Romeo and Juliet?" I need to consider both the types of conflict and how they are shown through the play's dialogue, actions, and structure.

First, the external conflict between the Montagues and Capulets is presented right from the beginning. The play opens with a brawl between their servants, setting the tone for the ongoing hostility. This conflict is so deep-seated that it affects everyone in the families, including Romeo and Juliet, who suffer because their love is forbidden.

Shakespeare uses vivid imagery and passionate language to depict this conflict. For example, in Act 1 Scene 1, the servants engage in a swordfight, and Benvolio tries to restore peace while Tybalt enters to escalate the conflict. This scene establishes the volatile nature of the feud and its impact on the community.

Moreover, the Prince's warning to the families about the consequences of further disturbances highlights the seriousness of their conflict and the societal pressure to resolve it.

Internal conflict is also presented through characters like Romeo and Juliet. Romeo struggles with his emotions, moving from unrequited love for Rosaline to his intense passion for Juliet. Juliet grapples with her loyalty to her family and her love for Romeo, which is complicated by the feud.

In Act 3 Scene 2, after Romeo is banished, Juliet is torn between her love for Romeo and her family's hatred for him. Her soliloquy in this scene shows her inner turmoil and the difficult choices she must make.

Additionally, there are conflicts between characters, such as the confrontation between Mercutio and Tybalt, which leads to Mercutio's death and Romeo's subsequent killing of Tybalt. These conflicts are fueled by the larger family feud and personal honor.

Shakespeare presents these conflicts through dramatic dialogue, intense action scenes, and the use of dramatic irony, where the audience is aware of the characters' true feelings and the tragic fate that awaits them.

Furthermore, the theme of conflict is reinforced through the play's structure. The escalating conflicts lead to a climax and ultimately to the tragic denouement where both Romeo and Juliet die, bringing temporary peace to the feuding families.

In conclusion, conflict in Romeo and Juliet is presented multifacetedly, through external feuds, internal struggles, and interpersonal disputes, all of which are interlinked and contribute to the play's tragic outcome.

So, my final answer would be:

\boxed{\text{Conflict in Romeo and Juliet is presented through multiple layers, including the longstanding feud between the Montague and Capulet families, internal struggles within characters like Romeo and Juliet, and conflicts between characters driven by honor and passion. These conflicts are interwoven and escalate throughout the play, leading to a tragic resolution that highlights the destructive power of unresolved disputes.}}
