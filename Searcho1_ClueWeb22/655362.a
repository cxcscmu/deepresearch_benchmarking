So I have this question: "What drives innovation?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but also really interesting. Innovation is everywhere nowadays, from technology to business models, to even how we approach problem-solving in everyday life. So, what exactly drives it?

First off, I think I need to understand what innovation means. From what I know, innovation is the process of turning an idea into a invention that has value, whether it's economic, social, or environmental. It's not just about inventing something new; it's about making something better or finding a new way to do things that creates value.

So, what drives this process? I guess there are multiple factors involved. Let me try to brainstorm some possible drivers of innovation.

One thing that comes to mind is necessity. Often, people say, "Necessity is the mother of invention." So, when there's a problem that needs solving, especially a pressing one, that can drive innovation. For example, during wartime, there's a lot of innovation because there are urgent needs that must be met.

Another factor could be competition. In business, companies are always trying to outdo each other, and this pressure can lead to innovative products and services. Think about the tech industry—companies like Apple and Samsung are constantly trying to make better phones or come up with new features.

Also, I think curiosity and creativity play a big role. Some people are just naturally curious and love to tinker and experiment. Their innate desire to understand how things work or to create something new can lead to innovations. Scientists and researchers fall into this category.

Moreover, incentives and rewards can drive innovation. Governments and organizations often offer prizes or grants for innovative ideas. For instance, there are competitions like the XPRIZE, which offers millions of dollars to teams that can achieve specific goals, like developing sustainable technologies.

Education and access to knowledge are also important. The more educated a population is, the more likely they are to innovate. Schools and universities provide the foundation for critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for innovation.

Additionally, cultural and societal factors can influence innovation. Some cultures may be more open to taking risks and embracing change, which can foster innovation, while others might be more conservative and resistant to new ideas.

I also think that availability of resources is crucial. Having the right tools, funding, and infrastructure can make a big difference in whether an innovative idea becomes a reality. For example, a brilliant inventor without access to a lab or materials might struggle to bring their ideas to life.

Furthermore, collaboration and networking can drive innovation. When people from different backgrounds and disciplines come together to share ideas and work on projects, it can lead to breakthrough innovations. Think about how many startups begin in coworking spaces where people can connect and collaborate.

Lastly, I believe that failure is an important driver of innovation. Many innovators fail multiple times before they succeed. Each failure provides lessons and insights that can lead to eventual success. So, having a mindset that embraces failure as part of the learning process is crucial for innovation.

Now, considering all these factors, I need to synthesize them into a coherent answer. Maybe I can categorize them into internal and external drivers.

Internal drivers would be the personal qualities and motivations that drive individuals to innovate, such as curiosity, creativity, necessity, and the desire for recognition or financial gain.

External drivers would be the environmental factors that encourage or enable innovation, such as competition, incentives, education, culture, resources, collaboration, and tolerance for failure.

Perhaps a combination of both internal and external drivers is needed for innovation to thrive. Individuals need the intrinsic motivation to innovate, but they also need the right environment and support systems in place.

Let me see if I can find some research or权威观点 to back up my thoughts. Maybe looking up some articles or books on innovation would help.

Top 10 Drivers of Innovation - New & Improved
Top 10 Drivers of Innovation
by Denise Morgan | Oct 5, 2018 | Innovation Culture, Top 20 blog posts | 0 comments
Over the past 30 years, we’ve worked with 100’s of international companies. We’ve seen that the most innovative companies drive innovation at the individual, team and organizational levels. They enjoy two benefits. First, they are more successful at creating and implementing new ideas. Second, their employees are more engaged. This means that they are more productive and committed to the organization.
So, what’s their secret? In this article, we’ll share our top 10 innovation drivers.
1) Make Everyone Responsible for Innovation (Individual)
Make innovation part of everyone’s job. No matter where they work in your value chain, they can contribute to new value creation. To do their job well, they need the skills and tools for innovation. Provide that training. When they use these skills, they need to be supported. Even when they fail! Think of innovation as productivity. Everyone strives to be productive. They are taught skills and tools to be more productive. Managers evaluate them on their productivity. Treat innovation the same way. When everyone is responsible for innovation, innovation happens.
2) Develop Innovation Processes that Everyone Can Use (Process)
Innovative organizations have processes that drive innovation. Their individuals and teams use a structured creative process. There are many out there, such as Lean Six Sigma, Design Thinking, TRIZ. We find the most robust process is the Universal Creative Process. Its seven steps help you choose the right problem to solve, generate lots of ideas, improve those ideas, prototype the best ideas, create a plan for implementation, and monitor progress. Also, innovative organizations have processes to select and fund new ideas. You can learn more about how to select and fund innovation. When there are processes to develop, select and fund new ideas, innovation will follow.
3) Go Beyond Developing Products (Offerings)
BIG innovations are more than products. Big innovations transform services, processes or channels. For example, the iPod was more than a cool-looking gadget that allowed you to buy and load music. It was the relationship between Apple and the music industry that made the iPod a big innovation. It transformed how people consume music. So, if you want to drive innovation, you need to look beyond just product innovation.
4) Create Teams that Support Innovation (Team)
While individuals are responsible for innovation, they cannot do it alone. People need to be part of an innovative team. Being an innovative team is hard work. Everyone must remain curious, humble and tenacious. If someone is not following these values, they should be called out. People need to accept feedback from others on the team. This is not easy, but there are tools and methods to make feedback non-threatening and an integral part of the work flow. Highly performing innovative teams make feedback part of their iterative process.
5) Welcome New Ideas (Psychological Climate)
When you welcome people’s new ideas, they will generate more ideas. Now, this does not mean that all their ideas are good. That’s ok, great solutions start with generating lots of ideas, then evaluating and picking the best. Innovative leaders understand how to evaluate new ideas. We find the most powerful way to evaluate ideas is using the tool POINt. This tool teaches people to start with praise first, which helps deflate any defensiveness. You’ll find other ways to evaluate ideas in our tools library. Do this and your team will more quickly create innovative solutions.
6) Leverage Diversity (Geopolitical Climate)
Every individual, team and organization have strengths and weaknesses. Embrace these. There are things that we can learn from each other, but first we must seek to understand each other. Take time to understand other individuals and other groups. Innovation leaders ask: “What strengths can I leverage? Also, what differences might make collaborating more difficult? A good tool for working through these opportunities is Assisters and Resisters. Once you answer these questions, innovation will accelerate.
7) Build a Culture of Innovation (Enterprise)
Creative people and teams need to be part of a culture of innovation. Innovation cultures support individual and team creativity. Our research and experience show that there are four dimensions to a culture of innovation. They are people, processes, policies and climate.  When an organization supports these four dimensions, people have the right ecosystem to innovate. Learn more about building a culture of innovation in our ebook, Demystifying Innovation Culture Efforts.
8) Show that Innovation is Important (Organizational Culture)
It’s not enough to say innovation is important! What leaders say is often drowned out by what people know is really going on. Invest in your employees. Here’s a few ways to show that innovation is important:
Train all employees in creative problem solving skills
Give them the time to explore new ideas, even when they fail
Train managers on how to l ead innovation
Reward employees, managers and business units for innovation with accountabilit y measures
When you do this, everyone will know that innovation is important. They will be motivated to improve their skills, support innovation, and create new solutions.
9) Design Spaces for People to Be Creative (Physical Environment)
People need to work in a space that fosters creative collaboration and innovation. This doesn’t mean companies need to invest in couches and coffee bars. In fact, there is no ideal environment for innovation. But, creative spaces have some things in common:
It’s easy for people to get together to share ideas and build solutions
People have space to escape and think in peace and quiet
There’s room to spread out and dig into information to create solutions
When people work in the right space, they can more easily collaborate and get into a creative mindset to drive innovation.
10) Fund Innovation Even During Tough Times (Economic Climate)
It’s easy to support innovation when the economy is strong. But, innovation leaders fund innovation even when the economy is weak. They can do this because when business is good, they set aside money. When budgets are tight, they use this money to fund innovation. Research shows that organizations “in distress” can be the most innovative. This makes sense because the pressure creates focus. When a company is in distress they need to innovate to survive. So, companies that support innovation even during the lean years can make great changes.
Every Organization Can Be an Innovation Powerhouse
Regardless of your company’s size, industry or location, it can be an innovation powerhouse. It won’t be easy. This list is a guide to get you started. If you’re interested in learning more, let us know. We’d love to help.

The Four Drivers of Innovation

The Four Drivers of Innovation
Top executives and business experts reveal the keys to making your company more creative
by Shelley Mika
A couple of decades ago, when economists forecasted the highest earning countries across the globe, many put their money on Japan as the leader, Germany as the runner-up, and the United States in third place for the largest GDPs in the new millennium. But now that we're seven years into the 21 st century, it's clear that those economists lost the bet: The United States' GDP is currently $12.3 trillion, exceeding the current GDPs of Japan and Germany by about $8 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively.
So what happened to make the United States' output soar above economists' predictions? According to some leading executives and management thinkers, the answer is innovation.
In fact, many argue that innovation is the most important driver of macroeconomics today. That's why a group of senior executives and business experts gathered recently in Chicago to discuss innovation, leadership, and the new economy of creativity, knowledge, and invention -- and how to focus these amorphous concepts into real business dollars. Their insights are relevant to executives from businesses large and small, global and local.
Interpreting innovation
Opening the event, Gallup Chairman and CEO Jim Clifton gave an overview of the history of macroeconomics, making it clear that business leaders are playing in a much different game than they did in the past. Economic centers once formed where resources like cattle or steel were plentiful. Now, these centers emerge where innovation is happening, he said.
Everyone can probably imagine what innovation is. We've seen it in Web sites like MySpace and YouTube and in each iteration of the iPod, and we'll see it again the day a noncombustion engine relieves many nations of their dependence on oil.
But, often the term innovation gets confused with creativity, according to Barry Conchie, principal leadership consultant at Gallup and a speaker at the event. "Let's be clear: Innovation and creativity are not the same thing," Conchie said. "Creativity may spur innovation, but there's an element of action missing there."
The difference is that innovation actually brings ideas to life. "You can't get innovation without a groundswell of creativity," Conchie said. "But you [must] turn creativity into something that has an impact beyond the conversation you had about the idea." Innovation is more than an idea -- it takes place when great ideas actually happen and make their mark on the world.
In the past, most businesses have focused on continuous improvement of their products and services to maintain a competitive edge. But in today's economy, that's not always enough, Clifton said. As the agriculturalists of the past had to literally break new ground to expand their trade, today's businesses must come up with new ideas, rather than settle for marginally better ideas. In Clifton's words, " Better doesn't work anymore. Different does."
If innovation is today's hot commodity, how can business leaders harvest it? They must create conditions in which innovation can thrive in their companies. Below are the four drivers of innovation, as identified by executives and thinkers who spoke at the event.
Driver #1: Finding and fostering talent
According to Clifton, four types of people drive innovation: inventors, entrepreneurs, extreme individual achievers in their fields (such as the arts, entertainment, or sports), and super mentors. "The theory is that where these people settle is where new economic empires will be built," Clifton said. "And they go where there is other talent like them." (See "Is the U.S. Losing its Competitive Edge?" and "Managing Those Creative Types" in the "See Also" area on this page.)
Marla Mayne, senior vice president of retail lending at U.S. Bank, knows the importance of hiring the right talent -- people who, based on the way they naturally think, feel, and behave, are likely to be top performers in their field. Her company was looking for sales talent, but even some of the most experienced salespeople weren't superb performers. "One gentleman had results and more than ten years of experience. But just because your stock did well before doesn't mean it will in the future," she said.
That's when Mayne realized she needed to focus on hiring only what she calls "A's" -- the very top talent in sales. Rather than having a staff of 50% A's, she asked herself how she could hire a greater percentage of top performers.
Using selection practices that identify candidates who are most like the best in their roles based on their natural talents, Mayne was able to identify and hire top talent. "We're hiring an 'A' team, and we'll have one thousand loan officers outproducing a company with three thousand loan officers," she said.
Mayne found out that experience doesn't matter nearly as much as talent. Now, she and her management team focus primarily on talent when selecting salespeople. "We can teach them the business, [but] not talent," she said.
Once you've hired these employees, how do you make the most of their talents and foster innovation? Based on Gallup research, Conchie said, employee engagement is highly related to the ability to innovate. (See graphic "The Three Types of Employees.")
Gallup recently asked American employees to rate their workplace on four items:
My current job brings out my most creative ideas.
My company encourages new ideas that defy conventional wisdom.
I have a friend at work who I share new ideas with.
I feed off the creativity of my colleagues.
For all four items, the percentage of engaged employees who strongly agreed far outnumbered the percentage of not-engaged or actively disengaged employees who strongly agreed. Clearly, creating an environment where employees are engaged can yield a higher crop of creativity, Conchie said. (See graphics "Innovation and Creativity at Work" and "Workplace Friendships Encourage Creativity" below and "Who's Driving Innovation at Your Company?" in the "See Also" area on this page.)
Mike Morrison, dean of the University of Toyota, said that one approach to engaging employees is to "incubate" their ideas. "You can't wait by the phone for a breakthrough idea," he said. "You need knowledge, technique, and motivation. If one [element] is missing, you can't have an innovative environment."
Morrison said that when people are relaxed, ideas begin bubbling to the surface. So at Toyota, they periodically take people out of their typical office environments and let them develop ideas in places where the pressure is off and they can brainstorm without the demands of the workplace competing for their attention. The company also provides those people with lots of information and reading material on the subject at hand, hoping to inspire them to create bigger and better ideas than those that already exist. These incubation periods yield the breakthrough ideas Toyota is looking for, Morrison said.
Driver #2: Managers matter
Let's not forget that creativity needs action to become innovation. Companies must do more with their employees' creativity than just acknowledging that an employee has a good idea. That's why managers matter.
Looking at the four categories of innovators, often the inventors, entrepreneurs, and high achievers would be nothing without that last category: super mentors, Clifton said. "When it comes to innovation, mentors play a key role, because they're the people who say, 'That's a great idea. You can make a lucrative business of that,'" Clifton said. Super mentors inspire their protégés and help them connect with the people who can couple action with their ideas -- as some of the best managers do.
In Mayne's case, managers were integral to U.S. Bank's success with its loan officers. Although the bank was hiring A-level loan officers, it found it wasn't able to keep them: U.S. Bank still saw a 60% turnover rate among this crucial group.
To remedy the problem, Mayne decided to assess the manager talent among her staff. It turned out that half of her regional managers were from the "B" or "C" pool. Once Mayne used selection tools that identified people who are most like the best managers -- increasing her regional management staff from 4 A-level managers to 25 -- she started keeping those coveted A-level loan officers. More importantly, she started seeing results. "When you put talent in a fully loaded environment, you get performance out of people," she said.
Now Mayne's team operates with fewer people, but its retention is up, and so are its numbers. Mayne found that loan officers who are:
A's completed 794 more loan applications per month than B's
A's closed 624 more loans per month than B's
A's closed $66 million more in loans than B's
In addition, when loan offers were divided into two groups by engagement levels and compared, A's in the top half closed 8 more loans per month than A's in the bottom half. Similarly, A's in the top half closed 9 more loans per month than B's in the top half.
At U.S. Bank, hiring the right talent, then making sure that talent was engaged and led by the right managers, made for a lucrative combination.
Driver #3: Relationships matter too
Talented managers usually understand the importance of relationships. "An emotional commitment of one person to another makes a difference. But the control a manager has to enhance or limit [an employee's] contribution to innovation is the most powerful factor," Conchie said. "It's important that [relationships are] cultivated from manager to manager and employee to employee. But we know that the [quality of the] relationship between a manager and an employee affects the ability to leverage that relationship. A bad relationship is a sure-fire way to kill innovation."
A relationship with customers matters too. In the new economy, improving a business model is more complicated than assembling a piece of hardware on an assembly line. To move forward -- to develop the most creative ideas, and most importantly, enact them -- a company must understand the needs of its customers, and that takes a good relationship. "In order to stay ahead of the game, you have to think of a way to connect with customers that makes you different," Conchie said.
Driver #4: Keeping the right leaders
If leaders are so important in driving innovation -- both in terms of thought leadership and fostering creativity in the people they lead -- what happens when they step down? Often, retiring CEOs choose their successors based on instinct or on an assumed company lineage, Conchie said. He shared an example of a manufacturing company that was facing the imminent departure of its CEO. To continue its growth, the company needed a leader with the right kind of talent. But as Conchie said, "The CEO already had a point of view. He was picking the people he admired, not people who could replace him. But you shouldn't think about succession planning without thinking about the loss of talent when the CEO leaves."
As the company set out to evaluate the performance of its key candidates, it learned that those who would typically be considered for the position didn't match the talent profile needed to succeed as CEO. When they assessed potential candidates for their drive to execute and their management, relationship, and direction talents, a different group stood out. Operating on these data, the company chose a successor whose talent profile projected success -- and it worked. In just four years, the company grew to $1.1 billion, and its stock price doubled.
To select the right leaders, Conchie said, companies must ask three key questions:
How objective is your company's assessment of current performance and leadership talent potential?
Is your company's succession management focused on lining up individuals for positions, increasing overall leadership capability, or both?
Is leadership team talent assessed or measured as a precursor to all leadership hiring decisions?
When companies begin asking these important questions, they can begin a formalized process for hiring leaders who are more likely to succeed. And when a data-driven performance review meets a talent-based succession planning model, it creates a powerful combination that allows companies to choose successful leaders -- and innovators -- who can make a solid future for their organizations. (See "Start Finding Tomorrow's Leaders Now" in the "See Also" area on this page.)
What happens without innovation?
In today's fast-paced marketplace, if a company keeps offering the same product, a rival can easily race past with a better one. And yet another competitor will blow them both out of the water when it invents something altogether different and better -- something innovative. To remain competitive, companies must consider how to find and keep visionary leaders and how to foster innovation and creativity in their employees, the executives and experts at the event agreed.
On the global stage, innovation could mean the difference between the United States keeping a tight grasp on economic leadership or eventually slipping behind countries like China and India, as some economists have predicted. But, those fast-growing countries also face the same challenge.
"Right now, does China have innovation, or does it just make the lowest cost products?" Clifton asked. "If it's bankrupt in terms of innovation, its economy is just as likely to be a bubble as the dot-coms."

Drivers of innovation
1.
    Drivers of Innovations
2. • Innovation helps organizations to grow. Growth, though measured in
turnover and profit, can also occur in knowledge, experience,
efficiency, and quality.
• Innovation is the process of making changes to existing, and it can be
radical or incremental, applied to products, processes, or services.
• It can happen at all levels, from management teams to departments
to individual.
3. • Various factors encourage and drive an organization to innovate. Each
of these drivers demands continuity and learning.
• These drivers create a sense of urgency to create new organizational
goals and generate new ideas for meeting these goals.
• The term innovation is often associated with products, but can also
occur in processes that make products, services, or deliver products
and services, including intangibles.
4. • Various factors encourage and drive an organization to innovate. Each
of these drivers demands continuity and learning.
• These drivers create a sense of urgency to create new organizational
goals and generate new ideas for meeting these goals.
• The term innovation is often associated with products, but can also
occur in processes that make products, services, or deliver products
and services, including new business models
5. This lecture focuses on :
• Innovation in the organizational context
• Describes concepts underlying innovation
• Tries to understand the core of the innovation process: What drives
innovation in organizations?
6. • There are factors that, singly and in combination, drive innovation
(successful innovation in particular)
• Those factors that motivate and shape innovation efforts, and in no
small way determine their success or failure
7. Drivers of Innovation
• 1. Corporate Culture
• 2. The individuals
• 3. The team
• 4. The Enterprise
• 5. Processes
• 6. Offerings
• 7. Psychological climate
• 8. Physical environment
• 9. Economic environment
• 10. Geo/political culture
8. 1. Corporate Culture
• Corporate culture dictates how people expect to work, and what the
“rules” are about how the organization is run.
• Wikipedia defines culture as the “attitudes, experiences, beliefs and values
of an organization”.
• When people join an organization, they usually adopt the culture of the
organization as well, reinforcing the belief systems and encouraging others
to adopt the culture as well
• Changing a culture is not easy, especially when you are asking a culture to
accept more failure and more risk.
• There are no quick fixes for cultural change; it requires leadership,
commitment, communication and time
9. Important elements in the corporate culture to
make a conducive environment for innovations
• Senior Management: The executive team needs to “walk the talk”
and show through their actions their commitment to innovation
efforts.
• Compensation: People do what they are compensated and motivated
to do. Change the compensation scheme to encourage people to take
risks and recognize they won’t be punished for doing so.
10. • Communication: Beyond the commitment of the leadership team, it’s
necessary for that commitment and the expectations of the
leadership team to be communicated to everyone in the organization,
consistently and repeatedly.
• Training: Training is a key component of cultural change, since it is
unrealistic to expect people to take on new responsibilities and
innovate consistently without giving them new tools, methods and
processes.
11. • Measurement: “What gets managed gets measured”, so goals,
measurements and metrics are a key part of any innovation initiative.
• As you begin your innovation initiative, you’ll have to measure
throughput – the number of ideas generated, the amount of
involvement throughout the organization and the amount of time it
takes to move an idea through your innovation process.
• Outcome based metrics can be created to measure the investment in
an innovation program against financial returns.
12. • Years of cost cutting and focus on process excellence have created in
many organizations a culture that is focused on operational
excellence and risk avoidance.
• Organizations (and people, for that matter) love stability and
predictability because these factors make it easier to earn profits.
• Innovation, however, is about adaptation, risk and change.
• It’s easy to come up with new ideas; the hard part is letting go of
what worked for you few years ago, but will soon be out of date
13. • Innovation will be one of the disciplines that also compete for scarce
resources and therefore the right choices have to be made about the
type of innovation that best match corporate objectives.
• Most innovations require substantial time to develop, mature as new
products or services and achieve market benefits
• In most organizations is that senior management requests more
innovation but expects results in one or two quarters, when the
average product or service development cycle is longer than that.
14. 2. The Individual
• You can ask “an organization” all day long to do something, but the
basic building block of getting things done is an individual.
• Organizations, departments, divisions, groups, teams, etc. all units
built from individual people.
• So focus on strengthening the primary building block to start moving
the needle on innovation.
• Understand this more deeply by reading “The weakness of “we” and
the power of “I” in innovation.”
15. 3. The Team
• Individuals make things happen, but in most cases, they can’t do it all
by themselves.
• Innovation requires multiple skill sets, whether it’s invention,
development, funding, marketing, patenting, operations, etc., those
skill sets almost never exist in one person, so multiple people are
needed to move it forward
• Focus on improving effective and collaborative team dynamics to
keep the innovation engine running smoothly
16. 4. The Enterprise
• A sad truth is that individuals, in teams, when successful, become
resistant to change.
• The successful innovation team of yesterday becomes the “this is the
way we’ve always done it” team of tomorrow.
• Focus should be given to creating and sustaining enterprise-wide
procedures, policies, metrics, and recognition and executive-level
accountability in order to keep the whole innovation vehicle running
in an organisation
17. • The Individual, Team and Enterprise are the most important drives of
the innovation. However, in order for the innovations to take place
smoothly, many other elements could play a vital role
• Processes, offerings, psychological climate, physical environment,
organization culture, economic climate/ market conditions and
geopolitical culture could be listed among them
18. 5.Processes
• The individual level (e.g. processes to enhancing self-awareness,
emotional intelligence and cognitive ability),
• The group level (e.g. using a structured “brainstorming” or “ideation”
or “creative process” to support teams in creating innovative
solutions)
• Enterprise level (e.g. the organizational system for creative
collaboration or procedures to protect innovation projects from being
robbed by the current “organizational favorite” profit generator).
19. 6. Offerings ( Products/Service)
• There are many ways to look at what is “an innovation”.
• To only see innovation as “a product” is to overlook services, business
models, alliances, processes, channels, and more.
• Expanding your scope to see that the BIG innovations were more than
just a simple “product,” can change the way you see the world.
20. 7. Psychological Climate
• What are the stories that the individual is telling him/herself about
what’s working? What’s not working? What’s acceptable? What’s our
industry? What’s its scope? Does this make a difference to
innovation?
• Absolutely, because how one defines the world will shape the
newness that they create and enable.
• The right amounts of personal freedom in the system, and the mental
energy to explore new areas are the primary impacts on the
psychological climate.
21. 8. Physical Environment
Physical space in which people work enables innovation
• Are people able to easily get together to communicate and work
together?
• Are they able to escape and think in peace and quiet?
• Can they find a space to spread out and dig into
prototypes/results/data?
22. 9. Organizational Culture
• It’s not enough to just say “Innovation is important!”
• The organizational policies, management behaviours, things that are
measured and executive messaging must all align to create the stories
of work that create the culture.
• If you want innovation over the long haul, look at company culture.
23. 9. Economic Climate/Market Conditions
• The spot where innovation culture is easiest to maintain is when
market conditions are such that there is not too much fear, or too
much confidence
• Paradoxically, research shows most organizations only get radically
innovative when they are in “distress situations.”
• When there’s no other choice, that’s when people start really
changing things up.
24. 10. Geopolitical Culture
• Where you were born, where you live, the language you speak, where
you work, how you were educated and the culture of those elements
all make a difference.
• We all know that different cultures communicate differently, see the
world differently, perceived different threats, and find value in
different things
• Every culture, every education system, has strength and weakness
• Curiously ask: “What cultural strengths can I leverage, and what
cultural impediments must I work to overcome?”
25. Other driving factors
• Type of ownership, Hiring right talent, skills, availability of technology,
leadership, relationships, and many more could matter in addition to
the major factors that we discussed.

Abstract
Innovation helps organizations to grow. Growth, though measured in turnover and profit, can also occur in knowledge, experience, efficiency, and quality. Innovation is the process of making changes to existing, and it can be radical or incremental, applied to products, processes, or services. It can happen at all levels, from management teams to departments to individual. Various factors encourage and drive an organization to innovate. Each of these drivers demands continuity and learning. These drivers create a sense of urgency to create new organizational goals and generate new ideas for meeting these goals. The term innovation is often associated with products, but can also occur in processes that make products, services, or deliver products and services, including intangibles. This chapter focuses on innovation in the organizational context, describes concepts underlying innovation, and tries to understand the core of the innovation process: What drives innovation in organizations?.

... The findings of the current study concur with the findings of a study by Parris et al. (2016) that identified limited budget, lack of buy-in and non-adoption of service innovation ideas as barriers to the effective implementation of service innovation. In addition, the results of this study concur with the findings of Baporikar (2015) that non-adoption of innovations is one of the primary reasons for service innovation failure. Moreover, the current study contributes significantly to academic literature by revealing that franchise and franchisee agreements, competition, government legislation, competition standards set by other regulatory bodies such as the Competition Commission, the difficulty of selling new ideas to customers, lack of perseverance, resistance to change, internal staff resistance, cultural background, age, and personal bias are barriers to the implementation of service innovations.  ...

Alright, I've got a bunch of information here about what drives innovation. Let's see. From Doc 1, it seems like there are ten drivers of innovation, ranging from making everyone responsible for innovation to designing spaces that foster creativity. Doc 2 talks about four main drivers: finding and fostering talent, managers matter, relationships matter, and keeping the right leaders. Doc 3 is a SlideShare presentation on drivers of innovation, but I don't have access to the content since it's from SlideShare. Doc 4 mentions that innovation culture and processes are crucial for competitive advantage and company value. Lastly, Doc 5 is an abstract from a research paper that discusses innovation in the organizational context and tries to understand what drives innovation in organizations.

So, synthesizing these, it seems like innovation is driven by a combination of factors at different levels: individual, team, organizational, and even external environmental factors. Let's break it down.

First, at the individual level, talent and inherent creativity play a significant role. Doc 2 emphasizes the importance of hiring the right talent and fostering an environment where these talents can thrive. This aligns with Doc 1's point about making everyone responsible for innovation. So, having a workforce that is not only skilled but also encouraged to think creatively and contribute ideas is crucial.

Second, management plays a pivotal role. Doc 2 highlights that managers are essential in turning creativity into actionable innovation. They act as mentors and facilitators, helping employees bring their ideas to life. This ties into Doc 1's emphasis on developing innovation processes that everyone can use and creating teams that support innovation.

Third, organizational culture is a major driver. Doc 1 lists building a culture of innovation as one of the key drivers, and Doc 4 stresses that deliberate innovation culture and processes are invaluable for competitive advantage. An organization that values and rewards innovation is more likely to see it flourish.

Fourth, processes and systems are important. Doc 1 mentions developing innovation processes, and Doc 5 refers to the need for systematic processes to capture and protect innovation. Having a structured approach to innovation can make it more efficient and effective.

Fifth, the physical environment matters. Doc 1 talks about designing spaces that foster creativity and collaboration, which can enhance innovative thinking and problem-solving.

Sixth, external factors such as economic climate and geopolitical culture can influence innovation. Doc 1 mentions that funding innovation even during tough times is important, and Doc 2 discusses how companies in distress can be more innovative.

Seventh, relationships and collaborations are key. Doc 2 emphasizes the importance of relationships, both within the organization and with customers, for staying ahead. Doc 1 also mentions leveraging diversity and building networks for innovation.

Lastly, leadership is crucial. Doc 2 discusses the role of super mentors and the importance of selecting the right leaders who can drive innovation. Doc 1 includes building a culture of innovation as an enterprise-level driver, which is heavily influenced by leadership.

In summary, innovation is driven by a multifaceted interplay of individual talents, managerial support, organizational culture, systematic processes, physical environment, external conditions, relationships, and leadership. Each of these elements reinforces the others, creating an ecosystem that either fosters or hinders innovation.

So, to answer the question "What drives innovation?", it's a combination of these factors working together. Organizations that prioritize and nurture these aspects are more likely to succeed in innovation.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Innovation is driven by a combination of individual talents, managerial support, organizational culture, systematic processes, physical environment, external conditions, relationships, and leadership.}} \]
