Alright, I need to figure out how Hitler's dictatorship ended. I know that Adolf Hitler was the leader of Nazi Germany, and his regime was known for its extreme policies, including genocide and aggressive warfare. But I'm not exactly sure how it all came to an end. I think it has something to do with World War II, but I need to get more specific than that.

First, maybe I should recall when Hitler came to power. I believe he became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933, and then consolidated his power to become the dictator shortly after. So his rule lasted from 1933 until... well, that's part of what I need to find out.

I think the end of his dictatorship is linked to the end of World War II in Europe. I remember that World War II started in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, and it ended in 1945 with the surrender of Germany. So, perhaps Hitler's dictatorship ended around that time.

But I need to be more precise. Did Hitler still hold power until the very end of the war? Or was there a point where he lost control? I seem to recall that Hitler committed suicide towards the end of the war, but I'm not sure about the details.

Let me try to outline the sequence of events leading to the end of Hitler's dictatorship.

1. **Outbreak of World War II**: Germany invades Poland in 1939, leading to declarations of war by Britain and France.

2. **Early German victories**: Blitzkrieg through Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, and France in 1940.

3. **Battle of Britain**: Germany tries to gain air superiority over the UK but fails.

4. **Invasion of the Soviet Union**: Operation Barbarossa in June 1941.

5. **Attack on Pearl Harbor**: Japan attacks the US in December 1941, bringing the US into the war.

6. **Turning points of the war**: Battles like Stalingrad (1942-1943), El Alamein, and later D-Day (June 1944).

7. **Allied advancement**: Allies liberate Italy, Normandy landings, and advance towards Germany.

8. **Fall of Berlin**: Soviet forces capture Berlin in April 1945.

9. **German surrender**: Official surrender on May 8, 1945 (V-E Day).

Now, where does Hitler fit into this timeline?

- In 1945, as the Allies and Soviets were closing in on Germany, Hitler's position became increasingly precarious.

- I think he was still in control until very late in the war. He appointed various commanders and made strategic decisions up until the end.

- But I'm not sure about the exact date he ceased to be in power.

Wait a minute, I recall that Hitler committed suicide in his Führerbunker in Berlin in April 1945. If that's the case, then his dictatorship would have ended at that point, even though the war continued for a few more weeks.

Let me see... if Hitler died in April, but the war ended in May, who was in charge between those months?

I think there was a period after Hitler's death where there was a succession of leaders trying to negotiate peace or continue fighting.

Let me try to find out more about that.

First, when exactly did Hitler die?

I think it was on April 30, 1945.

Okay, so on April 30, 1945, Hitler committed suicide.

Then, who took over after him?

I believe his successor was Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was named as the new President of Germany after Hitler's death.

So, from April 30 until the surrender on May 8, Dönitz was in charge.

Therefore, Hitler's dictatorship ended on April 30, 1945, with his suicide, and Dönitz briefly took over until the surrender.

But, to be precise, the dictatorship itself may be considered to have ended with Hitler's death, even though Germany continued to function under different leadership for a short time afterward.

Alternatively, some might argue that the end of the dictatorship coincided with the official surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945.

Hmm, I need to think about this.

Perhaps I should look into the legal and factual aspects of when Hitler's rule effectively ended.

Let me consider the following points:

- Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945.

- On the same day, he married Eva Braun, and their bodies were burned per his instructions.

- Just before his suicide, he dictated his last will and political testament, in which he appointed Dönitz as his successor.

- Dönitz became the President of Germany and Joseph Goebbels as the Chancellor, but Goebbels and his family also committed suicide on May 1, 1945.

- Dönitz continued to lead what was left of the German government, attempting to negotiate peace with the Allies.

- On May 7, 1945, representatives of the Dönitz government signed an instrument of unconditional surrender in Reims, France, which took effect on May 8, 1945.

Given this sequence of events, it seems that Hitler's personal rule ended with his death on April 30, 1945. However, the formal end of the Nazi regime and German surrender occurred on May 8, 1945.

So, depending on how one defines "the end of Hitler's dictatorship," it could be either the date of his death or the date of the official surrender.

If we consider that Hitler's dictatorship was based on his personal rule and authority, then it could be argued that it ended with his death. The subsequent leadership under Dönitz was more of an administrative body aiming to facilitate the surrender and maintain order.

Alternatively, if we consider the dictatorship to encompass the entire Nazi regime, then it would have ended with the official surrender and the beginning of the Allied occupation.

I think both perspectives have merit, but probably the more precise answer is that Hitler's personal dictatorship ended with his death on April 30, 1945.

But to be thorough, I should confirm the dates and events.

Let me make sure about the dates:

- Hitler's suicide: April 30, 1945

- Signing of the surrender: May 7, 1945

- Effective date of surrender: May 8, 1945

Yes, that seems correct.

So, in conclusion, Hitler's dictatorship ended with his suicide on April 30, 1945, although the war continued for another eight days until the official surrender.

I think that's the most accurate way to describe it.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Hitler's dictatorship ended with his suicide on April 30, 1945.}} \]
