Alright, I need to figure out how big of a problem human trafficking is. That sounds pretty serious. I don't know much about this topic, so I'll probably need to do some research to get accurate information.

First, I should understand what human trafficking is. From what I've heard, it involves exploiting people, often for forced labor or sex work, against their will. It's a form of modern slavery. But I need to make sure that's accurate.

Maybe I should look up a definition from a reliable source. Like, maybe the United Nations or the US State Department has a definition. Yeah, that sounds good.

So, I'll search for "definition of human trafficking by UN" or something like that.

human trafficking, also called trafficking in persons,  form of modern-day slavery involving the illegal transport of individuals by force or deception for the purpose of labour, sexual exploitation, or activities in which others benefit financially. Human trafficking is a global problem affecting people of all ages. It is estimated that approximately 1,000,000 people are trafficked each year globally and that between 20,000 and 50,000 are trafficked into the United States, which is one of the largest destinations for victims of the sex-trafficking trade.
Although human trafficking is recognized as a growing international phenomenon, a uniform definition has yet to be internationally adopted. The United Nations (UN) divides human trafficking into three categories— sex trafficking, labour trafficking, and the removal of organs —and defines human trafficking as the induction by force, fraud, or coercion of a person to engage in the sex trade, or the harbouring, transportation, or obtaining of a person for labour service or organ removal. Though the United States does not acknowledge the removal of organs in its definition, it does recognize sex and labour trafficking and describes human trafficking as the purposeful transportation of an individual for exploitation.
The trafficking scheme
Human traffickers often create transnational routes for transporting migrants who are driven by unfavourable living conditions to seek the services of a smuggler. Human trafficking usually starts in origin countries—namely, Southeast Asia, eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa —where recruiters seek migrants through various mediums such as the Internet, employment agencies, the media, and local contacts. Middlemen who recruit from within the origin country commonly share the cultural background of those migrating. Migrants view the services of a smuggler as an opportunity to move from impoverished conditions in their home countries to more stable, developed environments.
Because such circumstances make it difficult for victims to obtain legitimate travel documents, smugglers supply migrants with fraudulent passports or visas and advise them to avoid detection by border-control agents. Transporters, in turn, sustain the migration process through various modes of transportation: land, air, and sea. Although victims often leave their destination country voluntarily, the majority are unaware that they are being recruited for a trafficking scheme. Some may be kidnapped or coerced, but many are bribed by false job opportunities, passports, or visas. Transporters involved in trafficking victims from the origin country are compensated only after they have taken migrants to the responsible party in the destination country. Immigration documents, whether legitimate or fraudulent, are seized by the traffickers. After this, victims are often subjected to physical and sexual abuse, and many are forced into labour or the sex trade in order to pay off their migratory debts.
The cause of human trafficking stems from adverse circumstances in origin countries, including religious persecution, political dissension, lack of employment opportunities, poverty, wars, and natural disasters. Another causal factor is globalization, which has catapulted developing countries into the world’s market, increasing the standard of living and contributing to the overall growth of the global economy. Unfortunately, globalization is a double-edged sword in that it has shaped the world’s market for the transportation of illegal migrants, affording criminal organizations the ability to expand their networks and create transnational routes that facilitate the transporting of migrants. The U.S. Department of State adds that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has generated a large number of orphans and child-headed households, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, a situation that creates fertile soil for trafficking and servitude.
Types of exploitation
The most prevalent form of human trafficking that results in servitude is the recruitment and transport of people into the international sex industry. Sex slavery involves males and females, both adults and children, and constitutes an estimated 58 percent of all trafficking activities. It consists of different types of servitude, including forced prostitution, pornography, child sex rings, and sex-related occupations such as nude dancing and modeling. Forced prostitution is a very old form of enslavement, and recruitment into this lifestyle is often a booming business for purveyors of the sex trade. Victims of sexual slavery are often manipulated into believing that they are being relocated to work in legitimate forms of employment. Those who enter the sex industry as prostitutes are exposed to inhumane and potentially fatal conditions, especially with the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Additionally, some countries, including India, Nepal, and Ghana, have a form of human trafficking known as ritual (religion-based) slavery, in which young girls are provided as sexual slaves to atone for the sins of family members.
Forced labour has likely been around since shortly after the dawn of humankind, though there are a number of different forms of modern involuntary servitude that can go easily unnoticed by the general public. Debt bondage (also called peonage ), is the enslavement of people for unpaid debts and is one of the most common forms of contemporary forced labour. Similarly, contract slavery uses false or deceptive contracts to justify or explain forced slavery. In the United States the majority of nonsex labourers are forced into domestic service, followed by agriculture, sweatshops, and restaurant and hotel work.
Children are often sold or sent to areas with the promise of a better life but instead encounter various forms of exploitation. Domestic servitude places “extra children” (children from excessively large families) into domestic service, often for extended periods of time. Other trafficked children are often forced to work in small-scale cottage industries, manufacturing operations, and the entertainment and sex industry. They are frequently required to work for excessive periods of time, under extremely hazardous working conditions, and for little or no wages. Sometimes they become “street children” and are used for prostitution, theft, begging, or the drug trade. Children are also sometimes trafficked into military service as soldiers and experience armed combat at very young ages.
Another recent and highly controversial occurrence involving human trafficking is the abduction or deception that results in the involuntary removal of bodily organs for transplant. For years there have been reports from China that human organs were harvested from executed prisoners without the consent of family members and sold to transplant recipients in various countries. There have also been reported incidents of the removal and transport of organs by medical and hospital employees. In addition, there have been claims that impoverished people sell organs such as kidneys for cash or collateral. Although there have been some allegations of trafficking of human fetuses for use in the cosmetics and drug industry, these reports have not been substantiated. In recent years the Internet has been used as a medium for the donors and recipients of organ trafficking, whether legal or not.
Legal response
Although the practice of trafficking humans is not new, concerted efforts specifically to curtail human trafficking did not emerge until the mid-1990s, when public awareness of the issue also emerged. The first step to eradicating this problem was to convince multiple stakeholders that human trafficking was a problem warranting government intervention. As antitrafficking rhetoric gained momentum, efforts to address human trafficking crossed ideological and political lines. Recognizing the inadequacy of then-existing laws, the U.S. Congress passed the first comprehensive federal legislation specifically addressing human trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA). The primary goal of the TVPA is to provide protection and assistance to trafficking victims, to encourage international response, and to provide assistance to foreign countries in drafting antitrafficking programs and legislation. The TVPA seeks to successfully combat human trafficking by employing a three-pronged strategy: prosecution, protection, and prevention. Many federal agencies are given the oversight of human trafficking, including the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Labor and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The primary U.S. agency charged with monitoring human trafficking is the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (also called the trafficking office).
In addition to the U.S., many governmental entities throughout the world are actively engaged in the attempt to stop or at least slow the activity of trafficking in humans. In 2000 the UN established the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which provided a commonly accepted working definition of human trafficking and called upon countries to promulgate laws to combat the practice, to assist victims, and to promote coordination and cooperation between countries.
The Office of Drugs and Crime is the UN arm that monitors and implements policies concerning human trafficking and is the designer of the Global Program Against Trafficking in Human Beings (GPAT). Another important international agency with responsibility in this area is Interpol, whose aims are to provide assistance to all national criminal justice agencies and to raise awareness of the issue. Other involved global organizations include the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Human trafficking as organized crime
Human trafficking is a highly structured and organized criminal activity. The criminal enterprises need to transport a large number of migrants over a substantial distance, have a well-organized plan to execute the various stages of the crime, and possess a substantial amount of money for such undertakings. Human traffickers have developed a multibillion-dollar industry by exploiting those forced or willing to migrate. For this reason, migrant trafficking is increasingly recognized as a form of organized crime. Trafficking networks may encompass anything from a few loosely associated freelance criminals to large organized criminal groups acting in concert.
Human trafficking is a lucrative criminal activity, touted as the third most profitable business for organized crime, after drugs and the arms trade, at an estimated $32 billion per year. In fact, narcotics trafficking and human trafficking are often intertwined, using the same actors and routes into a country. Migrant trafficking is one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises. Traffickers resort to other illicit activities to legitimize their proceeds, such as laundering the money obtained not only from trafficking but also from forced labour, sex industries, and the drug trade. To protect their investment, traffickers use terroristic threats as a means of control over their victims and demonstrate power through the threat of deportation, the seizing of travel documentation, or violence against the migrants or their family members remaining in the origin country.

Trafficking is a transnational crime that requires international cooperation, and the United States has taken a lead in promoting intercontinental cooperation. The TVPA provides assistance to foreign governments in facilitating the drafting of antitrafficking laws, the strengthening of investigations, and the prosecuting of offenders. Countries of origin, transit, and destination of trafficking victims are encouraged to adopt minimal antitrafficking standards. These minimal standards consist of prohibiting severe forms of trafficking, prescribing sanctions proportionate to the act, and making a concerted effort to combat organized trafficking.
Foreign governments are to make a sustained effort to cooperate with the international community, assist in the prosecution of traffickers, and protect victims of trafficking. If governments fail to meet the minimum standards or fail to make strides to do so, the United States may cease financial assistance beyond humanitarian and trade-related aid. Furthermore, these countries will face opposition from the United States in obtaining support from financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. Department of State annually reports antitrafficking efforts in the Trafficking in Persons Report on countries considered to have a significant trafficking problem.

Human Trafficking:  The Effects and Impacts in the Society
Human Trafficking:  The Effects and Impacts in the Society
Posted by imarisktotell on August 19, 2017
DEFINITION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The United Nations defines human trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of persons by improper means (such as force, abduction, fraud, or coercion) for an improper purpose including forced labor or sexual exploitation. Human smuggling , a related but different crime, generally involves the consent of the person(s) being smuggled. These people often pay large sums of money to be smuggled across international borders. Once in the country of their final destination, they are generally left to their own devices. Smuggling becomes trafficking when the element of force or coercion is introduced. (United Nations 2000)
TYPES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The U.S. Government categorizes human trafficking as:
Sex trafficking, in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.
The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.
This modern slave trade is a threat to all nations. A grave human rights abuse, it promotes breakdown of families and communities, fuels organized crime, deprives countries of human capital, undermines public health, creates opportunities for extortion and subversion among government officials, and imposes large economic costs. (National Institute of Justice, 2007)
EFFECTS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The field of human rights, and specifically human trafficking, focuses on three
perspectives: policy-making, law-enforcement, and victim-service. Human trafficking
has only recently begun to receive world-wide attention and action; in the U.S.A.,
human trafficking was not specifically addressed by legal means until 2000. There is,
therefore, very little exploration  of this issue from a psychological point of view to research the psychological factors involved in both traffickers and victims alike. Even less research seems to exist on the lasting effects of trafficking and the effects that can occur across generations. Knowing the extent to which human trafficking impacts society is important and includes an issue of global concern, and if research can be done cross-culturally, then governments, humanitarians, and social workers – all institutions that work to reduce human trafficking – can have a better understanding of this issue, thereby improving their efforts to combat it effectively. Studies have been conducted to research the effect that various traumatic events have had on following generations. Such traumatic events include war, torture, and, most extensively, the Holocaust. .  This paper has explored the second-hand effects of trauma, including torture, sexual
violence, and the Holocaust, in order to consider what implications this might hold for the second-hand effects of human trafficking as a specific form of trauma. (Calvo 2014)
REVIEW OF RELATED STUDIES
Dana Hathaway (2012) on his thesis  “Human Trafficking and Slavery: Towards a New Framework for Prevention and Responsibility , has concluded that trafficking and slavery are horrific crimes that require strict penalties for perpetrators and effective protections for survivors, but these crimes are in part facilitated by a system of laws and norms that effectively marginalize certain populations—the “unskilled” migrant. The failure to see this problem as a complex process occurring within the context of a global and interdependent society has resulted in anti-trafficking policy that focuses heavily on direct perpetrators of the crime and border security. This is at the expense of recognizing the complex structural support system that facilitates the supply and demand of the trafficking process. This has lead to confusion about causes and, in turn, confusion about who/what is responsible. Prevention efforts are limited in scope and fail to call attention to structural causes, most significantly the role of current law and policy as contributing factors. Progress has been made over the past decade in how the problem of human trafficking and slavery is understood. The inclusion of the United States in the Trafficking in Persons Report was a turning point, if only for the express recognition that no country or culture is immune to this social problem. Much more progress is needed, however. Human trafficking and slavery are already illegal. Trafficking and slavery are symptoms of larger systemic and structural problems, and that anti-trafficking efforts must focus heavily on prevention. Specifically, prevention must address the structural conditions that make ripe an environment in which trafficking and slavery are sustained.
On the other hand, Katherine Calvo (2014) on her thesis on  “The Psychological Effects of Human Trafficking on  Second Generation”, has concluded that the lack of psychological or sociological studies on how the effects of human trafficking can transcend into the second generation makes it difficult to fully comprehend the extent to which the experience of trafficking affects victims. Without empirical studies, then it cannot be said with any level of certainty how this particular trauma manifests, which only impedes our ability to treat any symptoms or conditions that develop as a result of it. Although the existence of slavery is not new, the modern concept of human trafficking as a legal crime is a recent one. Further research into the extent trafficking affects us is crucial not only in understanding it but also in combating it. Such research should consider human trafficking as a form of trauma involving at least one perpetrator and at least one victim rather than simply a criminal offense such as prostitution or smuggling, and it might yield more signs that law enforcement could find useful when attempting to distinguish a case of human trafficking from other similar crimes.  It can also yield information on the differences of symptoms and conditions as they develop between generations, which would help social services cater clinical programs and resources to clients. The information yielded by such studies could also be used in the courtroom to ensure that the perpetrator serves a sentence appropriate for the severity of the crime and that victims receive suitable treatment. The more information we have, the more effective our solutions can be; the more effective our solutions, the sooner we can abolish slavery once and for all.
The documentary film produced by Chris Hilton and directed by Aaron Wolf (2003),entitled “Dying to Leave”, tells the story of organizations working to combat human trafficking. The director uses personal interviews of people working in these organizations and footage of their work to show how these individuals first learned about slavery and moved to inspiring action to emancipate girls and boys as well as women and men held in bondage.
This film summarizes the five impacts of human trafficking: (studymoose.com 2016)
The First Impact on Society: The Cause and Effect of Globalization .  According to  the documentary film and the book of James Harf and Mark Owen Lombardi (2006), Taking sided: “ Clashing Views on Global Issues”, globalization is one of the root causes of human trafficking.  This is because of the tantamount advertisement and imaged shown via mass media, people from all over the world develop a belief that there are greener pastures available elsewhere and that there are innumerable opportunities existing.  It has created the mindset and the opportunity for people, creating human smuggling as a result.  Hence, human trafficking can also have its impact on globalization.  Because of human trafficking, people who are either very poor that they want to leave their own country or those who merely want better opportunities are smuggled the boarders of other countries. (Harf & Lombarde 2006)
The Second Impact on Society: The Illusion of a Better World The immigrants explore the outside world and can open their eyes to both possibilities and horrifying circumstances.  As what was the experience of Chinese man by the name of Henry Zheng, showed, leaving their home place is sometimes not a good thing at all.  According to him, their village is composed of families who have members sent to the West (America or Europe).   Thus, people develop an overall belief that their own country is not enough.  In turn, this could also lead to mentality of the loss of own cultural identity and the virtue of patriotism, The Third Impact on Society: When smuggling becomes deadly. (Hilton & Wold 2003).
The Third Impact on Society: When Human Smuggling Becomes Deadly. Another experience shown in the documentary film, is that of Farid Kadhem, who lost his wife and only daughter on the horrifying trip for a better life, Human trafficking does indeed hold such promise of a better life, as what shown in television, shows in different parts of the world. However, the trip itself, can be deadly as the passengers are ill-treated.  , congested and packed together, are given little or no food at all, and sometime, even develop, illnesses on-board.  This case can also cause the loss of lives.
The Fourth Impact on Society: Slavery and Prostitution .  People Sometimes willingly migrate to other countries by means of human smuggling. The stories of two women in the story, Nina Matveyenko and Marcela Palacios were duped into thinking that they would have better lives by the respectable jobs that are waiting for them, little did they know that they would be sold as mere merchandize ad would be slaves or prostitutes in other country.  This has, in some effect, a possibility of organized crime and recruitment, wherein women can be forced to obey the whims of whoever bought them. This causes an alarming issue on women’s rights.  As what Janie Chung (2006) stated, women comprise the majority of trafficked people (cited in Harf & Lombardi 2006)
The Fifth Impact on Society: Why Migration Can also be a Good Thing .  Migration can develop interconnections of different nations and create opportunities for other people to explore other cultures different from their own.  Migration causes a very colourful diversity to countries when it could be otherwise dull and monotonous.  However, human trafficking is very different to legal migration.  Human trafficking can cause such grave consequences for the people involved, for the organizers, and for the family and country left behind.  As what cited in the film, there are villages in the countryside of China wherein males are not even present anymore and this scene can contribute what is happening and what may happen in the future, (Hilton and Wolfe 2003)

What is Human Trafficking?
The United Nations defines human trafficking as:
“The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.”
San Francisco is not immune to the problem, and has been considered a prime destination for human trafficking due to its ports, airports, industry, and rising immigrant populations. Human trafficking is the second largest and fastest growing criminal industry in the world with as many as 27 million individuals living in slavery-like conditions throughout the world.

Types of Human Trafficking
The 3 most common types of human trafficking are sex trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage. Forced labor, also known as involuntary servitude, is the biggest sector of trafficking in the world, according to the U.S. Department of State. Debt bondage is another form of human trafficking in which an individual is forced to work in order to pay a debt.
Sex trafficking disproportionately affects women and children and involves forced participation in commercial sex acts. In the United States, any child under the age of 18 who has been involved in a commercial sex act is considered a trafficking victim. Women and girls make up 80% of the people trafficked transnationally. Yearly, traffickers exploit 1 million children in the commercial sex trade.
Perceptions of human trafficking often involve women forced into prostitution. This is just one aspect of human trafficking. Survivors of trafficking also include men and children, and these survivors are exploited by any number of means. Victims may be forced into any of the following types of labor, among others:
• domestic servitude
• agricultural work
• manufacturing
• janitorial services
• hotel services
• construction
• health and elder care
• hair and nail salons
• prostitution
• strip club dancing
Some survivors are “mail-order” brides who believe they are going to a new country for marriage, but instead are enslaved.  All nationalities and ethnic groups are vulnerable to human trafficking. Any given country may be a source of forced labor, a place of transit, or a destination.
Return to Top
The Needs of Survivors of Human Trafficking
Survivors of human trafficking are forced, tricked or misled into modern-day slavery.  If they are able to escape a shrouded abduction and hidden enslavement, they have specific needs that are unique to their situation. Survivors may have experienced profound trauma, lack linguistic skills in the country of their escape, and struggle with basic functioning after trafficking.  The United Nations, the United States government, the State of California, and the City of San Francisco are all committed to meeting the unique needs of human trafficking survivors, with the aim of ending this particularly heinous crime once and for all.

Signs of HumanTrafficking
A person who has been trafficked may:
Show signs that their movement is controlled
Have false identity or travel documents
Not know their home or work address
Have no access to their earnings
Be unable to negotiate working conditions
Work excessively long hours over long periods
Have limited or no social interaction
Have limited contact with their families or with people outside of their immediate environment
Think that they are bonded by debt

Examples of Human Trafficking
Forced Labor: A family gives up a child to an adoption agent in Nepal because they cannot afford to care for him. He is then, in turn, sold to a sweatshop owner who forces the child to learn to sew garments without pay for hours each day. The child receives minimal nutrition and does not attend school.
Sex Trafficking: Two women from Korea are brought into San Francisco under the pretense that they will receive jobs as hostesses or waitresses. When they arrive, they are held captive and forced into prostitution, while their captor controls the money they receive.
Debt Bondage: A young woman from Russia has amassed grave credit card debt and is desperate to pay it off. A man who identifies himself as an employment agent offers her a job in the United States as a domestic employee.  She arrives in the San Francisco with a valid visa but it and her passport and taken from her. She is brought to a home where her movement is restricted. She is then told that she must work as a housekeeper to pay off the cost of her travel or her family will be killed.
Child Sex Trafficking: A 15-year-old boy runs away from his home in San Francisco to Oakland, where he lives on the street. He is seduced by a pimp who coerces him into participating in a prostitution ring and controls all the profits generated.

What is Human Trafficking?
Human trafficking and modern slavery are thought to be amongst the most widespread crimes in the world, affecting millions of men, women and children each day.
Human Trafficking
It is defined by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as:
The Act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.
Broken down into simpler terms, this means human trafficking is made up of three elements:
Movement or recruitment by
Deception or coercion for
The purpose of exploitation
Modern Slavery
This acts as an umbrella term, which covers a number of human rights issues, of which human trafficking is one.
It is mainly defined by the 1956 UN supplementary convention which says:
…debt bondage, serfdom, forced marriage and the delivery of a child for the exploitation of that child are all slavery-like practices and require criminalisation and abolishment…
Modern slavery encompasses:
Slavery
Human trafficking
Servitude
Forced or compulsory labour
Traffickers and slave masters use whatever means they have at their disposal to coerce, deceive and force individuals into a life of abuse, servitude, and inhumane treatment.

Human trafficking
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Human trafficking: Countries of origin are shown in red, destination countries are shown in blue; Data is from the UN, in 2006
Prostitutes in front of a bar, in Thailand: : Like slaves on an auction block waiting to be selected, victims of human trafficking have to do what they are told, or they will be beaten.
Human trafficking (or Trafficking in human beings) is a way to exploit people. People are sold, bought, traded much like slaves , and are even sold to couples who don't have children. It is estimated to be a $5 to $9 billion-a-year industry. [1] Trafficking victims typically are recruited by using force or because they are deceived, or fraud is used, power is abused, or they are simply abducted.  Threats, violence, and economic problems can often make a victim consent to exploitation .
Human trafficking should not be confused with human smuggling.[2] [3] [4]

General[change | change source]
Exploitation includes forcing people into prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. For children exploitation may also include forced prostitution, illegal international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, or recruitment as child soldiers, beggars, for sports (such as child camel jockeys or football players), or for religious cults. [5]
The norms based on international human rights law, such as Vienna Declaration [6] and the Yogyakarta Principles [7] prohibit human trafficking and Council of Europe and Charter of Fundamental Rights of European Union also prohibit them and do effort to save the victims.
Sex trafficking[change | change source]
Sex trafficking is human trafficking, where the main idea is to trick or force people so they can be used for sexual needs. This is fundamentally different from sex work or prostitution. Prostitution and sex work is legal in many countries. Human trafficking is almost always illegal.

a poster from around 1900 warning girls to check carefully, before working abroad. At that time, Germany was a country many prostitutes were from (source country). Today it is mostly a destination country.
Many are women, but it is not rare for men to also be trafficked. Their ages, ethnic and their socioeconomic background all vary. Still there are groups of people that are more high-risk. [8] [9]
Homeless and runaway young people
People that move from other countries and have low resources
People who have gone through physical, emotional, or sexual abuse
People who have been mistreated in their life and have low social skills
Who does it?[change | change source]
In 2017 they analyzed 1,416 child sex traffickers that were arrested in the United States in the past 10 years and it was found that 75.4% of traffickers are male and 24.4% are female. In average they were younger than 30 years. [10]
Ways of trafficking[change | change source]
Trafficking controlled by pimps: A person is controlled by one trafficker called a pimp. They sometimes use promises of marriage or possible modeling chances to attract victims. [11] Other times they simply use intimidation, brainwashing and kidnapping.
Trafficking done by gangs: It is a lot like pimp-controlled trafficking, but a person is controlled by a large group of people. [12] They can also attract people by making them trust them. Gangs now have been using sex trafficking because it is safer and leaves more money than drug trafficking.
Trafficking done by a person's family: The person is controlled by members of their own families. They let them be exploited and ask for something in return, usually drugs or money.
Trafficking done by cybersex: Cybersex trafficking means the live streaming of forced sexual acts and/or rape on camera of trafficked victims. [13] [14] [15]
Forced marriage: When a person is sent to another country, forced into a marriage and then is forced to participate in sexual conduct with their new partner, then the experience is considered sex trafficking. [16]
Child trafficking[change | change source]
Child trafficking is defined as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, and/or receipt" of a child for the purpose of exploitation.[17] The commercial sexual exploitation of children can take many forms. This includes forcing a child into Child prostitution.[18] Or it can be other forms of sexual activity like child pornography. exploitation may also involve forced labour or services like slavery. It can mean practices similar to slavery such as servitude or the removal of organs, illegal adoption, or recruitment as child soldiers.[19]

Alright, so I've got this definition from the Britannica website. It says human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery involving the illegal transport of individuals by force or deception for the purpose of labor, sexual exploitation, or activities in which others benefit financially. It's a global problem affecting people of all ages, and there are estimates of about 1 million people being trafficked each year globally, with 20,000 to 50,000 being trafficked into the United States alone.

So, the United Nations divides human trafficking into three categories: sex trafficking, labor trafficking, and the removal of organs. The US definition doesn't include organ removal, but it recognizes sex and labor trafficking. It describes human trafficking as the purposeful transportation of an individual for exploitation.

From this, it seems like human trafficking is a huge issue, involving millions of people worldwide. But I need to verify these numbers and see if there's more recent data available.

Let me check another source. There's a blog post from Facebook7501.wordpress.com that talks about the effects and impacts of human trafficking in society. It defines human trafficking similarly to the UN, mentioning force, abduction, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of forced labor or sexual exploitation.

It also mentions that human smuggling is related but different, as it involves consent from the person being smuggled, who often pays to be transported illegally across borders. But if force or coercion is introduced, smuggling becomes trafficking.

This blog post also categorizes human trafficking into sex trafficking and labor trafficking, aligning with what I read earlier.

Moving on to the next source from sf-hrc.org, it defines human trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons by force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of exploitation. It specifies that in the US, any child under 18 involved in commercial sex acts is considered a trafficking victim, regardless of consent.

This source also notes that San Francisco is a prime destination for human trafficking due to its ports, airports, industry, and immigrant populations. It's interesting to see that even in the US, a developed country, human trafficking is a significant problem.

It lists the three most common types of human trafficking as sex trafficking, forced labor, and debt bondage. It emphasizes that trafficking affects all genders and ages, not just women and children, contrary to common perceptions.

Another source from stopthetraffik.org defines human trafficking as the movement or recruitment of people through deception or coercion for the purpose of exploitation. It distinguishes human trafficking from modern slavery, saying that the latter is an umbrella term that includes slavery, human trafficking, servitude, forced labor, and other slavery-like practices.

This suggests that human trafficking is a subset of modern slavery, which encompasses a broader range of exploitative practices.

Lastly, the Simple English Wikipedia page defines human trafficking as selling, buying, or trading people like slaves, often for prostitution or other forms of exploitation. It emphasizes that trafficking is different from people smuggling, although there can be overlaps.

Looking at these definitions, there's a consensus that human trafficking involves the exploitation of people through force, fraud, or coercion, primarily for sex work or forced labor.

Now, regarding the scale of the problem, the Britannica article mentions about 1 million people trafficked globally each year, with 20,000 to 50,000 being trafficked into the US. However, this data might be outdated. I need to find more current statistics.

Maybe I should search for recent statistics on human trafficking.

Human trafficking - Statistics & Facts
Published by M. Szmigiera , Jun 29, 2021
Despite increased international attention and resources from states and other non-governmental institutions, the number of people falling victim to human trafficking around the world continues to grow. Between 2008 and 2019 the number of human trafficking victims identified worldwide more than tripled from 30,961 to 105,787. Though such statistics also lead to a degree of optimism among investigators and human rights advocates as it suggests that additional focus has led to greater exposure of the issue. After all, trafficking in persons is an illegal practice that is shaded in secrecy, and it is therefore nearly impossible to measure it in its entirety.

2017 Human Trafficking Statistics
March 20, 2018
2017 Human Trafficking Statistics
Last week Polaris released the 2017 human trafficking statistics as reported by the National Human Trafficking Hotline (NHTH). The hotline is a 24-hour confidential toll-free number that serves victims and survivors of human trafficking in the United States. The hotline operates in more than 200 languages and provides a platform for victims, survivors, and community members to report incidents – or suspected incidents – of human trafficking around the country. Cases are validated against indicators of human trafficking. The NHTH was established in 2007 and is funded by the Department of Health and Human Services as well as private donors, and operated by Polaris, a leading anti-trafficking organization.
In 2017, 8,759 cases of human trafficking were reported to the NHTH, representing over 10,000 individual victims, almost 5,000 potential traffickers, and more than 1,500 businesses involved in human trafficking. This was a 13 percent increase in cases compared to 2016. Women and girls were disproportionately victimized, comprising approximately 80 percent of the identified survivors. While only 35 percent of survivors reported race/ethnicity, Latino (1,230) was the most represented, followed by Asian (979), White (699), African/African-American/Black (592), and multi-ethnic/multi-racial (136).
The 2017 statistics categorize human trafficking in three groups: (1) sex trafficking; (2) sex and labor trafficking; and, (3) labor trafficking. Sex trafficking is the most common among these groups, followed by sex and labor trafficking, and labor trafficking.
Sex Trafficking
Within the sex trafficking category, Polaris reports that most reported trafficking cases concerned escort services (1,572), followed by residential (508), and outdoor solicitation (329). The average age that trafficking began was identified as 19. Crucially, the statistics include the recruitment tactics of traffickers. While not all victims reported on their recruitment, intimate partner/marriage proposition (711) was the most common among those who did. This was accompanied by familial relations (525), posing as a benefactor (397), job offers (209), and false promises and/or fraud (195).
Sex & Labor Trafficking
Sex and labor trafficking refers to a situation in which the victim is forced or coerced to engage in both labor and sexual exploitation. In this category, illicit massage businesses (774) had the greatest number of reports to the NHTH, followed by bars/strip clubs/cantinas (194), and “illicit activities” (104).
Labor Trafficking
Though sex trafficking receives the bulk of the attention, labor trafficking is also present throughout the United States. In 2017, domestic work (242) was most commonly reported, followed by agriculture (134), and peddling and begging (109). Contrary to sex trafficking, the top reported recruitment tactic for labor trafficking is a job offer (704). Other tactics include false promises/fraud (471), “smuggling related” (200), familial relations (162), and posing as a benefactor (110). In 2017, the average age for entry into labor trafficking was 23.
Top States for Human Trafficking
Human trafficking occurs in every state. California (1,305), Texas (792), and Florida (604) received the highest number of reported cases. This is due, in part, to their large populations, high immigrant populations, and status as border/entry states. Though these states are the top three states for human trafficking according to the NHTH, they use all of the tools at their disposal to address the issue and each received Polaris’ highest rating for confronting trafficking in 2014, the last year the state ratings were published.
For more information on the 2017 National Human Trafficking Hotline Statistics, read the Polaris Fact Sheet.
For more information on the reporting categories and types of human trafficking, read Polaris’ Typology of Modern Slavery report.
If you need help or suspect that you’ve observed human trafficking call (1-888-373-7888), text (233733), or TTY (711) the National Human Trafficking Hotline. If you are in immediate danger, call 911.

Okay, so from these new sources, I'm getting more recent statistics on human trafficking. The Statista website has some really interesting data.

First, in 2020, there were 109,216 identified victims of human trafficking worldwide. That's almost 110,000 people! And it's almost ten thousand less than in 2019, but still, the number has significantly increased over the past decade. That's a lot of people being trafficked.

Another Statista chart shows the number of human trafficking victims identified from 2008 to 2020, and it's clear that the numbers have been rising steadily.

Also, in 2020, there were 5,271 human traffickers convicted worldwide. That's a decrease from the previous year, but still, it's a significant number.

The Human Trafficking Search website has some 2017 statistics from the National Human Trafficking Hotline. In 2017, there were 8,759 reported cases of human trafficking in the US, representing over 10,000 victims. That's pretty shocking.

The statistics categorize human trafficking into sex trafficking, sex and labor trafficking, and labor trafficking. Sex trafficking was the most common, followed by sex and labor trafficking, and then labor trafficking.

In terms of demographics, women and girls made up about 80% of identified survivors, which is disturbing.

The top states for reported human trafficking cases in the US were California, Texas, and Florida. That makes sense given their large populations and other factors.

I also found a guide from the University of Illinois library that lists resources for statistics on human trafficking, including databases like ProQuest Statistical Insight and reports from the UN and ILO.

So, overall, it seems that human trafficking is a massive problem affecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people worldwide. The numbers are staggering, and it's clear that more needs to be done to combat this issue.

But I'm wondering, are these numbers accurate? Is there a way to verify them? Human trafficking is a hidden crime, so it's likely that many cases go unreported. Maybe the actual numbers are even higher.

Perhaps I should look for more information on the limitations of these statistics and see if there are any studies that try to estimate the true scale of human trafficking.

Gaps in Reporting Human Trafficking Incidents Result in Significant Undercounting
Deficient data on the incidence of human trafficking offenses reflect pervasive issues with incident identification and reporting, a study combining stakeholder interviews and data analysis shows.
August 4, 2020
Crime statistics on human trafficking are only as solid as the crime data informing them. Recent NIJ-supported research reveals that labor and sex trafficking data appearing in the FBI’s national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program may significantly understate the extent of human trafficking crimes in the United States.
Before this, there had been no research on the validity of UCR data on human trafficking, the researchers noted. An objective of the study was to advance understanding of how accurately reporting of human trafficking crimes reflects the true incidence of crime in a community.
Researchers discovered a widespread inability of law enforcement officers to identify local trafficking offenses, coupled with inadequate reporting of those offenses that were identified. That insight was the product of extensive record reviews and structured interviews with law enforcement and social service providers. Extrapolating their findings from three study sites to a national scale, the research team led by Amy Farrell, a Northeastern University criminologist, concluded that “the UCR Program undercounts both human trafficking offenses that exist in local communities and human trafficking offenses that are identified by local law enforcement.”
The crux of the problem is that, in order for us to make accurate estimations of human trafficking from the collected data, law enforcement investigators need to be able to identify the victims. The study found that inadequate victim identification was a problem not only for law enforcement but also for victim service providers. As a result, the data collections available for study are limited and tend to underrepresent the victim populations.
Trafficking Incidence Far Exceeds Trafficking Reports
In two of the three study sites [1] — jurisdictions with populations of 2.3 million and 600,000, respectively — researchers concluded that human trafficking incidents identified in law enforcement and social service agency records likely represented only a fraction of the actual incidence. The study found that the official trafficking numbers in one jurisdiction represented as little as 14% and at most 18% of the potential total trafficking victims. [2] Looking at law enforcement’s human trafficking records alone, underreporting in those two jurisdictions was even more acute, with no more than 6% of potential human trafficking victims captured in police records in both jurisdictions, the research report noted.
In 2008, a federal statute for protecting trafficking victims authorized the FBI to start collecting offense and arrest data on trafficking as part of the UCR Program. In 2013, the UCR Program started collecting information in its Summary Reporting System and the National Incident-Based Reporting System on human trafficking in commercial sex acts and human trafficking in involuntary servitude (i.e., sex trafficking and labor trafficking).
The deficiency of UCR data on trafficking crimes is attributable to three primary factors, the report said:
The relative recency of the incorporation of trafficking data in UCR, with some jurisdictions moving more quickly than others to contribute their data to that central crime data source.
Deficient identification of potential human trafficking incidents by local law enforcement.
Incomplete reporting of identified offenses at the local and state agency levels.
Many Officers Unable To Identify Human Trafficking or Not Inclined To Report It as Such
Interviews with law enforcement personnel found three main challenges to identification of trafficking offenses by law enforcement, the report stated:
Lack of training of law enforcement personnel.
The fact that identification of human trafficking victims is often pushed to later stages of criminal justice proceedings.
The fact that the nature of human trafficking crimes often complicates identification. A common problem for officers is difficulty separating human trafficking from other offenses, such as prostitution, the researchers reported. Where human trafficking offenses were identified, they were often recorded as other offenses on incident reports, in some instances because offense codes for human trafficking do not exist in records systems or incident reports.
Specialized investigators were better equipped to identify trafficking offenses, according to the study, but those investigators often hesitated to record a trafficking offense as such. In some instances, specialized investigators said they only coded incidents as trafficking offenses if an individual was arrested and charged with a trafficking offense by a prosecutor. State law enforcement personnel interviewed in one jurisdiction said officers hesitate to report incidents as human trafficking when they involve juvenile victims, because of special victim information reporting requirements. In classifying offenses, officers often defer to the prosecutor. The researchers found that, across studied jurisdictions, officers lacked the ability to identify labor trafficking.
Part of the complexity of human trafficking crimes is that, by definition, they must be the result of force, fraud, or coercion. For a case to be prosecuted, it is usually vital that victims be able to provide information on commercial labor or sex operations that can be corroborated. But researcher interviews of victims reflected that they are often reluctant to share information on their traffickers. In some instances, victims were not initially aware that their circumstances constituted human trafficking.
Beyond inadequate identification of human trafficking offenses, the UCR data are depressed by gaps in local crime reporting to state crime reporting programs and the failure of some state programs to maintain human trafficking crime classifications.
Recommendations From the Researchers
The researchers’ recommendations for law enforcement agencies included, among other actions:
Continued training of officers on how to spot a trafficking case, how to record it, and how to refer it to special investigators.
Establishment of nontraditional partnerships between law enforcement, labor regulators, inspection services, youth service providers, and immigration advocates to address labor trafficking.
Cooperation between law enforcement and prosecutors to develop other kinds of evidence, besides victim testimony, to prosecute trafficking cases.
Recommendations for non-law enforcement agencies included:
Training and supervision of agency staff on identifying trafficking victims; development and adoption of standardized tools to identify trafficking incidents.
Creation of a uniform trafficking database to be used across agencies.
The team also made recommendations for improving population estimates of trafficking victims. In this field of inquiry, estimation methods are still being tested, and data collection systems vary widely.
Conclusion
The challenges that human trafficking crimes pose for law enforcement and social service agencies are compounded by both the widespread inability of authorities to identify trafficking cases and the broadly inadequate reporting of vital human trafficking data. The Northeastern University research team urged that accurate identification of victims and accurate reporting are critical to addressing labor and sex trafficking and to supporting trafficking victims, their service providers, and law enforcement.
The inclusion of trafficking crimes in UCR was an important step toward enabling law enforcement and social service agencies to fully grasp the scope of the problem and provide a measured response. But research has found that current UCR trafficking numbers probably significantly underreport actual incidence, capturing only a fraction of trafficking crimes.
A key reason for the reporting gap is a pervasive and critical lack of trafficking identification in jurisdictions across the nation. For a variety of reasons, many human trafficking cases investigated by law enforcement are simply not identified as such, even in agencies with specially trained staff. Social service providers have also frequently failed to identify trafficking incidents, and they often underreported the human trafficking incidents known to their agencies.
Better training of officers, and of the service providers who address both sex and labor trafficking, will improve enforcement against traffickers and ensure needed support of victims, the report said. Better training of crime data development staff will produce a more complete picture of the human trafficking problem.

Data strengths & limitations
Further reading
The crime of human trafficking is complex and dynamic, taking place in a wide variety of contexts and difficult to detect. One of the greatest challenges in developing targeted counter-trafficking responses and measuring their impact is the lack of reliable, high-quality data related to the scale of human trafficking and the profile of victims.
The need for improved international response to human trafficking and commitment to its eradication is illustrated by its prominent inclusion in the targets of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (GCM). Eradicating human trafficking is addressed specifically in goals 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2. The GCM’s 10th Objective also calls for specific measures to prevent and combat trafficking in persons in the context of international migration.
Definition
The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons defines human trafficking or trafficking in persons:
“Trafficking in Persons”… mean[s] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. (Article 3, paragraph (a)).
The Protocol further elaborates that the consent of a trafficked person may be rendered irrelevant when obtained through improper means:
The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used; (Article 3, paragraph (b)).
In the case of trafficked children, the Protocol elaborates that the vulnerable status of children makes it impossible for them to consent regardless of whether any improper means were used or not:
The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered "trafficking in persons" even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article; (Article 3, paragraph (c)).
"Child" shall mean any person under eighteen. (Article 3, paragraph (d)).
Recent trends
Since the early 2000s, the proportion of identified cases of trafficking for sexual exploitation has in general declined, while the share of identified cases of trafficking for forced labour has generally increased, as identification of such cases has improved. However, there are regional differences in the rates of both trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labour. For example, data from UNODC and CTDC show that trafficking for forced labour has a higher rate in Africa and the Middle East than trafficking for sexual exploitation, while the opposite is true for regions such as Europe and Northern America. 1 This is partly reflected in the CTDC data above, where an increase of available case data from Northern America from 2015 onwards increased the proportion of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation in the dataset.
A large proportion of victims identified are female, as human trafficking had previously tended to be seen as a crime which affects mostly females who are trafficked for sexual exploitation. Over time, a higher percentage of men have been identified as it has been acknowledged that men can also be vulnerable to many forms of human trafficking, including sexual exploitation, and the identification of such cases has improved. The proportion of children relative to adults for males and females is about the same.
CTDC data also show differences in the routes undertaken by victims of trafficking. Nearly 80 per cent of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border control points, such as airports and land border control points. Victims of labour exploitation are more likely to be trafficked through official border control points, while victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation account for more cases crossing borders via locations that don’t have official border control points. This includes irregular routes, such as those across the sea or cross-country. Children are also more likely than adults to be trafficked via routes that don’t have official border control points.
Half of the victims identified by CTDC partners are under 26. Nearly a quarter of them are children. In fact, the largest age group in the whole distribution is 15 to 17 years old.
Data sources
The main sources of data on human trafficking globally are based on information provided by identified victims. These are usually collected by a range of different actors, including law enforcement, the judiciary, and non-governmental organizations providing protection and assistance to victims.
Several UN agencies and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have collaborated to produce data sources on the profiles of victims of human trafficking, the prevalence of human trafficking, and on related phenomena such as forced labour and forced marriage.
Operational case data and victim profiles
In the course of protecting and providing services to victims, counter-trafficking actors frequently collect individual-level, operational case data. IOM has been providing direct assistance to victims of human trafficking since the mid-1990s and assists approximately 8,000 victims each year globally. Through its case management activities, the Organization has developed the largest database of victim of trafficking case data in the world, with information on over 55,000 individual cases.
Operational data from counter-trafficking organizations are often highly sensitive and pertain to individuals, which raises a range of privacy and civil liberty concerns where the risk of identifying data subjects can be high and the consequences severe. While many organizations and governments around the world collect data on cases of human trafficking, disaggregated data has not been easily accessible to external stakeholders or has not been frequently shared between relevant actors in the past due to the sensitivity of its content, and data protection and confidentiality considerations.
To overcome these challenges, in 2017, IOM made its own data publicly available online through the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC), along with combined data from other leading counter-trafficking organizations with significant case-level datasets.
The Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative
The Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) is the first global data hub on human trafficking, with data contributed by organizations from around the world. The resulting dataset is the largest of its kind globally, with information on over 108,000 individual cases of human trafficking visualized throughout the site, including through an interactive global map. An anonymized version of this dataset is publicly available to download. By putting such data in the public domain, the goal of CTDC is to break down information-sharing barriers and equip the counter-trafficking community with up to date, reliable data on human trafficking. As new data from contributing partners are added, CTDC will continue to expand in scope, featuring new datasets from diverse counter-trafficking actors and disseminating standards on sharing trafficking-case data.
IOM’s Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative has made great progress in overcoming data obstacles, but more work is needed throughout the counter-trafficking community to agree on common standards and methods of data sharing and applicability. Disaggregated case-level data are the most detailed source of information on human trafficking and should thus play a vital part of any meaningful analysis on the phenomenon.
National reporting mechanisms
Another key source of trafficking information is official reports on administrative data compiled by governments (or other central reporting bodies) on human trafficking cases within their national jurisdictions.
UNODC surveys governments on trafficking victims identified in their respective countries for the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, using a common questionnaire with a standard set of indicators, and then aggregates the results.  The most recent global report was produced in 2018. In 2016, this exercise produced data on more than 24,000 identified victims of trafficking from 97 governments, a peak compared to the previous years. Data are largely published in the form of total numbers disaggregated by variables such as sex, age, and type of exploitation, wherever possible. In addition to government surveys, UNODC collects official information such as police reports that are available in the public domain, and some information from inter-governmental organisations and NGOs.
Estimating prevalence of human trafficking
There are currently no global or regional estimates of the prevalence of human trafficking.
Some national estimates have been developed, including using human trafficking administrative data:
Multiple Systems Estimation is the methodology used to estimate the total (unidentified and identified) victims of trafficking at country level. This is based on the analysis of the overlap of multiple lists of human trafficking cases provided by different actors in the counter-trafficking field, such as NGOs, law enforcement, other authorities and international organizations. MSE depends upon the existence of various databases of identified victims of human trafficking in the country of implementation. A number of other technical assumptions should also be met. For example, it must be possible for more than one entity recording administrative data to be able to independently identify a victim of trafficking. Researchers developing the method have estimated that it could potentially be used in approximately 50 countries around the world. Initial estimates have already been conducted in several countries, including the UK and the Netherlands.
Relatively few examples of estimates of related forms of exploitation exist:
2017 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery- This is a global estimate of the prevalence of the human-trafficking-related crimes of forced labour and forced marriage, produced by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Walk Free Foundation (WFF), in collaboration with IOM. The 2017 report estimates that 40 million people were victims of modern slavery in any given day in 2016. Out of these, approximately 25 million people were in forced labour and another 15 million people were in a forced marriage. Data from IOM’s human trafficking database on sexual exploitation and child exploitation were used for the estimates.
Estimating forced labour, forced recruitment and abductions in displacement contexts. IOM is developing a series of comparable estimates on prevalence of forced labour, forced marriage, forced recruitment into armed groups and abductions among Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and their families, in partnership with ILO and WFF. This is a pilot research initiative in three countries with large numbers of IDPs and where IOM has substantial humanitarian operations and suitable sampling frames. The report with the findings, methodology and recommendations will be published in 2020.
Trafficking in humanitarian settings and large-scale migration flows
Humanitarian crises such as those associated with conflicts or natural disasters may exacerbate pre-existing trafficking trends and give rise to new ones. While some forms of trafficking could be a direct result of crises, such as exploitative sexual services demanded by armed groups or the forced recruitment of child soldiers, others are less evident, with traffickers thriving on the widespread human, material, social and economic losses caused by crises and the inability of families and communities to protect themselves and their children.
IOM works to combat trafficking and protect trafficked persons in humanitarian settings. To address the acute need for data for evidence-based programming in these location, IOM has been using its Displacement Tracking Matrix to regularly collect data on risks and issues relevant to human trafficking and exploitation in crises. In addition, IOM with partners is also working to produce prevalence estimates on issues related to human trafficking.
Locations of recent regular data collection with human trafficking indicators include Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, North-East Nigeria, Ukraine, Central and South American countries. The data gathered during these operations can be used to better understand risks to trafficking, vulnerability to exploitation, gaps in assistance and to identify areas of further research.
IOM, through DTM, also produces primary data on the migrants’ vulnerability to human trafficking, abuse, exploitation and violence on different migration routes, for example on the main migration routes to Europe. Data with trafficking indicators are collected in countries like Italy, Libya, or Greece. Further similar data collection is planned in countries from Central and West Africa, and in Eastern Africa.
IOM produced a report with UNICEF on the specific experiences of children and youth migrating via the Mediterranean migration routes to Europe. In a separate report, IOM identified predictors of vulnerability to human trafficking and exploitation for migrants taking these routes. There is limited reliable data on human trafficking and exploitation in displacement contexts.
Data strengths & limitations
Operational case data and victim profiles
The availability of data on identified victims of trafficking depends on a range of factors, for example on whether counter trafficking organizations are operational or able to consistently collect or share data in any given country/location. Therefore, data coverage is not always comprehensive. Presence of large quantities of human trafficking data may not necessarily indicate higher prevalence, and a paucity of data in certain contexts may be due a lack of effective counter-trafficking responses.  Identified cases are better understood as a sample of the unidentified population of victims. This sample may be biased if some types of trafficking cases are more likely to be identified (or referred) than others. Even if this is the case, the extent of the bias is rarely known, since the unidentified population is, by definition, unknown. Nevertheless, where available, these data are indispensable, as they provide detailed insight into the profiles and experiences of the victims, the forms of human trafficking, and information on perpetrators.
National reporting mechanisms
While data from National Reporting Mechanisms are not detailed and generally only available as high-level aggregates, limiting their use, they have the widest geographical coverage and therefore provide useful baseline information on human trafficking at the global level. Furthermore, in the absence of publicly available disaggregated data, official reports may be the only source of data on identified victims available in a given country or region.
Estimating prevalence of human trafficking
National estimates of trafficking prevalence have been produced in several countries. However, they are commonly based on modelling of existing administrative data from identified cases and should therefore only be considered as basic baseline estimates. Historically, producing estimates of the prevalence of trafficking based on the collection of new primary data, for example through surveys, has been difficult. This is due to trafficking’s complicated legal definition and the ethical challenges of addressing sensitive questions to household survey respondents. Not all countries can be sampled due to resource constraints, security reasons, or the presence of large-scale humanitarian emergencies. There are also ethical considerations and further challenges related to large-scale household surveys in terms of the sensitivity of certain questions (for example, questions related to sexual exploitation or violence) and the difficulty of collecting data about children. This makes the case data mentioned above all the more valuable, both to gain insights on these specific profiles and to support estimations.
Trafficking in humanitarian settings and large-scale migration flows
Finally, humanitarian settings are often highly pressurised and fast changing environments, where conducting rigorous and ethical data collection can be challenging. For example, access to affected populations for data collectors can rapidly change, and services relevant for assistance of victims of human trafficking might not initially exist in crisis-affected locations.  Therefore, the methods of data collection need to avoid causing harm, and they need to be time-sensitive and adaptable. Sampling best practices can also be challenging to implement in some environments.

20 Somber Sex Trafficking Statistics for a Safer 2022
Marija Kovachevska
January 28, 2022
Human trafficking is one thing you don’t really consider, except if you encountered them in movies. It seems that such a thing cannot possibly happen in a civilized world.
However, current sex trafficking statistics reveal that human traffickers are jubilant over a new useful victim-tracking tool: online social platforms. This is proven by the growing number of trafficked individuals, adults and children alike, regardless of their origins.
Are you ready to learn to recognize how this modern slavery functions, including the new ways it has come to encapsulate the digital world? Read on and find out.
Top Ten Sex Trafficking Statistics for 2022
In Europe, the Netherlands tops the human trafficking countries list based on the number of victims registered.
The typical duration of sexual exploitation is 2 years on average.
The worldwide sex trafficking statistics show around 4.8 million victims, the majority of them coming from the Asia Pacific region.
Human trafficking statistics reveal that nearly 7,500 human traffickers were convicted around the globe in 2018.
Forced labor was imposed on 24% of the victims of human trafficking in North America.
Human and sex trafficking statistics suggest that 85% of human trafficking victims in the US have American citizenship.
Child sex trafficking statistics suggest that the share of sexually exploited children is on the rise.
Texas is the US leader based on the number of human trafficking offenses committed in 2018.
One in 6 child runaways is likely a victim of child sex trafficking, statistics in the US suggest.
With 14 million victims, India is the global leader in human trafficking, the facts confirm.
Human and Sex Trafficking Statistics Worldwide
There are no rules when it comes to estimating the danger of falling into the human trafficking trap. The numbers reveal that it happens all over the world. Here are some stats to keep you better informed and raise awareness of this issue.
1. Human trafficking statistics reveal that nearly 7,500 human traffickers were convicted around the globe in 2018.
(Statista; UNODC)
In a recent report, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) made an observation based on human trafficking statistics worldwide and found that the number of convictions has increased since 2009.
In fact, the number of convictions for sex trafficking increased by 67% since 2007, and the reason behind this may not always be a bigger crime rate but a better capacity to spot these offenses.
However, in regions and countries where there’s an ongoing armed conflict, human trafficking is often not detected.
2. The worldwide sex trafficking statistics show around 4.8 million victims, the majority of them coming from the Asia Pacific region.
(ILO)
In a report about modern slavery, the ILO revealed that 4.8 million people worldwide were victims of sex trafficking in 2016, of which more than 99% were women and girls.
Asia and the Pacific region accounted for 73% of the victims of forced sexual exploitation globally in 2016, whereas Europe and Central Asia’s regions accounted for 14%. Another 8% of sex trafficking victims had citizenship issued in Africa, and some 4% came from the Americas’ region.
3. Global human trafficking facts reveal that Western and Southern Europe counts the highest percentages of victims of foreign origin.
(UNODC)
The latest information on human trafficking indicates that most victims are found in their own countries of citizenship.
Nevertheless, in some countries—especially those in the region of Western and Southern Europe—the share of imported victims (75%) was greater than that of the domestic ones.
4. With 14 million victims, India is the global leader in human trafficking, the facts confirm.
(The Daily Signal)
Following the Global Slavery Index (GSI) data from 2014, India has the worst figures in human trafficking, accounting for 14 million victims. China, with 3.2 million victims, was second among the top 10 human trafficking countries, followed by Pakistan (2.1 million victims), Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Thailand.
5. In Europe, the Netherlands tops the human trafficking countries list based on the number of victims registered.
(Statista)
Europe is one of the most popular regions for human trafficking worldwide, as revealed in the worldwide facts about human trafficking from 2014. And on the European human trafficking countries list, the Netherlands is at the top, with 1,561 victims registered in 2014.
The remaining victims in Europe that year were registered in the UK (1,358), Romania (757), France (710), and Germany (583).
The stats show that human trafficking is, unfortunately, trending upwards in Europe. For example, during 2015 and 2016 in England and Wales, there were 13,000 registered victims of modern slavery, which was a fivefold increase from 2012.
6. About 30% of trafficking victims are children, and the number is growing according to the human trafficking global statistics.
(Statista; UNODC)
According to the latest worldwide NODC report on human trafficking, 23% of the total number of traced victims were girls, and around 7% were boys, making up almost a third of the total number of human trafficking victims in 2016. Compared to figures for child trafficking back in 2004, the percentages have more than doubled.
In 2016, around 21% of young female human trafficking victims did forced labor. Among boys, 50% were trafficked for forced labor.
7. Child sex trafficking statistics suggest that the share of sexually exploited children is on the rise.
(Statista; UNODC; ILO)
About one million of the 4.8 million sex trafficking victims around the globe are children. In 2011, more than a third of human trafficking victims were children, which represented an increase of 38% since 2004. Among the total number of victims, 21% were girls, and 13% were boys.
In 2016, a staggering 72% of underage female victims were used for sexual exploitation, and around 27% of underage male victims shared the same fate.
8. Forced marriages belong to modern slavery and sexual exploitation in sex trafficking, the facts confirm.
(ILO)
According to the arranged marriage statistics from 2016, there were around 15.4 million people in forced marriages worldwide. As per the ILO, suffering a loss of sexual autonomy and providing free labor under cover of marriage justifies this classification.
Although there are male victims of forced marriages, 88% of the victims are female, with more than a third (37%) under 18 years of age. Among those under 18 years in a forced marriage, 44% are under 15.
9. The sex trafficking industry counts $99 billion in profits each year, sex trafficking statistics worldwide from 2014 reveal.
(ILO)
It’s estimated that the global number of victims in forced labor and human trafficking is 21 million. As per the data in the ILO’s economic report on forced labor from 2014, commercial sex trafficking around the world is worth $99 billion, with an estimated annual profit per victim of $21,800.
10. The typical duration of sexual exploitation is 2 years on average.
(ILO)
Data from the IOM suggest that the average duration of sexual exploitation around the globe is 23.1 months. Most victims manage to escape or are freed within this period.
Human Trafficking Facts & Stats in North America
America is no exception when it comes to this issue. Every year, thousands of human trafficking cases are reported to the authorities, which just leaves us wondering how many go undetected. Following are some stats to shed more light on this issue.
11. Forced labor was imposed on 24% of the victims of human trafficking in North America.
(UNODC)
The latest statistics on human trafficking reveal that in North America, victims of forced labor represented an essential part of human trafficking. Most of the reported victims were adult men (at 56%), and 18% were women. Another 12% were underage girls, and 14% were underage male victims. They were either forced into labor or forced into criminal activities.
In several cases, female victims were both sexually exploited and forced to do labor.
12. 71% of the victims of human trafficking in North America are trafficked for sexual exploitation, facts about sex trafficking confirm.
(UNODC)
The worldwide human trafficking statistics from 2016 reveal that more than 70% of the victims detected in the region of North America were trafficked for sexual exploitation.
13. There were overall 17,880 prosecutions for human trafficking in the US in 2017.
(Statista)
Unfortunately, human trafficking of every kind is on the rise in the US, as per the figures released by the US State Department. From 7,909 prosecutions in 2011, the number was almost 56% higher in 2017. On a positive note, convictions have also been on the rise since 2011, but at a slightly lower rate.
14. Sex trafficking statistics in the United States reveal an estimated 199,000 incidents of children’s sexual exploitation each year.
(Fox News; UNODC)
Estimates by the US State Department show that over 300,000 American children and minors are at risk for sexual exploitation, with an estimated incidence of 199,000 such offenses happening each year.
In 2016, the UNODC reported that 65% of the detected trafficking victims in the region of North America (encompassing the US, Canada, and Mexico) were adult women, and 20% of them were girls. Underage girls account for 25% of the victims trafficked for sexual slavery.
15. One in 6 child runaways is likely a victim of child sex trafficking, statistics in the US suggest.
(Missing Kids; Statista)
Endangered runaways are considered children under 18 who have run away from guardians, parents, or childcare facilities. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) reported 23,500 endangered child runaways all across the US in 2019, suspecting that one in six was a potential victim of child sex traffickers.
51% of the endangered runaways are between 16 and 17 years old. The average age that child victims of sex trafficking go missing in the US is 15.
16. Human sex trafficking statistics in the US reveal that 56% of female victims of sex trafficking started off as runaway youth.
(Human Trafficking Hotline)
Dating violence statistics suggest that those who have fallen victim to violence or sexual assault in the past are more likely to be targeted by traffickers.
Furthermore, individuals with economic difficulties also have a greater chance of crossing the path of a trafficker, as confirmed in recent single mother statistics. Sex traffickers are usually very proficient in recognizing these vulnerabilities.
17. Human and sex trafficking statistics suggest that 85% of human trafficking victims in the US have American citizenship.
(Fox News)
Around 85% of human trafficking victims in the US originate from there. Besides, Mexico and the Philippines were the second and third most common places of origin, according to a 2018 report released by the State Department.
18. Texas is the US leader based on the number of human trafficking offenses committed in 2018.
(UCR FBI)
The human trafficking statistics by state issued by the FBI reveal that police authorities in Texas registered 312 offenses in commercial sex acts or involuntary servitude in 2018.
The vast majority of offenses were concerning commercial sex acts, 265 in total, of which six were offenses made by individuals under the age of 18. Another 53 were offenses of involuntary servitude, of which no offenses were made by juvenile perpetrators.
19. Minnesota had the best offense-to-clearance ratio for offenses involving commercial sex acts in 2018, FBI sex trafficking stats confirm.
(UCR FBI)
Clearance of a commercial sex act usually means that at least one person is arrested or charged with the offense, or the case has been sent to the court for prosecution. With 87.8% of its commercial sex offenses being cleared in 2018, Minnesota has the best clearance rate of these types of offenses nationwide.
20. Human and sex trafficking statistics suggest that around 1,000 potential sex trafficking victims were recruited online between 2015 and 2018.
(We Live Security)
Online dating statistics confirm that these sites can be a potential hub for sex traffickers. What’s more, other popular social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Craigslist are massively used by sex traffickers in the US.
1,000 potential victims reported being recruited this way over three years. Sadly, the number of those who fell for this remains unknown. According to this source, false representation and skillful recruiting tactics were used, catfishing statistics confirm.
FAQ

More specifically, India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Bangladesh are among the top human trafficking countries globally, based on the number of victims.
How does sex trafficking happen?
(Polaris)
Human trafficking happens through fraud, coercion, physical force, and other forms of manipulation and fraud-related methods. On the most basic level, human trafficking is stealing the freedom of an individual to force the person to do activities that will profit the trafficker. Such activities include criminal acts, commercial sexual acts, forced labor, etc.

More than 70% of human trafficking is forced commercial sexual acts, also known as sex trafficking. Around 35% of human traffickers worldwide are women, and approximately 88% of the victims are women and girls. About one-third of the victims of trafficking are children.
Where do traffickers find victims?
(NY Post; Missing Kids; We Live Security)
They’ll often track and contact foster children, waiting outside foster homes. Traffickers also “hunt” in neighborhoods with high poverty rates, tracking adolescent runaways.
Another common method includes recruiting victims online, using dating sites, social media, and even job-search websites. They usually present themselves falsely and try to lure victims in with false job propositions or false claims of love.
Conclusion
In the land of the free, we should be more vigilant of the signs and indications of child and adult human trafficking victims. We must work together to prevent these devastating sex trafficking statistics from leaving a stain on our core human right: freedom.

Human trafficking - Statistics & Facts
Published by M. Szmigiera , Jun 29, 2021
Despite increased international attention and resources from states and other non-governmental institutions, the number of people falling victim to human trafficking around the world continues to grow. Between 2008 and 2019 the number of human trafficking victims identified worldwide more than tripled from 30,961 to 105,787. Though such statistics also lead to a degree of optimism among investigators and human rights advocates as it suggests that additional focus has led to greater exposure of the issue. After all, trafficking in persons is an illegal practice that is shaded in secrecy, and it is therefore nearly impossible to measure it in its entirety.

20 Horrific Human Trafficking Statistics not to Miss in 2021
20 Horrific Human Trafficking Statistics not to Miss in 2021
By Andriana Moskovska July 5, 2021 Blog
Did you know that July 30 is World Day against Trafficking in Persons? It underlines global efforts to eradicate this horrible crime that comes in many forms. Every year, thousands of children, women, and men are victims of trafficking, human trafficking statistics reveal.
The thing is:
People are trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labor, forced begging, forced marriage, and more. Children are also sold as child sex slaves and child soldiers, while adults are trafficked for organ harvesting.
It gets worse:
Some of the most shocking facts about human trafficking are that women and girls make up a significant amount of the total number of trafficking victims. And the most common form of exploitation is sexual.
Victims are trafficked within their countries, but the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, passed in 2000, specifies that a victim doesn’t need to be physically transported from one location to another for the crime to fall within this definition.
Speaking of which:
When it comes to defining what is human trafficking, the US uses the terms “trafficking in persons,” “modern slavery,” and “human trafficking” interchangeably to refer to sex and labor trafficking.
Now that we have a clear human trafficking definition, let’s move on to the stats we’ve curated for you at The High Court.

Human Trafficking Statistics Worldwide
9. 25 million people are denied their fundamental right to freedom.
(Source: 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report)
The history of human trafficking is a long and tragic one. The Trafficking in Persons Report provides governments with invaluable data to prosecute traffickers and provide victim-centered and trauma-informed protection for the victims. The ultimate goal, of course, is to eradicate this dreadful crime altogether.
The report, which marked its 20th-anniversary edition in 2020, includes the most important forced labor and sex trafficking 2020 stats.
With that in mind, let’s take a look at the current state of how human trafficking in different parts of the world.
10. Traffickers exploit 70% of the estimated five million Ethiopians transported to Saudi Arabia in forced labor, prostitution statistics reveal.
(Source: 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report )
Labor and sex trafficking facts are clear:
Traffickers exploit over two-thirds of Ethiopians transported to Saudi Arabia for forced labor. Young women mostly travel through Eritrea or Djibouti to look for domestic work in Saudi Arabia.
Altogether, about 400,000-500,000 Ethiopians reside in Saudi Arabia with no valid travel documentation, which significantly increases their vulnerability to forced labor or sex trafficking exploitation. Click To Tweet
11. International organizations estimated 93% of child labor in Bangladesh, including forced child labor, is in the informal sector.
(Source: 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report, DOL)
Inspectors filed 42 cases on the worst forms of child trafficking against employers, especially child labor. Unfortunately, slavery facts show the Bangladeshi Government made only moderate progress in the efforts to combat and eradicate the worst forms of child labor in 2019 .
Here are the figures:
In 2019, more than 1,000 working children from 558 factories were removed, and 3,501 children were rehabilitated. Since 2017, 90,000 children have been removed from hazardous labor conditions, and over 35,000 children from exploitative work.
12. The government of Argentina reported that it had implemented 59% of the national anti-trafficking action plan, human trafficking statistics for 2020 confirm.
(Source: Human Rights Watch, 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report)
However, a specific budget for the plan is yet to be allocated. That’s why observers have raised concerns about the government’s ability to fund the anti-trafficking programs.
In contrast to the previous reporting periods, the Argentine Government did not report the latest human trafficking info or any details of its efforts to combat labor trafficking in 2019.
13. In France, 74% of exploited victims were victims of sex trafficking in 2018.
(Source: 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report)

So, from these sources, it's clear that human trafficking is a massive global issue. The statistics show that millions of people are affected by it every year. For example, in 2020, over 109,000 victims were identified worldwide, but the actual number is likely much higher since many cases go unreported.

I also found that the majority of victims are women and children, which is really disturbing. It's heartbreaking to think about the trauma and suffering these individuals go through.

Moreover, I saw that human trafficking takes many forms, including sex trafficking, forced labor, and even organ removal in some cases. It's a multifaceted problem that requires a comprehensive approach to tackle.

One thing that struck me is the discrepancy between reported cases and actual occurrences. The statistics might only be scratching the surface because human trafficking is often hidden and difficult to detect. That's why improving identification and reporting mechanisms is crucial.

I also noticed that there are efforts to collect better data and estimate the true scale of human trafficking. For instance, some organizations are using Multiple Systems Estimation to estimate the total number of victims, including those who haven't been identified yet. That seems like a promising method to get a more accurate picture of the situation.

Another interesting point is the role of technology in human trafficking. With the rise of social media and online platforms, traffickers are finding new ways to recruit and exploit victims. This highlights the need for increased vigilance and regulation in the digital space.

Furthermore, I saw that certain regions and countries are hotspots for human trafficking. For example, India has the highest number of victims, followed by China and other Asian countries. It's important to understand the root causes in these areas
