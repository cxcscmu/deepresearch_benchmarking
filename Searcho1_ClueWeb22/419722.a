Alright, so I need to figure out how the rich avoid taxes. This is a pretty broad topic, and I have to approach it carefully because tax laws are complex and can vary a lot between different countries. But generally, I know that wealthy individuals and corporations have more resources to manipulate their tax situations in their favor. So, I should look into some common strategies they use.

First off, I should probably start by understanding the basic principles of taxation and how income is taxed differently based on its type and source. I think different types of income are treated differently under tax laws, and the rich might take advantage of that.

Let me consider passive income versus active income. Passive income, like dividends, interest, and capital gains, often has lower tax rates compared to earned income from salaries and wages. So, maybe the rich rely more on passive income to minimize their tax burden.

Also, I've heard about tax havens and offshore accounts. Wealthy people might park their money in countries with more favorable tax regimes to avoid paying higher taxes in their home country. That seems like another strategy.

Additionally, there's something called tax avoidance through loopholes. I think this involves using legal methods, often involving complex financial instruments and arrangements, to reduce taxable income. Maybe things like trusts, partnerships, and other entities that can shelter income or shift profits to entities with lower tax rates.

I should also consider deductions and credits. The rich might have access to more opportunities for deductions, like charitable contributions, mortgage interest, and business expenses, which can significantly lower their taxable income.

Another angle is deferring income. By delaying when income is recognized for tax purposes, the rich can postpone paying taxes, which effectively reduces their tax burden over time due to the time value of money.

I recall hearing about something called the "carried interest" loophole, which allows hedge fund managers and private equity partners to treat a portion of their income as capital gains rather than ordinary income, thus paying lower taxes. That might be relevant here.

Moreover, estate planning plays a big role in tax avoidance for the wealthy. Techniques like gifting, trusts, and establishing foundations can help reduce estate taxes and pass wealth to heirs more efficiently.

I should also think about corporate structures. Companies owned by wealthy individuals might engage in transfer pricing, where they set prices for transactions between subsidiaries in different tax jurisdictions to minimize global tax liability.

Another practice is inversion, where a company reincorporates in a country with a lower corporate tax rate but continues to do business primarily in its original country.

I need to make sure that what I'm suggesting is actually legal. Tax avoidance is different from tax evasion; avoidance is legal, while evasion is illegal. So, I should focus on legal methods that the rich use to minimize their tax bills.

Perhaps I should look into specific examples or case studies to illustrate these points. For instance, how Amazon or Google structures its international operations to minimize taxes, or how famous billionaires like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk manage their wealth to optimize their tax situation.

Wait a minute, I should be careful not to make assumptions about individual behaviors without evidence. It's important to base my conclusions on factual information and reputable sources.

Maybe I should perform some searches to gather more concrete information. Let me try that.

5 Ways Rich Americans Avoid Paying Taxes
If you’re ready to learn how to save more money on your taxes, implement these steps and see how different your finances look both now and at tax time.

Rich people aren’t rich just because they make a lot of money — they’re rich because they know how to avoid paying taxes, the legal way, of course. Sometimes it’s not how much money you make, but how you treat it so you can minimize your tax liabilities, keeping more money in your pocket.
You work hard for your money, so it makes sense to avoid paying taxes as much as possible.
This doesn’t mean rich people don’t pay taxes or they hide their money.
They are just as honest as the rest of us — they just know how the system works and what avenues they can use to avoid paying taxes.
Are you ready to act like a rich person and avoid paying taxes too? Here’s how.
Disclaimer — This post is not financial advice, and everything that’s mentioned in this post is for educational purposes only.
#1 — Focus on long-term capital gains for lower tax rates
Capital gains are profits you earn from selling an asset for more than you paid for it. That’s the idea of investing — you want to make more money, but at what expense?
With Uncle Sam holding out his hand, it takes away from the excitement (and point) of investing. There are ways to lower your tax liability by focusing on long-term capital gains.
Short-term capital gains are any profits earned on investments you held for less than one year. These profits fall under your ordinary tax rate, which is much higher than the long-term capital gains tax rate. You didn’t let your money sit for very long and made a quick profit — the IRS wants its share of that revenue since you really didn’t give anything up to get it.
Instead of investing for a few months or even 11 ½ months, keep your investment for over one year.
The IRS awards you with a much lower tax rate of either 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income. They do this because you gave up your money for a longer period — you took a higher risk, and now you can pay lower taxes on the profits because of it.
The amount you pay varies based on your income. Single filers with less than $40,000 taxable income or married filing jointly with $80,800 income pay 0% on their long-term capital gains, whereas single filers with taxable income over $441,450 and married filing jointly with $501,600 annual income will pay 20% on their long-term capital gains.
You can offset your tax liabilities even further, too. If you have capital losses, they can offset your capital gains, decreasing your tax liability even further. Many rich people use this strategy to decrease the taxes on short-term and long-term capital gains. Watch your threshold, though. If you go over $3,000, you’ll carry the loss over into future years.
#2 — Modify income (take a smaller salary and pay yourself in dividends)
Rich people often own their own businesses so they can oversee their income. This offers an incredible advantage because you can modify your income to lower your tax liability. In other words, you take a smaller salary but pay yourself in dividends.
When you have a smaller salary, you have less ‘ordinary income’, which is taxed at the highest rates. The more money you make, the higher tax rates you pay, with the highest rate in 2021 being 37%.
If you don’t pay yourself a salary, you can still make money without incurring large tax liabilities. Figure out how much money you must pay yourself to live, and then use the tactics the rich use to pay themselves without getting hit with the higher tax brackets
Pay yourself in dividends. You’ll earn profits from the company without drawing a salary.
Dividends are taxed at the capital gains rate, so you can save money by paying no more than 20% on your dividends versus the much higher ordinary income tax rate. Alternatively, pay yourself in stock options. Paying yourself with stock options gives you the chance to exercise your right to buy a stock when you want. This tax-reducing tactic allows you to control when you pay taxes since you don’t pay the taxes until you exercise the option.
#3 — Tax deferral (retirement accounts)
Tax deferral isn’t an uncommon way to lower your tax liabilities, but the rich can max out their contributions, so they minimize their tax liability as much as possible. Deferring your tax liabilities by investing in your future sets you up for a successful retirement. Knowing how to max out your tax deferral is important; here’s how:
Traditional 401K accounts — If you work for someone and they sponsor a 401K account, you can contribute as much as $19,500 per year. That means you can defer up to $19,500 of your salary from taxes since you contribute to your 401K before taxes. The money then grows tax-free until you withdraw it in retirement, but even then, you can use strategies to reduce your tax liabilities.
Traditional IRA accounts — If you don’t work for someone offering a 401K, you can open an IRA. While the limits are much lower than a 401K, you can still defer some of your earnings to avoid taxes for now. In 2021, the IRA max contribution is $6,000 per year.
Self-employed IRAs — If you own a business, you may be eligible for a Solo 401K. But the contribution limits are much higher (up to $57,000 in some cases), allowing you to defer even more income. Keep in mind to check out the fine print and what legalities you’re up against if you open these accounts.

#4 — Charitable contributions
Giving money to charity has always been a great way to lower your tax liabilities, but only the rich seem to take advantage of it.
If you regularly give to charity or can give to charity, it may help you lower your tax liability.
I am not just talking about typical charitable contributions, though. This isn’t the type you write a check for or give a wad of cash. Instead, I am talking about the charitable contributions of your investments.
Believe it or not, charities accept investments as contributions, and both you and the charity benefit. Rather than selling the asset, taking the cash, and contributing, you contribute the investment directly to the charity.
This does two things:
1. You don’t have the hassle of selling the asset, hoping for a profit, and waiting for the money to contribute to your chosen charity.
2. You avoid the long-term (or short-term) capital gains taxes you’d earn if you sold the asset for a profit. Saving 20% on the transaction means more money in your pocket and, therefore, the charity’s pocket too.
Charities can decide how to handle the asset, whether they sell it right away or keep it in the hopes that it continues to appreciate, giving them an even larger donation.
#5 — Open an irrevocable trust
A trust protects your assets from lawsuits or anyone coming after you for money, but only an irrevocable trust helps reduce your tax liability. With an irrevocable trust, you transfer the funds into the trust, which is not in your name. You cannot touch the assets in there since you no longer own them.
That sounds harsh, but here’s the benefit — since they aren’t in your name, you don’t pay the taxes — the trust does. This lowers your taxable income and, therefore, your tax liability.
The exception to the rule, however, is if you take income from the trust. If you set it up, so you receive annual income (which isn’t unusual), you’ll owe taxes on the earned income, but it’s generally much less than the amount in the trust, which means a lower tax liability.
Final Thoughts
If you’re trying to lower your tax liabilities — it’s time to think outside the box. We are all programmed to make money, pay our taxes and live life, but what if you could keep more of that hard-earned money in your pocket?
It’s possible with a few simple tweaks in your financial plan. Whether you pay yourself less, contribute more to your retirement, contribute to charity, or invest smarter, you can keep your tax liabilities down and either have more money in your account today or when you retire.
The key is to know what options are available to you, considering your financial status. If you’re ready to learn how to save more money on your taxes, implement these steps and see how different your finances look both now and at tax time.

How The Super Rich Avoid Paying Taxes
If you're one of the 1% of Americans who control over 40% of the country's wealth, life is full of choices. Among them -- how best to keep all that money away from the government? The U.S. economic system offers no shortage of loopholes allowing the ultra-rich to shortchange Uncle Sam.
Tax rates for those making >$1 million level out at 24%, then declines for those making >$1.5 million. Those making $10 million a year pay an average income tax rate of 19%. $70-$100 billion is the estimated tax revenue lost each year due to loopholes. So how exactly do the super rich hide that much money from the government every year?
1. Put It in the Freezer
Trust Freezing: A way to transfer valuable assets to others (such as your children) while avoiding the federal estate tax.
"Freeze" the value of assets many years before you plan to pass them on to exclude all asset appreciation from the estate, and any taxes.
Popular method: Trade common for preferred stock.
Problem: If you sell your common stock you might owe a large amount of capital gains tax.
Solution: Trade your common stock for preferred stock, then put some of the preferred stock in a trust and live off the dividends.
2. Send It Overseas
Tax havens: Registering your business or putting your money in an account in another country with lower taxes.
~$21 trillion is being hidden in offshore tax havens.
David Bowie, U2 and the Rolling Stones have all benefited from tax havens at one time or another.
Popular cash hideout: The Cayman Islands, home to >85,000 companies -- making it home to more registered organizations than people.
3. Stock It Up in Options
By taking part of your compensation in stock options you can control when and if you pay taxes, since most options are only taxed when they are exercised.
Execs who have opted for options: Howard Schultz (Starbucks), Fred Smith (FedEx), William Weldon (Johnson & Johnson) and many others.
4. Play Shell Games with It
Shell company: A type of company that only exists on paper, allowing you to funnel money through it and avoid paying taxes.
Has a legal existence but typically provides few or no actual products or services.
Often used for buying and selling to avoid reporting international operations conducted, and avoid taxes on the profits.
Shady business: Mitt Romney caught some flak for allegedly using a shell company in Bermuda to avoid taxes.
5. Swap It Out
Equity swap: An agreement that allows 2 parties to exchange the gain and loss of assets without actually transferring ownership.
The swap avoids transaction costs, and typically, local taxes on dividends.
6. Play Dodgeball with It
Capital gains tax: A tax on the profits from a sale of non-inventory assets originally purchased for a lesser amount, such as stocks, bonds, property or precious metals.
Popular loophole: Purchasing stock options, which sets the share price at a fixed rate, then borrowing money from an investment bank using the shares as collateral.
The borrower then repays the loan either with money made with the money borrowed or by handing over the shares, avoiding the capital gains tax.
7. Go Corporate with It
Problem: being in a higher income tax bracket has less tax advantages than being a corporation.
Solution: You can incorporate your own personal brand, which allows you to: 1. Channel wages through a nominal "corporation"; 2. Pay yourself an interest-free wage; 3. Claim expenses; 4. Reduce your income taxes.
Mitt Romney claimed the management fee of his corporation as a capital gain rather than income, reducing his tax rate significantly.
8. Kick It Down the Road
You can put part of your payday in a deferred-compensation plan, instead of taking it all at once.
This allows your earnings to continue growing tax-deferred for +10 years.
79% of CEOs at Fortune 100 companies were offered deferred compensation plans.
9. Give It Away
Gift-giving and charitable donations are a real win-win: Avoid taxes and look and feel good doing it!
Gifts to anyone of up to $13,000 are tax-excluded, with an unlimited exclusion for gifts given to a spouse.
Allows you to circulate cash within the family as "gifts" while writing it off.
Popular donation tactic: Deduct the fair market value of a donated item from your tax liability.
Example: 1. Buy a sculpture for $1,000; 2. Have it appraised at $10,000 some years later; 3. Donate it and deduct the $10,000 from that year's taxable income.Score!
10. Make It Luxurious
Owning a yacht or multiple homes aren't just status symbols -- they offer tax benefits as well!
Popular earner: Claim your "second home"
Spend at least 2 weeks of the year on your yacht, outfit it like a home, and categorize it as a second home for tax purposes.
If the home's value appreciates over time, the profits from selling it can be considered capital gains and taxed at a lower rate than salary or other investment income.
A second home can be rented for up to 2 weeks a year without requiring the owner to claim the rent as income!

How the rich avoid paying taxes
Capital gains taxes, explained.
By Madeline Marshall Jul  8, 2021,  7:00pm EDT
How the rich avoid paying taxes
In the US, most people make their money from a regular job; they get a paycheck and pay income taxes. But the richest Americans, the top 1 percent, make most of their money from things like investments in real estate or the stock market. Those investments are taxed as capital gains. While federal income tax has a maximum tax rate of 37 percent, the tax rate for capital gains tops out at just 20 percent.
It’s why Warren Buffett, one of the richest people in America, has often said that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
President Biden has a plan to raise that maximum tax rate from 20 percent to 39.6 percent, and proponents see that as one way to tax the rich.
But Buffett and other billionaires still won’t have most of their wealth taxed. Watch the video above to learn about how the richest people in the US avoid paying taxes.

How Do Rich People Avoid Paying Taxes? It’s Easy, Actually
Whizy Kim
Last Updated June 8, 2021, 12:21 PM

Water and oil, night and day, billionaires and paying their fair share in taxes — this is just a short list of iconic opposites. It's probably not surprising that rich people go to great lengths to avoid paying any more taxes than they absolutely have to, but a new ProPublica investigation, published today, reveals in brutal detail how they get away with paying virtually nothing. Using over 15 years of tax returns from the ultra-rich, the investigation calculates the amount of taxes the 25 richest Americans paid contrasted with how much their net worth grew each year, to get what it calls their "true tax rate."
Let’s get specific, here, because ProPublica names names. Berkshire Hathaway billionaire Warren Buffet's true tax rate is 0.10%. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos' is 0.98%. Failed presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg's? 1.30%. Meanwhile, father of Grimes’ child, Elon Musk paid a comparatively high rate of 3.27%. No wonder he's such a fan of meme stocks — truly a man of the people.
A huge part of these tiny tax rates is the fact that extremely wealthy people maintain their wealth differently than ordinary people. It's not sitting in a bank, and it's definitely not stuffed under the mattress. They hold it in assets like stocks and real estate, which are only taxed when sold. Until then, it's "unrealized," not counting as income. Buffet, for example, reported an income of $125 million between 2014 to 2018, despite the fact that his net worth grew by $24.3 billion. Maybe you've heard before that Jeff Bezos made a salary around $80,000 as Amazon's CEO. That's obviously not the same thing as saying that his wealth only grew by $80K per year. Keeping your salary low is one way the ultra-rich get to keep more of their wealth. Bezos reported $6.5 billion to the IRS between 2006 to 2018, yet his net worth grew by $127 billion. In 2011, he reported a net loss and claimed a child tax credit. He's currently worth around $187 billion.
From 2014 to 2018, according to ProPublica, the 25 richest Americans increased their wealth to the tune of $401 billion. They paid 3.4% of that back in taxes. It compares this rate to a middle class American in their early 40s, whose wealth increased by an average of $65,000 between the same period. They would have paid about 95% of that back in taxes. Overall, the average American household from 2006 to 2018 paid more in taxes than they accumulated wealth. The report also notes that most of the wealth growth that middle-class Americans experience is thanks to a rise in home value, painting an even starker picture for how Americans who don't own such assets are supposed to see an upward trend in their net worth.
Even besides this, any income reported on their tax return can be offset by expenses and deductions. The 25 richest Americans can of course enlist the help of tax virtuosos who can perform dazzling acrobatics in tax avoidance. The kicker is that this type of tax avoidance is all basically legal — tax avoidance is using legal means afforded by the U.S. tax code to reduce how much you pay in taxes. Meanwhile, tax dodging is the illegal way that ordinary Americans might misreport their income or make some other mistake on their tax returns. The wealthiest people don't make such rookie moves. ProPublica notes that owning a sports team, for example, is a possible tax write-off. Another popular way to reduce tax liability is philanthropy, which not only saves billionaires money but also gives them good PR. Even in death, they can cling to much of their wealth. The highest U.S. estate tax rate is currently 40%, but the report says, "many of the richest create foundations for philanthropic giving, which provide large charitable tax deductions during their lifetimes and bypass the estate tax when they die."
Some billionaire-apologists argue that net worth somehow isn't really wealth, because much of it isn't liquid — they couldn't withdraw billions out of the bank right this second. But that's a disingenuous twisting of how wealth works. Jeff Bezos might not be able to bathe in a billion-dollar cash pile (not on the spur-of-the-moment, anyway), but everyone understands and respects the power that being "worth" $200 billion confers. There's an old story about Rockefeller once being denied a loan because he didn't have verifiable credit at the time, intended to show how the credit system is supposed to treat everyone equally. But does anyone actually believe Rockefeller would have had trouble borrowing any amount of money he wanted? In fact, credit is pretty much exactly how extremely wealthy people thrive. While for many Americans debt has become an unbearable burden, for billionaires it's the perfect way to avoid giving away more of their wealth, since loans aren't considered income. Earning an income is petty; the truly rich leverage debt to fund their lavish lifestyles, with a credit line in the billions of dollars. Their material wealth is not so material, but an invisible hand that opens every door.
That billionaires have to pay far less taxes than an ordinary wage-earner does also shows how money is either a vacuum or a magnet. If you don't have enough of it, its absence becomes a kind of black hole that sucks up even more money. Being poor is more expensive than being rich — you often end up paying more in banking fees, for example, paying more in interest, even paying more for everyday goods. Meanwhile, when you already have money, it allows you to start businesses that balloon into global megacorporations that attract deep-pocketed investors even when they're not turning a profit.
"The personal federal tax bill for the top 25 in 2018: $1.9 billion," ProPublica's report says. "The bill for the wage earners: $143 billion." Working a job? In this economy? It's obviously not an efficient way to accumulate wealth. Why should anyone dream of a job or want to return to their difficult, low-wage "essential" job — with CEOs complaining about the indolence of people supposedly preferring to stay on unemployment benefits — while billionaires give back so little of their staggering wealth to the society that helped create them?
Warren Buffet may have been proclaiming for years that billionaires should be taxed more, but he does so in a political landscape where the odds of reversing so much entrenched wealth inequality remains pretty low — or at the least, where progress towards that inches along at a snail's pace. President Biden has proposed higher tax rates for the rich, with a top marginal tax rate of 39.6%, and there's been vocal pushback from conservatives. Opponents of the plan have argued this is the biggest tax hike in history, but that's not true. Top tax rates have been higher than 39.6% before, and our overall tax burden as a nation is far lower than most, ranking 33rd among the 35 richest countries.
And unless the way that the ultra-rich hold their wealth changes — in assets rather than income — as well as whether we tax it or not, how much will a higher marginal tax rate really tip the scales? How do we ensure billionaires contribute an equal share to our society when they can still use foreign tax havens? Is this a flaw to fix like a leaky faucet, or is it a feature of the tax code, which contains so many specific clauses to help the rich? In A Fine Mess, a book about the convoluted U.S. tax system, author T.R. Reid lists several historical examples of this, including a special tax loophole that applied to “an automobile manufacturer incorporated in Delaware on October 13, 1916.” It was a loophole written exclusively for General Motors, without actually naming General Motors. Such examples make it seem like writing the nation's tax code is like signing someone's yearbook with an inside joke.
"To the moon" is a phrase often used by r/WallStreetBets traders when they want a stock, such as GameStop, to soar. While an individual trader might gamble on the financial windfall of skyrocketing meme stocks, billionaires seem to know that their wealth is not only safe, but that it will continue to generate more wealth. Instead, they aspire to literally go to the moon; ProPublica's investigation comes the day after Bezos announced he was going to space with his brother next month. Who knows? Maybe the last frontier will serve as the ultimate tax haven for billionaires. We just hope they’ll stay up there.

False Profits
Offshore tax havens used by individuals and corporations cost governments trillions of dollars annually. Economists estimate that individuals have stashed anywhere from $8.7 trillion to $36 trillion in tax shelters around the world. But not all of the tax reduction tactics favored by the rich involve offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. There's a variety of places the rich hide money to lower their tax burden and shelter income, many quite straightforward.

Conservation Easements
One of the best-kept secrets the wealthy use to reduce taxable income is the conservation easement. "By investing in one, or taking advantage of the strategy, people can effectively reduce their adjusted gross income by 50%," says entrepreneur Brad Blazar, who has taken advantage of such easements himself. "I've made almost $200,000 in earnings disappear from my adjusted gross earnings that I would have otherwise been taxed on." The Conservation Easement Act was created to incentivize affluent landowners to conserve and protect land that they own, donating an easement to a land protection organization for a federal income tax deduction equal to the value of the donation.

Qualified Opportunity Zones
One of the newest approaches to sheltering income is investing capital gains in businesses in Qualified Opportunity Zones, says Phil Strazzulla, a former venture capitalist and founder of Select Software Reviews, which reviews human-resources software. Created in 2017 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, these zones are disadvantaged neighborhoods and communities across the country in need of economic development and job creation. The law offers pretax benefits for capital gains investments in the zones as long as it's within 180 days of getting the gains. "If your new investment lasts more than 10 years, you don't have to pay any taxes on any incremental gains," Strazzulla says.

Municipal Bonds
It may sound counterintuitive to protect money from being taxed by giving it to the government, but Andrew Latham, managing editor of the site SuperMoney and senior writer on tax topics, says municipal bonds can be effective tax shelters and are a popular way to earn tax-free income. "Governments at every level issue municipal bonds to finance large-scale projects like schools and highways. These bonds are generally safe investments with interest rates that exceed those paid by ordinary savings accounts," Latham says. Under most circumstances, earnings from municipal bonds are exempt from federal income taxes — and are also available to ordinary taxpayers, Latham says.

Life Insurance
Don't skip the whole life insurance policy. "Similar to a Roth IRA, taxes have to be paid on money prior to going into a life insurance policy. But once the money is in the policy as part of the cash value, it is tax-free, provided the policy is structured correctly," financial adviser Adam Doran says. The "contributions" or premiums on the policy are not reported to the IRS, nor are distributions when the policy owner accesses the cash value through policy loans. "These loans can serve as investment capital to purchase real estate, businesses, or anything else," he says. "They can also be a form of tax-free income in retirement, as they don't have to be paid back during the policyholder's lifetime." In addition, outstanding loans at the time of the policy owner's death are paid by the policy's death benefit, and the remainder of the death benefit goes tax-free to named beneficiaries.

Charitable Investments
One of the easiest ways to dodge some taxes is by making sizable donations to charities. "You can donate up to $100,000 directly to the charity, but you can also donate to a charity savings account," says Chane Steiner, CEO of the personal finance site Crediful. A charitable savings account, also known as a donor-advised fund, is similar to opening a checking account, but one that holds funds earmarked to be distributed to a charity at your suggestion at a later date. "These funds can be deposited into the account and act as an immediate tax write-off even if they haven't been distributed."

Offshore Accounts Around the World
Perhaps one of the most notorious ways people hide money: opening offshore accounts. These are typically in tax havens — places with little to no tax liability, says Josh Zimmelman, owner of Westwood Tax & Consulting, a New York accounting firm. Popular examples include countries in the Caribbean and Switzerland. A Financial Secrecy Index produced by the Tax Justice Network ranks Switzerland and the Cayman Islands as some of the top places for hiding private wealth, with $21 trillion to $32 trillion worth of private wealth in what are called "secrecy jurisdictions" where the money is lightly or entirely untaxed. But there are plenty of those in the United States as well, including South Dakota and Nevada.

Shell Companies
The rich sometimes hide money by opening up shell corporations that don't have their names attached. "It can be difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities to figure out who owns the corporation, so they don't know whose money it is," Zimmelman says. "Setting up interlocking entities in different places makes it even harder. For example, a fake corporation in one country might control a trust in another country that has a bank account in yet another country."

Financial Gift Giving
Financial gifts of various types can be made tax-free up to a certain level. "Sometimes people will hide funds by giving a portion of it to their children or other trusted friends or family for whom the tax burden wouldn't be as great," Zimmelman says. The U.S. federal gift tax is paid on cash or properties that individuals give to others. The law allows for giving as much as $15,000 tax free, and rises to $16,000 in 2022. The gifts can be all at once or in small increments and can go to any number of people.

Offshore Subsidiaries
Multinational corporations are among the most legendary dodgers of tax responsibilities, and it starts by registering a company or a subsidiary in certain countries. "A U.S.-based company with worldwide income would set up an offshore company in a country with a low corporate tax rate. Since the corporate tax is paid on net income, a company would shift income to a country with the lower tax rate and shift expenses to the country with higher tax rates," says Peter Greco, CPA and founder of CSI Group, which works for international and expatriate clients. According to the International Monetary Fund, corporate tax havens and similar maneuvers cost governments about $500 billion to $600 billion annually in lost corporate tax revenue. IMF estimates some multinational corporations have hundreds of offshore subsidiaries.

199A Deductions
Creating a sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate is another way to qualify for a substantial tax deduction not available to rank-and-file wage income earners. The 199A deduction allows those who have qualified business income from either a domestic business that's operated as a sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate to deduct as much as 20% of that income. According to the IRS, the deduction not only allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income, it also allows for deducting 20% of qualified real estate investment trust dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership incomes.

Retirement Funds
While not a technique exclusive to the very wealthy, squirreling away as much money as possible in a retirement fund is an effective tax shelter. With an IRA, you can defer paying taxes on up to $6,000 per year, reducing taxes at the end of the year. A 401(k) allows you to defer taxes on up to $20,500 per year as of 2022, which is up $1,000 from 2021. "If you go with a Roth IRA, any earnings made from investments won't be taxed," Steiner says

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can gather from these documents.

Starting with Doc 1 from Data Driven Investor, it seems to outline five ways rich Americans avoid paying taxes legally. The article emphasizes that these methods are legal and highlights that being rich isn't just about earning a lot but also about managing taxes efficiently. The points mentioned include focusing on long-term capital gains for lower tax rates, modifying income by taking a smaller salary and paying oneself in dividends or stock options, utilizing tax-deferral mechanisms like retirement accounts, making charitable contributions to lower tax liabilities, and setting up irrevocable trusts to protect assets and reduce tax burdens.

Doc 2 from Top Accounting Degrees provides an infographic on how the super-rich avoid paying taxes, listing seven methods: trust freezing, offshore tax havens, stock options, shell companies, equity swaps, capital gains tax avoidance through borrowing against shares, and incorporating personal brands to reduce income taxes. It also mentions deferred-compensation plans and charitable donations as additional strategies.

Doc 3 from Vox explains capital gains taxes and how they allow the rich to pay lower tax rates compared to ordinary income. It cites Warren Buffett's example of paying a lower tax rate than his secretary due to the majority of his income coming from capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than regular income. The article also mentions President Biden's proposal to raise the capital gains tax rate to 39.6%.

Doc 4 from Refinery29 presents a detailed analysis based on a ProPublica investigation, revealing how the 25 richest Americans paid minimal taxes compared to their wealth growth. It explains that since much of their wealth is held in assets like stocks and real estate, which are only taxed when sold, they can defer taxes indefinitely. The article also discusses various legal tax avoidance strategies used by the wealthy, such as owning sports teams for tax write-offs, engaging in philanthropy for tax deductions, and using complex financial instruments to minimize tax liabilities.

Doc 5 from Cheapism.com lists places where the rich hide their money to avoid paying taxes, including conservation easements, qualified opportunity zones, municipal bonds, life insurance policies, charitable investments, offshore accounts, shell companies, financial gift giving, offshore subsidiaries, Section 199A deductions, and retirement funds. The article provides brief explanations of each method and how they help in reducing tax burdens.

From these documents, several themes emerge regarding how the rich avoid taxes:

1. **Capital Gains Tax Advantage:** The rich often derive their income from capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. By holding assets for long periods and avoiding frequent trading, they can minimize their tax liabilities.

2. **Asset Appreciation:** Since assets like stocks and real estate appreciate over time and are only taxed upon sale, the rich can delay realizing gains and thus defer taxes indefinitely.

3. **Legal Tax Avoidance Strategies:** Utilizing various legal mechanisms such as trusts, offshore accounts, shell companies, and complex financial instruments allows the wealthy to shelter their income from taxes.

4. **Deductions and Write-offs:** Engaging in activities that provide significant tax deductions, such as charitable contributions, business expenses, and certain investments, helps reduce taxable income.

5. **Tax Deferral through Retirement Accounts:** Contributing to retirement accounts allows for tax-deferred growth, reducing current tax liabilities.

6. **Minimizing Salary Income:** By taking a lower salary and compensating through dividends or stock options, the rich can shift their income into lower-taxed categories.

7. **Philanthropy:** Donating to charities not only provides social benefits but also significant tax deductions, allowing the wealthy to reduce their tax bills while enhancing their public image.

8. **Offshore Havens:** Registering businesses or holding assets in countries with lower tax rates enables the rich to avoid higher taxes in their home countries.

9. **Complex Financial Transactions:** Engaging in equity swaps, deferred compensation plans, and other sophisticated financial maneuvers allows for tax optimization.

It's crucial to note that while these methods are legal, they contribute to a system where the wealthy pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes compared to middle-class individuals. This disparity has sparked debates about tax reform and the need for a more equitable tax system.

In conclusion, the rich employ a variety of legal strategies to minimize their tax liabilities, taking advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains, deferring taxes through asset holdings, utilizing deductions and write-offs, and leveraging complex financial instruments and offshore accounts. These practices collectively result in a tax system that is often criticized for being regressive and favoring the wealthy.
