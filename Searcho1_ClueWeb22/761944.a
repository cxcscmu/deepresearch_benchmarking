Alright, I need to figure out how corruption is shown in "Animal Farm." I read the book a while back, but I don't remember all the details. Maybe I should look up some information about the book to refresh my memory.

First, I know that "Animal Farm" is a novella by George Orwell, published in 1945. It's an allegory, which means it uses characters and events to represent broader ideas, often related to politics and society. Given that it's an allegory, corruption is likely to be represented through the actions and transformations of the characters.

Let me think about the main characters. There are the animals who take over the farm from Mr. Jones, the owner. The leader among them is Old Major, who inspires the other animals with his ideas about animal equality and freedom from human oppression. After Old Major dies, the pigs take charge, with Napoleon and Snowball being the main pig leaders.

I recall that Napoleon becomes increasingly corrupt over time. He starts off as one of the leaders, but gradually consolidates power unto himself, eliminating Snowball and anyone who opposes him. He changes the rules and the Seven Commandments to suit his own purposes, which is a clear sign of corruption.

For example, one of the original commandments is "All animals are equal." But as the story progresses, it gets changed to "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." This is a classic example of corruption, where the rulers twist the rules to give themselves special privileges.

Also, the pigs start living in the farmhouse, which was one of the things they originally opposed. They drink alcohol, wear clothes, and engage in other human-like behaviors, which were forbidden according to their original ideals. This shows how they have become corrupted by power and the desire to imitate the very humans they rebelled against.

Another instance of corruption is the way Napoleon uses the dogs to maintain control. He raises a litter of puppies as his personal guards, and they are used to intimidate and eliminate any opposition. This is similar to how corrupt leaders use force and violence to suppress dissent and maintain their grip on power.

Moreover, the character of Squealer acts as Napoleon's propagandist. He manipulates the information given to the other animals, spinning stories to make Napoleon look good and to justify his actions. This is another aspect of corruptionâ€”using propaganda and misinformation to control the population.

The farm's dealings with humans also show corruption. Initially, the animals reject all contact with humans, viewing them as enemies. However, Napoleon later engages in trade with neighboring human farms, which was against the original principles. This suggests that Napoleon is willing to compromise the ideals of the revolution for personal gain and power.

Towards the end of the book, the pigs become indistinguishable from humans. They walk on two legs, carry whips, and even invite human farmers to inspect the farm. This symbolizes complete corruption, as the leaders have fully embraced the ways of the oppressors they once fought against.

In conclusion, corruption in "Animal Farm" is shown through the pigs' gradual abuse of power, their alteration of the original ideals and rules, their use of force and propaganda to control the other animals, and their eventual transformation into mirror images of the human farmers they originally rebelled against.
