As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information and perspectives on whether everyone can benefit from higher education.

Higher education refers to any education beyond high school, including vocational training, community colleges, four-year colleges, and graduate schools. The benefits of higher education are often discussed in terms of increased earning potential, better job opportunities, personal growth, and contributing to societal development.

Firstly, in terms of career prospects, many jobs now require at least some form of post-secondary education. Higher education can provide individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. It can also lead to higher salaries and greater job security.

Secondly, higher education can contribute to personal development. It exposes individuals to new ideas and ways of thinking, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It can also broaden one's perspective and promote cultural understanding.

Moreover, higher education can have broader societal benefits. Educated individuals are more likely to participate in democratic processes, volunteer in their communities, and engage in lifelong learning.

However, it's important to note that higher education may not be the best path for everyone. Some individuals may prefer to enter the workforce directly after high school or pursue vocational training. Additionally, the cost of higher education can be a barrier for many, leading to student debt that can take years to pay off.

In conclusion, while higher education can provide numerous benefits, it's not necessarily the only path to success or personal fulfillment. It's essential for individuals to consider their own goals, interests, and circumstances when deciding whether to pursue higher education.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, not everyone necessarily benefits from higher education, as individual needs and circumstances vary.}} \]
