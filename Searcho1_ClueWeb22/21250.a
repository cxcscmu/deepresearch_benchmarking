Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why cybersecurity is a good career choice. I mean, I've heard that it's in demand, but I want to understand exactly why that is and what makes it a solid career path. Maybe I should start by understanding what cybersecurity actually entails.

First off, cybersecurity is all about protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, theft, and damage. With more and more of our lives moving online—personal information, financial transactions, you name it—the need to protect all that data has become crucial. So, it makes sense that there would be a high demand for people who can help safeguard all that.

I think one reason cybersecurity is such a big deal is because of how vulnerable we are to cyber threats. Every day, there are news stories about hacks, data breaches, and identity theft. It’s scary stuff. And as our dependence on technology grows, so does the potential for these kinds of attacks. That means businesses and organizations need skilled professionals who can anticipate and prevent these threats.

Also, I’ve heard that the job market for cybersecurity is really strong. There are a lot of openings, and the pay seems to be pretty good. But I should probably look into that more to get some concrete numbers and see what the growth prospects are like.

Maybe I should do some research to back this up. Let me try searching for something like "why choose cybersecurity as a career" or "benefits of a career in cybersecurity." That might give me some insights and statistics to work with.

4 reasons to consider a cybersecurity career
Mark Nunnikhoven Vice President, Cloud Research, Trend Micro
Zero percent unemployment is an attractive stat. It certainly tops a guidance counselor's reasons for students to choose cybersecurity as a career. It's a nice perk, for sure, but it doesn't compare to some of the more compelling reasons to pursue a career in cybersecurity.
You don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to understand that this is a growth area. Cybersecurity has become critical to the fabric of any modern business. As breach after breach hits the headlines, it's clear to everyone that organizations need more professionals focused on cybersecurity.
Every role within IT has a cybersecurity aspect. Focusing on security as your primary role opens up a world of options. From security operations to risk assessments to application security to investigations to compliance to educator, there as many roles within cybersecurity as lines of code running in your browser.
And don't let those negative headlines get your down. For every Equifax, there are hundreds of millions of successful transactions made online. We are making progress as a profession.
Here are the top four reasons why you should consider a career in cybersecurity—and one reason why you shouldn't.
1. Practically unlimited growth
With an ever-expanding scope, cybersecurity presents the ultimate growth potential—both in your career path and for learning opportunities.
We teach security as its own discipline, but it links to all of the other IT skill sets. A good cybersecurity professional works to understand as much as possible about how technologies and organizations work.
A great cybersecurity professional realizes that the learning never stops.
That's a massive opportunity to stay engaged and challenged.
When security teams started out, they were built from "jack-of-all-trades" types. The discipline hadn't grown enough to support specialties in forensics or application security or incident response.
The current workload has forced security teams to quickly scale up and out. Opportunity is there for professionals willing to challenge themselves to take it.
Whether you're looking to work your way towards a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) role or to work with brand new technologies, the only thing that will restrict your growth is your desire.
That's an exciting proposition and reason enough on its own to choose a career in cybersecurity.
2. Plenty of variety
All of the opportunities for growth are tied to the variety of technologies and situations security professionals have to deal with. If it uses ones and zeros, it has a cybersecurity component (and some roles even extend to physical security!).
Security professionals get the chance to work directly with teams on technologies and systems they never dreamed of. From robots to cars to websites serving millions and millions of users, the variety is near infinite.
That's an exciting career prospect. Bored is not a word you'll be using often.
This variety has an interesting offshoot: Because of the broad skill set required to properly understand modern security challenges, cybersecurity professionals come from a diverse set of backgrounds. In fact, the more variety you have in your background, the better a security professional you'll be!
There’s no "right" way to train to become a cybersecurity professional.
3. The ability to solve puzzles
Add together the growth of technology and its variety, and you start to glimpse the different types of puzzles that cybersecurity professionals can deal with.
In cybersecurity we rely on some tried-and-true principles, but the tactics can change day-to-day. And there's always a new puzzle that needs to be solved.
With each new wave of technology, new risks are created. It's the job of security professionals to identify, understand, and then help address these risks. That changes significantly when you're considering how to defend a website running in the cloud compared to defending a pacemaker in an elderly patient.
Each situation is a unique puzzle and a new opportunity to rise to the challenge.
4. The job has real impact
That last use case—defending a pacemaker in an elderly patient—is a real one. Recently there was a massive recall of pacemakers due to a security issue. The Equifax hack impacted 145 million Americans.
Cybersecurity matters. It has impacts that extend beyond the digital world and into the physical one.
That's a terrifying and exciting prospect and one that highlights its importance.
If you want to work on IT issues that have real-world impact, cybersecurity might be the discipline for you.
And why not to choose this path: Perception
Make no mistake. The variety, growth opportunities, puzzles, and impact of cybersecurity add up to an exciting career. But if you're expecting a career more in line with Hollywood’s presentation of security professionals...think again.
The vast majority of roles in cybersecurity don't require you to jet around the world dodging bullets or getting scan results in milliseconds or being able to immediately identify malicious code by its red color (<sarcasm>thanks for that, CSI: Cyber </sarcasm>).
Of course, that doesn't mean that these roles aren't rewarding. They are. They just might not be glamorous.
Start learning, keep learning
Cybersecurity has the two key logistical advantages for a strong career: Low to no unemployment and solid compensation.
Plus, if you choose this path, you'll always have room to grow. You'll continually be learning new skills and working to understand new technologies. New challenges will keep popping up and you'll be exposed to a multitude of new people, situations, and opportunities.
You'll never be bored as new puzzles need to be solved, and you can always be proud because your work will have a positive impact on the digital and physical world.

9 Reasons Why Cyber Security is a Good Career Option | 2021
9 Reasons Why Cyber Security is a Good Career Option
By Jonas July 5, 2021 5min read 950 views
There are countless reasons why a career in cyber security is worth it. With more than 3.5 million job openings currently across the world in the cyber security world, you can believe that this career option is one of the fastest growing industries in the world.
Cyber security being a solid career choice promotes employment, good salary and much more, but it also has its drawbacks. Let’s get in detail and discuss as to why a career in cyber security would the right choice for you!
Is Cyber Security a Good Career Option?
Here are nine reasons to explain and justify that why getting into the cyber space is good for your career.
1# High Salary
As majority of people look for jobs for a good pay, cyber security might a good fit for you. With a high demand and a relatively low supply of qualified labor in the cyber world, the salary is pretty good in this career line.
The average salary of a person working in cyber security in North America is around 90,000 compared to other average salary wages which are around 40,000. Therefore, with a fair amount of experience and qualified certifications, you must expect to make double the national average in cyber security.
2# Education & Certification
As difficult the career may sound, you actually do not require any degree in cyber security to get into this field. As education can be a huge obstacle for other career paths such as for doctors and lawyers who need to invest thousands of dollars to get a formal education degree, it is quite the opposite in this field.
Cyber security specialists are usually self-taught or have degrees in other fields of work which are unrelated, but have been able to make a transition into this field. Having credible certifications are more than enough to be considered well-respected in this field and can be used to enter or advance in cyber world rather than getting a whole degree from college.
3# More Job Openings
One of the biggest benefits of this high-in demand career option is that the job openings in this field are never ending. According to a survey done in 2019, there was a global shortage of about 2.9 million cyber security professionals in the previous year, 2018.
With such statistics, you can figure out the extremely low unemployment pattern among this field. In the whole of United States, there were more than 500,000 job openings in 2020, even during the pandemic when millions of people were losing their job, cyber security professionals helped save the economic downturn and was consistent throughout.
4# Remote Work
Even before than pandemic of Covid-19 began, most of the work in the cyber security field was based off of technology and working with people from different parts of the world, therefore, it was easier to work from home with flexible timings.
While some people might think this as a negative point as they do not get the opportunity to socialize with coworkers and do not get to get out of the house, for many people remote work is a benefit.
5# Job Satisfaction
According to a survey done by PayScale, 71% of respondents in North America said they were satisfied with the work pressure of being a cyber security professional, while 36% chose very satisfied, which on a scale of 5, made job satisfaction a 3.83 pointer, which is more than 10% over the average of 51% among the workers in the United States.
6# Exciting & Challenging Work
In the field of cyber security, one thing we can assure you of is a whole lot of challenges and exciting work coming your way on a daily basis. In this digital era, cyber security plays a key role in ensuring online safety as well the safety of essential computer systems supporting our daily lives.
Technologies such as electricity, transportation, financial institutions and infrastructure, all rely on cyber security professionals to be taken care of and kept safe, as they face new challenges every day that they need to tackle.
7# Variety in Options
As you complete your certification program in cyber security, you now have to choose which field of cyber security you wish to join. As new roles emerge and old roles evolve to encompass new skills, you have abundance of roles and jobs to choose from.
For instance, a data scientist to work with emerging technologies as a machine learning, or you could become a penetration tester to solve riddles and crack flaws in the security systems, or you could become an ethical hacker in big bounty programs.
8# Digital is Future
As cyber security becomes an increasingly important part of most industries, it is not surprising that today, every organization is looking to hire a cyber security professional to protect their assets and confidential data. On a global scale, the average cost of data breach is almost $4 million dollars every year.
The private and public sectors, both are looking to hire either a freelancer or a cyber security full time professional for protection and safety. Not only this, start-ups and small digital businesses are also investing in hiring professionals to deal with cyber security issues in their operations.
9# Dynamic Field
As cyber security is considered to a highly-dynamic field with new cyber threats coming along every day, it requires a dynamic skill set in the professionals from different types of work backgrounds to solve the issues and for safety from breaches and unethical cyber practices.
By involving yourself in the cyber security world, you have the opportunity to differentiate yourself by drawing out your own unique skill set from experience from prior jobs, degrees or education, such as information technology, administration or accounting, which helps in building a strong cyber security skill set all together.
Conclusion
With reasons ranging from competitive pay, growth opportunities, high-in demand job openings, job security, exciting day-to-day tasks and chance to make a difference, pursuing a career in cyber security is one of the wisest choices you could make today.
Huge variety of different avenues and a perfect fit for different personality types, what else do you need, right?

5 reasons to consider a career in cybersecurity
From competitive salaries to ever-evolving job descriptions, there are myriad reasons why a cybersecurity career could be right for you

If you’re finishing middle school, graduating college or even thinking of switching jobs, chances are that you have given some thought to the sprawling tech industry. With cyberthreats looming large and cybercrime predicted to cost the world US$6 trillion by 2021, it’s no wonder that cybersecurity professionals are a “hot commodity”. In fact, there aren’t enough of them to go around; the number of available cybersecurity professionals would need to grow by a whopping 145% just to meet the global demands of the market.
This week is National Careers Week in the United Kingdom, and we’ve rounded up five reasons why cybersecurity may be the right career path for you.
The future is digital
Few doubt that cybersecurity will increasingly become an important part of most industries. Considering that on a global scale the average cost of a data breach is almost US$4 million, it’s not surprising that organizations are looking to bolster their ranks with cybersecurity professionals.
The doors are open to you in the private or public sector or even as a freelancer. You wouldn’t necessarily have to stick to one role – or one industry, for that matter – since everything is connected nowadays. Everybody needs protection: be it a small and up-and-coming startup, or an enterprise with billions of dollars in revenue.
Variety
Cybersecurity keeps on evolving, just as the rest of the tech world does, which means that new roles will emerge while old roles will gradually evolve to encompass new skills. Even now there is an abundance of roles to choose from.
For example, you can become a big data scientist, and work with emerging technologies such as machine learning. If you’re more into solving riddles and looking for flaws, you might become a penetration tester working to crack the security of clients’ IT systems or become an ethical hacker enrolled in official bug bounty programs. While both test the security of different IT systems, their working methods are different. Often, penetration testers are more specialized in specific areas, while ethical hackers are jacks of all trades.
Salary
Since the talent gap is so large, companies are offering competitive salaries to entice their prospective candidates. One thing to note is that although salaries are good, they vary depending on the position you are applying for and the region where you are applying.
According to an ISC 2 study, the average salary in North America for cybersecurity-related jobs is about US$90,000 a year. Indeed, a job and recruiting website, pretty much backs that with an average figure of US$111,000. Depending on the position and your seniority level, for example, penetration testers make around US$122,000 per year, while network security engineers have an average income of US$117,000 per year and information security analysts have an average salary of US$89,000.
Job satisfaction
The ICS 2 study found that job satisfaction is high among cybersecurity professionals in North America, with 71% respondents saying they are satisfied. Professionals working in this field take pride in the fact that they are defending people and organizations against cybercrime, as well as helping them find solutions to technical problems. Another benefit is that the environment is always changing, which keeps the job interesting: these professionals have a constant series of challenges they must analyze and conquer.
Education and certification
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a degree in cybersecurity to get started in the field. Although an increasing number of universities and colleges offer such degrees, many specialists are self-taught, as clearly there’s more than one route to your goal. If you’re a student applying to universities, then seek out a program that best fits your needs.
If you’re considering a career switch, then you may not have the luxury and time to attend university. In that case, you can get started by trying online courses, attending meetups, and following cybersecurity professionals on online media. Certification can be an important part of your education, since certified professionals tend to rise through the ranks faster and have better salaries. There are multiple certificates available depending on the area you want to specialize in, you just need to choose the right one for you.
There’s no better time than the present to join the ranks of cybersecurity experts. So if you’re ready to dive in, we suggest you start with this article as a jumping-off point.

Why work in cyber security?
Why work in cyber security?
The fact we are launching an independent professional body for cyber security shows just how vital this area has become – it makes a huge contribution to our thriving digital economy by safeguarding our critical national infrastructure, commerce and other online spaces.
Matt Warman MP, Digital Infrastructure Minister, February 9th 2021
What drives anyone to choose a particular career? In some cases, it might be sheer aptitude – a mathematician, say, or an athlete. Sometimes it might be passion or a vocation – perhaps an actor, or a doctor. Sometimes it’s a simple case grabbing an unexpected opportunity.
But for most of us, the drivers are several and more mundane: a good salary, job security, interesting work, progression potential… all of which are good reasons why you should choose a career in cyber security.
Cyber security professionals are in huge demand
Cyber security's fastest-growing skill areas reflect the high priority organizations place on building secure digital infrastructures. Research by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport into Cyber Security skills in the UK labour marke t estimates that between 30-48% of all businesses in the UK have a basic or more advanced skills gap in their organisations. These include both technical and non-technical skills.
Technical skills gaps are relatively high in each of the following areas: threat assessment or information risk management; assurance, audits, compliance or testing; cyber security research; implementing secure systems; and governance and management.
29% of cyber firms say that non-technical skills deficiencies are preventing them from meeting their business goals, such as communication, leadership and management skills.
Variety of opportunities
The range of activities in effective cyber security management includes identifying threats, enabling protection policies and systems, detecting and responding to cyber security threats, as well as recovering data and systems in the event of a breach.
The industry depends on its practitioners developing a wide range of practical management skills as well as technical know-how. Learn more about the 16 core specialisms here.
Job satisfaction
Job satisfaction among cybersecurity practitioners is reported to be high: worldwide, 76% of cyber security professionals (peaking at 79% in North America) report that they are satisfied with their jobs.
Job continuity
Advances in smart technology and artificial intelligence for a wide range of domestic and industrial uses means that cyber security roles will continue to require monitoring via ethical hackers or “white hats” for the foreseeable future.
Education and certification
You don’t need a degree to become a cyber security professional - although many universities offer cyber security-specific degrees and new courses are appearing all the time. Many online courses are available, too, which may be general in nature or provide training in a specific area of cyber security. Obtaining relevant certifications will be a key component to your progression in the industry.
See the Getting started in cyber security, Apprenticeship schemes and opportunities and Cyber security qualifications sections for more information.
Of course, you shouldn’t take our word for it. An internet search for “Why work in cyber security” will bring up similar reasons and many others.

7 Awesome Reasons Why Cybersecurity is a Fun Career – StartaCyberCareer.com
7 Awesome Reasons Why Cybersecurity is a Fun Career
I get a lot of questions about the field of cybersecurity.  People often want to know how to get into cybersecurity, what the demand will be in the future, or if the field is hard to keep up with .  But another common question regarding a career in cybersecurity is simply, is cybersecurity fun?  Do most people find cybersecurity to be enjoyable work on a day to day basis, and do cybersecurity professionals like what they do?  To answer this question, I reached out to a dozen cybersecurity professionals to find out if they think cybersecurity is fun, and if so, what they enjoy most about it.
Is cybersecurity fun? Many professionals find the field of cybersecurity to be fun and enjoyable due to the importance of the work, the fast pace of change, the challenge of solving problems, and the plentiful career opportunities that are available to them.
Let’s jump in a little deeper and discuss why cybersecurity jobs are enjoyable for the professionals that do them every day.
Why Cybersecurity is Enjoyable
Reason #1: Cybersecurity is important work that makes a difference.
Cybersecurity incidents are bad news.  They are continual, increasingly-complex attacks against every sector of our economy, and they can negatively impact every aspect of our lives.  One cybersecurity professional I spoke to actually called them “wicked,” but said that being on the front lines of cybersecurity was enjoyable because he felt like he was making a real difference.
This video is private
Watch on
There are probably some jobs out there that aren’t that important and really don’t make that much of a positive impact to the employer.  You may even know someone that has a job that seems almost unnecessary, and possibly even one that if they stopped doing the job, their company wouldn’t even notice a difference.  That certainly isn’t the case for cybersecurity positions.  Many cybersecurity professionals see their work as highly important, in the same way a doctor or teacher would hopefully view their work.  To these cybersecurity professionals, their work is a critical part of a greater mission that keeps something or someone secure.  And being part of this mission is what they find fun and enjoyable.
Reason #2:  Abundant opportunities to advance and grow.
The fast pace of cybersecurity is a double-edged sword.  On one hand, it can be difficult or even brutal to keep up with all of the new technology, breaches, updates, and changes that occur on a daily and sometimes hourly basis.  But on the other hand, the consistent change of new technology means that there is always a new skill or specialization that is available to learn and become proficient with.  Some cybersecurity professionals really use this to their advantage and leverage this to shape their careers.  For example, by being willing to learn a new technology that a company or a client is rolling out, they can help steer their careers into new specialties on a frequent basis.  Many future-thinking cybersecurity professionals use the opportunity to learn new technology not just as a means for job security, but also as a way to specialize in new areas that they will find enjoyable.  Anytime that anything they’re doing starts to get stale, there’s always a new technology that can keep things fresh and fun.
Reason #3:  Every day in cybersecurity is a new adventure.
Okay, I’ll admit that every day is cybersecurity is an adventure.  Certainly, there are some days that feel mundane.  But for many cybersecurity jobs, much of the work that these cybersecurity professionals do would certainly not be considered boring by any means.  Several of the cybersecurity professionals I spoke with said that what made their jobs fun were the new adventures that cropped up daily.  They shared that in many cases, no two days ever feel the same, and there is always something new that comes across their desk that they find interesting and intriguing.
As a cybersecurity professional, you may find that there are many facets to your job.  At one moment, you may feel like a detective completing forensic investigation work on a breached system or researching a problem.  The next day you may feel more like a network technician, diagnosing typical problems and providing customer service to network users.  Or in different scenario you may feel like an analyst, providing cybersecurity advice to a manager, business owner, or client.  Different tasks in the cybersecurity field provide variety in the job, and this is what some cybersecurity pros find enjoyable.
Reason #4:  Cybersecurity work can be extremely challenging.
As a teenager, I worked as a laborer in the construction field.  The job required absolutely no thinking.   It wasn’t too long before the lack of any kind of mental stimulation in the job started to get to me.  I hated the feeling of not having to think.  Having work that is easy every day, year after year, would probably become boring.  One of the fun factors of cybersecurity cited by the professionals I spoke with was that the incredible challenge of cybersecurity is exactly what makes it fun for them.
There are some situations in cybersecurity that can be high difficulty, high stress, and high importance, but the best cybersecurity professionals seemed to enjoy those situations the most.  Having work that on occasion is really challenging and that tests their skills is the exact thing that enables them to prove to themselves that they are capable and talented professionals, and the experience of going through a challenging cyber situation and coming out with success on the other side makes their jobs fun.  And this makes sense.  Everyone wants to feel competent and successful, and cybersecurity work provides the challenge that can generate success and enjoyment.
Reason #5:  Cyber has a great community of professionals.
Cybersecurity professionals told me that they really enjoy networking with others in the field, and because of this, the cybersecurity field provides a great community of like-minded professionals to connect with and learn from.  This sense of community and camaraderie is something that makes the field of cybersecurity fun for some professionals.  When you’re engaged in the field of cybersecurity, sharing war stories and insight with others helps make the work that you do fun.
Reason #6:  Support for cyber projects.
I wasn’t expecting this one, but it does make sense.  One of the professionals I interviewed said that what makes cybersecurity fun for him is that he gets a lot of support from management and customers, including budgetary support, for the work that he does.  This is because those people see the importance of cybersecurity.
Certainly, during the past five years, two things have happened in cybersecurity.  First, cybersecurity has become a household word that people now have an understanding of.  That wasn’t the case a half-decade ago.  Secondly, companies have now realized that cybersecurity defense is no longer optional.  It is forevermore a part of their budget when five years ago it very well has been viewed as optional.
This change has created for many cyber professionals a situation where they are getting the support that they need to carry out their jobs effectively, and according to them, this is what makes their jobs fun.
Reason #7:  We are the first generation of cyber warriors.
Here’s another one I didn’t expect to hear, but that makes sense when you hear it.  Cybersecurity is a new phenomenon.  It didn’t exist in anything near its current form twenty years ago.  This means that any current and soon-to-be cybersecurity professionals are among the first generation of this new field.  Teachers, doctors, attorneys, carpenters, and just about everyone else has been around for a while.  Not cybersecurity professionals.  As cyber pros, we are on the ground floor of this whole new thing, and that is fun and enjoyable to some.  One cybersecurity professional said that he enjoys being among the “first iteration of this new science.”  That is pretty cool when you think about it.

Alright, so I've got some information here from these articles. Let me try to summarize why cybersecurity is a good career choice based on what I've read.

First off, there's the issue of high demand. All these sources mention that there's a huge shortage of cybersecurity professionals worldwide. For example, one article says there were 3.5 million job openings globally, and another mentions a shortage of 2.9 million professionals. Even during the pandemic, when many jobs were disappearing, cybersecurity jobs remained strong, with over 500,000 openings in the U.S. alone in 2020. So, job security seems really solid in this field.

Next, salary is a big factor. One source says the average salary for cybersecurity professionals in North America is around $90,000, compared to a national average of around $40,000. Another source puts the average even higher, at $111,000. Specific roles like penetration testers can make up to $122,000 per year. So, financially, it seems like a lucrative career path.

Education and certification seem to be more flexible in cybersecurity compared to some other fields. You don't necessarily need a degree in cybersecurity to get started. Many professionals are self-taught or have degrees in unrelated fields but have made the transition through certifications. This is appealing because it lowers the barrier to entry and allows for more flexibility in career paths.

Variety is another plus. Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of specialties, from data science and machine learning to penetration testing and ethical hacking. This means there are many different directions you can take your career, depending on your interests and strengths. It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of job.

Job satisfaction appears to be high in cybersecurity. One survey found that 71% of respondents were satisfied with their jobs, with 36% reporting they were very satisfied. People seem to find fulfillment in the work because it's challenging, ever-changing, and has real-world impact.

The field is dynamic and constantly evolving, which can be exciting for someone who thrives on new challenges and doesn't mind adapting to change. With new technologies emerging all the time, there's always something new to learn and implement in terms of security measures.

Moreover, cybersecurity is crucial in today's digital age. Every organization, whether private or public, relies heavily on technology, and protecting their systems and data is paramount. So, working in cybersecurity means you're playing a vital role in keeping organizations and individuals safe from cyber threats.

Lastly, the work can be quite engaging and stimulating. Solving complex problems, staying ahead of hackers, and being part of a team that defends against cyberattacks can be intellectually satisfying and fun, according to some professionals.

So, overall, it seems like cybersecurity is a robust career choice with good prospects, competitive pay, and a sense of purpose. However, it's important to consider that like any job, it has its challenges too. For instance, the field can be stressful, especially during security breaches or major incidents. Also, the need to stay updated with the latest threats and technologies requires continuous learning, which can be demanding.

But despite these challenges, the benefits seem to outweigh them, making cybersecurity an attractive career option for many.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Cybersecurity is a good career choice due to high demand, competitive salaries, flexible education paths, variety in roles, job satisfaction, and the critical importance of the work in today's digital landscape.}} \]
