So I need to figure out what leads to poverty. That seems like a pretty big topic because poverty can be caused by lots of different things, right? I think I should start by understanding what poverty is. Poverty is when people don't have enough money or resources to meet their basic needs like food, shelter, and clothing. It's a complex issue that affects millions of people worldwide.

I guess there are different types of poverty, like absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty is when people can't afford the most basic things needed to survive, while relative poverty compares people's living standards within a society. For this question, I'll focus more on absolute poverty since it's more severe and universally applicable.

Now, what causes poverty? I think there are several factors that contribute to poverty, and they can be categorized into individual, societal, and global levels.

Starting with individual factors, one thing that comes to mind is lack of education. If someone doesn't have access to education or chooses not to educate themselves, they might not have the skills needed to get good jobs, which can lead to poverty. Also, poor health can be a cause; if someone is sick or has a disability, they might not be able to work or their medical expenses could drain their resources.

Family circumstances also play a role. Growing up in a poor family can limit opportunities because of insufficient resources for education, nutrition, and healthcare. This can create a cycle of poverty that's hard to break.

Moving on to societal factors, unemployment is a big one. If there aren't enough jobs available, people will naturally struggle to make ends meet. Even if jobs are available, they might not pay enough, leading to what's called "working poverty." Minimum wage jobs often don't provide enough income to cover living expenses.

Social inequalities also contribute to poverty. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, or other factors can limit people's opportunities in education and employment. For example, certain groups might face bias in hiring processes or be steered towards lower-paying jobs.

Access to resources is another important aspect. In some areas, people might not have access to clean water, nutritious food, or reliable transportation, which can hinder their ability to improve their situation.

Looking at global factors, economic policies can have a significant impact. For instance, trade policies that favor wealthy nations over developing ones can stunt economic growth in poorer countries, keeping their populations in poverty.

Conflict and instability are also major causes. War-torn regions often suffer from destroyed infrastructure, displacement of populations, and disruption of economies, all of which can lead to poverty.

Lastly, climate change is emerging as a significant factor. Natural disasters and environmental degradation can devastate communities, particularly in vulnerable areas, leading to loss of homes, crops, and livelihoods.

I think it's important to note that these factors are interconnected and often reinforce each other. For example, a lack of education can lead to poor health choices, which in turn can limit employment opportunities.

To get a better understanding, maybe I should look up some statistics or studies on poverty. Maybe see what experts say about the main causes.

What Are the Main Causes of Poverty?
By Staff Writer Last Updated April 03, 2020
Dan Moyle/CC-BY 2.0
On an individual basis, poverty is caused by the level of education, skill, intelligence and experience one has. Mental and physical handicaps, feebleness due to age and discrimination due to sexual orientation, race, sex and other bigotry also are causes. Causes on a societal level include warfare, agricultural cycles, natural disasters, droughts and flooding.
There are at least two approaches to explaining societal poverty, including case and generic theories. The case approach says that individual theories (or cases) of poverty make up the aggregate (or total) reasons for societal poverty. The generic theory of poverty, however, maintains that systemwide societal problems, such as low national income, cause individual cases of poverty.
In other words, case theories believe in combating poverty by addressing individual causes. Generic theory, on the other hand, believes in combating poverty by addressing the overarching social and economic issues that cause it.
For example, in case theory, if the cause of poverty is believed to be lack of education or skills, then the solution is better educating individuals in poverty. According to generic theory, however, the issue of poverty would be better solved by improving the quantity and quality of jobs nationwide.
Some scholars who like a generic approach say that some underlying problems that cause poverty include the fact that there aren’t enough employment opportunities that produce a livable wage, or the fact that a country has a low national income. Another country-specific example is warfare. For example, the per capita GDP of Iraq dropped from $2,500 to $761 due to the Persian Gulf War between 1990 to 1993.

Hint: A condition or state in which a person or a community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living is known as Poverty. Poverty means that the income level from employment is so low that basic human needs can't be met.
Complete answer:
Following are the main causes of poverty:-
1. Increase rate of rising population: In the last 45 years, the population has increased at a whopping rate of 2.2% per annum. An average of approx. 17 million people are added every year to the population which raises the demand for consumption goods considerably.
2. Less productivity in agriculture: In agriculture, the productivity level is very low due to subdivided and fragmented holdings, lack of capital, use of traditional methods of cultivation, illiteracy etc. The very reason for poverty in the country is this factor only.
3. Less utilization of resources: Underemployment and veiled unemployment of human resources and less utilization of resources have resulted in low production in the agricultural sector. This brought a downfall in their standard of living.
4. A short rate of economic development: In India, the rate of economic development is very low what is required for a good level. Therefore, there persists a gap between the level of availability and requirements of goods and services. The net result is poverty.
5. Increasing price rise: Poor is becoming poorer because of continuous and steep price rise. It has benefited a few people in the society and the persons in the lower-income groups find it difficult to get their minimum needs.
6. Unemployment: One of the main causes of poverty is the continuous expanding army of unemployed in our country. The job seeker is increasing in number at a higher rate than the expansion in employment opportunities.
7. Shortage of capital and able entrepreneurship: The much-required capital and sustainable entrepreneurship play a very important role in accelerating growth. But these are in short supply making it difficult to increase production significantly.
8. Social factors: Our country’s social set-up is very much backward with the rest of the world and not at all beneficial for faster development. The caste system, inheritance law, rigid traditions and customs are putting hindrances in the way of faster development and have aggravated the problem of poverty.
9. Political factors: We all know that the East India Company started lopsided development in India and had reduced our economy to a colonial state. They exploited the natural resources to suit their interests and weaken the industrial base of the Indian economy. Hence, the planning was of immense failure to handle the problems of poverty and unemployment.
10. Unequal distribution of income: If you simply increase the production or do checking on population cannot help poverty in our country. We need to understand that inequality in the distribution of income and concentration of wealth should be checked. The government can reduce inequality of income and check the concentration of wealth by pursuing suitable monetary and price policies.
11. The problem of distribution: The distribution channel should be robust in order to remove poverty. Mass consumption of goods and food grains etc. should be distributed first among the poor population. The present public distribution system must be re-organised and extended to rural and semi-urban areas of the country.
12. Regional poverty: India is divided by the inappropriate proportion of poor in some states, like Nagaland, Orissa, Bihar, Nagaland, etc. is greater than the other states. The administration should offer special amenities and discounts to attract private capital investment to backward regions.
13. Provision for minimum requirements of the poor: The government should take care of the minimum requirements, like drinking water, primary medical care, and primary education etc. of the poor.
Note:
Projects on Poverty in India:
- Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP): To offer assistance to the rural poor in the form of subsidy and bank credit for effective employment opportunities through successive plan periods.
- Jawahar Rozgar Yojana/Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana: To create meaningful employment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in rural parts of the country
- Food for Work Programme: It focuses on improving food security through wage employment. Foodgrains are supplied to states for free
- Rural Housing-Indira Awaas Yojana: This programme is meant to offer free housing to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in rural areas and keep up the targets would be the households of SC/STs.

Poverty is basically the condition of having insufficient resources or income. It is the state of being where one is deprived of necessities in life such as housing, food, sufficient income, employment and access to required social services and status. There are many forms of poverty which exists in this world such as absolute poverty, relative poverty, human poverty and lastly income poverty. Absolute poverty is defined as living to an absolute minimum standard which is called the 'poverty line' where people barely have sufficient resources to live. Relative poverty is when people are poor in relation to people around them in the country. Income poverty is when people are poor when they have less money than the defined poverty line in their country and lastly human poverty takes account other factors such as life expectancy, infant mortality, nutrition, illiteracy and lack of food and clean water and lack of health services. Poverty exists in both MEDC's and LEDC's, however, absolute poverty and the places which suffer poverty severely and the most is in LEDC's such as Africa, Asia, Latin America and some countries in Eastern Europe. People in these countries, struggle daily for food, shelter and other necessities. They also often suffer from severe malnutrition, epidemic disease outbreaks, famine and war. However, poverty in MEDC's is usually due to poor nutrition, mental illness, drug dependence, crime and high rates of disease. There are many reasons and causes to poverty which some people say it is due to adequate lack of resources on a global level such as land, food , shelter, building materials in order to survive while other believe it is because of uneven distribution of resources around the world. Overall, there are many causes to poverty which is caused from political, social and economic factors in which some vital causes are mentioned below are on resource exploitation, indebtedness and structural adjustment, corruption, and overpopulation.
Poverty, in history actually began after resource exploitation from MEDC's. Poverty actually became worse after the rise of civilizations and when powerful nations maintained and increased their power in wealth by building empires by using labor and resources of less powerful regions (i.e. some LEDC's). This happened after the era of colonialism where countries in Western Europe and later the U.S and Japan claim territories in LEDC's such as Asia, Africa and Central America. At first, there countries had plenty of natural resources. However, the colonizers (MEDC's) acquired new resources and productive land and spread religion to gain strategic positions against rival nations and military confrontations. This had all happened by firstly, the colonizers, France, Britain, Portugal, used LEDC's(their colonies) territories and provided them with goods for consumption and trade. However, after the Industrial Revolution, it brought mechanized production and it spread to other MEDC's to produce much larger quantities of goods and resources. So these MEDC's could produce much larger quantities of goods and resources than previously had in LEDC's. So to achieve this level of production, they had to rely on LEDC's to provide raw materials for building machines and supplying their factories. This increased the standard of living for industrialized countries however, caused poverty in colonies in Africa, South and East Asia, Latin America which did not share these gains in standard of living as the MEDC's. These resources of the colonies (LEDC's) were usually exploited by MEDC's and especially Britain to supply raw materials such as metal ores for smelting or sugarcane for production of rum. The production of food and raw materials for manufacturing diverted indigenous people from doing subsistence work, such as gardening or tending livestock. Many also were displaced from their land and they became poor and suffered poverty which mainly happened in China and Russia. Even though the countries gained independence, they still remain developing counties as MEDC's have exploited resources and due to colonization have left an unstable political stability in many LEDC's. Therefore this is one cause of poverty, as so many resources were exploited and hence, with overpopulation people didn't have enough resources to sustain their life. These countries don't have enough resources such as productivity on food and other resources to increase their standard of living and the government doesn't provide infrastructure and aid to citizens to decrease poverty levels.
Overpopulation is another cause to poverty. This is when there is a situation where of having large number of people with too few resources and too little space. This results in high population density while puts stress on the availability of resources. Poverty is caused because many countries, it is overpopulated in the given area of land because foods and resources can provide less than the amount needed. This is because countries where people live on simple farming, gardening, herding, hunting and gathering can only support a few number of people because they are labor-intensive subsistence activities and can provide only small amounts of food. A countries level of poverty can depend on its population density and agricultural productivity. Such as Bangladesh, has one of the highest population density of 1078 people per square km and a large number of people can only work for low-productivity and manual farming which contributes a high level of poverty. This is because these countries have infertile land and lack of economic resources and technology to boost productivity due to government 'inappropriate' way of using money such as Sub-Saharan Africa). If an area is overpopulated, the more the people there will be hence more resources are needed to be provided and with low productivity it would only cause a high rate of poverty and instigate crimes. Overpopulation is usually in LEDC's where many remain illiterate or women are illiterate as there is no access to education provided for them. Hence, with no education, the fertility rate of the country because of no knowledge of using contraception and use of technology. Another reason for overpopulation in LEDC's is due to children being asset to poor families to provide labor especially farming. Hence these children remain illiterate and this again, doesn't increase economic growth because the next generation still remains with no skills and there won't be further industrialization and economic growth. Another reason for overpopulation is also because many countries it is a tradition for rural areas to have large quantities. Therefore LEDC's which are populated with government's who provide little or no support on health and education, financial and political support and do not have anti-natalist polices and family planning goods provision might suffer severe poverty.
Many LEDC's are in debt and poverty is partly because of to policies of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Indebtedness is the 'the amount that is owed; thus amount of an entity's (individual, firm, or government's) financial obligations to creditors.' LEDC's ending up suffering severe poverty due to massive debt they had. For e.g. From 1970, LEDC's debt was $US68 billion while in 2000 it reached up to $US2trillion which is an increase of over 3000%. This all had originally been caused by the oil crises. This happened when the price of oil increased rapidly due to the realization from the OPEC that oil was becoming scarce and this caused supply shocks around the world. This resulted in a massive increase in revenues for the OPEC and for other oil producing nations which flowed into commercial banks in development countries. This increased in loanable funds and this accused a recession due to the supply-side shock of increased oil prices and the 'Bretton Woods system' of fixed exchange rates were broken down hence countries were free to set exchange rates. Hence with low investment demand and increase in loanable funds, there was low demand for loans in developed countries so Commercial banks looked for an alternative which is LEDC's with low risk to not go bankrupt and the LEDC's did borrow because interest rates were low due to high inflation and also to stimulate demand in the country. So the debt grew due to increase in the compound interest for developing countries massively and when oil prices rose again, it interest rates increased in the US and other MEDC's due to deflationary policies with high inflation. This resulted in poverty for LEDC's because it was a barrier to growth for them, so instead of spending on infrastructure, health and education, investments and technology, they had to pay for debts instead. Also the fall in commodity prices had hurt the exports in many LEDC's had to go into recession and it was hard to pay for there loans. This caused poverty because the foreign loans were beyond the country's capacity to service the debt. Instead of increasing poverty, the large proportion of loans were taken by the governments for military unnecessarily as there might no haven't even been useful as there wasn't war and people were living but they were struggling because they were starving. Governments, instead on focusing on economic growth, spend all their revenue on debt instead of roads, infrastructure, health care and education. For e.g. Africa spends 4 times more on debts than on education. Also due to high being, 'bad borrowers' and unable to pay debts to Commercial Bank, instead of spending on people who suffer poverty, they tend to have more debts by borrowing from the IMF with high interest rates. This makes the country suffer in a poverty and debt trap as they can't even educate the less fortunate in their country.
Also to do this debts, the IMF and World-Bank causes poverty by having structural adjustment policies which means that the nations that owe them money, have to cut on social expenditure as health and education in order to pay loans. They also are tied to opening up their economies and being primarily commodity exporters in such a way that the poor countries have found themselves racing to the bottom nation and compete against others to provide lower standards, reduced wages and cheaper resources to corporation and richer nations. This means that the GNP per capita will keep decreasing and hence, again many people's income is below the amount needed to live. This is the form of globalization. Also there is a neglect of domestic savings as a source of development finance. There is also an escalation of export-orientated resource extraction to generate hard currency for debt servicing, so again there is less income. Debt is a major cause to poverty and example is Niger, the poorest country in the world, has a debt burden in reference to GNP of 88% and the population in which suffers poverty is 92% of the population. Due to debt, three times more money is paid on international debt than on health and education. The amount of poverty is so severe that there are 3 million children dying of curable diseases every year and the illiteracy rate is so high that the hope for economic growth and skilled labor is very slight hence, there isn't foreign investment to stimulate economic growth and the country remains in a poverty trap.
Corruption lastly is a huge problem in many LEDC's in which causes poverty. This is when there is lack of democracy and poor governance. This is when government uses tax funds for themselves and keeps the money in offshore banks. Corruption causes poverty as it discourages economic growth and therefore there is less FDI for LEDC's. Also since there is a lot of bribery, the poor suffers a lot more because they can't afford goods and services just like a 'regressive tax'. So goods and services arnet' provided with good standards for the people and hence they suffer poverty as they cant' afford goods ns services. Also there is more poverty as the government also spends less on health and education and without access to health, there is more diseases and with less education, less income and causes to suffer more poverty and can't spend money to cure disease.
So basically:
- Increase corruption: reduction on economic growth and increase income inequality cause more poverty. This is because there is less FDI and more bribery, hence the less fortunate is hit hard and they suffer poverty.
- Increase corruption: reduces governance capacity and increases poverty. This is because if governments spend less on health and education and on infrastructure there will be fewer jobs provided and less skilled people hence national income will decrease as there will be unemployment and an increase in poverty.
Overall, corruption causes more poverty because of poor governance and also the government stimulates more income inequality due to bribery and less GNP per capita as there is less education to provide skills and infrastructure to provide jobs to those unemployed.
Above, is all cause of poverty which are 'generic' form of causes of poverty and also a few 'case'. Poverty can also be explained by the individual due to less amount of education and hence there is less skills and therefore they are unemployed or have to go for jobs will less wages. Poverty could also be caused individually by race, such as ethnicity as Myanmar doesn't accept people who are Mon and Karreni by ethnicity. Also by sex, women could suffer more if the country is sexist and provides higher income for men than for women such as some countries in East Asia such as 'Afghanistan' wouldn't provide sufficient jobs for women at all. Hence they suffer poverty because if they don't marry, there wouldn't have enough jobs to work for as most women are expected to live behind lock doors. Health and intelligence can also affect poverty such as a handicap that doesn't have legs might not be able to farm or so and hence they suffer poverty as they don't' have enough education to work for another job. Also those who suffer aids in the family might not be capable physically of providing income for the family due to health conditions. Aids a major problem in this world, especially LEDC's and it keeps on spreading so more and more people suffer poverty due to aids too.
As a conclusion, there are many causes of poverty, even those which are not mentioned above and many can't escape suffering poverty as they are stuck in the poverty trap. This because with low income, there is low investment because of low consumption and hence, the cycle keeps rotating and it makes it hard to get out of the poverty trap. As we can see many of the reasons for poverty is both caused by local governments, MEDC's from the past (colonization, exploitation, debt) and also even IMF and Commercial Banks. Poverty is also caused by the government unable to stable the demographic state of the country such as birth rates, death rates, life expectancy and infant mortality due to less access to education and also access to health and safe water.

Verified by Toppr
Main causes of poverty in INDIA are-
(i) Heavy pressure of population: Population has been rising in India at a rapid speed.
(ii) Unemployment and under employment: Due to continuous rise in population, there is chronic unemployment and under employment in India. There is educated unemployment and disguised unemployment. Poverty is just the reflection of unemployment.
(iii) Capital Deficiency: Shortage of capital creates hurdles in development.
(iv) Under-developed economy: The Indian economy is under developed due to low rate of growth. It is the main cause of poverty.
(v) Increase in Price: The steep rise in prices has affected the poor badly. They have become more poor.
(vi) Net National Income: The net national income is quite low as compared to size of population. Low per capita income proves its poverty.
(vii) Rural Economy: The Indian economy is the rural economy. Indian agriculture is backward. It has great pressure of population. Income in agriculture is low and disguised unemployment is more in agriculture.
(viii) Lack of Skilled Labour: In India, unskilled labor is in abundant supply but skilled labor is less due to insufficient industrial education and training.
(ix) Deficiency of efficient Entrepreneurs: For industrial development, able and efficient entrepreneurs are needed. In India, there is shortage of efficient entrepreneurs. Less industrial development is a major cause of poverty.
(x) Lack of proper Industrialisation: Industrially, India is a backward state. 3% of total working population is engaged in industry. So industrial backwardness is major cause of poverty.
(xi) Low rate of growth: So compared to the population, the per capita growth rate of the economy has been very low. It is the main cause of poverty.
(xii) Outdated Social institutions: The social structure of our country is full of outdated traditions and customs like caste system, laws of inheritance and succession. These hamper the growth of economy.
(xiii) Improper use of Natural Resources:
India has large natural resources like iron, coal, manganese, mica etc. It has perennial flowing rivers that can generate hydro electricity. Man power is abundant. But these sources are not put in proper use.
(xiv) Lack of Infrastructure: The means of transport and communication have not been properly developed. Road transport is inadequate and the railway is quite less. Due to the lack of proper development of road and rail transport, agricultural marketing is defective. Industries do not get power supply and raw materials in time and finished goods are not properly marketed.

What is Poverty?
Poverty is a complex problem. There are many aspects to it, and it has many causes. The most widely used poverty definition focuses on economic poverty. This definition measures poverty by the amount of money a person earns and establishes poverty rates for communities and countries based on income inequality and financially drawn poverty lines.
In this way, poverty becomes relative. The poverty threshold for a family of four in the United States is an income just over $26,000 a year. For a family of four living in absolute poverty in a low-income country, that amount of money is more than 36 times what they are forced to survive on each year.
Many families living in the world’s poorest countries must meet their basic needs with an income of less than $1.90 a day. Nearly 10 percent of the world's population live in this type of extreme poverty.
Understanding poverty strictly as economic inequality and measuring it with relative poverty thresholds makes it difficult to view poverty as more than unemployment, poor living standards, and a low income. But poverty encompasses more than this.
A proper definition of poverty must address the many different types of poverty and acknowledge that poverty is hunger and lack of shelter, illiteracy and not having access to school, being sick and unable to see a doctor, fearing for the future, living one day at a time and feeling completely powerless and trapped by things beyond one's control.

What Causes Poverty?
While the causes of poverty may seem as multi-faceted as a diamond, they can be grouped into two primary categories—culture and believing the lie of worthlessness.
The Cultural Cause of Poverty
Cultures have internal and external elements that contribute to the existence of poverty. Some of these conditions are tangible and external, like:
Lack of shelter
Limited access to clean water resources
Food insecurity
Physical disabilities
Lack of access to health care
Unemployment
Absence of social services
Gender discrimination
Poor infrastructure
Government corruption
Environmental circumstances such as natural disasters, droughts, limited resources or depletion of natural resources
Other elements are intangible and internal—knowledge, aspiration, diligence, confidence, leadership styles, participatory governance, social capital, values, and peace, to name a few.
Culture is the framework that creates an atmosphere that accommodates poverty or prevents it from taking root.
When society provides a school or educational opportunities, that is a cultural asset. It addresses the community's lack of education by providing a means to teach literacy and knowledge. This enables individual learning and betterment and provides greater chances of future employment. Internal factors are then impacted as children and families become optimistic about the future.
When children don't have a safe place to play, they are more vulnerable to being abused or getting caught up in gangs and drugs. When a culture provides something as simple as a safe playground , children have a place to escape from those who could harm them. The children then feel valued and protected and begin to experience the importance of healthy socialization with other children.
Consider a family without access to clean drinking water. They walk miles every day to collect water and the water they collect is unsafe to drink. Such water can transmit illnesses, including cholera, typhoid, diarrhea, dysentery and even polio. When a culture provides access to clean filtered water, it provides safety from water-borne illness. When a child doesn’t need to walk miles for water, he or she also has time for educational and family opportunities. Safe water impacts more than just physical health.
And consider a child who grows up in a garbage dump. She is surrounded by waste and chaos. This conveys the message, “you are trash.” The external environment and unhealthy living conditions are part of this child's poverty, but the message the environment communicates is just as devastating and can be a reason why the child remains in poverty.
Individually, these internal and external elements are often used as justifications to explain poverty and why a person, family or community is poor. Developing strategies to address these elements or conditions is helpful and provides a way to address the various root causes of poverty.
The Lie of Worthlessness Causes Poverty
Poor people often believe they are failures. And this message of oppression and hopelessness affects their ability to hope for a better future. Their grandfathers lived in poverty. Their fathers lived in poverty. The cycle continues with them and will continue to the next generation as well.
When people believe this lie of poverty, that they are worthless because of their circumstances, they become victims. They lose hope, and without hope, it’s difficult to dream of a better way and almost impossible to be an agent for positive change.
When people in poverty have a low view of themselves and no hope for the future, their relationships are affected. They have a low regard for other people and don't believe that their relationships will get better.
Children are particularly vulnerable to this lie. When poverty surrounds them, they believe they have no value or purpose.
The solution is introducing a voice that transforms the worthless and hopeless mindset into a message of truth: “I matter. I have worth. Things can get better.”
This change in mindset is easiest when it is done early in a person’s emotional development. Therefore, it is best done with a child. That way, the lie can't take shape and influence the child’s identity. The voice of truth can be strong and influential in the life of a little child. Freedom from poverty is possible.
"Children are likely to live up to what you believe of them." — Lady Bird Johnson, Former First Lady of the United States
Untangling the Causes of Poverty
Regardless of how poverty is measured our holistic child development model addresses the external factors of poverty culture by helping communities and families gain access to clean water sources, create positive and healthy living environments, learn income-generation skills, build better infrastructure and take advantage of educational opportunities.
But our approach to fighting child poverty doesn’t stop with these external factors. It places great emphasis on the internal, and eternal, message of truth, that every person matters.
Through our Child Sponsorship Program we provide holistic care to address all the effects poverty has on children. It's holistic care that helps poor children fully develop and become responsible and fulfilled adults. Holistic care means whole-life care. It's long-term, and it's comprehensive. It means we provide opportunities that encourage healthy spiritual, physical, social and economic development.
We build self-esteem and self-respect, to fight the lie of worthlessness, and we help meet the physical and external needs of impoverished families with initiatives to help babies and mothers in poverty, develop future leaders and meet critical needs such as medical emergencies and recovery after a natural disaster.
According to a poll of top development economists who specialize in analyzing development programs, child sponsorship is the most effective long-term development intervention for helping the poor because it addresses the external and internal causes of poverty.

Alright, so I've got this question: "What leads to poverty?" It seems pretty broad, but I'll try to break it down. First, I need to understand what poverty is. Poverty is when people don't have enough resources to meet their basic needs like food, shelter, and clothing. It's a complex issue that can be looked at from different angles.

I think poverty can be caused by a mix of individual, societal, and global factors. Let's start with individual factors. One big thing is lack of education. If someone doesn't have access to education, they might not have the skills needed for good jobs, which can lead to poverty. Also, poor health can be a cause; if someone is sick or has a disability, they might not be able to work or their medical expenses could be really high.

Family circumstances also play a role. Growing up in a poor family can limit opportunities because of insufficient resources for education, nutrition, and healthcare. This can create a cycle of poverty that's hard to break.

Moving on to societal factors, unemployment is a big one. If there aren't enough jobs available, people struggle to make ends meet. Even if jobs are available, they might not pay enough, leading to what's called "working poverty." Minimum wage jobs often don't provide enough income to cover living expenses.

Social inequalities also contribute to poverty. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, or other factors can limit people's opportunities in education and employment. For example, certain groups might face bias in hiring processes or be steered towards lower-paying jobs.

Access to resources is another important aspect. In some areas, people might not have access to clean water, nutritious food, or reliable transportation, which can hinder their ability to improve their situation.

Looking at global factors, economic policies can have a significant impact. For instance, trade policies that favor wealthy nations over developing ones can stunt economic growth in poorer countries, keeping their populations in poverty.

Conflict and instability are also major causes. War-torn regions often suffer from destroyed infrastructure, displacement of populations, and disruption of economies, all of which can lead to poverty.

Lastly, climate change is emerging as a significant factor. Natural disasters and environmental degradation can devastate communities, particularly in vulnerable areas, leading to loss of homes, crops, and livelihoods.

I think it's important to note that these factors are interconnected and often reinforce each other. For example, a lack of education can lead to poor health choices, which in turn can limit employment opportunities.

To get a better understanding, maybe I should look up some statistics or studies on poverty. Maybe see what experts say about the main causes.

## Final Solution
Poverty is a multifaceted issue influenced by a combination of individual, societal, and global factors. Understanding these causes is crucial for developing effective strategies to alleviate poverty.

### Individual Factors

1. **Lack of Education**: Without access to education, individuals may lack the skills needed for higher-paying jobs, perpetuating a cycle of poverty.
   
2. **Poor Health**: Illness or disabilities can prevent people from working or increase their medical expenses, making it difficult to escape poverty.

3. **Family Circumstances**: Growing up in a poor family can limit access to essential resources like education and healthcare, making it harder to break the cycle of poverty.

### Societal Factors

1. **Unemployment and Underemployment**: Insufficient job opportunities or low-wage jobs can leave individuals and families unable to meet their basic needs.

2. **Social Inequalities and Discrimination**: Bias based on race, gender, sexuality, or other factors can limit access to education and employment opportunities.

3. **Access to Resources**: Limited access to clean water, nutritious food, and reliable transportation can hinder individuals' ability to improve their circumstances.

### Global Factors

1. **Economic Policies**: Trade policies that favor wealthy nations can stifle economic growth in poorer countries, keeping their populations in poverty.

2. **Conflict and Instability**: Wars and conflicts lead to destroyed infrastructure, displacement, and economic disruption, all of which contribute to poverty.

3. **Climate Change**: Natural disasters and environmental degradation can devastate communities, particularly in vulnerable areas, leading to loss of homes, crops, and livelihoods.

### Interconnectedness of Causes

It's essential to recognize that these factors are interrelated and often reinforce each other. For example, a lack of education can lead to poor health choices, which in turn can limit employment opportunities. Similarly, global factors like economic policies and climate change can exacerbate local issues like unemployment and access to resources.

### Conclusion

Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive approach that tackles these interconnected causes at multiple levels. By investing in education, promoting equality, creating就业机会, and implementing fair economic policies, societies can work towards reducing poverty and improving the lives of their citizens.
