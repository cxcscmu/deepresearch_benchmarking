I'm trying to figure out whether online learning is better than face-to-face learning. Hmm, this seems like a pretty broad question, and I think it depends on various factors. I need to consider different aspects of both methods to make a comparison.

First, I should probably understand what online learning and face-to-face learning entail. Online learning is when courses are delivered over the internet, and students can access materials and interact with instructors and peers remotely. Face-to-face learning, on the other hand, is the traditional classroom setting where everyone meets in person.

I think I need to look into studies or research that compare the effectiveness of these two methods. Maybe there are some key metrics like student performance, engagement, and satisfaction that can help me make a judgment.

Let me start by searching for some information on this topic.

Online Learning vs. Face-to- Face Learning
We all know higher education is the key to success. In today’s time, one must have some form of education in order to prosper in the work force. There are many options for higher learning. Students should decide which option would best fit their schedules. Face-to-face learning grants more organization and more “hands on” instruction.
To begin with, face-to-face learning promotes easier learning through “hands on” instruction. Face-to-face learning allows students to get a better understanding by asking questions. According to the authors Delfino and Persico, face-to-face courses appear to be less convenient but a lot easier. (Delfino) The article discusses the success of an online and face-to-face …show more content…
Online courses lack in the area of physical communication. Communication is virtually done through emails or discussion board assignments; often times this can be a disadvantage to students who need a quick response from their instructor. One implication for face-to-face instructors is the need to continually maintain free-flowing dialog with the students to enhance learning. (Hauser)
Face-to-face courses allows the student to get an understanding right away and reduces possible stress. Online learning can be viewed as a complex system of knowledge presentation that occurs in an environment minus the physical instructor. (Hauser)
On the other hand, online courses seem to work better for others. Over a five year span, over fifty percent of students preferred to repeat the online experience. (Delfino) Students that are more organized and have less time to actually attend class due a job or children, find that online learning is the best option. Horspol researched how online and face-to-face courses differ in many aspects of student behavior. He studied motives for choosing the online format, communication and interactivity, and effort put into work. (Horspool) He observed students’ success in an online class based on grades and time used to complete assignments. Students worked through Blackboard and completed modules at their own time schedule and pace. …show more content…
Online learning has transformed tremendously over the years, from paper-based to electronic materials with online tutorial support taking over. (Richardson) Determining which type of learning is best, depends on the student. Students that are well-organized, responsible, and dedicated to their education prove to be most successful in online learning. Online learning is best for those who need to keep their schedule flexible. An alternate option for students would be Hybrid classes or blended learning. These courses are a mix of face-to-face and online learning that requires a certain amount of face-to-face class meetings paired with online course work. This is a great option for first-time online students and those that want a taste of what online learning is

Have you ever seen an advertisement on television that promotes acquiring a degree online? The advertisements make it sound easy and convenient to get a two-year, or even a four-year degree, for little of nothing, in a short amount of time, and big-time businesses will be begging you to work for them. However, is acquiring a degree online better than sitting in a classroom with a real-life professor? Do you receive more of a quality education in a classroom, face-to-face, or behind a computer screen?

Face-to-Face learning is better than online learning because of the interactions and examples of face to face learning will benefit the learner the most. One of the most beneficial means of physically being in a classroom is the response time that a person receives from an actual person, such as a professor, versus an online class instructor. During face to face learning, a person’s questions will get an immediate answer whereas online learning means waiting for a response. Studies show that immediate and efficient feedback response time is crucial to effective learning. In a classroom environment, you may also have the advantage of working in small groups where you can collaborate on difficult topics and receive immediate feedback from you peer groups as well.
Sometimes, discussing issues or problems with your instructor in person is a lot easier than typing it out or trying to explain it in face-time online.
Efficient and effective constructive feedback is imperative to proper learning environments, such as what a person would receive in an actual classroom. Attending classes in person also creates a disciplined, structured student.
In today’s society, it is crucial that students become more structured by attending scheduled classes. By abiding by a class schedule, this trains the student for “real world” situations, such as being on-time for a job interview or important business meetings. The online environment is usually more flexible as far as time constraints. A person does not have attend class at a specific time and can do household chores, take care of a baby, etc. Many people may see this as an advantage. (Lim, Doo Hun, Michael L. Morris). However, this is actually a disadvantage because it creates a carefree, lazy, and distractive environment. This type of climate cannot possibly properly prepare a person for a job, profession, or career. The online classroom is at an extreme disadvantage when trying to properly prepare a student for a structured, business-type atmosphere.
One of the best ways to make new friends and meet new people by socially interacting with them is in the classroom. Meeting new people is a great way to sharpen your social skills and where else better can a person do that but in the classroom. Socializing with others is a perfect way to make future job connections, acquire new friends, maybe meet your soulmate. Online learning depletes a person of these socializing opportunities. It even impairs them further. Socializing face-to-face is becoming a trait that is harder to find in employers today. With increased amounts of text messages, social media sites, and other less invasive ways of interacting with other people, employers are struggling to find employees that know how to interact face-to-face effectively. They are a dying breed as we speak. Collaborating with others offers several more benefits for a student to be successful in the real world instead of spending time behind a monitor at home.
A great way to learn how to interact with a superior is by being a student in an actual classroom environment. By interacting with your professor, this prepares a student how to effectively talk, respond, and “work for” a superior. Personalities sometimes do not mesh, they may even clash, but by learning how to deal with other personalities, this develops a more well-rounded individual socially speaking.
Trial and error in how you respond and/or get responses gets students ready for real world problems, such as how to properly talk to your boss, how to handle difficult situations with co-workers, maybe even how to settle differences with your spouse. (Smith, Nigel V). By learning how to answer to a superior, even though it may be a professor or professor’s assistant, interacting with different types of people as your superior trains a student to become a more successful individual later in life. The classroom also offers several opportunities for a student to learn kinesthetically, whereas the online classroom fails the student in this area.
Online learning obviously offers opportunities for visual learning, but it does not offer much else. The classroom offers so much more, such as hands-on trainings, visual and hearing enhanced learning, and other kinesthetic, or physical means, of acquiring information. By incorporating different learning styles, the success rate of learning highly increases. This creates a more successful learning environment for everyone. The online learning experience is very limited in capturing different learning styles and ultimately fails the student. The online classroom actually offers more opportunities to become distracted and stray away from better learning versus the physical classroom. Since the traditional way of learning has always been in a classroom, many people think that students become more distracted in this type of environment. (Bowen, William G., et al).
However, the opposite is true. By doing online learning from home, office, or in a public venue, students are increasingly more distracted by other people, family members, and cell phones.
Many classrooms limit students to being on their phones or laptops, therefore, decreasing the amount of distractions. Online learning actually increases the amount of distractions because most people access their online classrooms from home, their office or place of work, or in a public place such as a coffee shop. People with conditions such as ADHD or other learning disabilities are at even more of a disadvantage for a successful online learning experience.

Finally, not everyone is equipped with fast-connecting internet, wifi, or has data plans that support the online learning environment. Many people live in rural areas where high-speed internet service or wifi is not available. Data plans and internet plans can be expensive, so people that are on a strict budget tend to stray away from costly internet and phone data plans. Sometimes internet connections can be interrupted by bad weather and can cause problems with your online learning experience. You may even lose your work if there is a power outage or your internet connection is interrupted. If you have a deadline, this could be a very bad situation.
Face-to-face learning in an actual classroom is proven to be the better alternative when it comes to being a student. Despite our ever increasing use of technology, online learning fails to prepare a well-rounded student that is prepared for the real world. By increasing social interactions, becoming more structured in your schedule, and learning how to interact with authority figures, students are far more successful in their careers by accessing the traditional classroom option. However, as more and more online learning opportunities increase, face-to-face learning may fade away forever.

Facts: Is Online Learning As Good As Face-To-Face Learning?
Facts: Is Online Learning As Good As Face-To-Face Learning?
Blog » Tips for Online Students » Facts: Is Online Learning As Good As Face-To-Face Learning?
Online learning is increasingly popular nowadays, and this trend is here to stay. With more flexibility, self-directed study options, and access to the same instructors and teachers as traditional learning, it’s no surprise that online learning is popular. But is online learning as good as face to face learning? It may be — and may even be more effective in some cases!
What Is Online Learning?
Online learning can be any type of learning that takes place over the internet. This could be a supplemental course, a full degree program, or self study. More times than not, online learning is asynchronous, as students do not have to learn at the same time and place as their instructors are teaching.
What Is Face-To-Face Learning?
Face-to-face learning is the more traditional way of instruction, where students and teachers attend an in-person session at the same time. The instructor leads the class, and usually, students are passively learning.

Measuring Up: Online Learning vs Face-to-Face
1. Asynchronous Learning vs Synchronous Learning
One of the most significant differences between face-to-face learning and online learning is that face-to-face learning is synchronous, or done at the same time. All instructors and students/classmates are present in face-to-face learning.
With online learning, however, that is not necessary. Online instruction can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
2. Delivering Knowledge vs Facilitating Learning
In face-to-face classes, instructors are usually just delivering knowledge, and then assessing the understanding of that knowledge at a later date.
This is compared to online learning, where instructors are seen more as facilitators of learning — helping their students understand the material through provided online materials.
3. Teacher vs Child-Led Advancement
While both online and face-to-face learning can have components of both student-led and teacher-led curriculum, online study lends itself better to student-led advancement and learning. In online study, students can decide for themselves what they want to dig deeper on, and spend more time learning.
4. Discipline and Self Motivation
Some may say that it is harder to succeed in online education, and that is because you must be highly self-motivated and disciplined. In online learning, no one is keeping you on track — you must be your own motivator, time keeper, and disciplinarian.
5. Measuring Performance
In both face-to-face and online learning, instructors must have a way to measure performance. This is typically done by way of submitting assignments, administering tests, exams and quizzes, and creating points for participation. Participation and class ‘attendance’ is harder to measure in an online learning environment.

Key Differences Between Face-to-Face vs Online Instruction
There are so many important differences between face-to-face learning and online learning. Here are just a few:
Benefits of Face-to-Face Learning
Face-to-face learning has been the standard way of instruction for centuries. While online instruction is becoming increasingly popular, in-person study may still be the best option for some people. With face-to-face learning, instructors are better able to gauge understanding and interest of students, and it is easier to generate group excitement about a subject. It is also easier to hold students accountable.
6 Reasons Why Online Learning is More Effective
Is online learning as good as face-to-face learning? It may be even better.
1. Students Learn More
Online courses give students full control over what they are learning, so students are able to work at their own speed. They are able to work quickly through areas they understand, and spend more time on areas they do not.
2. Higher Retention Rates
Many studies have shown that retention rates for online students are much higher than for traditional, in-person students. Online learning increases access and makes it more likely that a student can finish a course or program when physical limitations are removed.

3. Lower Time Investment
In online learning, students save a ton of time by not having to commute to class. There is also a need by face-to-face instructors to fill the allotted course time, when students could be using that time to work on something more valuable for their learning. In online learning, students are spending less time overall, and making that time towards their education count.
4. Frequent Assessments Reduce Distractions
In a classroom setting there are many distractions, but at home, those same distractions are removed. Online, students’ disruptive behavior is no longer a factor in classroom culture, and there is no need to hold up the lesson for just one student. In addition, many online courses make use of more frequent ‘knowledge checks’ or mini quizzes which can keep students on track.
5. It’s the Green Way to Study
Online learning not only cuts back on paper and electricity use, but also on carbon emissions commuting to a campus. Online courses use 90% less energy and have 85% fewer carbon emissions than traditional, face-to-face classes.
6. Tracking Learning Patterns
Online learning helps educators and instructional designers track learning in ways that face-to-face learning cannot do. Through analytical tools, educators and researchers can see what really works and what doesn’t, and use that information to inform future curriculum and instruction design.
So, you want to know is online learning as good as face to face learning? Just check the facts listed, and we think you’ll find that the answer is… Absolutely!

Face to Face Vs. Online Learning? Which is Better?
Face To Face Vs. Online Learning? Which Is Better?
It isn’t that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework, syllabus, examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario, online education today is the need of the hour. However, one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions, their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries, there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this, but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact, it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees. The traditional schools charge hefty amounts unreasonably and with no option left, the parents who can afford the fee have to unwillingly or willingly pay for the benefit of their children. For the unfortunate children, there is no other option but to opt for the homeschooling.
In homeschooling, it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children, parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children, online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education, the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies. Online high school education has emerged out to be a very suitable option for all the homeschooled children. Homeschooling has its own advantages and disadvantages. It`s true that a student is exposed to learning but at the same time parents who do not specialize in all the subjects are unable to render necessary information of respective subjects. So ultimately, the child is at the losing end. Whereas in online education, every child is under the guidance of teachers and they make sure that each and every student enrolled with the school prospers and shines in the long run. For instance, in FTA or Forest Trail Academy, there`s a separate login page for the students as well as the parents. Guardians can at any time avail the performance report of their child from the school staff. The school which is today one of the best online high school imparts online education to students from all over the world.
In order to back this claim of putting the online education at the higher level than traditional education, there are ample reasons to dignify this point. Let`s go through them in brief:
Convenience – in online education you do not have to commute to your school every day. Don’t have to rush yourself in the overcrowded buses, you don’t have to wake up early in the morning and get ready with those muddy eyes for the school and the biggest point you save considerable amount at the end of each year. The perks of online education when it comes to convenience are endless.
Flexibility – online education means you have the liberty to decide and set up your own study hours. The flexibility in the nature of these online schools has made it easy for the students to understand that every student who comes under the shelf of it. A student gets to listen to his lecture tutorial at any time of the day. He can jot down the notes from the lecture and report if any issue occurs in grasping the matter.
Self-discipline – online education teaches an individual the importance of discipline. When you are studying online, you have to be self-motivated and disciplined to complete all your coursework before the deadlines. To adhere to these deadlines, you will have to be very disciplined and focussed. Eventually, this self-motivation and discipline get in your personality and it stays for the rest of life. At the end of the day, discipline is the key to success in online education. In fact, in any field, you will have to be disciplined so as to thrive in the long run.
IF YOU ARE A HOME SCHOOLED STUDENT, GET ENROLLED IN FOREST TRAIL ACADEMY TODAY
Forest Trail Academy is one of the most prestigious online homeschools today. The school is though based in the USA but it imparts education to students across the world via the internet. The school is approved as a private institution with the Florida Department of Education. It is a fully accredited school that renders education to children from Kindergarten till 12th grade. Also, note that it`s an accredited school which gives online high school diplomas and not graduate degrees.
Students who are enrolled in the school are exposed to an enhanced conductive open learning environment where they can learn under best mentors. The school staffs, on the other hand, make sure that every student is given an individualized attention which however also lacks in a traditional school. Since every student has his own pace of learning, the teachers do not impose any strict restrictions or deadlines on these students. Such an approach of the school towards a student creates favorable condition for the students.
Also, the school staff especially the teachers keep a close watch on the performance of every student. If a student lags or is facing some issues which are preventing him from performing to his fullest potential, all such endeavors are undertaken to resolve the queries of such students. Every student has a unique Id and password on the school`s login page, where he/she can possibly bring all their queries to the forefront.

Alright, I've got some information from these documents. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, Doc 1 is from Cram.com and it's an essay comparing online learning to face-to-face learning. The author seems to argue that face-to-face learning is better because it offers immediate feedback, better social interaction, and prepares students for a structured environment. They also mention that online learning can be distracting and may not suit everyone, especially those with limited internet access.

Doc 2 is from UK Essays and it's another essay on the same topic. This one also favors face-to-face learning, emphasizing the importance of immediate feedback, structured schedules, and social interactions. The author believes that online learning fails to prepare students for real-world situations that require face-to-face communication and interaction with superiors.

Doc 3 appears to be the same essay as Doc 2 but from a different website, Essay Company. So, same content, different platform.

Doc 4 is from UoPeople, which seems to be an online university. Their blog post argues that online learning can be as good as, or even better than, face-to-face learning. They highlight benefits such as asynchronous learning, student-led advancement, higher retention rates, and environmental advantages. They also mention that online learning requires more self-discipline and motivation, which can be seen as a pro or con depending on the perspective.

Lastly, Doc 5 is from Forest Trail Academy, an online school. Their perspective naturally leans towards online learning being better due to convenience, flexibility, and the development of self-discipline in students. They also mention that online learning can be more affordable and accessible, especially for homeschoolers.

So, from these documents, I see two main viewpoints:

1. Face-to-face learning is better because it provides immediate feedback, better social interaction, and prepares students for real-world scenarios that require in-person communication.

2. Online learning is better or at least as good as face-to-face learning because it offers flexibility, student-led pacing, higher retention rates, and is more environmentally friendly. It also develops self-discipline and is more accessible for many students.

I need to consider both sides and see which one holds more weight or if there's a middle ground.

First, let's look at feedback. In face-to-face settings, feedback is immediate, which can be crucial for learning. Students can ask questions on the spot and get answers right away. In online learning, feedback might be delayed unless it's a live session. However, some online platforms have features like实时聊天或讨论论坛，可以提供及时的反馈。所以，这可能取决于在线课程的设计。

再来看社交互动。面对面的学习确实提供了更多的社交机会，学生可以与同学和老师建立更紧密的关系。这对于某些人来说是非常重要的，尤其是对于那些需要通过社交来增强学习动力的人来说。然而，在线学习并不完全缺乏社交，现在很多在线平台都有讨论区、小组项目和视频会议等功能，让学生们可以进行互动。虽然可能不如面对面的交流那么自然，但仍然可以建立起一定的社交联系。

结构化环境也是面对面学习的一个优势。在传统的课堂中，有固定的上课时间表，这有助于培养学生的时间管理和纪律性。而在线学习通常更加灵活，学生可以根据自己的时间安排学习，这可能会导致一些学生缺乏自律，从而影响学习效果。但是，对于那些能够自我管理的人来说，灵活性反而是一个优点，因为他们可以更好地平衡学习和其他责任。

另一方面，在线学习提供了更大的便利性。学生不需要通勤，可以在任何有互联网连接的地方学习，这特别适合那些生活在偏远地区或者有工作和家庭责任的人。此外，在线学习往往成本更低，因为没有了物理教室的维护费用和通勤成本。

再来看看文档4中提到的，在线学习可能更有效率，因为学生可以按照自己的速度学习，花更多时间在他们不理解的概念上，而在熟悉的概念上则可以加快进度。这种个性化的学习路径可能比传统课堂上的统一教学更有效。

文档5提到在线学习有助于培养自控力和自律，这些都是成功的重要品质。通过在线学习，学生必须学会如何管理自己的时间，如何保持专注，以及如何在没有外部监督的情况下完成任务。

不过，我也注意到这些文档可能有一定的偏见。文档1和2来自学术写作网站，可能是学生的作业，可能没有全面考虑在线学习的优势。文档4和5来自在线教育机构，可能有推广在线学习的倾向。因此，我需要客观地评估这些观点。

也许我可以找一些更中立的研究来帮助我做出判断。比如，有没有研究比较了在线学习和面对面学习的效果？

让我再进行一次搜索。

Research review: Online versus face-to-face learning outcomes
Posted on December 5, 2017 by Voxy

In a comprehensive investigation of online and traditional face-to-face learning outcomes, the U.S. Department of Education released one of the first major reports to take a close look at the effectiveness of each approach. The analysis revealed that, on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. While this is certainly good news for online learning, the results are not as clear-cut as they may seem. To help break it down, we’re sharing summaries of three key findings from the study.
1. “Few rigorous research studies of the effectiveness of online learning for K–12 students have been published.”
One of the reasons it’s so difficult to measure the efficacy of online learning is that so few people are measuring it in the first place! Between 1994 and 2006, there were “no experimental or controlled quasi-experimental studies comparing the learning effects of online versus face-to-face instruction for K–12 students that provide sufficient data to compute an effect size,” and there were only five published between 2006 and 2008. Voxy’s strong commitment to research aims to move the needle on this issue and promote the advancement of research into online and blended learning outcomes to continue improving our approach to online learning.
2. “Students who took all or part of their class online performed better, on average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face instruction.”
While it’s impossible to know for sure, the difference in learning outcomes in this case was likely the result of a greater amount of total time spent studying in the online setting, whereas in traditional face-to-face instruction—such as a classroom—total time spent is limited to the in-person experience.
3. “Most of the variations in the way in which different studies implemented online learning did not affect student learning outcomes significantly.”
Analysts looked at 13 different types of online learning applications, and found that only two had a significant impact on outcomes: (1) The total time spent studying; and (2) blended learning, or using face-to-face instruction in combination with online learning. This is a crucial finding because it highlights the importance of time on task and blended learning, and shows that smaller differences in the application of online learning may ultimately not play as significant of a role in learning outcomes.

Face-to-Face Learning vs. Online Learning: Which Is Better?
Face-to-Face Learning vs. Online Learning: Which Is Better?
Posted by Sterling Staff on Dec 7, 2014 11:37:00 PM
This posting was written by Sterling Academy faculty member Dr. James Croasmun.
You may have been engaged in some debate as to whether an online education is as good as an education acquired in a classroom.  Fortunately, there have been a significant number of research studies done to give us objective knowledge regarding this debate.
Many studies have been conducted which examine the effectiveness of online learning versus traditional face-to-face (F2F) courses. One such meta-analysis of these studies was conducted by Karen Swan. The conclusion as stated by Swan (2003) was, “…it is clear that when compared using gross measures of learning effectiveness, students learn as much if not more from online courses as they do in traditional higher education courses.”
A sample of her findings include:
A blind review process comparing students’ performances enrolled in an online graduate course with that of the same version of the course taught F2F showed no significant differences.
A study comparing mid-term scores between online and F2F students at Stevens Institute of Technology found little or no differences in student outcomes.
Two studies showed equivalent or increased performance of nurses in the field who graduated from online learning programs.
Three studies looked at faculty perceptions of student learning  as a measure of learning effectiveness in online courses. The vast majority of instructors felt that student learning outcomes were comparable or better than those in F2F courses.
Thomas L. Russell (1999) compared student outcomes in online and F2F by examining 355 studies the result of which show no significant differences in student outcomes. Additional information on his work can be found at http://www.nosignificantdifference.org/
While the delivery mode for learning materials isn’t important as we think (Clark, 1983) in achieving learning outcomes, there are other factors which affect the success of a course. These include:
How students interact with course interfaces/menus. Bad or confusing course structures can cause a decrease in learning.
Increased clarity in the course design, goals, and expectations lead to better learning.
Frequent assessments and timely feedback from instructors supports learning.
The quality and quantity of interactions between students and instructors is tied to student learning.
John Hattie (2008) compiled over 800 studies on learning and found that providing formative evaluation, teaching clarity, feedback, teacher-student relationships, spaced vs. mass practice, teaching strategies, mastery learning, and worked examples all significantly affected student achievement.
To summarize, the instructional design of a course, the relationships between instructors and students, and the type and frequency of feedback to the students are paramount to student learning.

Abstract:-This study was conducted to understand students’perceptions of the effectiveness of online and face-to-face
learning for a graduate course. 93 Phd students who took the course of Planning And Assessment In Education on the
basis of face-to-face learning and 76 Phd students who took the same course on online basis at Anadolu University in
Turkey were requested to state their views about the course in terms of 7 different points by marking the options of 7
statements prepared for this purpose. The findings revealed that the teaching method they followed was effective with
the rates ranging from 50,6% to 72% for face-to-face students and from 45% to 65% for online students. The
responses given to three statements revealed that face-to-face learning was significantly more effective than online
learning, and the responses given to one statement showed that the latter was significantly more effective than the
former (p<.05). For the other three statements, there were no significant differences between effecitivenes of the two
teaching methods. The online learners (online 1 students) who held the discussions in WebCT chat rooms and took
technical support via e-mail and those (online 2 students) who took such services in Macromedia Breeze Virtual
Classes agreed, with the rates ranging from 38,2% to 71%, that the teaching method they followed was effective. The
relationships between the perceptions of the online learners and the ways they used the services stated above were not
significant (p>.05).

Have you ever seen an advertisement on television that promotes acquiring a degree online? The advertisements make it sound easy and convenient to get a two-year, or even a four-year degree, for little of nothing, in a short amount of time, and big-time businesses will be begging you to work for them. However, is acquiring a degree online better than sitting in a classroom with a real-life professor? Do you receive more of a quality education in a classroom, face-to-face, or behind a computer screen?

Face-to-Face learning is better than online learning because of the interactions and examples of face to face learning will benefit the learner the most. One of the most beneficial means of physically being in a classroom is the response time that a person receives from an actual person, such as a professor, versus an online class instructor. During face to face learning, a person’s questions will get an immediate answer whereas online learning means waiting for a response. Studies show that immediate and efficient feedback response time is crucial to effective learning. In a classroom environment, you may also have the advantage of working in small groups where you can collaborate on difficult topics and receive immediate feedback from you peer groups as well.
Sometimes, discussing issues or problems with your instructor in person is a lot easier than typing it out or trying to explain it in face-time online.
Efficient and effective constructive feedback is imperative to proper learning environments, such as what a person would receive in an actual classroom. Attending classes in person also creates a disciplined, structured student.
In today’s society, it is crucial that students become more structured by attending scheduled classes. By abiding by a class schedule, this trains the student for “real world” situations, such as being on-time for a job interview or important business meetings. The online environment is usually more flexible as far as time constraints. A person does not have attend class at a specific time and can do household chores, take care of a baby, etc. Many people may see this as an advantage. (Lim, Doo Hun, Michael L. Morris). However, this is actually a disadvantage because it creates a carefree, lazy, and distractive environment. This type of climate cannot possibly properly prepare a person for a job, profession, or career. The online classroom is at an extreme disadvantage when trying to properly prepare a student for a structured, business-type atmosphere.
One of the best ways to make new friends and meet new people by socially interacting with them is in the classroom. Meeting new people is a great way to sharpen your social skills and where else better can a person do that but in the classroom. Socializing with others is a perfect way to make future job connections, acquire new friends, maybe meet your soulmate. Online learning depletes a person of these socializing opportunities. It even impairs them further. Socializing face-to-face is becoming a trait that is harder to find in employers today. With increased amounts of text messages, social media sites, and other less invasive ways of interacting with other people, employers are struggling to find employees that know how to interact face-to-face effectively. They are a dying breed as we speak. Collaborating with others offers several more benefits for a student to be successful in the real world instead of spending time behind a monitor at home.
A great way to learn how to interact with a superior is by being a student in an actual classroom environment. By interacting with your professor, this prepares a student how to effectively talk, respond, and “work for” a superior. Personalities sometimes do not mesh, they may even clash, but by learning how to deal with other personalities, this develops a more well-rounded individual socially speaking.
Trial and error in how you respond and/or get responses gets students ready for real world problems, such as how to properly talk to your boss, how to handle difficult situations with co-workers, maybe even how to settle differences with your spouse. (Smith, Nigel V). By learning how to answer to a superior, even though it may be a professor or professor’s assistant, interacting with different types of people as your superior trains a student to become a more successful individual later in life. The classroom also offers several opportunities for a student to learn kinesthetically, whereas the online classroom fails the student in this area.
Online learning obviously offers opportunities for visual learning, but it does not offer much else. The classroom offers so much more, such as hands-on trainings, visual and hearing enhanced learning, and other kinesthetic, or physical means, of acquiring information. By incorporating different learning styles, the success rate of learning highly increases. This creates a more successful learning environment for everyone. The online learning experience is very limited in capturing different learning styles and ultimately fails the student. The online classroom actually offers more opportunities to become distracted and stray away from better learning versus the physical classroom. Since the traditional way of learning has always been in a classroom, many people think that students become more distracted in this type of environment. (Bowen, William G., et al).
However, the opposite is true. By doing online learning from home, office, or in a public venue, students are increasingly more distracted by other people, family members, and cell phones.
Many classrooms limit students to being on their phones or laptops, therefore, decreasing the amount of distractions. Online learning actually increases the amount of distractions because most people access their online classrooms from home, their office or place of work, or in a public place such as a coffee shop. People with conditions such as ADHD or other learning disabilities are at even more of a disadvantage for a successful online learning experience.

Finally, not everyone is equipped with fast-connecting internet, wifi, or has data plans that support the online learning environment. Many people live in rural areas where high-speed internet service or wifi is not available. Data plans and internet plans can be expensive, so people that are on a strict budget tend to stray away from costly internet and phone data plans. Sometimes internet connections can be interrupted by bad weather and can cause problems with your online learning experience. You may even lose your work if there is a power outage or your internet connection is interrupted. If you have a deadline, this could be a very bad situation.
Face-to-face learning in an actual classroom is proven to be the better alternative when it comes to being a student. Despite our ever increasing use of technology, online learning fails to prepare a well-rounded student that is prepared for the real world. By increasing social interactions, becoming more structured in your schedule, and learning how to interact with authority figures, students are far more successful in their careers by accessing the traditional classroom option. However, as more and more online learning opportunities increase, face-to-face learning may fade away forever.

Learning Style and Effectiveness of Online and Face-to-Face Instruction
Learning Style and Effectiveness of Online and Face-to-Face Instruction
Authors:
Charlotte Neuhauser
Abstract
In this study the investigator compared two sections of the same course-one section was online and asynchronous; the other was face-to-face-by examining gender, age, learning preferences and styles, media familiarity, effectiveness of tasks, course effectiveness, test grades, and final grades. The two sections were taught by the same instructor and used the same instructional materials. The results revealed no significant differences in test scores, assignments, participation grades, and final grades, although the online group's averages were slightly higher. Ninety-six percent of the online students found the course to be either as effective or more effective to their learning than their typical face-to-face course. There were no significant differences between learning preferences and styles and grades in either group. The study showed that equivalent learning activities can be equally effective for online and face-to-face learners.

... In this context, a great deal of research and meta-analyses have been done that prove that there are no significant differences between the two modes of education, online and face-to-face [3] [4][5][6]. In other words, studies have confirmed that a well-prepared, structured and organized face-to-face lecture compared to an equally prepared online lecture results in equal acquisition of knowledge and skills development in students.  ...
... It also determined that the key to successful face-to-face as well as online teaching and learning actually is the teacher [13]. This study, like many other similar studies, confirmed that there are no differences between online and face-to-face teaching [3] [4][5][6], as long as the emphasis is on a well-designed, well-prepared, organized and implemented teaching and learning process.  ...

... With the advancements in technology, the interest in the relation between learning styles and students' attainment in e-learning environments has increased (Allen, Bourhis, Burrell & Mabry 2002). The findings are somewhat controversial as some studies have reported a positive relationship between learning styles and success in distance education (Fahy & Ally 2005;Irani, Telg, Scherler & Harrington 2003;Manochehri & Young 2006;Mehlenbacher, Miller, Covington, & Larsen 2000;Soles & Moller 2001), whereas others have found no significant association (Ahn & Ahn 2000;DeTure 2004; Neuhauser 2002).  ...
... For this purpose, assessment of target language competences before and after the course would be necessary. Considering the controversial findings of previous studies, some of which observed a positive relationship between learning styles and success in distance education ( Neuhauser 2002), several hypotheses are plausible. It can be anticipated that students with favorable attitudes towards online distance learning may have better learning gains than students with less favorable attitudes.  ...

... Several studies have shown reduced completion rates in online courses compared to traditional face-to-face courses (e.g., Atchley, Wingenbach, & Akers, 2013). However, results for student success have ranged from lowered success rates and student outcomes in online courses compared to traditional face-to-face courses (e.g., Brown & Liedholm, 2002;Murphy & Stewart, 2017), to no differences (e.g., Buckley, 2003; Neuhauser, 2002), and even heightened success for those online (e.g., Means et al., 2009).  ...
... In contrast, studies evidencing online formats to be detrimental to student success have shown lower levels of student performance (Amro, Mundy, & Kupczynski, 2015;Bettinger, Fox, Loeb, Taylor, 2017;Brown & Liedholm, 2002;Buchanan & Palmer, 2017;Emerson & MacKay, 2011;Flanagan, 2012;Ganesh, Paswan, & Sun, 2015;Gundlach et al., 2015;Helms, 2014;Murphy & Stewart, 2017;Sohn & Romal, 2015), higher levels of dropout or reduced course completion (Alpert, Couch, & Harmon, 2016;Atchley, Wingenbach, and Akers, 2013;Bettinger et al., 2017;Brown, 2012;Dutton, Dutton, & Perry, 2002;Faulconer et al., 2018;Helms, 2014;McLaren, 2004;Murphy & Stewart, 2017;Smith & Ferguson, 2005;Sohn & Romal, 2015), lower student satisfaction levels and negative course perceptions (Buchanan & Palmer, 2017;Ganesh, Paswan, & Sun, 2015;Gundlach et al., 2015;Keramidas, 2012), as well as lower levels of skill development (Callister & Love, 2016). Further muddying the waters, a small number of studies have suggested that in fact there is no real difference between online and face-to-face instruction, outlining a lack of variation in performance and satisfaction levels across disciplines (e.g., Cavanaugh & Jacquemin, 2015), as well as in a number of diverse fields, including clinical/medical settings (Buckley, 2003;Chan et al., 2016;McCutcheon et al., 2015), business/finance (Ary & Brune, 2011;Daymont & Blau, 2008;DiRienzo & Lily, 2014; Neuhauser, 2002), psychology (McDonough, Roberts, & Hummel, 2014;Yen, Lo, Lee, & Enriquez, 2018), social work (Cummings, Chaffin, & Cockerham, 2015), and sociology (Driscoll, Jicha, Huny, Tichavsky, & Thompson, 2012).  ...

Other researchers who aver distance education produces students who perform better than their traditional classroom counterparts [6,7], while the rest select the status quo, arguing that there is no significant difference in test scores, assignments, participation grades and performance between distance and traditional classroom students [8][9][10] [11].  ...

... Harmanlanmış bir eğitim yaklaşımının öğrencilerin başarısına geleneksel yaklaşımlardan daha fazla katkı sağladığı ve öğrencilerin internete yönelik tutumlarını anlamlı şekilde geliştirdiği ortaya konulmuştur (Yapici & Akbayin, 2012). Öte yandan e-öğrenme ve yüz yüze öğretim etkinliklerini karşılaştıran çalışmaların bu ortamların öğrencilerin öğrenmeye ilişkin memnuniyetleri ve akademik başarıları açısından bir birine üstün olduğuna dair güçlü kanıt sunduğuna rastlanmamıştır (Neuhauser, 2002; Shapiro & Niederhauser, 2004). Söz konusu sonuçlar değerlendirildiğinde de bu ortamlardan birinin diğerine üstün olmasının değil her iki ortamın birleştirilmesinin ve bu ortamların güçlü yönlerinin ortaya çıkarılmasının öğrenci başarısını ve memnuniyetini artırdığı şeklinde yorumlanabilir.  ...

Okay, so I have some research here comparing online and face-to-Face learning. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, in Doc 1 from Voxy, there's a report from the U.S. Department of Education that says students in online learning conditions performed better than those in face-to-face instruction on average. That's interesting. But the article also mentions that the difference might be due to students spending more time studying in the online setting. So, maybe it's not the medium itself but the time invested that makes the difference.

Doc 2 from Sterling Academy talks about a meta-analysis by Karen Swan, which concluded that students learn as much or more from online courses as they do in traditional higher education courses. It also mentions a study where instructors felt that student learning outcomes were comparable or better in online courses. This seems positive for online learning.

Doc 3 is a research paper from Academia.edu comparing student perceptions of face-to-face and online learning for a graduate course. The results show that both methods were perceived as effective, but there were some differences in specific aspects. For example, online learning was seen as more effective for developing teaching skills, while face-to-face learning was seen as better for developing relationships with students. It's interesting that the perceptions varied depending on the aspect being considered.

Doc 4 from UoPeople's blog argues that online learning can be as good as or even better than face-to-face learning, highlighting benefits like asynchronous learning, student-led pacing, higher retention rates, and environmental advantages. They also mention that online learning requires more self-discipline, which can be a pro or a con.

Lastly, Doc 5 from Forest Trail Academy emphasizes the convenience and flexibility of online learning, along with the development of self-discipline in students. They also mention that online learning is more accessible and affordable for many students.

So, overall, it seems that both methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them might depend on the specific context and the learners' needs.

But I need to think about this more carefully. Let's consider some key factors:

1. **Interaction and Feedback:**

- Face-to-face learning allows for immediate feedback and more natural interactions.

- Online learning can provide asynchronous interactions, which might be better for some students who need time to process information before responding.

2. **Socialization:**

- Face-to-face learning facilitates socialization and building relationships.

- Online learning can also foster social connections through discussion forums and collaborative projects, but it might not be as immediate or personal.

3. **Structure and Discipline:**

- Face-to-face learning provides a structured schedule, which can help students stay on track.

- Online learning requires more self-discipline and time management skills, which can be beneficial in the long run but might be challenging for some students.

4. **Accessibility:**

- Online learning is more accessible for students who have scheduling conflicts or live in remote areas.

- Face-to-face learning requires physical presence, which might not be feasible for everyone.

5. **Learning Outcomes:**

- Some studies suggest that online learning can be as effective as or even more effective than face-to-face learning, possibly due to increased student engagement and time on task.

- Other studies find no significant difference in learning outcomes between the two methods.

Considering all this, I think it's fair to say that online learning can be as effective as face-to-face learning, and in some cases, even more effective, especially when students are motivated and have good self-regulatory skills. However, face-to-face learning still has its advantages, particularly in terms of social interaction and immediate feedback.

Perhaps the best approach is to combine both methods, creating a blended learning environment that leverages the strengths of each. This way, students can benefit from the structure and social aspects of face-to-face learning while enjoying the flexibility and convenience of online learning.

But to directly answer the question: "Is online learning better than face-to-face learning?" The answer is not straightforward. It depends on various factors such as the subject matter, the students' learning styles, and the quality of instruction in both formats. In many cases, online learning can be just as good as, or even better than, face-to-face learning, but it's not universally superior.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, online learning is not universally better than face-to-face learning; it depends on various factors and contexts.}} \]
