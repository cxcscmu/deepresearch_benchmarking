Alright, so I have this question: "Are high intelligence and anxiety correlated?" Hmm, that's an interesting topic. I'm not exactly sure about the relationship between intelligence and anxiety, so I think I need to do some research to find out.

First, I should probably define what is meant by "high intelligence." I guess it refers to people who have above-average IQ scores or maybe those who are considered gifted or talented. And anxiety, well, that's a feeling of unease, worry, or fear, often about future events. So, are people who are smarter more likely to experience anxiety, or is there no connection?

I think the best way to approach this is to look for scientific studies or research that has investigated this relationship. Maybe there are some statistics or findings that can help answer this question. So, I'll need to do a search to find relevant information.

Let me try searching for something like "intelligence and anxiety correlation." Hopefully, that will bring up some useful results.

Anxiety Linked to High IQ
By Rachael Rettner published May 30, 2013

Excessive worry might not be such a bad thing after all — a new small study suggests that such anxiety may have evolved in people along with intelligence.
The results show, among people diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, high IQ scores were associated with high levels of worry.
In addition, those with anxiety disorder tended to have higher IQ scores than healthy people, as well as higher levels of activity in regions of the brain that aid in communication between parts of the brain. These regions are thought to have contributed to the evolutionary success of humans, the researchers say.

Although we tend to view anxiety as not being good for us, it is linked with intelligence — a highly adaptive trait, said Dr. Jeremy Coplan, study researcher and professor of psychiatry at State University of New York Downstate Medical Center.

High levels of anxiety can be disabling, and patients' worries are often irrational, Coplan said. But "every so often there's a wild-card danger. Then, that excessive worry becomes highly adaptive," Coplan said.
"People who act on the signals of that wild-card danger are likely to preserve their lives and the lives of their offspring," Coplan said.
Because the study was small, more research is needed to confirm the findings.
Anxiety and intelligence
In the study, 26 patients with anxiety disorder and 18 healthy people completed an IQ test, along with a questionnaire to assess their level of worry.
Among the participants with anxiety disorders, the higher their worry level, the greater their IQ score was.
Interestingly, the opposite was seen in healthy patients: those with high IQ scores tended to have low levels of worry, and those with low IQ scores tended to have high levels of worry — a finding that agrees with earlier research.
Not enough worry
Too little worry can be problematic for individuals and society, Coplan said. Some people are "incapable of seeing any danger, even when danger is imminent, he said.
"If these folks are in positions as leaders, they are going to indicate to the general populace that there's no need to worry," Coplan said. In some situations, like the recent real estate bubble, that lack of worry can have societal consequences, he said.
The study was published Feb. 1 in the journal Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience.
Pass it on: In some situations, excessive worrying is advantageous, and the trait may have co-evolved with intelligence.

Why Smart People Are More Prone To Anxiety - PsyBlog
Why Smart People Are More Prone To Anxiety
The reason high intelligence and anxiety are correlated.
Intelligence and anxiety may have evolved together as mutually beneficial traits, research finds.
This may help to explain why people with high intelligence also tend to have higher levels of anxiety.
The benefit may be that intelligence allows people to better imagine what might go wrong.
Worriers tend to keep out of danger so that their genes are the ones carried forward into the next generation.
Non-worries, meanwhile, starved to death because they didn’t prepare for winter or failed to anticipate an enemy raid.
Professor Jeremy Coplan, who led the study, said:
“While excessive worry is generally seen as a negative trait and high intelligence as a positive one, worry may cause our species to avoid dangerous situations, regardless of how remote a possibility they may be.
In essence, worry may make people ‘take no chances,’ and such people may have higher survival rates.
Thus, like intelligence, worry may confer a benefit upon the species.”
For the study, people with high anxiety levels were compared with those with average levels.
Brain scans were carried out, along with tests of intelligence and anxiety.
In people diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, IQ was positively correlated with worry.
In other words, people who were more intelligent also worried more.
Brain scans found that activity in sub-cortical white matter correlated with both anxiety and intelligence.
Previous research has shown that people who are low in intelligence are also prone to worry — possibly because they achieve less in life.
Average intelligence show less of a link with anxiety.

The Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders and a High IQ - Exploring your mind
Wellness
The Relationship Between Anxiety Disorders and a High IQ
5 minutes
“Ignorance is bliss.” Strangely enough, this popular saying has quite a bit of evidence to support it, at least according to several pieces of research on the links between happiness, anxiety, and intelligence. According to a paper from Lakehead University in Canada, there’s a very striking relationship between anxiety disorders and a high IQ. They have confirmed that there’s an almost direct link between these brilliant, analytical minds and excessive worry and social anxiety.
Not long ago, we talked about the apparent correlation between creativity and bipolar disorder. First of all, we need to clarify something quite important. This doesn’t mean that there’s a psychological disorder behind every person with an exceptionally high IQ or remarkable creative potential. This isn’t the case at all.
There’s a relationship between anxiety disorders and high intelligence, an evidence that has its origin in the cerebral white matter.
Science, and in particular the psychology departments of many universities around the world, have been studying this area. They periodically offer information that could be of interest to us. This information consists of data that contains significant evidence that can help us later in clinical practice. They concluded something very important. They’ve shown that there are many people with high abilities and intelligence levels that behave in a way that seems to not go hand in hand with their highly privileged brains. They’re often not happy due to this fact. It makes them feel frustrated and they don’t always make the best decisions.
There are many psychiatrists and neuropsychologists around the world who have often come across the same problem. They have many high IQ patients who have chronic and generalized anxiety. What’s the reason for this?
The relationship between anxiety disorders and high intelligence
Whoever works in education will often see this phenomenon. There are brilliant students who show a remarkable emotional balance and a striking calmness. Others, on the other hand, quickly become frustrated with any changes that take place. They always expect the worst, and stress fills their lives. So much so that they end up exhausted and their academic performance suffers.
Tscahi Ein-Dor and Orgad Tal are two psychologists from Lakehead University in Canada. They conducted different experiments in several secondary schools and universities. Their aim was to study these particular behavior patterns, patterns that end up hindering the personal and professional success of a good number of students. At one point during their research, they decided to also include an MRI scan. It was then that they discovered something remarkable and quite unexpected.
White matter and high intelligence
The connection between anxiety disorders and a high IQ and intelligence could be explained by a small cerebral anomaly in the brain’s white matter. This structure, formed mostly by myelinated axons, is related to the transmission of information. It determines our intelligence and the capacities of our cognitive processes. In turn, it also plays a part in our emotions.
Some scientists think that as intelligence was developing in human beings, so was anxiety. This had a very specific purpose: to anticipate dangers. In that way, our ability to analyze and process information would help us to improve our chances of survival by anticipating risks and threats. Obviously, when we become overloaded with anxiety, then intelligence loses its potential because the person feels literally paralyzed.
Characteristics of people with a high IQ and anxiety disorders
This small anomaly or variation in the cerebral white matter doesn’t mean that every person with high IQ or intelligence will develop an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. There’s simply a greater risk. They’re more susceptible to not being able to control their emotions in stressful situations. Here are some typical characteristics of people who do have this relationship between their intelligence and their emotions:
Sentinel intelligence: The ability to anticipate threats or dangers that others can’t perceive (something that in certain contexts can be beneficial).
Hypersensitivity: Anxiety disorders and high intelligence often result in low tolerance levels in certain situations and certain people. This can end up causing mental exhaustion.
Emotional contagion. Another characteristic of very intelligent people is that they’re very sensitive to other people’s emotions. However, they don’t know how to filter them, handle them, or separate them from reality. This means that they suffer from a continuous “emotional contagion,” along with the fatigue it causes.
Subconsciously wasteful. This curious term will probably seem a bit strange to you, but it actually reveals something that really rings a bell. People with a high IQ think too much. They waste a lot of mental and emotional energy thinking about inconsequential matters that, in most cases, don’t take them anywhere.
The world is full of possibilities and they can’t ignore any of them. Anxiety disorders and high intelligence also produce an inability to establish limits, to set aside some options and choose others. The world, for them, is full of infinite options, variables, and conditions. They are often incapable of discarding any of them.
A hyperactive brain
At this point, the question is almost inevitable. How can we deal with it? How can we handle a hyperactive brain incapable of filtering a reality that is too complex? A reality that is so full of information, emotions, and stimuli?
We would probably say that the best thing to do would be to find a way of getting rid of the anxiety or at least reducing it. Well, as strange as it sounds, that isn’t the answer. The key is to use anxiety in our favor, to manage it effectively in order to realize our full potential. Because, if our intelligence and anxiety go hand in hand for a reason, then we need to focus on that reason.
Let’s learn how to use what we have to see what others don’t see. Let’s use it to anticipate risks, events, and probabilities. But let’s do it in a balanced way, knowing how to filter out the unnecessary. Let’s order our paths in such a way that our mental energy can flow in the best way possible. Giving it all you got will definitely be worth it.

Restless Intelligence: Why Smart People Are So Anxious
Restless Intelligence: Why Smart People Are So Anxious
Posted on January 6, 2021 by Guest Author for www.rtor.org

Smart people are often anxious. Is this news to you?
I’m guessing not, since you’re smart. Research has shown that there is a high correlation between being intelligent and socially anxious. The higher your IQ, the higher the chance your social apprehension is higher than usual.
Of course, that doesn’t mean that your social anxiety should be classified as a disorder. But it surely means you should keep it in check. No matter where on the anxiety spectrum you’re placed, here are some of the most essential reasons why smart people are anxious.
1. Smart people can detect more threats
The smarter you are, the wider your eyes are open, which means the higher awareness you possess. Intelligent individuals can, therefore, detect more threats in any given situation. With more threats come more worries. When we are hyper-sensitive, we tend to observe things in more depth around us. That turns us into super-highly aware individuals.
The emotions attached to this hyper-awareness can be detrimental to our mental health. For instance, instead of enjoying a party, we’d be more concerned with how other people feel, if they are okay and if our best friends are having a good time. If the people around us are not safe, we are not safe, meaning our environment becomes threatened and thus, fails to provide us with the security we need. This is where anxiety kicks in.
2. Self-awareness is one of the reasons
Regardless of the hypersensitivity to external stimuli, smart people are usually self-aware. Not only are they attentive to those around them but also concerned about their personal performance. Smart people experience the “spotlight” more often. Monitoring their reactions to everything and everyone can therefore get exhausting. Other people could pick up on these reactions, so they must observe counterreactions subconsciously. This can also be anxiety-triggering.
3. A searching mind becomes anxious
Intelligent people’s brains work 24/7, meaning their minds browse for new information continuously. Higher levels of cognitive abilities lead people to seek new information and examine theories more often. The more the mind searches, the more anxiety it can create if left unchecked. Trying to rationalize everything by finding answers to all the arising questions becomes tiring. Running these mental activities at the same time is overwhelming.
4. Theory of Mind is better developed in smart people
Theory of Mind is concerned with social function and intelligence. The more developed we are, the more stress we will accumulate. The ability to determine other people’s states of mind and attribute reasons to them can, again, be overwhelming. Thinking is good but over-thinking every social situation is damaging to our mental health. That’s because our minds can point us to negative conclusions and thus, skew our natural perception of things. A hyper-understanding of the world around us can have both positive and negative effects.
5. Smart people are empathic
On the same note, smart people are also great empaths. That means that they are aware of other people’s emotional states and well-being. The more we realize and understand how other people feel, the more concerned we become. We take these emotional cues and integrate them as our own, which can destabilize our mood. When we experience such emotions around others, we can easily pick up on their mental states, which adds to the anxiety.
6. Too much thinking can get you anxious
Over-thinking can make you anxious. When you are busy assessing how every single person in the room feels, you might forget about your state of being. The more you empathize with others, the more you forget about your own issues. That can lead you to feel misunderstood or even outnumbered. While you can create and maintain friendships for longer, you’ll also have more to lose than non-empaths. They’re not as concerned about you as you are about them, which could leave you feeling uncomfortable. This lack of comfort can quickly become anxiety.
7. Empirical evidence is key
Smart people look at all the empirical evidence in the physical domain to draw conclusions. That’s because they don’t want to seem naïve or gullible. They want to be self-aware of how various people or situations affect them. However, many times, this leads to excessive control.
You might not want to experience a negative emotion once again, so based on your empirical assessment of a former situation, you’ll naturally avoid it. Unfortunately, not all negative situations can be avoided, so trying to over-control this can trigger you. In an effort to avoid being hurt, you might hurt yourself by triggering your anxiety.
8. Social situations are not always logical
Smart people are always taking logical action. However, social situations are not always logical in nature. They can be based on feelings, emotions, and intuition. People are not always logical, so their behaviors cannot always be predicted. Social anxiety is born out of this concern for unpredictability. Interacting with other people can be more difficult for smart people because these interactions don’t follow a specific set of rules; they just happen. This lack of control over social situations can easily trigger anxiety.
9. Smart people tend to over-decipher
IQ and EQ are not the same things. IQ refers to cognitive intelligence (‘brains’), while EQ refers to emotional intelligence. As smart people, we tend to decipher emotions in a more rational way; but emotions are not always rational. People can react in strange and unpredictable ways to the same stimuli because their minds are complex. To put it more briefly, reactions to the same stimuli might vary. Since these emotional reactions are not consistent, they cannot be boxed in and transmuted into patterns. Thus, it is easier for us to misinterpret emotional reactions and then feel stressed about it. And as you might well know, constant stress leads to anxiety.
10. Channeling awareness into action
I don’t want to end today’s article without offering any solutions. The only solution I see is channeling that hyper-awareness into action. Since intelligent people have a harder time comprehending everything at a basic, simple level, the answer is to stop thinking and DO. When you feel socially anxious, stop over-thinking, and become present. Do not try to find patterns and reasons for everything; just be. Stop thinking of all the possible outcomes, and enjoy the present moment. Participate in the action that is taking place in the now without worrying about your brain. A good method to start channeling is meditation.
Conclusion
Anxious people worry more because they also have more to lose. So, it’s important to admit to these anxious feelings and work on accepting them. After integrating them into your life, you can start taking action. This is the only way to better understand your emotions and become less anxious. If you’re smart and in denial about your anxiety, I hope this article opened your eyes just a bit more. Take baby steps and stop worrying so much. You got this!

16 Scientific Reasons Why People Who Are Socially Anxious Are Usually Highly Intelligent
By Brianna Wiest Updated July 26, 2021
Sophia Sinclair
Many people know there’s a neurological correlation between being highly creative and mentally ill, but few seem to realize that the same is true between being socially anxious and highly intelligent. Everybody experiences a degree of social apprehension, and a high IQ is not the sole root of social anxiety as a classifiable clinical disorder, but it’s a huge factor, no matter where on the spectrum you fall. Here, 16 reasons why:
1. People with social anxiety exhibit high levels of sentinel intelligence, which is the ability to detect real threats that are invisible to other people. For example, in the study linked, participants were able to detect the smell of smoke far before others. This means that they are hyper-sensitive to perceived threats, and can feel uneasy or disturbed when they are mental or emotional in nature.
2. Socially anxious people are hyper self-aware. This is generally a positive thing, but when in a social setting these people will experience a sort of spotlight effect and become exhausted trying to monitor and control what they logically know other people could, and may, pick up on.
3. “An anxious mind is a searching mind ,” and an intelligent one is, too. In the study linked, it was found that children with Generalized Anxiety Disorder have higher levels of cognitive ability and diligence simply because they are constantly examining things, seeking theories and explanations, trying to rationalize and evaluate information from multiple angles, all at the same time.
4. People with anxiety score higher on verbal intelligence exams. This simply means that they are more attuned to the dimension of meaning behind any given interaction. They perceive the world beyond the surface (and statements beyond their obvious meaning.)
5. People with social anxiety have a natural awareness of other people’s states of mind. This means that they are highly attuned to how someone is thinking, feeling or perceiving a situation, a little bit beyond what would be appropriate and healthy to function without over-thinking, worrying and trying to react to someone’s perceived state of mind, rather than the reality they are presenting.
6. Socially anxious people are, in a sense, empaths. That almost psychic ability to be aware of other people’s states of mind ties inextricably to being aware of their emotional state. Often, if people don’t realize that they are so empathetic, they adopt other people’s issues as their own. They experience an influx and instability of emotion around others (especially large groups) just because they are picking up on everyone else.
7. People with social anxiety are also downboard thinkers: they are a few logical steps ahead of the conversation at almost all times. This leads to feeling easily embarrassed as they can immediately determine the repercussions of a social faux pas.
8. People with similar levels of social anxiety tend to bond quickly; friendships that form quickly and last for a while tend to have this in common. When it comes to being around people whose levels are not aligned with your own, a sense of looming discomfort approaches as they feel ‘outnumbered’ or misunderstood, and certainly uncomfortable.
9. Intelligent people compile empirical evidence from their lives to create a conclusion… socially anxious people do, too. Because intelligent people are far from being naive, they understand how, realistically, history could repeat itself, so if they’ve had a series of negative social experiences, they close off and try to avoid being hurt again.
10. Intelligent people best cope with things that are logical, and social situations are not logical – and neither are people. Their social anxiety is born of a sense of misunderstanding; intelligent people search for information, not emotional cues, and this is how it becomes difficult to interact with others, or even just understand them.
11. Socially anxious people are subconscious overthinkers. This is to say, they don’t know that they’re over-evaluating and coming up with (ironically enough) irrational conclusions.
12. Mental and emotional intelligence is not the same thing, and often, mentally intelligent people will try to decipher emotions in a rational way, which leads to a lot of stress when conclusions cannot be made. When people don’t behave in ways that create patterns, and their emotions are not logical or consistent or dismantled with reason, this misunderstanding of mind vs. heart can lead to a lot of internal stress.
13. Intelligent people are simply less able to dilute reality. Most people choose to ignore all the possibilities, the “what-if’s,” but that doesn’t make them less a part of reality, it makes them less a part of their reality. Unfortunately, intelligent people lack the ability to do this (for better and for much, much worse.)
14. The Theory of Mind is a crucial element of both intelligence and social function, but a hyper-understanding often leads to unnecessary stress. Theory of Mind, otherwise known as commonsense psychology, is the ability to determine and attribute mental states to oneself and to others. Over-thinking this natural perception, however, leads to unnecessarily negative conclusions and the like.
15. Socially anxious people are far more perceptive of intent rather than what appears at face-value. This is because their natural inclination is to dig beneath the surface and understand the root, cause, meaning, purpose, and ultimately, intention of anything (so this need extends into their social lives.)
16. Intelligent people can be more judgmental if they haven’t channeled their awareness into being discerning instead. This is where the whole intelligent-pretentious correlation stereotype comes from. Intelligent people have a hard time of seeing things on more simplistic levels, and an even harder time of stomaching someone else’s lapse in perception (especially when it’s leading to a negative consequence in their lives.) This results in a constant state of social anxiety: tell someone the truth and help them out, or remain mum and feel frustrated regardless.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got these search results here. Let me see what they're saying about the correlation between high intelligence and anxiety.

The first document is from Live Science, and it talks about a study suggesting that anxiety might have evolved alongside intelligence. It says that people with anxiety disorders have higher IQ scores and higher levels of activity in certain brain regions involved in communication between parts of the brain. The idea is that excessive worry can be advantageous because it helps people anticipate dangers, which could have been beneficial for survival.

Interesting. So, according to this, high intelligence and anxiety are linked, and this link might have evolutionary roots. The article mentions that in some situations, excessive worrying can be disabling, but in others, it can be highly adaptive.

The second document is from PsyBlog, summarizing the same study. It reiterates that high intelligence and anxiety may have co-evolved as mutually beneficial traits. The theory is that intelligence allows people to better imagine potential dangers, and thus take precautions, which could increase their survival rates.

This seems consistent with the Live Science article. Both suggest a possible evolutionary advantage to having both high intelligence and anxiety.

The third source is from Exploring Your Mind. It discusses a study from Lakehead University in Canada that found a relationship between anxiety disorders and high IQ. The article mentions that there's a small anomaly in the brain's white matter that might explain this link. White matter is involved in transmitting information in the brain and is related to both intelligence and emotions.

So, this adds another piece to the puzzle, suggesting a neurological basis for the correlation between high intelligence and anxiety.

The fourth document is from RTOR.org, and it lists several reasons why smart people might be more anxious. Some of the points include:

1. Smart people can detect more threats because they're more aware of their surroundings.

2. Self-awareness can lead to increased anxiety.

3. A restless, searching mind can generate more anxiety.

4. Theory of Mind being better developed in smart people, leading to more stress.

5. Empathy, which is common in smart people, can lead to picking up on others' emotions and feeling overwhelmed.

6. Overthinking can cause anxiety.

7. Empirical evidence and over-control can lead to anxiety when facing unpredictable social situations.

8. Social situations are not always logical, which can be challenging for logical thinkers.

9. Misinterpreting emotional reactions can cause stress and anxiety.

This provides a more psychological perspective on why high intelligence might be linked with anxiety.

The fifth source is from Thought Catalog, and it also lists reasons why socially anxious people are often highly intelligent. Points include:

1. Sentinel intelligence: being able to detect real threats others might miss.

2. Hyper self-awareness leading to exhaustion in social settings.

3. Higher cognitive ability and diligence in children with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

4. Scoring higher on verbal intelligence exams.

5. Natural awareness of others' states of mind.

6. Being empaths, picking up on others' emotions.

7. Being downboard thinkers: always a few steps ahead, leading to embarrassment.

8. Bonding quickly with others who have similar levels of social anxiety.

9. Using past negative experiences to inform future behavior, leading to avoidance.

10. Difficulty coping with illogical social situations.

11. Subconscious overthinking.

12. Confusion between mental and emotional intelligence.

13. Inability to ignore possibilities and "what-ifs."

14. Hyper-understanding of Theory of Mind leading to stress.

15. Perceptiveness of intent beyond face value.

16. Tendency to be judgmental if not discerning.

This reinforces many of the points from the previous sources, emphasizing the psychological mechanisms behind the correlation.

So, overall, these sources suggest that there is a correlation between high intelligence and anxiety, and they offer several explanations for this link:

1. Evolutionary advantage: Anxiety helped intelligent ancestors anticipate and avoid dangers, increasing survival rates.

2. Neurological basis: Differences in brain structure, particularly in white matter, may link intelligence and anxiety.

3. Psychological factors:

a. Increased awareness and detection of threats.

b. Heightened self-awareness and over-monitoring in social situations.

c. Overthinking and difficulty dealing with uncertainty.

d. Empathy and picking up on others' emotions, leading to overwhelm.

e. Difficulty navigating social situations that don't follow logical patterns.

It's important to note that while there seems to be a correlation, not all intelligent people experience anxiety, and not all anxious people are highly intelligent. Additionally, anxiety can be disabling and requires proper management and, in some cases, treatment.

In conclusion, based on these sources, it appears that high intelligence and anxiety are correlated, with possible evolutionary and neurological underpinnings, as well as various psychological factors contributing to this relationship.

\boxed{\text{Yes, high intelligence and anxiety are correlated.}}
