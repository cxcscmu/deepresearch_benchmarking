Alright, I need to figure out what the major forms of resistance to slavery were. I don't know a lot about this topic off the top of my head, so I think I should start by doing some research. I'll use the search tool to look up information on resistance to slavery.

First, I need to think about what kinds of resistance there might have been. I know that slaves were often treated very poorly, so I imagine that they would have found ways to resist their enslavement. Maybe they rebelled or tried to escape. There might have been other forms of resistance too, like work slowdowns or sabotage.

I should probably look into specific historical examples to get a better understanding. For instance, I've heard of slave revolts in places like Haiti and the United States. Those might be good examples to look into.

Also, I should consider the different periods and places where slavery existed because resistance might have taken different forms depending on the context. Slavery has existed in many parts of the world throughout history, so it's important to have a broad perspective.

Maybe I should start by searching for "major forms of resistance to slavery" to see what comes up. That should give me a general overview.

There were many ways in which slaves could resist the people who owned them.  Let us look at three of them.
First, there were slave rebellions.  These were the most drastic sorts of resistance.  These involved violence by slaves against the people who owned them and generally against other whites as well.  Since this sort of resistance was so drastic and had such a small chance of success, relatively few slaves engaged in it.
Second, there was escape.  One thing that slaves could do to resist was to try to deprive their owners of their “property.”  By escaping, a slave could hurt their owner both in terms of prestige and in economic terms.  Of course, this sort of resistance could also lead to freedom for the slave.  This was much more common than slave rebellions, but was still not terribly common as it had a relatively low chance of success, particularly for slaves in the Deep South.
Finally, there was the most common form of resistance.  This was everyday resistance that came in very small, subtle ways.  It might not even be perceived as resistance by the slaveowners.  Here, slaves deliberately worked poorly and/or slowly.  They deliberately broke tools.  They malingered.  In other words, they did as much as they could to harm their owners’ economic interests.  The resisted by working only unwillingly and at a much lower level of productivity than they could have.

Slave Revolts, Abolition, and the Underground Railroad. Nat Turner’s Rebellion.
Reconstruction.
Early 20th Century.
The Southern Civil Rights Movement.
Politics and Race in Late 20th Century.
Resisting Racism in Policing and the Justice System.
What were examples of overt and passive resistance to enslavement?
Because they were living under the domination of their masters, slaves knew that direct, outright, overt resistance—such as talking back, hitting their master or running away—could result in being whipped, sold away from their families and friends, or even killed.
Why was resistance difficult for slaves on the plantations?
Resistance took many forms: from keeping aspects of their identity and traditions alive to escaping and plotting uprisings. On the plantations they broke tools, damaged crops and feigned injury or illness in order to frustrate plantation owners and their ambitions for greater profits.
How did slaves create their own community?
This act of creating a culture all of their own was an act of rebellion. They found ways to defy their bondage through harvesting personal gardens, creating culturally diverse foods, practicing religion, expressing themselves through music, creating strong family bonds and even through their ideas of freedom.
What language did most slaves speak?
In the English colonies Africans spoke an English-based Atlantic Creole, generally called plantation creole. Low Country Africans spoke an English-based creole that came to be called Gullah.
What songs did the slaves sing in the fields?
Songs associated with the Underground Railroad
“Follow the Drinkin’ Gourd”
“Go Down Moses”
“Let Us Break Bread Together”
“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”
“Steal Away (To Jesus)”
“Wade in the Water”
“Song of the Free”
John Coltrane has a song titled “Song of the Underground Railroad” on his album Africa/Brass.
Why did African slaves use call and response songs on plantations *?
As Africanized Christianity took hold of the slave population during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, spirituals, a type of religious song typically sung in a call and response form with a leader improvising a line of text and a chorus of singers providing a solid refrain in unison, served as a way to …
Where did call and response originate?
Sub-Saharan African
What were the early forms of black music?
The earliest form of black musical expression in America, spirituals were based on Christian psalms and hymns and merged with African music styles and secular American music forms. Spirituals were originally an oral tradition and imparted Christian values while also defining the hardships of slavery.

Running away was another form of resistance.
What is an example of covert resistance to slavery?
Covert forms of slave resistance often involved resisting work. Individual slaves would pretend to be too sick to work or groups of slaves would “slow down” their work. Because the slaves were in collusion, it was difficult if not impossible to ascribe blame to any one individual with work slowdowns.
Why was resistance difficult for slaves on the plantations?
Resistance took many forms: from keeping aspects of their identity and traditions alive to escaping and plotting uprisings. On the plantations they broke tools, damaged crops and feigned injury or illness in order to frustrate plantation owners and their ambitions for greater profits.
Did cotton cause the Civil War?
If there was one ultimate cause of the Civil War, it was King Cotton — black-slave-grown cotton — “the most important determinant of American history in the nineteenth century,” Dattel concludes. “Cotton prolonged America’s most serious social tragedy, slavery, and slave-produced cotton caused the American Civil War.”
What was the main capital of the Confederacy?
Richmond
What product accounted for more than 50% of US exports in 1860?
Cotton Exports, 1860-1866 (in Millions of Pounds) Most important, they understood that labor, not land, constrained the production of cotton.
What was the main crop of the Deep South?
cotton
What’s considered the Deep South?
The Deep South Also known as “The cotton states,” the states we refer to as the “deep south” include South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
What facilitated the spread of slavery in the lower Deep South?
Because Southern planters relied on enslaved workers to plant and pick their cotton, the demand for slave labor increased. Slavery spread across a larger area of the South. One reason was the boom in cotton. Agriculture, especially cotton farming, produced great profits.
What is one way slaves were treated differently from indentured servants in colonial North America?
Other masters treated their slaves more humanely than their servants because slaves were regarded as a lifetime investment, whereas servants would be gone in a few years. Indentured servants did have some rights, though, at least in theory. For example, they had access to the courts and were entitled to own land.
What does the Second Middle Passage refer to?
Second Middle Passage: The forced migration of slaves from the upper south to the lower south of the United States.
When was the middle passage used?
From about 1518 to the mid-19th century, millions of African men, women, and children made the 21-to-90-day voyage aboard grossly overcrowded sailing ships manned by crews mostly from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal, and France.

Slave Resistance and Revolts

Enslaved African Americans resisted slavery in a variety of active and passive ways. "Day-to-day resistance" was the most common form of opposition to slavery. Breaking tools, feigning illness, staging slowdowns, and committing acts of arson and sabotage--all were forms of resistance and expression of slaves' alienation from their masters.
Running away was another form of resistance. Most slaves ran away relatively short distances and were not trying to permanently escape from slavery. Instead, they were temporarily withholding their labor as a form of economic bargaining and negotiation. Slavery involved a constant process of negotiation as slaves bargained over the pace of work, the amount of free time they would enjoy, monetary rewards, access to garden plots, and the freedom to practice burials, marriages, and religious ceremonies free from white oversight.
Some fugitives did try to permanently escape slavery. While the idea of escaping slavery quickly brings to mind the Underground Railroad to the free states, in fact more than half of these runaways headed southward or to cities or to natural refuges like swamps. Often, runaways were relatively privileged slaves who had served as river boatmen or coachmen and were familiar with the outside world.
Especially in the colonial period, fugitive slaves tried to form runaway communities known as "maroon colonies." Located in swamps, mountains, or frontier regions, some of these communities resisted capture for several decades.
During the early 18th century there were slave uprisings in Long Island in 1708 and in New York City in 1712. Slaves in South Carolina staged several insurrections, culminating in the Stono Rebellion in 1739, when they seized arms, killed whites, and burned houses. In 1740 and 1741, conspiracies were uncovered in Charleston and New York. During the late 18th century, slave revolts erupted in Guadeloupe, Grenada, Jamaica, Surinam, San Domingue (Haiti), Venezuela, and the Windward Island and many fugitive slaves, known as maroons, fled to remote regions and carried on guerrilla warfare (during the 1820s, a fugitive slave named Bob Ferebee led a band in fugitive slaves in guerrilla warfare in Virginia). During the early 19th century, major conspiracies or revolts against slavery took place in Richmond, Virginia, in 1800; in Louisiana in 1811; in Barbados in 1816; in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822; in Demerara in 1823; and in Jamaica and in Southampton County, Virginia in 1831.
Slave revolts were most likely when slaves outnumbered whites, when masters were absent, during periods of economic distress, and when there was a split within the ruling elite. They were also most common when large numbers of native-born Africans had been brought into an area at one time.
The main result of slave insurrections was the mass executions of blacks. After a slave conspiracy was uncovered in New York City in 1740, 18 slaves were hanged and 13 were burned alive. After Denmark Vesey's conspiracy was uncovered, the authorities in Charleston hanged 37 blacks. Following Nat Turner's insurrection, the local militia killed about 100 blacks and 20 more slaves, including Turner, were later executed. In the South, the preconditions for successful rebellion did not exist, and tended to bring increased suffering and repression to the slave community.
Violent rebellion was rarer and smaller in scale in the American South than in Brazil or the Caribbean, reflecting the relatively small proportion of blacks in the southern population, the low proportion of recent migrants from Africa, and the relatively small size of southern plantations. Compared to the Caribbean, prospects for successful sustained rebellions in the American South were bleak. In Jamaica, slaves outnumbered whites by ten or eleven to one; in the South, a much larger white population was committed to suppressing rebellion. In general, Africans were more likely than slaves born in the New World to participate in outright revolts. Not only did many Africans have combat experience prior to enslavement, but they also had fewer family and community ties that might inhibit violent insurrection.

Methods of resistance: Enslaved Africans resisted slavery in both covert and overt ways. Examples of covert forms of resistance include work slow-downs and breaking tools. Examples of overt forms of resistance include running away or organizing rebellions.
Know more about it here.
Accordingly,  what was a method of resistance that was employed by slaves?
Slave resistance on plantations Some African slaves on the plantations fought for their freedom by using passive resistance (working slowly) or running away. The problem of runaways became so serious that most West Indian islands passed laws to deal with this and other forms of resistance.
what were three reasons for the growth of slavery? These seven factors led to the development of the slave trade:
The importance of the West Indian colonies.
The shortage of labour.
The failure to find alternative sources of labour.
The legal position.
Racial attitudes.
Religious factors.
Military factors.
Similarly, you may ask,  how was slavery in the New England colonies?
Part of the reason slavery evolved differently in New England than in the middle and southern colonies was the culture of indentured servitude. As a carryover from English practice, indentured servants were the original standard for forced labor in New England and middle colonies like Pennsylvania and Delaware.
How were cotton and slavery connected?
Growing more cotton meant an increased demand for slaves. Slaves in the Upper South became incredibly more valuable as commodities because of this demand for them in the Deep South. They were sold off in droves. This created a Second Middle Passage, the second largest forced migration in America's history.
How did slaves find their way north?
Star played a key role in helping to find their way and freedom. Escaping slaves could it by locating the Big Dipper, a well-recognized asterism most visible in the night sky in late winter and spring.
How did abolitionists fight slavery?
Abolitionism, or the abolitionist movement, was the movement to end slavery. This term can be used both formally and informally. In Western Europe and the Americas, abolitionism was a historic movement that sought to end the Atlantic slave trade and set slaves free.
When did America abolish slavery?
1865
How did the Underground Railroad work?
The Underground Railroad was a secret system developed to aid fugitive slaves on their escape to freedom. The free individuals who helped runaway slaves travel toward freedom were called conductors, and the fugitive slaves were referred to as cargo.
How did Africans resist colonial rule?
The conditions that led African peoples to resist colonial rule often emerged from longstanding grievances against colonial labor exploitation, taxation, racist and paternalist practices, arbitrary violence, and political illegitimacy.
What happened during Nat Turner's rebellion?
Nat Turner's Rebellion (also known as the Southampton Insurrection) was a slave rebellion that took place in Southampton County, Virginia, in August 1831, led by Nat Turner. The state executed 56 slaves accused of being part of the rebellion, and many non-participant slaves were punished in the frenzy.
What did slaves do in New England?
In New England, it was common for individual enslaved people to learn specialized skills and crafts due to the area's more varied economy. Ministers, doctors, tradesmen, and merchants also used slave labor to work alongside them and run their households.
Why did New Englanders choose to purchase slaves?
Colonial New Englanders also justified slavery in religious terms. They believed that their religion was the only valid religion in the world and that all who did not accept it would go to hell. Many slave traders argued that enslaving Africans was actually a blessing to them, since it introduced them to Christianity.
What was slavery like in the southern colonies?
Slaves and indentured servants, although present in the North, were much more important to the South. They were the backbone of the Southern economy. Settlers in the Southern colonies came to America to seek economic prosperity they could not find in Old England.
What did slaves do in Massachusetts?
This made Massachusetts the first colony to authorize slavery through legislation. In 1670, Massachusetts made it legal for the children of slaves to be sold into bondage. By 1680, the colony had laws restricting the movements of blacks.
When was slavery abolished in England?
1833
How is chattel slavery different from slavery?
Chattel slavery, also called traditional slavery, is so named because people are treated as the chattel (personal property) of the owner and are bought and sold as commodities. Typically, under the chattel slave system, children inherited slave status via the mother (partus sequitur ventrem).
When did slavery end in the North?
1804
When did indentured servitude end?
Indentured servitude reappeared in the Americas in the mid-nineteenth century as a means of transporting Asians to the Caribbean sugar islands and South America following the abolition of slavery. Servitude then remained in legal use until its abolition in 1917.
What is the relationship of slavery to colonial development?
Slavery was more than a labor system; it also influenced every aspect of colonial thought and culture. The uneven relationship it engendered gave white colonists an exaggerated sense of their own status.
What are the main causes of slavery?
These seven factors led to the development of the slave trade:
The importance of the West Indian colonies.
The shortage of labour.
The failure to find alternative sources of labour.
The legal position.
Racial attitudes.
Religious factors.
Military factors.

Alright, I have some search results here. Let's see what I can find out about the major forms of resistance to slavery.

First, in Doc 1 from eNotes, it mentions three types of resistance: slave rebellions, escape, and everyday resistance like working slowly or breaking tools. Slave rebellions were the most drastic and involved violence, but they were rare. Escape was more common but still not very frequent, especially from the Deep South. The most common form was everyday resistance, where slaves would work poorly, break tools, or pretend to be sick to resist their owners.

Doc 2 from Brainly mentions that the most popular form of resistance was sabotaging equipment. So, that seems to align with the everyday resistance mentioned in Doc 1.

Doc 3 from JanetPanic.com also talks about similar forms of resistance, including breaking tools, feigning illness, and running away. It also mentions that creating their own culture and community was a form of resistance.

Doc 4 from Digital History provides more detailed information. It talks about "day-to-day resistance" as the most common form, which includes breaking tools, feigning illness, and slowdowns. Running away was another form, often temporary to negotiate better conditions rather than permanent escape. Permanent escapes often involved heading southward or to cities and forming maroon communities.

It also mentions slave revolts, which were less common but more dramatic. Examples include the Stono Rebellion in 1739, Gabriel Prosser's conspiracy in 1800, Denmark Vesey's in 1822, and Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831. These were risky and often led to severe punishments for the slaves involved.

Doc 5 from Treehozz.com confirms that covert resistance included work slow-downs and breaking tools, while overt resistance included running away or organizing rebellions.

From these sources, it seems that the major forms of resistance to slavery were:

1. Everyday or covert resistance: This included breaking tools, feigning illness, working slowly, and other subtle ways to disrupt the slave owners' plans and assert some control over their own lives.

2. Escape: Running away, either temporarily to negotiate better conditions or permanently to seek freedom elsewhere.

3. Rebellion: Organizing uprisings or revolts against slave owners, which were rare but significant.

So, in summary, slaves resisted slavery through both subtle, everyday actions and more dramatic measures like escape and rebellion.
