Alright, so I've been hearing a lot about how used car prices are going up. I'm not really sure why that's happening, but I want to understand it better. Maybe it has something to do with the economy or supply and demand or something like that. I think I should look into it more carefully.

First off, I know that supply and demand is a big factor in pricing. If there's high demand for something and low supply, prices tend to go up. So, maybe there are fewer used cars available right now, or maybe more people want to buy them. I need to figure out which one is true or if both are happening.

I should probably look up some data on used car sales and prices to see what's been going on recently. Maybe compare it to previous years to see if this is a normal fluctuation or something more significant.

Also, I've heard about chip shortages affecting the automotive industry. I think that's mostly for new cars, but could it also be impacting used car prices? If new car production is down because of missing chips, maybe more people are turning to used cars, increasing demand.

Another thing I've noticed is that during the pandemic, a lot of people changed their commuting habits or started working from home. Maybe that's affecting the demand for cars. If fewer people need cars for commuting, maybe demand is down, which would typically lead to lower prices. But that seems contrary to what's happening.

Wait, no. If more people are working from home, they might not need to commute as much, but they still need cars for other purposes like running errands, vacations, etc. So maybe the impact isn't as straightforward.

I should also consider interest rates. If interest rates are low, borrowing money to buy a car is cheaper, which could increase demand for used cars. On the other hand, if interest rates are high, that could抑制 demand.

Hmm, I'm not sure about the current interest rates. Maybe I should look that up as well.

Additionally, the overall health of the economy could be a factor. If people are doing well financially, they might be more willing to spend on big ticket items like used cars.

I should also think about the condition of used cars. Are they generally holding their value better now? Maybe maintenance costs are higher, so people are keeping their cars longer before selling them.

Alternatively, maybe there's been an increase in the number of people selling their used cars, flooding the market and driving prices down. But that contradicts the initial statement that prices are rising.

Wait, no, if there are more used cars available, that would increase supply, which should drive prices down, not up. So maybe that's not the case.

Let me try to summarize what I think might be happening:

1. Demand for used cars is high.

2. Supply of used cars is low.

3. Therefore, prices go up.

So, I need to find out why demand is high and supply is low.

First, why is demand high?

- Maybe more people need cars for various reasons, like reduced public transportation options during the pandemic.

- Perhaps people are favoring used cars over new ones for cost reasons.

- Could be that used cars are perceived as more reliable or better value.

Second, why is supply low?

- Maybe fewer people are trading in their used cars.

- Or, perhaps there's been a decrease in the import of used cars from other countries.

- It's also possible that many used cars are being held back by rental companies or dealerships, reducing the available inventory.

I should look for data on used car sales, inventory levels, and any trends in the market.

Maybe I can find some articles or reports that discuss this issue in more detail.

Let me start by searching for "why are used car prices rising."

Used-Car Prices Are Surging - Consumer Reports
How to Navigate Surging Used-Car Prices
Used-car price increases are helping to drive the nation's rising inflation rate, according to government data

Used-car prices have continued their steady upward climb this year as new-car shortages put increased pressure on the used market. The most recent Consumer Price Index report, from August, shows that prices were up almost 32 percent over a year earlier, and a major used-car retailer tells us that prices have crept upward each month this year.
“We continue to see an upward trend in average used listings prices,” says Nick Woolard, an analyst at TrueCar, a Consumer Reports partner that tracks industry trends and provides a platform for auto listings. “In October, our average used list price is $31,676, which is up 29 percent compared to a year earlier.”
Woolard says that current used car prices are 42 percent higher than they were in the first quarter of 2020, before the pandemic caused widespread closures and market disruptions. The price increase has helped drive an overall rise in the nation’s inflation rate.
Lauren Donaldson, senior director of accounts at PureCars, a consultancy that advises dealerships on marketing strategies, says consumer searches for used cars are double what they were a year ago. That means the cars are being sold a lot faster. She advises that shoppers move quickly if they see a car they like.
“The silver lining for consumers is that even though prices are higher, your trade-in will never be worth more than it is today, and that may put you in a better position to purchase a newer car,” Donaldson says.
In good times and bad, Consumer Reports members can search our Used Car Marketplace for vehicles for sale in their area, sorting by the factors that matter most. The listings include CR reliability and owner satisfaction ratings, and there’s a free Carfax report for most of the vehicles. Members can also access ratings and information on used vehicles going as far back as 20 years.

The relatively high price of used cars was pushing many buyers toward new cars a few months ago, but now that a global semiconductor shortage has prompted many automakers to slow or pause production, new cars are more scarce.
Now even rental car companies—many of which sold off vehicles during the pandemic last year when car rentals and travel in general plummeted—are buying used cars just to bring their fleets back in line with rising demand.
The widely watched Consumer Price Index surged 5.4 percent in June compared with one year ago, the government said Tuesday, resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years. That follows an average inflation rate of just 1.4 percent last year, when the COVID-19 pandemic kept many people at home.
Donaldson says that as demand has surged for SUVs and trucks, dealers are more likely to negotiate over the price of sedan models, which have waned in popularity over the past several years. CR has found that typically, sedans tend to be more fuel-efficient than SUVs of equivalent size.
Check CR’s used-sedan ratings and reviews.
Although used-car prices are rising faster than new car prices, experts say the spike is a double-edged sword. Dealers are trying to snap up as many used cars as they can to satisfy customer demand, and that means you can get top dollar if you’re looking to sell or trade in.
Donaldson says that dealers are most keen on finding cars under 2 years old and that the 3- to 5-year range is the next most sought-after.
CR experts say that regardless of prices, the bottom line is that you should make a deal when the time is right for you. If it’s now, you can leverage your trade-in to get the best deal possible. If you decide to wait, know that future pricing is hard to predict, especially when global supply chain problems plague automakers.
Chip Shortage
The semiconductor shortage has put a pinch on the supply of microchip processors automakers need for new cars—the chips control everything on a car from infotainment screens to window motors. It’s the main culprit behind the current tightness in the new- and used-car markets, multiple experts say.
The chip problem is compounded by a year’s worth of pent-up demand from people who are starting to venture out again as the worst days of the pandemic appear to have passed, says Woolard.
“Experts are expecting this to drag on to the fall, and as far as where consumers can go for alternatives, there aren’t a whole lot of options,” he says. “Anyone who’s waiting for prices to come down might be waiting for a while.”
“If you need a car right now, they’re expensive, and unfortunately, all signs point to prices continuing to increase,” Woolard says. “It’s a great time to trade or sell a used vehicle—used vehicles are going up in value, and that doesn’t happen that often.”
The market will calm down eventually, but it may take some time. So if you want to buy now, do your research on current pricing and deals, and be open to considering several models to increase your chance of scoring significant savings.

This year's been a norm-busting time for a number of reasons, and used car prices are included. JD Power published a market update on Monday and delivered more bad news for used car prices: they're still rocketing upward. After a brief reprieve this summer, the latest data from October 2021 showed prices rose 37% year-over-year compared to 2020. In other words, used cars cost almost 40% more than they did this time last year.

The car market, in general, continues to suffer from major supply issues and the crux of the used car problems still comes from new car inventories. Automakers are churning out fewer new cars, leaving dealers with smaller stocks, so many buyers are turning to used cars instead. In turn, wholesale auction prices climb as demand rises for used cars, and the prices dealers charge also climb. Gently used cars from only a couple years ago can also be attractive to car buyers since they often offer in-demand features, such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, heated seats and more. And even with prices climbing, a used car is often still much cheaper than a brand new car.
JD Power foresees prices remaining high while automakers continue to work through supply chain woes into next year. However, we may see some fluctuations up and down.

Why the used-car market is sending American inflation soaring
Blame stimulus cheques, a shortage of new vehicles and rising demand for rental cars
Jun 15th 2021(Updated Jun 15th 2021)
Share
FIGURES RELEASED last month showed that American consumer-price inflation hit 4.2% year-on-year in April, the highest rate since 2008. Markets were spooked. Investors feared that higher inflation and interest rates could destroy asset values. Then, on June 10th, came worse news, or so it seemed. In May annual inflation rose higher still, to 5%. Prices climbed by 0.6% that month alone. But this time financial markets were sanguine. One reason could be that much of the inflation comes from a surprisingly small part of the economy: the market for used cars.
Economists crunching the latest inflation data have found soaring used-car prices to be the prime culprit behind the surge. About a third of May’s overall month-on-month rise came from the appreciating value of cast-off cars. According to official figures, from the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the prices of used cars and trucks have risen 30% over the past year. Many in the automotive industry think that is an underestimate. The latest index of second-hand values published by Manheim, America’s largest used-car auction business, suggests that prices have increased by 48% over the past year, and rose by 5% between April and May alone. Those of pick-up trucks have sped off fastest, rising by an astonishing 70% in just 12 months. Some Americans report that they are able to sell their cars bought a year or two ago at a profit. Ageing usually quickly destroys a vehicle’s value; not now.
So why are the sale prices of used vehicles soaring? The underlying cause is surging demand. Depressed sales during the first covid-19 lockdowns last year, when many would-be buyers feared for their jobs and many dealers were closed, are part of the story. Now pent-up demand is being unleashed. Thanks in part to stimulus cheques from the government, drivers have savings to spend. And for those who do not, low interest rates mean that car loans are cheaper than ever.
That helps to explain the direction that prices are travelling, but not their turbocharged speed. For that, look at the recent history of the car-rental business. When the pandemic began, travel stopped and almost no one wanted to hire a vehicle. With bills to pay, most car-hire firms were forced to sell their vehicles at fire-sale auctions. (That was not enough to stop Hertz, once America’s second-largest car-hire firm, filing for bankruptcy protection last May.) But now, with restrictions being eased, demand for hire cars has bounced back faster than expected. More commuters and holidaymakers may be going by car to avoid the fear of infection on planes and public transport. Carmakers have been unable to expand production fast enough to replenish rental fleets, thanks to a worldwide shortage of semiconductors. The hire firms are splashing their cash at used auctions, driving prices up as they compete for the limited vehicles available.
Cox Automotive, which owns Manheim, forecasts that used prices will continue to rise over the next months. That is hardly a surprise. Ford, America’s second-largest carmaker, recently said it expected to produce 1.1m fewer vehicles than planned this year—a fifth of its usual production—owing to the chip shortage. The North American assembly plants that produce its lucrative F-150 pick-up trucks are among the hardest hit, and they are exactly the sort of vehicles whose used values have risen fastest. Used-car prices will drop whenever the supply of new cars recovers, as it will eventually once the chip shortage has abated. But until then, get ready for more inflation scares ahead.

It’s Not Just the Chip Shortage Causing Used Car Prices to Skyrocket
Used cars have hit the perfect storm for soaring prices—but how did this storm get created?
By Wesley Wren and Keenan Thompson

Used car prices have risen dramatically because of a shortage of available new cars and a general increase in car demand.
Prices are expected to stabilize in the fall, but the computer chip shortage will play a role in the prices normalizing.
Decreased supply in fleet sales, repossessions, and  off-lease cars entering the used market is shrinking the supply.
If you’ve been shopping for a used car lately, you’ve probably been knocked into the Twilight Zone. Used car prices have climbed to unheard of levels, in some cases surpassing the vehicle’s original MSRP, which has effectively turned vehicles into an appreciating asset. This, by and large, is not normal.
“Well, it’s economy 101, supply and demand. We have elevated demand and short supply,” explains Alex Yurchenko, senior vice president of data science for Black Book. “Because of the chip shortage, there’s a shortage of new inventory. We still don’t see it in sales numbers. If you look at May, April, March, they’re healthy 2019 levels—so pre-pandemic. But what’s happening is that dealers are just selling off their inventory. Available inventory is just dropping fast, every single day,” notes Yurchenko. He also explains that available new car inventory is about half of what it was before the pandemic. That’s not good for car shoppers.
More About the Chip Shortage
Chip Shortage Affects Production on Many Vehicles
Yurchenko expects that the chip shortage will finally start showing up in the sales figures this month. With declining new car availability and no shortage of demand, there’s going to be a continued increase in used car prices. Of course, that’s already happening and is being reflected in their prices.
While it’s easy to point at the computer chip shortage as the problem, that’s only one component of it. Another reason for climbing used car prices is the short supply in that pool, as well. According to Yurchenko, “We still don’t have a lot of repossessions going to market, rental companies that typically sell hundreds of thousands of units a month. Right now they’re not selling anything, because they cannot buy new vehicles…so you have that shortage of used inventory that pushed prices up on the used side.”
Repossessions have not risen as had been expected.

Repossessions and fleet cars not reentering the market are having a huge effect on the used car price, but again, they’re not the only reasons for the decreased supply. President of the auction powerhouse ADESA, John Hammer, explains: “When we think about commercial inventory, the main supply channels for that really come from off-lease, repos, rental fleets, and then just other fleet customers. But off-lease cars, we have 80 percent of the supply actually flow through our platform, so we have really good insight into what’s going on the off-lease side. But prices have gone up so much in the market, there’s so much demand for those low-mileage cars, that they’re either getting bought by the customer or getting bought by a dealer before they’re even entering the remarketing channels and have an opportunity to go through the auctions.”
Hammer also touches on some of the supply issues as mentioned by Black Book’s analyst. “All of the stimulus money with government, it’s good for consumers, has really kept those cars out of the lanes. Repo rates are really low. We kind of expected repo rates to spike, but it really hasn’t happened,” says Hammer.

While this increased demand in used cars should increase the price of cars, it’s hard to believe that cars are becoming appreciating assets. “Normally what happens, though, is prices are somewhat capped by new cars,” says Hammer. “So you’ll see used car prices rise and rise, and eventually, they’ll just kind of cap out because they get so close to new car prices that people switch over to buying new cars. But with the new car inventory being so short due to the chip issue, new car prices are rising as well. Our economist tells us ‘it’s the perfect storm meeting the perfect drought.’ There’s a ton of demand and there are just not enough cars out there.”
That explains why these used car prices are rising the way that they are, but how long is this going to happen? According to Yurchenko, we could see things get better as soon as the fall. “In the fall, or close to Q4,” Yurchenko says, “the chip shortage still being the big question mark, but we do expect stabilization in prices.” While that’s good news in the future, Yurchenko does expect used car prices to keep rising in the summer.

Now that we know why we’re seeing the used car market go wild, we should take a look at how it’s actually affecting the movers and shakers—those who are passing those extra costs onto the consumer. The used car dealer is also fighting for inventory, as Hammer explains, “When cars do get in the lane, the dealers are fighting over them. So prices are as high as we’ve seen them. Dealers are shopping further away than they ever did. Bids are up substantially, nearly double per vehicle what we’ve seen in the past… dealers buying out of state is up almost double.”
This narrowing pipeline for inventory is making the dealers work harder for their cars, but that doesn’t mean that dealers are making much less. “Retail prices are much stickier—they don’t change as much,” says Yurchenko. “When the economy shut down last year and wholesale prices dropped by 7-8 percent in April, retail prices did not. The same is true on the opposite side. Right now, wholesale prices are appreciating much, much faster than retail prices. So for dealers, that margin is shrinking fast. Retail prices are increasing, but not at the same speed as wholesale prices.”
Yurchenko also explains that smaller dealers could be making more off wholesale inventory than retail because of the shrinking margins. Bigger dealers? They make up the difference with volume. For example, CarMax reported via email that it sold 100,000 cars in March. A company spokesperson echoed some of the reasons we’ve already outlined about why consumers are moving towards used vehicles, like a shortened supply of new cars and some extra cash. The CarMax spokesperson also mentioned that now is a good time to sell your car. At least, if you don’t need to drive it.

The Best (and Worst) Year-Old Cars to Buy
On a first-quarter earnings call, the folks at CarMax are reporting expectedly absurd results. According to the company’s resident and CEO Bill Nash, the folks at CarMax sold 452,000 cars in the first quarter, which surpasses last year’s first-quarter sales by 128 percent. Nash says the company also purchased 236 percent more cars than last year, and 77 percent more than 2019’s first quarter. This all means that CarMax is making the most out of this hot used car market.
This used car bubble won’t last forever, but it seems like it will be on here for a while—at least until the new car market starts to get back on its manufacturing feet. If the market stabilizes in the fall, which is expected, it should make chasing down a used car a little easier. Until then, it looks like you’re going to have to fight to find a deal on a used car.

Forecasting Used Car Prices in 2021
December 1, 2020 7905 views
The coronavirus has had a drastic impact on the used (and new) car market. For prospective buyers, understanding where used car prices are currently and what experts forecast for 2021 can help you decide if you should purchase a used car, purchase a new car or continue driving your current vehicle.
An overview of used car prices and factors that affect it
There are several key factors that affect used car prices. Understanding these factors helps when forecasting where prices will be in the upcoming year. Notable factors that affect the price of used cars are the supply and demand of used cars and the supply and demand for new cars. Let’s review the current state of both below.
The supply of used cars
The supply of used cars has dwindled in 2020. This is of course due in large part to the coronavirus, in which fewer people are willing to sell their current vehicle to dealerships because of various concerns. The lack of supply for many used car dealers has affected the cost of used cars to rise overall.
The demand for used cars
Used car purchases have risen to 85 percent in 2019, meaning that 85 out of every 100 cars purchased were used, and only 15 out of 100 were new. In 2018, used cars accounted for 80 of 100 purchases, and the number was only 77 out of 100 in 2017. We are seeing the number continue to grow in 2020, which increases the overall value of used cars. This is another contributing factor to the sudden and unprecedented rise in the average cost of used cars across the country.
New car supply and demand
The new car supply and demand (and subsequently the price) also affect the price of used cars. When new cars are in short supply, either because production is low or demand is high, the used cars will also become more valuable. In 2020 due to coronavirus, many manufacturers have cut back or temporarily halted the production of new car models, leading to a limited supply of new cars. This subsequently raises the prices of new cars, causing many more to look towards used vehicles instead.
The current status of used car prices
So what does all this mean as it relates to the current price of used cars? Well, this year the average used car has sold for substantially more than in previous years. In fact, the average listing price for used cars rose more than $700 from June to July in 2020, and the trend has continued into the fall as well. In other words, it is a definite seller’s market as it pertains to used cars. Of course, this is largely contributed to the coronavirus and the unprecedented moment we are living in during the pandemic, so the current status of increased used car prices does not necessarily suggest we will see the same trend heading into the new year.
What to expect with used car supply and demand in 2021
As discussed, the supply of used cars has diminished this year, and the demand has not had the same level of decline, leading to more buyers than there are available used cars (compared to previous years). The used car demand may pick up in 2021 as more people return to their normal lives and are more willing to spend money on a new vehicle, and the supply may increase as dealerships begin to focus more on selling new vehicles once production of 2021 increases.
Forecasting 2021 used car supply, demand and pricing
It is safe to assume that the automobile industry will return to normal once the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, which likely will not come until there is a safe and effective vaccine. As it relates to 2021 specifically, the used car prices are likely to remain higher than normal for the first half of the year.
With that said, the average listing price for used cars should come down slightly as manufacturing picks up for car manufacturers. An increase in new car production and demand will make used cars more of a buyer’s market. As 2021 progresses in the second half of the year, we may see a return to the same supply and demand of used cars that we saw in 2017 through 2019.
Forecasting used car prices in 2022 and beyond
Although the automobile industry may remain rather slow throughout 2021, we should see normal, or perhaps even lower than normal, car prices for 2022, barring any unforeseen circumstances. This is, of course, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we should be able to put behind us by January of 2022. When it comes to purchasing a vehicle, timing is crucial. In times of financial uncertainty, it is best to only spend on essential costs.
Our recommendation for prospective car buyers
Essentially, car owners have three options. They can buy a new car, buy a used car or keep the car they currently have. Considering the current price of used and new cars in 2020 and the likelihood that prices remain higher than normal in 2021, we recommend keeping your own car until the economy, and specifically, the automobile industry returns to normal.
Rather than paying higher prices for a used vehicle, consider fixing up your current vehicle instead. This may include upgrading the brakes, replacing all of the car lights (headlights, taillights, etc.) and scheduling a full engine tune-up. Particularly if you are happy with your current car, this is likely the best solution. With thorough maintenance, you should be able to hold off on purchasing a new vehicle for at least a few years, during which point the automobile industry should have returned to normal.
The bottom line
Used car prices increased in 2022. Although the trend may not continue at the same rate, used car prices should remain high throughout 2021, especially during the first half of the year. If a safe and effective vaccine is properly distributed in 2021, then you could start to see more reasonable used car prices as car manufacturers begin to produce more new vehicles and consumers feel more confident spending money.

Alright, so I've got these five documents here that talk about why used car prices are rising. Let me try to make sense of all this information.

First, from Consumer Reports, it seems that used car prices are going up, and this is contributing to overall inflation. They mention that used car prices were up almost 32% over a year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index. An analyst from TrueCar says that in October, average used list prices were up 29% compared to a year earlier. So, there's definitely a significant increase in used car prices.

The article also mentions that even though used car prices are higher, trade-ins are also worth more, which could help buyers when purchasing a new car. It seems like it's a mixed bag for consumers.

Moving on to the second document from MSN Autos. It says that used car prices are up 37% year-over-year as of October 2021, according to JD Power. So, that's a pretty substantial jump. The article attributes this to supply constraints, primarily due to the semiconductor shortage affecting new car production. Because there are fewer new cars available, more people are turning to used cars, driving up demand and prices.

Interesting, so both sources point to the semiconductor shortage impacting new car production, which in turn affects used car markets.

The third document is from The Economist. It delves deeper into why used car prices are soaring and links it to stimulus cheques, a shortage of new vehicles, and rising demand for rental cars. So, in addition to the semiconductor shortage, there's also the factor of increased demand from consumers who have more disposable income due to government stimulus.

The rental car sector is also playing a role. During the pandemic, many rental companies sold off their vehicles because of decreased demand for rentals. Now, as travel is picking up, these companies are trying to replenish their fleets but are facing difficulties because of the chip shortage limiting new car production. Therefore, they're competing in the used car market, driving prices up further.

That makes sense. So, not only are individual consumers seeking used cars, but rental companies are also bidding up prices to acquire vehicles.

Document four is from Autoweek. It echoes similar points: the chip shortage is reducing new car supply, leading to increased demand for used cars. The article also mentions that there's a shortage of used cars entering the market because of lower repossessions and fewer fleet sales.

It's interesting that repossessions are lower. Maybe people are keeping their cars longer because of economic uncertainty or because they're able to make payments due to stimulus funds.

Moreover, off-lease cars, which typically flood the used market, might not be available in the same numbers because of the chip shortage affecting new car production. If fewer new cars are being leased, then there are fewer off-lease cars coming back into the market.

Lastly, the fifth document is from Headlights.com, and it's a bit older, from December 1, 2020. It's forecasting used car prices for 2021. At that time, they were seeing used car prices rise due to reduced supply and increased demand. They anticipated that used car prices would remain higher in the first half of 2021 but expected a return to normalcy in the second half.

Well, looking back, it seems like their prediction wasn't entirely accurate, as prices continued to rise throughout 2021 and into 2022. So, perhaps the situation was more complex than initially thought.

From all these sources, it's clear that the primary drivers of used car price increases are:

1. **Semiconductor Shortage:** This has severely impacted new car production, leading to lower supply of new cars.

2. **Increased Demand for Used Cars:** With fewer new cars available, more buyers are turning to used cars, increasing demand.

3. **Reduced Supply of Used Cars:** There are fewer used cars entering the market due to lower repossessions, fewer fleet sales, and rental companies buying up used cars to replenish their fleets.

4. **Economic Factors:** Stimulus cheques and low interest rates have given consumers more purchasing power, further boosting demand for used cars.

Additionally, the shift in consumer behavior due to the pandemic, such as increased preference for private vehicles over public transportation, has also played a role in boosting demand for used cars.

It seems like a perfect storm of factors has converged to create this surge in used car prices. And unless there's a significant improvement in the semiconductor situation and a normalization of the economy, it's likely that used car prices will remain high.

But, as the Headlights.com article suggested, there might be a point where new car production increases, and the market balances out, leading to more normalized used car prices. Only time will tell.

In summary, used car prices are rising due to a combination of factors including the semiconductor shortage affecting new car production, increased demand from consumers and rental companies, reduced supply of used cars entering the market, and economic stimuli providing buyers with more purchasing power.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Used car prices are rising due to a combination of factors including the semiconductor shortage affecting new car production, increased demand from consumers and rental companies, reduced supply of used cars entering the market, and economic stimuli providing buyers with more purchasing power.}} \]
