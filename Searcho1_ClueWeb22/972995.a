Alright, so I need to figure out why the League of Nations failed. I don't remember a lot about it, but I know it was some kind of international organization formed after World War I. I think its main goal was to prevent another major war by providing a platform for countries to resolve their disputes peacefully. But somehow, it didn't succeed in preventing World War II. So, what went wrong?

First, maybe I should refresh my memory about what the League of Nations actually was and how it operated. I recall that it was established in 1919, as part of the peace settlements that ended World War I, particularly through the Treaty of Versailles. The idea was to create an organization where各国 could talk out their differences and cooperate on various issues like trade, diplomacy, and collective security.

I think one of the key problems was that the United States never joined the League. Even though it was largely the brainchild of American President Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. Senate didn't ratify the Treaty of Versailles, so the country never became a member. That must have weakened the League significantly, since the U.S. was a major world power at the time.

Another thing I remember is that the League lacked teeth when it came to enforcement. It relied on the concept of collective security, where member states would collectively respond to aggression by any one member. But in practice, countries were often reluctant to get involved in each other's conflicts, especially if they didn't directly affect them. This was probably due to exhaustion from World War I and a general desire to mind one's own business.

I also think that some key players left the League or weren't sufficiently committed. For example, Japan withdrew in 1933 after a dispute over Manchuria, and Germany left in 1933 under Hitler's leadership. Italy also left in 1937 under Mussolini. So, gradually, some of the more aggressive powers weren't bound by the League's rules, which undermined its effectiveness.

Moreover, the League seemed to have trouble dealing with aggressor countries. When Japan invaded Manchuria, and when Italy invaded Ethiopia, the League's responses were weak and didn't really deter those actions. In the case of Ethiopia, the League imposed economic sanctions on Italy, but they weren't very effective because some countries didn't fully comply, and crucial resources like oil weren't restricted.

I also recall that the League had some successes, like resolving disputes over Aaland Islands and Upper Silesia, but overall, it failed to prevent the outbreak of World War II. Maybe its structure was flawed, or perhaps the political will wasn't there when it mattered most.

Maybe I should look into specific instances where the League failed to act effectively. For example, during the Mukden Incident in 1931, when Japan invaded Manchuria, the League condemned the invasion but didn't take strong action. Then, in 1935, when Italy invaded Ethiopia, the League's sanctions were limited and didn't stop Mussolini's advance.

Another factor might have been the economic crises of the 1930s, like the Great Depression, which diverted attention from international affairs and fostered nationalism and protectionism.

I also think that the League's decision-making process was cumbersome. It required unanimous decisions for certain actions, which made it difficult to take decisive steps against aggressors.

Furthermore, the absence of permanent members with veto power, like in the later UN Security Council, might have been a drawback. While the veto can be problematic, it also represents a balance of power among major nations.

Perhaps the League was too idealistic for its time. The world wasn't ready for such a level of international cooperation, especially given the rise of totalitarian regimes that weren't interested in playing by the rules of the League.

I should also consider the perspective of the member countries. Maybe they saw the League as a way to preserve the status quo and protect their own interests, rather than as a truly impartial forum for resolving conflicts.

Additionally, communication and transportation were much slower back then, which might have hindered rapid response to crises.

I need to organize my thoughts here. Let me list some key reasons why the League failed:

1. Lack of major powers: US never joined, and later Germany, Japan, and Italy left or weren't committed.

2. Ineffective enforcement mechanisms: Relied on collective security, but members were reluctant to take action.

3. Failed to prevent aggressive actions: Manchuria, Ethiopia, etc.

4. Structural flaws: Unanimity requirements, no standing army.

5. Economic distractions: Great Depression.

6. Rise of totalitarian regimes.

7. Idealistic beyond its time.

8. Dependence on voluntary compliance.

Maybe I'm missing some points. Perhaps I should see what historians generally cite as the main reasons for the League's failure.

Wait, maybe I should do a quick search to verify some of this information and see if there are other factors I haven't considered.

ADVERTISEMENTS:
Causes of its Failure:
The League of Nations was the first major attempt as an international  organization of state to maintain peace and promote international co-operation.  But it failed. Some of the causes of its failure are briefly mentioned as  follows:—
1. The political background of Europe at the time of the birth of the League  was not very conducive to a peace organization. World War I had been fought  ostensibly to make the world safe for democracy, to end all future wars, etc.  But essentially it was an imperialist war for the division and re-division of  colonies.
The major powers namely the allied and the associated powers were, no doubt,  victorious but peace as it emerged was an imperialist peace. The secret treaties  among major powers were concluded at the very outset.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
The League of Nations was a part of the Versailles peace treaty. But men like  Clemenceau (French P.M.) and Lloyd George never wanted its success. Clemenceau  actually ridiculed the idea and said to Wilson, “I like your League of Nations.  I like it very much but I do not believe in it,” Thus the imperialist character  of the peace handicapped the League throughout its history.
2. At no stage of its history did the League represent the world balance of  forces. The U.S.A. never became its member and Russia stepped in only in 1934.  Thus its effectiveness as an instrument of the world peace suffered.
3. In absence of Russia and America, it was actually dominated by the  Anglo-French powers and became an instrument of their policy in Europe and since  these powers were not interested in peace so much as in maintenance of their  imperialist domination and destruction of Soviet Union, the League of Nations  never had a chance to succeed.
4. The League of Nations was founded on the principle of unani of all the  members except those who were party to a dispute. Thus every single member  including the smallest had the right to veto. This system had two very important  consequences.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
(i) A small power could very irresponsibly hamstring the League in its action  against an aggressor. For instance aid to Republican Spain and condemnation of  Fascist attack against Spain was prevented by a hostile vote of Portugal. The  small powers who could not have the responsibil­ity of maintaining world peace,  could yet wreck it.
(ii) The big powers very often used small powers as stalking horses from  behind the veto of a small member and thus escaped responsibility for a  particular decision before their own people and world public opinion.
5. The world was divided into two social systems-the capitalistic and  socialistic. The absence of Russia created a very real danger that the League  might be used against the new socialist state. Unfortunately this danger proved  to be real. The League which condoned fascist aggressions one after the other,  wasted no time in violating its very principles by expelling Soviet Union on the  question of Finland.
6. The spheres of activity of the Council and the Assembly were not clearly  defined. It led to confusion of responsibility.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
7. The responsibility for maintenance of peace was not securely placed  anywhere. The Council of the League which alone could shoulder it was burdened  with other responsibilities regarding minority treaties, mandatory territories,  etc.
Despite these flaws, the League could have been made an instrument of peace  if the powers dominating had wished it so. The articles of the covenant of the  League provided for economic and military sanctions against the aggressors. The  League failed because the leading powers never wanted a durable peace.

League of Nations was an abysmal failure. Here are the following reasons:
America’s isolation: The American president Woodrow Wilson made the organization in order to prevent any future war in Europe. Congress rejected the treaty and America was not able to be involved in it. It made the League of Nations quite paralyzed as the founding member was not involved and was not able to enforce the rules during crises.

Why did the League of Nations fail? There had to be unanimity for decisions that were taken. Unanimity made it really hard for the League to do anything. The League suffered big time from the absence of major powers — Germany, Japan, Italy ultimately left — and the lack of U.S. participation. The League of Nations was established at the end of World War I as an international peacekeeping organization. Although US President Woodrow Wilson was an enthusiastic proponent of the League, the United States did not officially join the League of Nations due to opposition from isolationists in Congress.

How could the League of Nations have survived to the present day or at the very least, be somewhat effective?
It couldn’t have survived. The League of Nations was idealistic and ultimately unfeasible. It’s primary goal was global peace through total disarmament. This was due to the belief that WW1 happened because of the build up of arms that eventually erupted into war. In the realist framework, the League was doomed from the start because of the need for states to be able to protect themselves. Additionally, the lack of any enforcement mechanism, as well as the fact that the leading super power of the time wasn’t a part of it further damaged their power.

Firstly it lacked it's own armed forces and even it depended on member nations or more precisely the great powers then to enforce it's resolutions.

Causes of the Failure of the League of Nations | Important
Causes of the Failure of the League of Nations
By Gk Scientist March 10, 2021 Political Science No Comments
Causes of the Failure of the League of Nations:
We have seen that the League failed in its primary objects of preserving world peace. Now the question arises as to what are the chief causes of its failure.
According to Anthony Eden, the failure of the league was due to two causes. The idea of one nation, one vote, led to Liberia being as important as the Soviet Union or Costa Rica as important as the United Kingdom. That was not a sound basis on which to found an international organization because it was not a basis of truth. The League, though conceived as universal, was in fact never universal. According to Potter, “The League of Nations failed in so far as it failed- because the peoples of Germany, Japan and Italy preferred to support their governments in careers of imperialistic conquest, and because the peoples of England, France and the United States discouraged their governments from taking effective action early enough to stem the tide of Axis aggression. The peoples and governments of totalitarian states were more responsible for the destruction of international collaboration under league auspices than those of the liberal states, but the latter must bear a large share of negative blame”. Again, “It was not the League of Nations but the Nations of the League which failed, in so far as there was a failure. The legal theory of organization was defective on this side, perhaps but this did not preclude action by the Members for effective promotion of security and welfare beyond what was required of them; it is probably true that they lived up to their obligations in the main but they certainly failed to live up to the ideals or the principles or the clear implications of the Covenant. The techniques of the Council and numerous conferences and even of the Secretariat were too ‘diplomatic’ but this was mainly because of the attitude taken by the government of the Member States. Certainly, the League did not fail because of any major defect in its general structure and even defects of individual organs. For what it is worth the conclusion can be adopted almost without qualification that the League failed especially in the maintenance of peace and security because its leading members, France and Great Britain, failed to support it with sufficient vigour in the Manchurian and the Ethiopian cases”.
Prof. Hans Morgenthau finds three weaknesses in the League- constitutional weakness, structural weakness and political weakness. However, the main causes of its failure can be stated as under-
Ineffective Machinery- The League of Nations did not have any effective machinery at its command for dealing with aggressive acts. It had no force for compelling agreements. It could only make recommendations to its member’s states for an economic boycott or economic sanctions against the aggressor. The rule of unanimity made the working of the League impossible because it was always difficult to reach it in the face of conflicting interests being present in the League.
Unwillingness of the Big Powers to Cooperate- Another cause of the failure of the League was that the big powers were unwilling to cooperate under the League Covenant. While Great Britain and France joined the League, they did not change their behaviour. Great Britain looked upon the League as a means to perpetuate the balance of power. France looked upon the League as a means to encircle Germany. The United States was not a member of the League and acted in its own interest.
Bad Foundation- The League failed because it had a bad foundation. In fact, it was a mistake to make the League Covenant a part of the Treaty of Versailles. From its very beginning, it was regarded as an association of victor nations, built up to execute the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.
Narrow Nationalism- The undesirable aspect of nationalism ‘as every country tried to save itself at the expense of the rest of the world’ was also a serious handicap in the successful working of the League. France was mostly interested in her national security, while Great Britain considered that problem less important than promoting British Commerce, Japan wanted to consolidate her position in the world scene at the expense of others. As a matter of fact, nationalism in its narrow sense had been the accepted policy of every state. So, this also proved to be a great handicap.
Economic Nationalism- Lastly, economic nationalism was also the main reason for the League’s failure. The desire for more and more territories and the craze for new markets became a mania with every state. So, this made the League’s work impossible and as such contributed to the League’s failure in achieving its primary object- the maintenance of peace and order in the world.
Treaty of Versailles
Treaty of Versailles: The Treaty of Versailles was the most important and most controversial of all the treatises signed after the First World War. On 28th June 1919, the representatives of Germany put their signature on this treaty. The very next day a German newspaper published an essay ‘Let us not forget’. Through this, it was said that Germany would try again to join the line of civilized nations and to revenge the 1919. It is believed that the seeds of the Second World War lay in these very words.

Answer:
The reasons for the failure of the League of Nations of 1920 include:
3. The League of Nations was created by the unpopular Treaty of Versailles
5. The US Senate did not allow the US to become involved in the League of  Nations.
Explanation
The League of Nations otherwise known as the Society of Nations was a global intergovernmental diplomatic organization aimed as maintaining and promoting world peace. It was established in 1920 by the Treaty of Versailles with its headquarter in Geneva, Switzerland. It was established after the first world war to encourage disarmament and prevent war and armed conflicts. However, the League of Nations failed to achieve most of its goals with the outbreak of the second world war. Some of the reasons for the failure of the League of Nations include: the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations was an unpopular one which was criticized by nations. Countries like the US and Germany did not welcome the idea of the treaty, so they refused to become members of the League. Also, the League of Nations ha no standing army to back it up. More so, some notable nations like the United States, Russia, Germany, etc. refused to join the League of Nations, thus this weakened League.

As stated by Wilson, ‘This treaty is nothing less than an organization of liberty and mercy for the world’ (Foley 1969:129) The intentions of the League appealed to many countries, especially as they were still raw from the war and favourable towards pacifism.
With the benefit of hind-sight it is easy to criticise the actions taken which led to the eventual failure of the League, however it is of much importance to establish the significance of the concepts that they initially determined. It is also essential to understand the different ways in which the whole ideology of democratic peace is perceived by idealists and in contrast realists, in order to evaluate and grasp the fundamental organisation of the League and varying perspectives on it’s failure and on it’s formation.
Although the intentions were arguably credible to begin with, the numerous weaknesses which crippled the League from the very start were hugely detrimental to the impact and prestige of the League. The failure to join by the U. S. A, the refusal to join by communist Russia and Germany being prohibited from joining vastly undermined the authority and strength of the League. Furthermore, ‘the League of Nations was shattered by insoluble conflicts between the major imperialist powers’ (North, 2002) The inability of the main powers to come to decisions invalidated the organisation and contributed towards the deterioration of the League. It has become common to argue that the League system of collective security failed only because the powers lacked faith in the principle’ (Stromberg 1956:250-263)
However, other factors which were consequential in it’s breakdown were, the general structure of the League and poor organisation, the World Depression to a certain extent and the general lack of enthusiasm reflected by its member states. The most identifiable hinderance to the League was the failure to join by America. This was not only externally damaging to its credibility but also meant that they could not depend upon the support of the U. S. A, which was a very powerful and influential country. The exclusion of three of the most powerful nations effectively reduced the authority of the League and deminished the basic premise of ‘collective security. ‘ Additionally, ‘The United State’s failure to identify herself with the League (because it) undermined the one noteable attempt at collective action- the feeble endeavour to restrain Italy’s attack on Ethiopia’ (Twitchett 1971:34) The division of the major powers restricted the effectiveness and decreased the severity of any action that was taken by the League.
Continuously the League of Nations under the Covenant was restricted to a certain extent in the action it could take if a dispute amongst any coutries occurred. They did not have an army and therefore were limited militarily and forced to depend upon enforcing sanctions alone. The idealistic/Wilsonian view which was fiercely favourable towards pacifism and peace failed to recognise the realist perspective which acknowledges the ambition and selfishness of each state, and thus the inevitability that member states would likely be unenthusiastic about actually enforcing sanctions upon offending countries, if it would adversely effect themselves.
A prime example of the failure of imposing sanctions would be in the Manchurian crisis, where many countries placed more importance upon preserving their trading links with Japan than acting in accordance with the assembly of the League, which ruled that Japan must withdraw from China. Consequently, the fear of provoking another war and unwillingness to sacrifice trading links alluded to the League doing nothing, and substantially failing to settle the issue or gain the confidence of member nations.
The organisation of the League itself failed once again to recognise that member nations would be unwilling to a certain extent to allow their fate to be determined by other countries. The idealist view over looks the avariciousness and ambitiousness which is present in most developed countries and fails to realise that their aspiration to increase in strength would surpass the goal of collective security. Furthermore, the structure of the League was weak in that, in order for a decision to be made it had to be unanimously voted for by the entire assembly.
Thus, conclusive and effective action was slow and difficult. Continuously, ‘it is true that the Court does not have compulsory jurisdiction over all the members of the League, and that the great powers have refused to submit to such compulsory jurisdiction’ (Harriman 1927:138) The lack of authority held by the Court meant that it was of far greater difficulty to ensure fair and definite decisions. Harriman further states, ‘the duty of enforcing the Laws of the League is left to the individual members. Harriman 1927:139) This suggests that the great powers such as Great Britain and France, who recognisably dominated the council had higher positions of authority thus indicating the inequalities which existed throughout the entire organisation. Additionally, the position of neutrality often manifested itself as indecision and so the reputation of the League was damaged by it’s unwillingness to take firm action against offending countries. The apathetic attitudes demonstrated by Britain and France contributed towards the weakening of the League.
The way in which both countries prioritised their own personal interests above those of the League insinuates that they were disinterested by the whole premise of collective security, which ultimately undermines the purpose, and diminishes the whole point of the organisation. The 1923 invasion of the Ruhr by France is an example of the disregard for the League of Nations. By taking action without consulting the League suggests that France either did not trust them, or felt that they would be indifferent to her decision.
This indicates that one of the main members lacked faith in it, and thus hugely degrades the entire purpose of the League. The Abyssinian affair is possibly one of the most renowned failures of the League as the corruption and betrayal of certain countries completely disregarded the basic idea of collective security, which was the basis of the whole organisation of the League. In 1935 France, instead of acting against Italy in order to protect Abyssinia signed a treaty with Italy in exchange for protection against Germany.
With Abyssinia desperately seeking support from the League, the first feeble action they took was imposing a ban on arms sales which had a far worse effect on Abyssinia than on Italy. Although the League agreed that they should act in order to help Abyssinia, they failed to impose severe enough sanctions on Italy and furthermore the emergence of the Hoare-Laval pact showed the League to be corrupt. From this point the League’s prestige was hugely damaged, and the actions taken by Britain and France highlighted their unwillingness to sacrifice in order to achieve collective security.
The failure of Britain to close the Suez canal to Italy and the failure to impose sanctions which would have had a more severe impact correlates with the realist way of thinking which recognises the self interest of individual nations, even at the expense of others. After the Abyssinian affair, the League of Nations was largely dismissed as being ineffective. According to Dr. Peter Hough, ‘ The League was an irrelevance anyway, having failed to act against blatant acts of aggression by its member states on a number of ccaisions throughout the 1930’s (2004:32) In order to understand why the League of Nations failed it is vital to understand why it was set up to begin with, and to understand the realist and idealist ways of thinking. Although the League was, ‘established to maintain world peace, and spectacularly failed to do so’ (Pederson 2007:1-44) it did to begin with achieve some successes, for example in Upper Silesia and in Memel. However, when it was of importance the League generally failed to act efficiently.
I think it is important to recognise that the League of Nations was erected largely based on Wilsonian/idealist ideology, thus from the very beginning it failed to incorporate and predict that many of the goals of the League were too optimistic. Furthermore, the League was set up from the Treaty of Versailles and so it could be argued that the hostility and bad feelings which were felt towards the treaty were then reflected onto the League.
Thus meaning that regardless of the actions taken, the League was doomed from the very beginning as there was already a lack of faith and trust. Continuously, the Depression affected most countries and therefore had a detrimental effect on relations and so there was an increase in tension. This inevitably made the job of the League more difficult as it was a time of hardship and insecurity worldwide. I think that it has to be acknowledged that the basic premise of the League was certainly understandable, but it was far too idealistic and optimistic to succeed.

Alright, so I've got some information here from different sources about why the League of Nations failed. Let me try to organize this.

First off, the League was established after World War I, as part of the peace settlements, particularly the Treaty of Versailles. Its main goal was to prevent another major war by providing a platform for countries to resolve their disputes peacefully. It was kind of like an early version of the United Nations.

But it didn't succeed in preventing World War II, which means it failed in its primary objective. So, why did that happen?

From what I'm reading, there are several key reasons:

1. **Lack of Major Powers:** The United States never joined the League, even though it was largely the brainchild of American President Woodrow Wilson. The U.S. Senate didn't ratify the Treaty of Versailles, so the country never became a member. This was a big blow because the U.S. was a major world power at the time.

   - Also, other important countries like Germany, Japan, and Italy either weren't original members or left later on. So, gradually, some of the more aggressive powers weren't bound by the League's rules, which undermined its effectiveness.

2. **Ineffective Enforcement Mechanisms:** The League relied on the concept of collective security, where member states would collectively respond to aggression by any one member. But in practice, countries were often reluctant to get involved in each other's conflicts, especially if they didn't directly affect them.

   - The League didn't have its own army, so it had to depend on member nations to enforce its decisions. But when push came to shove, many countries weren't willing to use military force to back up the League's decisions.

3. **Specific Failures:** There are a couple of notable instances where the League failed to act effectively. For example:

   - **Manchuria (1931):** Japan invaded Manchuria, and the League condemned the invasion but didn't take strong action. Economic sanctions were proposed, but they weren't very effective because some countries didn't fully comply, and key resources like oil weren't restricted.

   - **Ethiopia (1935):** Italy invaded Ethiopia, and again, the League's response was weak. Sanctions were imposed, but they didn't stop Mussolini's advance.

4. **Structural Flaws:** The League's decision-making process required unanimity for certain actions, which made it difficult to take decisive steps against aggressors. This is a big problem because even one country's veto could block action.

   - Also, the League didn't have permanent members with veto power like the later UN Security Council, which might have been both a blessing and a curse.

5. **Economic Distractions:** The Great Depression in the 1930s diverted attention from international affairs and fostered nationalism and protectionism. Countries were more concerned with their own economic problems than with upholding international agreements.

6. **Rise of Totalitarian Regimes:** The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan challenged the League's authority and made it harder to maintain peace.

7. **Idealism vs. Realism:** Some argue that the League was too idealistic for its time. The world wasn't ready for such a level of international cooperation, especially given the political climate.

8. **Dependence on Voluntary Compliance:** The League relied heavily on countries voluntarily following its rules and decisions, which wasn't realistic in a world where national interests often trumped international obligations.

Looking at these points, it seems like a perfect storm of factors led to the League's failure. The absence of key players like the U.S., the reluctance of members to take action, structural problems in decision-making, and the global economic crisis all contributed to its ineffectiveness.

I think it's also important to note that despite its failures, the League did have some successes. For example, it resolved disputes over the Aaland Islands and Upper Silesia peacefully. So, it wasn't a complete failure, but it definitely didn't live up to its promise in preventing another world war.

In conclusion, the League of Nations failed primarily due to a combination of lacking major powers like the United States, ineffective enforcement mechanisms, specific failures in key crises like Manchuria and Ethiopia, structural flaws in decision-making, economic distractions from the Great Depression, the rise of totalitarian regimes, and an overly idealistic approach to international relations.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The League of Nations failed due to a combination of factors including the absence of major powers like the United States, ineffective enforcement mechanisms, specific failures in key crises, structural flaws in decision-making, economic distractions from the Great Depression, the rise of totalitarian regimes, and an overly idealistic approach to international relations.}} \]
