So I've been given this question: "Should trial by jury be abolished?" Hmm, that's a pretty heavy topic. I need to think about this carefully. First off, I should probably understand what trial by jury is and its purpose in the justice system.

I think trial by jury is when a group of ordinary people, chosen at random, are brought together to listen to evidence in a court case and then decide on the verdict. It's meant to ensure that the judgment is made by a representative sample of the community, which is supposed to be fair and impartial.

But is it really fair and impartial? That's what we need to consider. Maybe I should look into some pros and cons of trial by jury.

Let me start by considering the advantages. One big advantage is that it democratizes the justice system. Since jurors are ordinary people from the community, it reflects the values and standards of society. It's also thought to be a check against tyranny because the jury can refuse to convict someone even if the law says they should, based on their own moral compass. This is called jury nullification, and it's been used in cases where laws were unjust.

Another pro is that it educates the public about the legal system. Jurors get to see how the courts work up close, which might make them more informed citizens.

Now, what about the disadvantages? One issue is that not everyone understands legal procedures or the complexities of a case. Jurors might make decisions based on emotion rather than facts. There have been cases where jury decisions seem questionable, perhaps because they didn't fully grasp the evidence.

Also, trials with juries tend to be longer and more expensive than bench trials, where a judge decides the case. Jurors need to be selected, instructed, and managed, which takes time and resources.

Moreover, there's the problem of jury tampering or bias. Sometimes, jurors might be influenced by external factors, like media coverage, which can sway their opinions before they even hear the evidence in court.

Another point is that high-profile cases can be particularly tricky because of widespread media attention, making it hard to find an unbiased jury.

I wonder if there are any systems where trial by jury has been abolished or is not used. Maybe looking at other countries' legal systems could provide some insight.

Let me consider some examples. In Britain, for example, they do have jury trials for criminal cases, but not for civil cases except in certain situations. In contrast, in大陆 China, they don't use jury trials; instead, judges decide both the facts and the law.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. In mainland China, they have people's assessors who sit with professional judges in some cases, but it's not the same as a jury. So, they don't have the same system of trial by jury.

I should probably look into how other countries handle this. Maybe seeing different approaches will help me evaluate whether trial by jury should be abolished.

Jury trials or panel of judges?
(in the US) There is no comparison. The only alternative to a

do not come into play unless/until a case reaches the Appelate
level of court, and in appelate court no jury option exists.
What state court has jury trials?
Civil courts allow jury trials based upon the individual
circumstances of the case such as personal injury/property damage
matters. In criminal matters the defendent automatically has the
right to a trial by jury (the exception is juvenile court). In
theory, all citizens have a right to a jury trial as provided by
the US Constitution; in practice this would be almost impossible
given the number of cases filed in state and federal courts

In some ways, trial by jury may be the most fundamental feature of the American criminal justice system. But even in the U.S., the right to a jury is limited. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, the jury-trial right applies only when "serious" offenses are at issue. (For more, including the role of state law in affording juries to defendants, see The Right to Trial by Jury .)
Other countries further restrict the availability of jury trials, and others still have eliminated it. In 2014, a South African judge declared disabled Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide. Pistorius didn't have a jury trial because, well, there are no juries in the South African system. And back in 2009, The Economist featured a story explaining that some countries were expanding trial by jury while others were contracting it.
Despite the flaws in the justice system, many criminal defense lawyers in the States would say that U.S. defendants should consider themselves lucky—at least when it comes to the jury-trial issue. A popular perception is that defendants tend to fare better when groups of laypeople rather than single, potentially skeptical judges make the guilt/innocence determination. That isn't to say, however, that choosing a judge (or "bench") trial is always the wrong move. Above all else, though, it's a decision that should be made in consultation with an experienced criminal defense attorney. (For more, see What is the bench trial process?)

Some judicial proceedings, such as probate, family law, juvenile matters and other civil cases do not normally use juries.

The appellate courts do not retry cases or hear new evidence. They do not hear witnesses testify. There is no jury. Appellate courts review the procedures and the decisions in the trial court to make sure that the proceedings were fair and that the proper law was applied correctly.
Does the Supreme Court have jury trials?
The Seventh Amendment mandates juries in federal courts for cases that would have required them at common law. Yet the nation’s highest federal court has presided over a jury trial in only one reported case, Georgia v. Brailsford (1794).
Why is a trial by jury considered an essential right?
Why is trial by jury considered an essential right? It allows people to be judged by ordinary citizens like themselves. What can you conclude from the fact that the U.S. constitution can be amended? The founding fathers wanted to allow the government to change with the times.
What happens if all 12 jurors don’t agree?
If the jury cannot agree on all counts as to any defendant, the jury may return a verdict on those counts on which it has agreed. . . . If the jury cannot agree on a verdict on one or more counts, the court may declare a mistrial on those counts. A hung jury does not imply either the defendant’s guilt or innocence.
Do all 12 jurors have to agree in Chauvin trial?
The verdicts must be unanimous. All the jurors must agree for a guilty verdict. What happens if they can’t come to a unanimous decision? If a unanimous verdict cannot be reached, Judge Cahill may declare a mistrial.
How many times can a mistrial be retried?
There is no limit. A mistrial means that there was no verdict, so until the prosecutor decides ot stop trying the case, they can continue to go to trial. It is unfortunate, but unless the jury agrees they can keep trying.
Can you be recharged after a mistrial?
When the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, even if the prosecutor or judge caused the error that forms the basis of the motion.
Can you be found guilty after being found not guilty?
In the US, no. You are absolutely protected from punishment for the original crime. If you testified, though, you may have committed perjury. You may have committed related crimes that weren’t originally charged, which now your confession can come in for.
Can you be sentenced twice for the same crime?
The Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits anyone from being prosecuted twice for substantially the same crime.
Has anyone confessed from the stand?
No. The trope was first used in the old Perry Mason TV show in the US (1957-1966). I have been in the legal field since 1974 and have never seen this nor heard of it happening in real life. The place: crowded Trial session District Court.
Is there a trial if you confess?
Confessing to the police is not a legal conviction. It can GET you a conviction, but only by you appearing in front of a judge and pleading guilty to him as well. The confession by itself has little legal standing until a judge hears it and agrees that it is an honest confession to a crime that you committed.
Can a confession be used as evidence?
In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States or by the District of Columbia, a confession, as defined in subsection (e) hereof, shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.

Landmarks in law: how do you judge a case without a jury?
Covid-19 has led to a growing backlog of cases waiting to be dealt with by crown courts. Why are juries so important?

B efore Covid-19 struck, there were 37,500 cases waiting to be dealt with by the crown courts. Since the pandemic halted jury trials in March, that backlog has risen to more than 41,000. Restricting the right to trial by jury could be the last resort of the government to reduce the growing backlog of cases.
A limited number of jury trials have started again, but the need for social distancing means that many courtrooms are not large enough for jury trials to be conducted safely. The lord chancellor, Robert Buckland QC, and the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, have both indicated their willingness to temporarily replace jury trials with trial by a judge and two lay magistrates, for defendants charged with either-way offences (those that can be heard in a magistrates or crown court).

Some, including prominent human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC, have suggested that defendants should be given the choice to be tried by a judge alone – as happens in some Commonwealth jurisdictions, including Australia and Canada. Others see the idea of restricting the right to trial by jury as an attack on one of the cornerstones of British criminal justice.
Although only available to those whose cases are heard in the crown court, trial by jury has been a long-held tradition of British criminal justice for centuries, going back to Anglo-Saxon times when an accused could be acquitted if he found enough people to swear his innocence. The right was enshrined in law by Magna Carta, which in 1215 stated that no freeman should be imprisoned without the “lawful judgment of his peers”, and firmly established following the trial of William Penn and William Mead in 1670.
William Penn and William Mead were arrested for preaching in Gracechurch Street, London, in 1670. Photograph: Paul Grover/Alamy
The two men, who were Quakers, were arrested for preaching in Gracechurch Street, London. The recently passed Conventicle Act forbade gatherings of more than five to worship other than for services of the Church of England. But the jury of 12 men refused to convict the pair of “leading a dissident form of worship”, despite being directed to by the judge and imprisoned without food or water. They found the men “guilty of speaking” in Gracechurch Street”, and then modified their verdict to “guilty of speaking to an assembly in Gracechurch Street”.
The judge declared that the jury “shall not be dismissed until we have a verdict that the court will accept” and ordered Penn to be bound and gagged. Penn shouted to the jury: “You are Englishmen, mind your privilege, give not away your right.” The foreman, Edward Bushel, replied bravely: “Nor shall we ever do.”
After two days, the jury returned a not guilty verdict, prompting the furious judge to send them to prison for contempt of court until they paid a fine.
Those lawyers who oppose any move, even for a limit time, to permit judge-only trials believe it would set a dangerous precedent. They hold up the case of Penn and Mead to demonstrate the importance of being judged by a jury of 12 randomly selected members of the public.
Nigel Pascoe QC, a criminal barrister who has written a play about the trial, says: “It is impossible to overstate the importance of the case. It is the difference between an administrative judicial mindset which would exclude emotional factors and the instinctive judgement of our peers.”
In an action brought by Bushel, who refused to pay a fine, the chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas, Sir John Vaughan, said: “The jury must be independently and indisputably responsible for its verdicts, free from any threats from the court.”
It is that independence that underlines one of the key reasons for maintaining trial by jury, rather than having cases decided by professional judges.
Sarah Vine, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, says: “It is tempting to think that, because the behaviour of the judge in [Penn and Mead’s case] was so very outrageous, because the actions of both the defendants and the jury were so very brave, it can have no relevance today.”
But, she says, although judges may believe what they were doing is legally and morally right, that does not make them “invulnerable to prejudice, case-hardened cynicism or unconscious bias”. Judges, she suggests, are good at the law, but “singularly ill-placed to make the decisions entrusted to juries”.
Twelve ordinary citizens, on the other hand bring their collective life experience to the case. According to barrister Emma Fenn that is a “far greater shared experience than a single judge could possess” – and which in Bushell’s case allowed them to stand up to the pressure they faced.
Juries can arrive at decisions that judges and the public do not like. “The prospect of criminal trials conducted with an eye to public opinion and decided by a single, case-hardened judge is one which should be resisted at every turn,” says Vine. The near-anonymity of a jury also means that jurors are able to make decisions without fear of public opprobrium or retribution.
Landmarks in law: the Brexit court ruling that thwarted Boris Johnson
Read more
A judge alone, says Vine, can “never be regarded as a defendant’s peer” – for example, around 90% of the crown court judges in England and Wales are white.
Even more importantly, as Fenn notes, jury verdicts are the only stage in the criminal justice system where black or other ethnic minority defendants do not suffer adverse outcomes due to discrimination – findings supported by research by Professor Cheryl Thomas in 2010 and a review by David Lammy, now shadow justice minister, in 2017.
Although they were 350 years ago, Penn’s famous words are just as relevant today. “They should act as a sharp reminder that we should jealously guard our rights, however ancient,” says Vine. “Because there will always be those who want to remove, reduce or suspend them.”

Historically, renowned constitutionalist Joaquin Bernas, SJ noted in his Historical and juridical study of the Philippine Bill of Rights (1971) that “the ommission of the right to jury trial [in the American occupation which carried over to the present] “was doubtless due to the fact that “the civilized portion of the Islands had a system of jurisprudence founded upon civil law, and the uncivilized parts of the Archipelago were wholly unfitted to exercise the trial by jury,”.”

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered that trial by jury is a significant part of the American criminal justice system, but it's not universal across all countries or even within all types of courts in the US. Some countries don't have jury trials at all, while others have them only for specific types of cases.

First, I need to understand what trial by jury entails. It's a legal practice where a group of peers, usually randomly selected, listens to evidence presented in a trial and determines the facts of the case, leading to a verdict. This is contrasted with bench trials, where a judge makes all decisions.

Pros of trial by jury:

Democratization of justice: Jurors represent a cross-section of the community, bringing diverse perspectives and ensuring that justice is informed by societal values.

Protection against tyranny: Juries can refuse to convict based on their conscience, even if the law dictates otherwise, as in jury nullification.

Public education: Serving on a jury educates citizens about the legal system and the seriousness of legal proceedings.

Cons of trial by jury:

Potential for bias: Jurors may not fully understand legal concepts or may be swayed by emotions or preconceptions.

Time-consuming and costly: Jury selection and management can extend trial durations and increase expenses.

Vulnerability to external influences: Media coverage and other external factors can taint jury perceptions before the trial begins.

In some countries, like South Africa, jury trials are absent, and judges make all decisions. Other countries have hybrid systems or restrict juries to certain types of cases.

Considering these points, should trial by jury be abolished? Abolishing it entirely seems extreme, given its historical significance and the checks it provides against potential judicial overreach. However, reforms could address some of the drawbacks.

Possible reforms:

Enhanced juror education: Providing better training and resources to jurors to help them understand legal principles and evidence.

Streamlined jury selection: Improving the efficiency of selecting impartial jurors to reduce time and costs.

Protecting jurors from external influences: Implementing stricter rules to prevent media interference and ensuring juror privacy.

Alternatives to complete abolition could include limiting jury trials to more serious crimes or allowing defendants to choose between jury and bench trials, as is sometimes the case now.

In conclusion, while trial by jury has its flaws, it also serves important functions in the justice system. Rather than abolishing it, focusing on reforms to enhance its effectiveness might be a more prudent approach.

\boxed{\text{No, trial by jury should not be abolished, but it should be reformed to address its shortcomings.}}
