Alright, so I've got this question: "Are female-led relationships common?" Hmm, that's an interesting topic. I'm not entirely sure about the statistics or anything, but I do know that in recent years there's been a lot of talk about gender roles and how they're changing in relationships. So, maybe female-led relationships are becoming more common. But I need to back this up with some actual data or research.

First off, I should probably define what a female-led relationship means. I think it refers to relationships where the woman takes on more leadership or decision-making roles, perhaps financially or in terms of career advancement, compared to traditional male-led relationships. But I need to make sure that my understanding is correct.

Maybe I should look up some studies or articles on this topic. I know that there's been a lot of social change regarding gender roles, especially with more women entering the workforce and achieving higher education levels. So, it's possible that female-led relationships are becoming more prevalent.

Wait a minute, I should consider what constitutes a "female-led" relationship. Is it when the woman is the primary breadwinner? Or when she makes most of the decisions in the relationship? Or maybe it's about emotional leadership? These are all different aspects, and I need to clarify that.

Perhaps I should start by searching for statistics on women as primary breadwinners, since that's a concrete measure of leadership in the financial sense.

Let me try to search for something like "percentage of households where women are primary breadwinners."

CCF Brief Report: Mothers Are the Primary Earners in Growing Numbers of Families with Children
CCF Brief Report: Mothers Are the Primary Earners in Growing Numbers of Families with Children
A summary of forthcoming research prepared for the Council on Contemporary Families by Jennifer Glass, R. Kelly Raley (UT, Austin), and Joanna Pepin (Univ. at Buffalo, SUNY)
November 2, 2021
About 70% of U.S. moms can expect to be primary financial providers before their children turn 18.
In a substantial number of families with children, mothers, whether single or partnered, are now the primary breadwinner. More than 40 percent of American mothers solely or primarily support their minor children through their own earnings in any given year. For most of the 20th century, except in wartime, says historian Stephanie Coontz, women who were the primary source of their children’s income were generally unmarried, divorced, or widowed. But for the past two decades, the most rapid growth in breadwinning mothers has been among partnered women. As late as 2000, only 15 percent of primary-earning mothers were married. But by 2017, married women accounted for almost 40 percent of mothers whose earnings were the primary support for their families.[1]
These figures actually understate the chance that a mother will at some point be the primary economic support for her children, since they represent only a static cross-section of families in any one year. The number of years mothers primarily rely on their own earnings to support their children provides a better picture of children’s financial dependence on moms. In a study to be released this month in the peer-reviewed journal Socius, “ Children’s Financial Dependence on Mothers: Propensity and Duration ,” we use recent data from the Census Bureau’s 2014-2017 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to estimate a mother’s chance of ever being the family breadwinner over her first 18 years of motherhood, as well as the average duration of a mother’s role as primary household earner. We conservatively define breadwinning as earning at least 60 percent of her household’s earnings in the previous year.
We find that in the 18 years following the birth of their first child, about 70 percent of American mothers can expect to be the primary breadwinner in their household for at least one year. The average time such mothers can expect to spend as primary breadwinner is nearly 6 years.
The experience of being the family’s primary breadwinner occurs across all educational levels. We find that 62 percent of mothers without a high school diploma will support their households at some time during the first 18 years of motherhood, a figure that rises to 67 percent among those with a high school diploma. About 71 percent of mothers who are college graduates will at some point bring in more than 60 percent of household earnings, and a whopping 76 percent of mothers who attend college but do not obtain a degree will serve as primary breadwinners for their household for some period of time. These mothers also average a longer duration as primary breadwinners. Mothers with “some college” but no degree are not a small part of the population. Thirty percent of all mothers fall into this category.
Our findings demonstrate that many American children already depend primarily on their mothers’ earnings for their well-being, and that most will likely do so at some point in their childhood. The COVID-19 pandemic reveals the tremendous risks to children when mothers cannot earn money for their families because they do not have access to childcare and/or paid caregiving leave. In large part because of the lack of such supports, mothers have experienced job losses at over twice the rate of fathers in this crisis. For many families the economic consequences of mothers’ COVID-19 related employment interruptions will last well into the future, and research shows that even just a few years of economic deprivation or insecurity pose long-term risks to children .  It is time for policy-makers and social planners to recognize the near ubiquity of children’s reliance on their mothers’ earnings across all sections of the population.

U.S. Women Rise as Primary Breadwinners, Pew Study Shows

Women Rise as Primary Breadwinners, Some Still Face Challenges
Updated: November 17, 2020|Alanna Ritchie|Jobs
College-educated women are catching up with men in the workforce, but many other women, especially single mothers, are facing great financial challenges, a new report shows.
The Pew Research Center this week issued a report, titled “Breadwinner Moms,” that shows 40 percent of all households with children under the age of 18 are headed by mothers who are either the sole or primary income generator for the family. That’s a record spike from 1960 when women’s share was just 11 percent.
A total of 5.1 million of these women are married moms who earn higher incomes than their husbands and the majority — about 8.6 million — are single mothers, the study shows.
While the results from the Pew report are good news for married, college-educated women, who shared a total family income of nearly $80,000 in 2011 (generously above the national median of $57,100 for all families with children), the findings also showed that mothers raising children on their own earned a median income of about $23,000.
To put this in perspective, the 2011 poverty guideline for a single mom with two children was $18,530 in most states, which leaves 8.6 million single mothers in a difficult financial place that could worsen if they become unemployed and take on greater debt.
Women and Bankruptcy
Today, women make up nearly half the U.S. labor force; a drastic improvement from the 1960’s when women comprised a little over one-tenth of the work force. This increase in employment may be what is keeping women from falling into the kind of debt that can only be resolved with bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy will take a toll on your credit and the ability to use your money in the future. It plays havoc on your property, too, possibly preventing or delaying foreclosure on a home and repossession of a car.
A report issued in 2011 by the Institute of Financial Literacy, titled “A Five Year Perspective of the American Debtor,” shows the gap between women and men who filed for bankruptcy is shrinking.
That study indicates that in 2010, 52.26 percent of bankruptcy filers were women and 47.74 percent were men — that’s a 4.52 percentage point difference. It’s a sharp contrast to the 7.2 percentage point difference between the two sexes in 2006 bankruptcy reports.
There is a lack of current research showing why those figures followed that pattern or if they are continuing to decrease for women and increase for men; however, that report’s authors suggest that this closing gap could be a reflection of the U.S. population at that time. Women accounted for 50.8 percent of the population and men represented 49.2 percent of all U.S. residents in 2010.
The narrowing gap might also be a result of more women entering the workforce and avoiding the kinds of pitfalls that land them in bankruptcy court.
Some of these women might be finding alternatives to bankruptcy like debt consolidation or debt settlement.
Income Disparities in the Workforce
While men still account for the majority of the workforce, single and married mothers are stepping out of their homes to make a 13.7-million person dent, about 47 percent, in the workplace.
Despite closing the gap in the workforce, working women are making significantly less than their male counterparts. In 2011 the median annual earnings for women working full time, year-round was $37, 118. For men, the average earnings were $48,202. If you examine the gender gap in pay over a lifetime, women make $434,000 less than men, according to a fact sheet from the Democratic Policy and Communications Center.
Unfortunately, unequal pay may begin right at the start of your career. Just as they enter the work force, women are earning 7 percent less in their first year than their male peers, according to research from the American Association of University Women (AAUW).  The men and women in this study came from similar backgrounds and held similar jobs, but did not receive equal pay.
That difference suggests that gender discrimination remains a significant problem in the workforce. Unfortunately, the Senate did not pass suggested legislation in June of 2012, which was intended to prevent this type of discrimination.
The Paycheck Fairness Act would have legally required employers to be able to prove that salary differences between men and women doing the same work were not gender-related. If the act had passed, it might have brought us one step closer to avoiding debt and bankruptcy, but a 52-47 vote opposing the bill ended the discussion for now.
Making this inequity all the more distressing is the fact that this first year of employment is a crucial time, setting the standard for a future salary and potential raises. Additionally, many graduates must take the first fruits of their earnings to begin paying off student loans.
Yet, for every dollar men are earning, women earn 93 cents.
This AAUW study also accounts for the factor of choice, regarding how women pick majors, decide what field to work in and how many hours they will work. Previous studies that did not account for the choice factor found that women were earning 18 percent less than men.
The gender gap may be diminishing—revealing that women are taking financial steps in the right direction—but still have their work cut out for them if they hope to be paid their real worth.

Breadwinner Moms | Pew Research Center

Report May 29, 2013
Breadwinner Moms
Mothers Are the Sole or Primary Provider in Four-in-Ten Households with Children; Public Conflicted about the Growing Trend
Chapter 1: Overview
A record 40% of all households with children under the age of 18 include mothers who are either the sole or primary source of income for the family, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The share was just 11% in 1960.
These “breadwinner moms” are made up of two very different groups: 5.1 million (37%) are married mothers who have a higher income than their husbands, and 8.6 million (63%) are single mothers. 1
The income gap between the two groups is quite large. The median total family income of married mothers who earn more than their husbands was nearly $80,000 in 2011, well above the national median of $57,100 for all families with children, and nearly four times the $23,000 median for families led by a single mother. 2
The groups differ in other ways as well. Compared with all mothers with children under age 18, married mothers who out-earn their husbands are slightly older, disproportionally white and college educated. Single mothers, by contrast, are younger, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and less likely to have a college degree.
The growth of both groups of mothers is tied to women’s increasing presence in the workplace. Women make up almost of half (47%) of the U.S. labor force today, and the employment rate of married mothers with children has increased from 37% in 1968 to 65% in 2011. 3
The impact the recession may have had on this trend is unclear. 4 However, a Pew Research Center survey conducted in November 2012 found that mothers’ views about whether and how much they would like to work had changed significantly since 2007 (before the recession officially began). The share of mothers saying their ideal situation would be to work full time increased from 20% in 2007 to 32% in 2012. And the share saying they would prefer not to work at all fell from 29% to 20%.
A new Pew Research Center survey finds that the public remains of two minds about the gains mothers have made in the workplace–most recognize the clear economic benefits to families, but many voice concerns about the toll that having a working mother may take on children or even marriage. About three-quarters of adults (74%) say the increasing number of women working for pay has made it harder for parents to raise children, and half say that it has made marriages harder to succeed. At the same time, two-thirds say it has made it easier for families to live comfortably.
While the vast majority of Americans (79%) reject the idea that women should return to their traditional roles, 5 the new Pew Research survey finds that the public still sees mothers and fathers in a different light when it comes to evaluating the best work-family balance for children.
About half (51%) of survey respondents say that children are better off if a mother is home and doesn’t hold a job, while just 8% say the same about a father.
On the topic of single mothers, most Americans (64%) say that this growing trend is a “big problem”; however, the share who feel this way is down from 71% in 2007. Also,
young adults are less concerned than older adults about the trend. About four-in-ten adults under age 30 (42%) view it as a big problem, compared with 65% of those in their 30s and 40s and 74% of adults who are 50 and older.
The public’s opinions about unmarried mothers also differ by party affiliation and race. Republicans (78%) are more likely than Democrats (51%) or independent voters (65%) to say that the growing number of children born to unwed mothers is a big problem. Whites are more likely than non-whites to view it as a big problem (67% vs. 56%). The views of men and women on this issue are the same.
Data for this report are mainly from Pew Research analysis of multiple years of Census Bureau data as well as a recent Pew Research survey conducted by landline and cellular telephone April 25-28, 2013, among a nationally representative sample of 1,003 adults living in the continental United States. More detailed information about the data sources can be found in Appendix 2.
Other Key Findings
Both groups of breadwinner mothers, married and single, have grown in size in the past five decades. Of all households with children younger than 18, the share of married mothers who out-earn their husbands has gone up from 4% in 1960 to 15% in 2011, nearly a fourfold increase. During the same period, the share of families led by a single mother has more than tripled (from 7% to 25%).
The total family income is higher when the mother, not the father, is the primary breadwinner. In 2011, the median family income was nearly $80,000 for couples in which wife is the primary breadwinner, about $2,000 more than it was for couples in which husband is the primary breadwinner, and $10,000 more than for couples in which spouses’ income is the same.
Married mothers are increasingly better educated than their husbands. Even though a majority of spouses have a similar educational background, the share of couples in which the mother has attained a higher education than her spouse has gone up from 7% in 1960 to 23% in 2011. In two-parent families today, 61% have a mother whose education level is similar to her husband’s, 23% have a mother who is better educated than her husband, and 16% have a father who is better educated than his wife.
Most people reject the idea that it is bad for a marriage if a wife out-earns her husband. When asked if they agree or disagree that it is generally better for a marriage if a husband earns more than his wife, some 28% of survey respondents say they agree and 63% disagree. When a similar question was asked in 1997, 40% said they agreed. In the new survey, adults with a high school diploma or less were twice as likely as those with a college degree (35% vs. 18%) to say it is generally better for a marriage if a husband out-earns a wife. There were no significant differences between men and women on this question.
Today’s single mothers are much more likely to be never married than were single mothers in the past. The share of never married mothers among all single mothers has increased from 4% in 1960 to 44% in 2011. During the same period, the share of single mothers who had children from previous marriages has gone down from 82% to 50%.
Never married mothers have a distinctive profile. Compared with single mothers who are divorced, widowed or separated, never married mothers are significantly younger, disproportionally non-white, and have lower education and income. Close to half of never married mothers in 2011 (46%) are ages 30 and younger, six-in-ten are either black (40%) or Hispanic (24%), and nearly half (49%) have a high school education or less. Their median family income was $17, 400 in 2011, the lowest among all families with children.

Based on Pew Research Center analysis of 2011 American Community Survey, the unit of analysis is the household head, single mothers who are not the head of household (e.g., single mothers living with parents) are not included in the count. Similarly, married couples in which neither of the spouses is a household head are not included in the analysis.
The income gap between the two groups remains when using personal income as the measure. The median personal income of married mothers who out-earn their husbands was $50,000 in 2011, compared with $20,000 for single moms. Both personal and family income was self-reported. There is a small difference between the median personal income of single mothers and their family income. It could be due to financial contributions of other adult family members such as a cohabiting partner or a parent.

For a more recent version of this report, see “ Breadwinning Mothers Continue To Be the U.S. Norm ” by Sarah Jane Glynn.
Introduction and summary
In 2015—the year for which the most recent data are available—42 percent of mothers were sole or primary breadwinners, bringing in at least half of family earnings. Nearly another one-quarter of mothers—22.4 percent—were co-breadwinners, bringing home from 25 percent to 49 percent of earnings for their families. This represents an increase over previous years and is the continuation of a long-running trend, as women’s earnings and economic contributions to their families continue to grow in importance.
InProgress
Stay updated on our work on the most pressing issues of our time
The Center for American Progress first described the role of working mothers as breadwinners in 2009 with The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Changes Everything, in a chapter titled “The New Breadwinners.” 1 Authored by former CAP economist Heather Boushey, “The New Breadwinners” was among the first pieces of research to quantify the ways that women’s labor force participation has increased since the 1960s and what that means for families’ incomes. Boushey’s research focused on data that demonstrated how much likelier it is for today’s mothers to provide critical financial support to their families compared with earlier generations. While subsequent authors and publications have replicated her analysis in the ensuing years, often using slightly different definitions and variables, 2 this update will continue the trajectory first laid out in her original work.
This report updates Boushey’s original analysis of breadwinning and co-breadwinning mothers and a 2014 follow-up report from CAP—“Breadwinning Mothers, Then and Now”—using the most recent data available. While this newest report revises the original analysis, it also provides new analyses looking at differences in breadwinning and co-breadwinning based on race and place. Specifically, it dives deeper into differences between black and white mothers in the frequency with which they combine paid employment with family caregiving and the different ways that they contribute to their families’ bottom lines. Most notably, the report highlights differences in the rates of breadwinning and co-breadwinning among different racial and ethnic groups. It also explores how rates of breadwinning differ across the United States, looking at differences between states and between rural and metropolitan areas.
It is true that there are significant differences between groups of breadwinning mothers based on their backgrounds and where they live. But while there are differences across the country and within groups of women, one overarching fact remains indisputably true: With the majority of women working for pay, and their earnings being so vital to the economic well-being of their families, the days of full-time, stay-at-home mothers are long past. Women are crucial economic actors for their families, local communities, and the overall U.S. economy.
However, the fact that women are bringing home a significant portion of their families’ incomes does not mean that there is gender parity in the workforce, nor does it mean that working parents and caregivers have the supports they so vitally need. Issues such as the gender wage gap and a lack of policies such as universal paid family and medical leave, paid sick days, and workplace flexibility still hold women back from reaching their full economic potential.
It is a testament to the hard work and tenacity of women that they have reached the level they occupy today. However, there is far more work to be done to ensure that U.S. labor standards and workplace policies are updated to reflect the reality of the 21st century workforce and to ensure that the nation’s public policies are in line with the needs of today’s working families.
Changes in family type and employment patterns
As noted in CAP’s previous update, families in the United States look different than they did a generation or two ago. Married couples today are less likely to have children than they were in the past, and single-parent households are also much more common. In 1974, a married couple headed 84 percent of all families with children, while in 2015, only about two-thirds, or 65.5 percent, of families with children were headed by a married couple. 3 And from 1974 to 2015, the rate of families with children headed by a single mother nearly doubled—from 14.6 percent to 26.4 percent—while the rate of single fatherhood quadrupled from 1.4 percent to 8.1 percent. 4
Regardless of household composition and whether parents are married, the vast majority of adults with custodial children are in the labor force. While fathers have been very likely to work outside the home over the past 50 years, mothers’ labor force participation rates have not always been as high as they are today. In 1976, only 56.3 percent of married mothers worked for pay, compared with 69.6 percent in 2015. 5
However, changing family dynamics and increasing rates of mothers’ labor force participation obscure many differences between groups. Women of color have always been more likely than white women to work outside the home. 6 And while the majority of single mothers are white, women of color are more likely to be raising children on their own compared with white women. In 2014, 40 percent of births were to unmarried mothers. 7 And in 2013, 72 percent of all black women who gave birth and 53 percent of Latinas who gave birth were unmarried. Comparatively, 29 percent of white women who gave birth in 2013 were unmarried. 8
So while patterns of motherhood and employment look different for different groups of women in 2015, the same has been true historically as well. The narrative around breadwinning and the struggles of balancing paid employment with family caregiving responsibilities often is framed as if these trends are new. 9 But women of color have historically been much more likely than white women to be cast in the position of supporting their families economically while simultaneously providing family care.
Breadwinning mothers
It should not be surprising, given that so many women with children work outside the home, that the majority of mothers contribute significantly to their families’ bottom lines. 10 Married and unmarried, most mothers with children under age 6 and those with school-age children, regardless of race or ethnicity, work for pay. At the same time, single mothers, because they are the sole parent, are more likely to work than married women, and the employment rates of mothers increase as their children age and enter school. 11 As a result, breadwinning mothers are more common today in the United States than ever before. (see Figure 1)
In 2015, the latest year for which data are available, 42 percent of mothers were sole or primary breadwinners, bringing in at least half of family earnings. (see Figure 1) Nearly another one-quarter—22.4 percent—were co-breadwinners, bringing home from 25 percent to 49 percent of earnings. This represents a continuation of the previous trends seen in CAP’s research using data from 2009, 2010, and 2013. 12
As previously mentioned, deeper analysis shows that not all women with children have the same patterns of labor force participation—and these differences also contribute to different patterns of breadwinning and co-breadwinning across different groups. The remainder of this report explores how rates of mothers’ breadwinning and co-breadwinning differ across different races and ethnicities, as well as by U.S. region and state.
Working mothers’ breadwinning rates and family income contributions
In order to be consistent with CAP’s previous research, the author uses the same definitions for variables in this updated report as in the previous reports. The term “breadwinning mothers” refers to single working mothers and married mothers who earn as much as or more than their husbands. 13 In the initial 2009 research, first published in The Shriver Report, co-breadwinning mothers were defined as “a working wife bringing home at least 25 percent of her family’s total earnings.” 14 In 2015, 64.4 percent of mothers in the United States were either the sole family breadwinner at 42 percent or the co-breadwinner at 22.4 percent.
Race and ethnicity
As noted in the last report, the majority of breadwinning mothers in 2015 were white, with breakdowns as follows: 59.5 percent white; 17.3 percent black; 15.8 percent Latina; and 7.3 percent non-Hispanic mothers of another race. (see Figure 2) About two-thirds of co-breadwinning mothers—63.7 percent—are white, as are 62.6 percent of mothers with zero earnings.
However, the racial and ethnic breakdown of all breadwinning mothers is influenced not only by the employment and earnings patterns of women but also by their relative share of the population. While demographic shifts are changing the makeup of families in the United States, there are still more white households with children than there are households of color with children, and white families make up 56.7 percent of all families with children. 15 In this report, in addition to looking at the racial and ethnic breakdowns across all breadwinning and co-breadwinning mothers, the author analyzes the data within racial and ethnic groups to create a more detailed understanding of the dynamics at play.
Analyzing the data within racial and ethnic groups shows that among white families, white women are the least likely to be breadwinners for their families when compared with their black or Latina peers. Black mothers are by far the most likely to be the primary economic support for their families, both because they are more likely to be single mothers and because they are more likely—when part of a married couple—to earn as much as or more than their husbands. 16 The vast majority of black mothers contribute significantly to their families’ bottom lines, with only 14.6 percent of black mothers bringing home less than one-quarter of their family’s earnings. 17 ” (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010).] In fact, in 1970, black mothers were as likely to be the sole breadwinners of their families, at 36.4 percent, or co-breadwinners, at 22.2 percent, as white women were for their families in 2015. White mothers were sole breadwinners at 37.4 percent and co-breadwinners at 24.7 percent. During that same time span, black mothers saw their sole breadwinning share rise to 70.7 percent. While the increase in breadwinning among white mothers has been significant, the movement over the past 45 years has only brought them to the same level that black women occupied in 1970—illustrating how vital it is to center race in discussions of women’s economic empowerment and stability.
Latinas were more likely than white mothers to be breadwinners in 2015—40.5 percent versus 37.4 percent, respectively. However, Latinas were less likely to be co-breadwinners when compared with white mothers—18.6 percent versus 24.7 percent.
At least some of the differences in respect to breadwinning rates between different racial and ethnic groups are likely due to the fact that black women and Latinas are more likely than white women to be single mothers. 18 Slightly more than half, or 55.8 percent, of white breadwinning mothers are married and earn as much as or more than their husbands. 19 However, only 40.4 percent of Latina breadwinning mothers are married, as are only 25.3 percent of black breadwinning mothers. (see Table 1) The majority of black and Latina breadwinning mothers are single parents providing for their families.
Many women of color also have lower wages compared with white women. Furthermore, black women and Latinas experience even larger wage gaps compared with white men. 20 In 2015, white, non-Hispanic women earned 75 percent of what white, non-Hispanic men earned, while black women earned only 63 percent and Latinas earned only 54 percent. 21 These findings also reflect black women’s and Latinas’ historically high labor force participation rates, as women of color have always been more likely to work in the paid labor force than white women. 22
While data sample size restrictions prevent further exploration by race, other demographic characteristics are differently correlated with breadwinning and co-breadwinning. (see Table 2) Perhaps unsurprisingly, higher levels of education are associated with higher levels of breadwinning and co-breadwinning for mothers—likely due to the fact that women with more education tend to earn higher salaries than their less educated peers. Age makes a difference as well, with younger women being more likely to be breadwinners but less likely to be co-breadwinners, which is likely explained, at least partially, by the fact that younger women are more likely to be single mothers compared with older women and combined with the fact that younger workers earn less on average. Finally, women in the bottom income quintiles are much more likely to be breadwinners, and much less likely to be co-breadwinners, compared with mothers in higher family income brackets. This is likely due to the fact that higher-income families are more likely to be headed by two married working parents, since two incomes collectively tend to be larger than just one.
Region and state
In addition to differences by race, ethnicity, and other demographic factors, the author also found regional variation in rates of breadwinning and co-breadwinning mothers. (see Table 3)
Given the fact that highly educated and high-earning individuals are likely to live in the West or Northeast, 23 it is somewhat counterintuitive to find that mothers in those states are not more likely to be breadwinners or co-breadwinners compared with their peers in the Midwest and South. 24 In fact, mothers on the West Coast are the least likely to be either breadwinners or co-breadwinners. Mothers on the West Coast are also more likely to have zero earnings, compared with their peers in other areas of the United States. 25
While there are regional patterns, not every state within a region shows the same patterns. (see Table 4) For example, 4 of the top 10 states with the highest rates of breadwinning mothers are in the South—Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina—while Texas is squarely within the bottom 10. Mississippi, the state with the highest percentage of breadwinning mothers, is also the state with the lowest median family income, which may be driving at least some of this trend. 26 CAP’s previous updates have found that married breadwinning mothers are more common in lower-income families. 27 And families headed by single mothers are more likely to be low-income than married-couple families, in part because these families, by definition, contain only one working adult. 28
Finally, there are also small differences in the rates of breadwinning and co-breadwinning mothers depending on whether they live in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area. Mothers living in the central city of a metropolitan area were the most likely to be breadwinners for their families—46.9 percent, though they were also the least likely to be co-breadwinners—19.3 percent. Mothers living within metropolitan areas but outside the central city were the least likely to be breadwinners for their families at a rate of 39.2 percent, but they were equally likely to be co-breadwinners as mothers not living in a metropolitan area, at 23.8 percent.
Policy updates are needed
Most mothers work, and in most families, their earnings are important to their households’ economic well-being, yet a number of barriers continue to persist that prevent women from reaching their full potential for themselves and their families. 29 While some of these problems are rooted in sexism and outdated gender norms, the fact that the nation’s workplace policies have not been updated to reflect the nature of today’s working families holds back working women, as well as men who also have family caregiving responsibilities.
The negative impacts stemming from a lack of progressive workplace policies tend to fall primarily on women—especially mothers—who are the family members most likely tasked with bringing home a paycheck while also providing the majority of care to children and elderly family members. Mothers still provide the majority of child care and elder care, even when they are employed full time. 30 However, there are no national-level policies in place to ensure that working caregivers have access to paid family and medical leave and paid sick days. Change is necessary to ensure that workplace policies match the realities of today’s working families.
While a significant percentage of mothers are the primary breadwinners for their families, the gender wage gap still continues to drag down women’s wages, which makes households less economically secure. The average full-time, year-round working woman earns only 80 percent of what the average man earns, and the rates are even lower for women of color. 31 The causes underlying the wage gap are complex, but most of the difference between the overall wages of men and women can be traced to a combination of discrimination and a lack of workplace policies to enable workers to manage the dual responsibilities of wage earning while providing family care. 32
For example, the United States continues to hold its place as an outlier among the rest of the world by being the only advanced economy, and one of only a few nations globally, that does not guarantee women the right to paid maternity leave after the birth of a baby. 33 And the fact that the United States does not have the same kinds of family-friendly policies seen in other wealthy nations is a large part of why mothers’ labor force participation rates have fallen in America relative to other countries. 34 Currently, only 13 percent of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave, and the rates are even lower among low-income workers. 35
Thirty-six percent of private-sector workers, including more than 70 percent of low-wage workers, lack access to paid sick days that can be taken to recover from a short-term illness such as the flu or to take a sick child to a doctor’s appointment. 36 This lack of paid leave is not just a matter of inconvenience; it can have devastating effects on families’ economic well-being as well. Nearly one in four U.S. workers report that they have either lost a job or have been threatened with the loss a job for taking time off when they were ill or when they needed to care for a sick child or relative. 37
But solutions exist. Four states have passed laws to create their own temporary disability and paid family leave programs—California; New Jersey; Rhode Island; and, most recently, New York. 38 These programs have been shown to increase labor force participation and reduce reliance on public assistance. 39 While states have been leading the way, a national solution is needed to level the playing field and ensure that workers are not penalized for living in one of the other 46 states without such policies in place. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, or FAMILY Act, would create a federal paid family and medical leave insurance program to provide partial wage replacement when people need time away from work to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from their own serious illness or injury. 40
In addition, the Healthy Families Act would enable workers to earn up to seven paid sick days per year that could be used to recover from an illness, care for a sick family member, or access medical care. 41 Seven states—Connecticut; California; Massachusetts; Oregon; Vermont; Arizona; and Washington—and Washington, D.C., as well as dozens of cities, have already passed paid sick days laws. 42 Leveling the playing field for workers regardless of where they reside would ensure that no one has to choose between caring for a sick child and losing a job.
Mothers across the United States continue to increase their rates of breadwinning and co-breadwinning for their families. Long gone are the days when the majority of middle- and upper-income women stayed home to raise families full time. Instead, in most families today, either both parents work or the household is headed by a single parent. In 2015, roughly two-thirds of mothers were either the primary breadwinner for their families or earned at least one-quarter of their family’s income. While this number represents a new high, it is the continuation of a long-running trend.
Women, and mothers in particular, have entered the paid labor force en masse, and there are no signs of that changing. At a time when women’s wages are so vital to keeping their families afloat, America cannot afford to sit idly by and do nothing. It is time to update the nation’s labor standards and put in place family- and worker-friendly policies to ensure that all working families have the supports they need.

... Conversely, other research found that women in the UK were more likely to extend paid work beyond retirement age compared with men (Finch, 2014). One possible explanation of this continued labour market participation stems from the 'motherhood penalty'-when women reduce their labour market activity more than their male partners at the time of childbearing (Klesment & Van Bavel, 2015). Furthermore, these mothers often return to work on a part-time basis, juggling paid work with caring responsibilities and are therefore less able to accrue sufficient pension income (Budig et al., 2012;Grimshaw & Rubery, 2015).  ...

Despite consistently high rates of part-time employment among older women, the quality of this cohort's work is largely under-researched with the focus being mainly on younger women. To address this gap, our paper engages with the key strands of this debate—age, gender and employment status—to interrogate the job characteristics and position of this worker cohort in the Irish labour market. Findings reveal notable differences between this cohort's job characteristics compared with those of other part-time workers and older women working full-time. These job characteristics include low-wage employment in poor-quality jobs, suggesting that job quality is influenced by age, gender and employment status, raising concerns regarding the likelihood for precarious employment among this cohort. In addition to individual-level consequences, this study's findings have major implications for public and organisational policy on part-time labour market participation, highlighting the need for a new research agenda on older workers.

In Germany, women outperform men in educational attainments (Klesment & Van Bavel, 2015) and are at times supported by gender quotas (Schultheis, 2018). However, German women still perform more family care duties than men (Jurczyk et al., 2019).  ...

Studies on the content of gender stereotypes have been conducted primarily in the United States, while research in other, particularly non-Western, countries is scarce. In this research, we assessed and compared the content of gender stereotypes and self-characterizations in Germany—a Western European country—and Nigeria—a West African country. We asked 403 Germans and Nigerians to rate three target groups (either men in general, women in general, or themselves) on 74 agentic and communal characteristics. We found that Nigerian women were rated as more agentic and more communal than German women, while German men were rated as more communal than Nigerian men, but similarly on agency. On self-characterizations, Nigerian men rated themselves as more communal than German men, but again similarly on agency; Nigerian women rated themselves as more agentic and more communal than German women. Within-country comparisons showed that in Germany, men and women were perceived as similarly agentic and communal, while in Nigeria, men and women were perceived as similarly agentic, but women were perceived as more communal than men (by both others and when rating themselves). Further analysis on individual agentic and communal characteristics, however, showed important differences in stereotypes and self-characterizations of men and women in both countries that were obscured when looking at overall agency and communion. Our results show that gender stereotyping of oneself and others is complex and highlights the impact of culture on people's perceptions of gender.
... Using EU-SILC data for 27 European countries, Klesment and Van Bavel [2015] examined the reversal of the gender gap in education and showed that '… hypogamy positively affects the probability that she earns more than half of the couple's income. Highly educated women are much … more likely to be the main breadwinner than medium or low educated women, but this is particularly the case when their partners have medium or lower educational attainment'.  ...
Setting Social Status in Couples and Partners’ Budgetary Discretion in Central European Countries

The conventional optics of social stratification research—in which
the social position of the family unit is seen as being determined by the status of the male head of the household—have been challenged since the early 1970s. Similarly, economic research which views the household as a single unit has been questioned. Changing family circumstances and the increased share of couples in which the woman has higher earnings, education, and socioeconomic status mean that both these perspectives needs reformulating. The authors illustrate these issues using the European Union Statistics on Income
and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) for five Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria) and draw on its 2006–2016 time series to present the characteristics of partners in couples and the relations between them. Female primacy has increased either in earnings, education, or socio- conomic category in all countries except Hungary. The authors use the EU-SILC 2010 ‘Module on Intra-household Sharing of Resources’ to test the hypothesis that a direct link exists between partners’ social status
split and separate welfare status, where female primacy in relevant characteristics is taken as a proxy for social status split, while separate welfare status is indicated by partners’ budgetary discretion. The hypothesis is confirmed for Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, but not for Hungary and Poland. Apart from the personal factors of social status split, two family factors are strongly related to the probability of the budgetary discretion of couple partners across all countries: household income and marital status.
... In Germany and elsewhere in Europe, women are now outperforming men in educational achievements. For example, women obtain university entry qualifications more often and complete tertiary education more successfully than do men (Authoring Group, 2016, Klesment & Van Bavel, 2015. Despite these attainments, women still participate less than men in the labor market, 2 are less represented in senior management positions, 3 and are affected by a relatively large gender pay gap. 4 Such phenomena have primarily been explained with the ongoing traditional division of domestic labor, gendered labor markets, and gendered patterns of time use (Oláh, Richter, & Kotowska, 2014).  ...
... Against this background, the phenomenon of female breadwinningwhere the woman is the family's sole or dominant earner (Chesley, 2017)has gained in significance over recent years in Germany (as well as in Europe in general; Klenner & Klammer 2009; Klesment & Van Bavel, 2015; Wang, Parker, & Tylor, 2013). The proportion of couples with underage children with a female breadwinner in Germany has increased from 10% in 2003 (Destatis, 2015) to 12.2% in 2016.  ...
... 7 The proportion of female-breadwinner couples with children is much higher in Eastern Germany (23.9%) than in Western Germany (9.6%) 8 -a fact, which has partly been attributed to historically higher levels of female employment coupled with higher male unemployment rates since reunification in the East (Klammer, Neukirch, & Weßler-Poßberg, 2012). The proportion of breadwinning mothers rises with the age of the youngest child in the household (Klesment & Van Bavel, 2015). Higher qualifications increase the probability of female breadwinning, although a considerable proportion of female breadwinners have mid-level professional qualifications (Klammer et al., 2012).  ...

Female breadwinning has recently gained in significance in Germany. This article examines the extent to which female breadwinning is linked to new gender roles, and the impacts the role reversal may have on families’ everyday lives. Qualitative interviews with female breadwinners living in Western Germany were conducted to explore families’ ways of doing gender and doing family as an interrelated process. The research examined, first, the female-breadwinner families’ division of employment and domestic labor and second, the relationship between individual gender self-concepts and factual income arrangements. Some examples of modernization of gender roles and arrangements in everyday life in female-breadwinner families were found, but traditional gender concepts and practices prevailed. The families achieved doing family results comparable to couples with other breadwinning arrangements, but this demanded extraordinary efforts. We reconstructed “practices of normalization,” which couples used to reassure themselves and others of their “normalness” despite their gender-atypical roles.
... Furthermore, Klesment and Van Bavel [27] finds that highly educated mothers of school-age children whose husbands are less educated are more likely to be the main breadwinner compared to highly educated mothers without children whose husbands are also highly educated. This is in line with Konietza and Kreyenfeld [28] who found that in German couples, women experience less economic pressure to seek employment when they live with a highly educated spouse.  ...
... Meanwhile, only 1.7 percent husbands work as unpaid family workers, and the rest work as paid employees. Klesment van Bavel [27] found a positive probability that a women who is more educated than her husband earns more than her husband.1 However, in the case of Indonesia, a large number of wives work for their family without being paid, and 84.4 percent of them are low educated.  ...

... For the first time in European history, there are more highly educated women than men reaching the reproductive ages (Klesment & Van Bavel, 2015; Van Bavel, 2012). Due to this changing educational balance as well as the rise in unemployment in male dominated employment sectors, the prevalence of work-family constellations with female main wage earners has increased (Vitali & Mendola, 2014) 1 .  ...

Although young couples increasingly divide paid and unpaid work equally, the transition to parenthood is associated with the production of gender inequality. Given the rising prevalence of female breadwinner households in Europe, this paper assesses whether the parenthood effect on gender inequality in employment is counteracted in couples where women were the main income providers before the onset of family formation. Using longitudinal micro-data (1999–2010) from the Belgian Crossroads Bank for Social Security and the National Register, population-averaged logit models assess the effect of pre-birth relative earnings on parental employment strategies following the transition to parenthood. Results indicate that a female main earner constellation positively relates to egalitarian and female-oriented employment strategies. Although pre-birth relative earnings affect the magnitude of the negative relationship between parenthood and gender inequality in paid work, male-oriented parental employment strategies continue to occur most, even among female main earner couples. Hence, variation in pre-birth relative earnings cannot fully account for the rise in gender inequality in employment following the transition to parenthood, suggesting that cultural as well as structural factors limit parents to opt for an egalitarian employment division.
... The gender gap in Hungary regarding the number of those with tertiary education is also below average and has the median value among the EU-27. Klesment and Van Bavel (2015), using EU-SILC data, report that the share of women of age 25-45 years with a 'breadwinning role' (she earns 51-100 per cent of the couple income) ranges from 14.5 to 33.9 per cent in Europe with an average of 21.9 per cent. In Hungary, 23.4 per cent of the women earn more than their partners that places the country 11th of 27 countries.  ...

This article examines the relationship between intra-couple income distribution and subjective well-being, using nationally representative data from Hungary. We show that the association between the woman’s relative income (WRI) (the woman’s share of the couple’s total income) and life satisfaction is negative not only for men but for women as well. Because we control for financial disadvantages on the individual and household level, as well as for socio-economic and job characteristics of the respondent and their partner, the result can be interpreted as the impact of traditional gender roles and the persistence of the traditional male breadwinner mentality. In addition, we show that gender norms moderate this negative association. Among those with low levels of traditional norms, the WRI has no effect on life satisfaction, whereas among those who prefer traditional gender roles, the negative association is stronger. Our results suggest that conflicts between the gender norms and the social and economic reality reduce life satisfaction.
... The reversal of gender inequality has also resulted in remarkable shifts in educational pairing: educational hypergamy (women marrying up) is declining while homogamy and hypogamy (women marrying down) are becoming more prevalent (Esteve et al. 2012). In a study of Klesment and Van Bavel (2015), based on EU-SILC data, educationally homogamous couples constitute more than half of the sample and the share of hypogamous couples exceeds that of hypergamous couples (except for Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Romania). Between 2007 and 2011 the proportion of highly educated homogamous couples increased similarly to the share of hypogamous partnerships with highly educated woman.  ...
The New Roles of Men and Women and Implications for Families and Societies

This keynote chapter presents main research findings on new gender roles and their implications for families and societies. It first depicts the development of family forms in Europe over the past fifty years, with a focus on increasingly diverse family biographies and the changes in the roles of women and men. It highlights that changes in women’s role have been more comprehensive, whereas in most countries the transformation of the male role has barely started. Next, views in contemporary scholarship on the interplay between the increasing family complexity and gender role changes are addressed. A detailed discussion of new challenges of transitions in and organization of family life follows, with a focus on four main topics: women’s new role and the implications for family dynamics, the gendered transition to parenthood, new gender roles in doing families, and coping strategies in family and work reconciliation under conditions of uncertainty and precariousness and impacts on fertility. A brief conclusion ends this chapter.
... In other cases, depending on which parent was interviewed, one of the two grandfathers is simply used as the representative of grandparental education. In practice this will often be similar to the dominance approach as, until recently, grandfathers were more likely to be more highly educated than grandmothers, but the gender gap in higher education is changing rapidly (Klesment and Van Bavel, 2015) making this approach increasingly less valid. Data limitations often make it impossible to differentiate between different grandparents or parents, but to advance our understanding of the G1-G3 association, information on all members of G1 and G2 is needed.  ...
... While our G1-G3 association remains significant, the inclusion of mother's education dramatically reduces the sizes of the associations of both the grandfathers and the father. This is an important finding in itself, as future multigenerational research will have to take into account mothers' and grandmothers' education, given the fact that the distribution of women's education is rapidly changing (Klesment and Van Bavel, 2015). The mothers (G2) in the SHARE sample we use here are in fact today's grandmothers.  ...
The additive advantage of having educated grandfathers for children’s education: evidence from a cross-national sample in Europe

Until recently, research on intergenerational processes of social mobility has focused on two generational processes and paid little attention to the role of the grand-parental generation. An increasing number of studies have started to address this shortfall, but they report inconsistent findings. This may be due to design and measurement differences across studies and to substantive heterogeneity in the association. We use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to explore these two issues. First, as we have information on all four grandparents, and both parents, we were able to evaluate the different ways to model grandparental associations. We found that including information on both grandfathers provided the best fit, once controlling for parental education. Second, we investigated the moderating effects of parental education, family size, and the grandparents’ being alive during the grandchild’s early life and school years. Having higher educated grandfathers is associated with higher educational outcomes for grandchildren, net of parental education and wealth. Moreover, having two highly educated grandfathers shows a stronger association than just one. We found no evidence for moderating effects of family size, parental education or generational overlap.
... Thus, this woman may be expected to have higher fertility than a woman whose partner has more resources than she does (Nitsche et al. 2015). Accordingly, as the female partner's bargaining power is highest among hypogamous couples (Klesment and Van Bavel 2015), these couples are expected to have higher fertility than other educational pairings.  ...
Do different educational pairings lead to different fertility outcomes? A cohort perspective for the Greek case
Article
Jan 2018
Christos Bagavos
The paper investigates fertility differentials by educational pairing in a cohort perspective. Based on Greek census data, the analysis generates empirical results in demographic areas that have yet to be fully explored, such as the quantum of completed cohort fertility by the partners' educational levels (particularly among homogamous, hypergamous, and hypogamous couples), permanent childlessness among highly educated couples and the completed fertility patterns by birth order across different educational pairings. The findings confirm the shift from the traditional pattern of educational hypergamy (women marrying up) to hypogamy (the woman is more educated than the man) and to medium and high educational homogamy. They also document that the differentials in fertility patterns by couples' levels of education appear to be related more to the tempo than the quantum of fertility, with the notable exception of the less educated homogamous couples; the completed fertility levels are significantly higher among this particular educational pairing than among the other educational pairings. The study suggests that educational pairing is likely to be an important topic in the investigation of human reproduction, particularly given that the increase in female educational levels and the shifts in traditional gender roles are leading to changes in fertility decisionmaking processes.

Okay, so I've got these search results. Let me see what I can gather from them.

First, there's a briefing paper from the Council on Contemporary Families about "Breadwinner Moms." It says that about 70% of U.S. moms can expect to be primary financial providers for their children at some point before they turn 18. That's a pretty high percentage. It also mentions that in 2017, about 40% of American mothers solely or primarily support their minor children through their own earnings in any given year. So, it seems like a significant number of mothers are the main breadwinners for their families.

Another article from Debt.org talks about how college-educated women are catching up with men in the workforce, but many other women, especially single mothers, are facing financial challenges. This suggests that while some women are making good progress in their careers, there's still a disparity, particularly for single mothers who might be struggling financially.

Then, there's a report from the Pew Research Center titled "Breadwinner Moms," which provides some statistics: in 2011, 40% of households with children under 18 had mothers who were either the sole or primary source of income. Among these, about 5.1 million were married mothers who earned more than their husbands, and 8.6 million were single mothers. The report also notes that the median total family income for married mothers who out-earned their husbands was nearly $80,000, compared to $23,000 for single mothers. So, there's a big income gap between these two groups.

Another article from the Center for American Progress discusses how the share of mothers who are sole or primary breadwinners has been increasing over time. In 2015, 42% of mothers were bringing in at least half of their family's earnings, and nearly 22.4% were co-breadwinners, bringing in 25% to 49% of the family's earnings. The report emphasizes that women's earnings are crucial for their families' economic well-being and that there's a need for policies like paid family leave and equal pay to support working mothers.

Lastly, there's a research gate diagram showing the proportion of women being the main breadwinner by country and motherhood status. It seems to indicate variations across different countries in Europe, with some countries having higher proportions of women as main breadwinners than others.

From all this, it appears that female-led relationships, especially in terms of financial contribution, are becoming more common. The percentage of mothers who are primary breadwinners has been increasing over time, and this trend seems to be consistent across various studies.

However, there are differences based on factors like marital status, education level, and race. For instance, single mothers tend to have lower incomes compared to married mothers who out-earn their husbands. Also, women of color, particularly black mothers, are more likely to be breadwinners, often due to higher rates of single parenthood.

Moreover, there's a recognition that despite these trends, women still face challenges such as the gender pay gap and lack of supportive workplace policies like paid leave, which can impact their ability to balance work and family responsibilities.

So, to answer the question "Are female-led relationships common?", yes, they are becoming increasingly common, especially in terms of women being the primary earners in their families. However, there are various dimensions to consider, including the socioeconomic status, race, and marital status of these women.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, female-led relationships are becoming more common, particularly in terms of women being primary breadwinners for their families.}} \]
