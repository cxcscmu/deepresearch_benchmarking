So I'm trying to figure out what would happen if marijuana was federally legalized in the United States. I don't know a whole lot about this topic, so I need to do some research to understand the current status and potential impacts of such a change.

First, I should probably look into the current legal status of marijuana in the U.S. I know that some states have legalized it for medical or recreational use, but federally, it's still illegal. So, if it were to be federally legalized, that would override the federal prohibition, right? But I need to confirm that.

Let me start by searching for the current federal law on marijuana. I think it's classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, which means it's considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. If it were to be legalized, it would need to be rescheduled or removed from the list altogether.

So, <|begin_search_query|>federal law on marijuana<|end_search_query|>

Federal Marijuana Laws
The federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. § 811), which does not recognize the difference between medical and recreational use of marijuana. These laws are generally applied only against persons who possess, cultivate, or distribute large quantities of marijuana.
Under federal law, marijuana is treated like every other controlled substance, such as cocaine and heroin. The federal government places every controlled substance in a schedule, in principle according to its relative potential for abuse and medicinal value. Under the CSA, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, which means that the federal government views marijuana as highly addictive and having no medical value. Doctors may not "prescribe" marijuana for medical use under federal law, though they can "recommend" its use under the First Amendment.
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), charged with enforcing federal drug laws, has taken a substantial interest in medical marijuana patients and caregivers in general, and large cultivation and distribution operations more specifically. Over the past few years, dozens of people have been targets of federal enforcement actions. Many of them have either been arrested or had property seized. More than a hundred are currently in prison or are facing charges or ongoing criminal or civil investigations for their cultivation or distribution of medical marijuana.
The DEA, like local enforcement agencies, can choose how to make the best use of its time. Ideally, the DEA will leave medical marijuana patients and their caregivers alone. But federal law does not yet recognize medical marijuana, and the DEA is currently allowed to use the Controlled Substances Act to arrest people for its use. In many pending and past cases, the DEA and U.S. Attorney's office have used exaggerated plant numbers and inflammatory rhetoric, as well as informants who trade jail time for testimony, to justify enforcing federal laws against medical marijuana patients and caregivers in California and other states.
Federal marijuana laws are very serious, and punishment for people found guilty is frequently very steep. Federal law still considers marijuana a dangerous illegal drug with no acceptable medicinal value. In several federal cases, judges have ruled that medical marijuana cannot be used as a defense, though defense attorneys should attempt to raise the issue whenever possible during trial. Federal law applies throughout California and the United States, not just on federal property. The key to federal property is that they are more likely than non-federal property to have federal officials monitoring it who will bust medical marijuana patients. Most likely, even if a patient is arrested and charged with a minor possession offense, he will be referred to the state authorities where he can assert a medical marijuana defense.
There are two types of federal sentencing laws: sentencing guidelines, enacted by the United States Sentencing Commission, and mandatory sentencing laws, enacted by Congress. The Sentencing Commission was created in 1987 to combat sentencing disparities across jurisdictions. The current mandatory minimum sentences were enacted in a 1986 drug bill.
Federal sentencing guidelines take into account not only the amount of marijuana but also past convictions. Not all marijuana convictions require jail time under federal sentencing guidelines, but all are eligible for imprisonment. If convicted and sentenced to jail, a minimum of 85% of that sentence must be served. The higher the marijuana amount, the more likely one is to be sentenced to jail time, as opposed to probation or alternative sentencing. Low-level offenses, even with multiple prior convictions, may end up with probation for the entire sentence of one to twelve months, and no jail time required. Possession of over 1 kg of marijuana with no prior convictions carries a sentence of six to twelve months with a possibility of probation and alternative sentencing. Over 2.5 kg with no criminal record carries a sentence of at least six months in jail; with multiple prior convictions, a sentence might be up to two years to three years in jail with no chance for probation.
In United States v. Booker (2005), a Supreme Court decision from January 2005, the court ruled that the federal sentencing guidelines (as outlined above) are advisory and no longer mandatory. However, many federal judges continue to give great deference to the guidelines.
In addition to the sentencing guidelines, there are statutory mandatory minimum sentences, which remain in effect after United States v. Booker and primarily target offenses involving large amounts of marijuana. There is a five-year mandatory minimum for cultivation of 100 plants or possession of 100kgs, and there is a ten-year mandatory minimum for these offenses if the defendant has a prior felony drug conviction. Cultivation or possession of 1000kg or 1000 plants triggers a ten-year mandatory minimum, with a twenty-year mandatory sentence if the defendant has one prior felony drug conviction, and a life sentence with two prior felony drug convictions. To avoid a five-year mandatory minimum, it is advisable to stay well below 100 plants, including any rooted cuttings or clones.
Conflict between State and Federal Law
As of this printing, the federal government claims that marijuana is not medicine and in Gonzales v. Raich (2005), the United States Supreme Court held that the federal government has the constitutional authority to prohibit marijuana for all purposes. Thus, federal law enforcement officials may prosecute medical marijuana patients, even if they grow their own medicine and even if they reside in a state where medical marijuana use is protected under state law. The Court indicated that Congress and the Food and Drug Administration should work to resolve this issue.
The Raich decision does not say that the laws of California (or any other medical marijuana state) are unconstitutional; nor does it invalidate them in any way. Also, it does not say that federal officials must prosecute patients. Decisions about prosecution are still left to the discretion of the federal government.
According to a post-Raich statement by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the ruling does not overturn California law permitting the use of medical marijuana. Lockyer also underscored the role of local law enforcement in upholding state, not federal, law. A superior court has rejected the County of San Diego's claim in a lawsuit filed against the State that California's medical marijuana laws are preempted by federal law. As of this printing, that case is pending on appeal.
States have recognized marijuana's medical value and have either passed laws through their legislatures or adopted them by initiative. In support of the numerous states that have taken responsibility for the health and welfare of their people, and have implemented medical marijuana laws, ASA is fighting for states' ability and right to pass and enforce their own laws, regardless of federal law.

What are Federal Marijuana Laws?
Both the possession and distribution of marijuana are illegal under federal laws on marijuana, specifically, the Controlled Substances Act. Federal law makes it illegal to use, possess, grow and sell marijuana. There is no exception for the medical or so-called “recreational” use of marijuana in federal law. Possession of even a small amount of marijuana is a federal criminal offense. Simple possession with no intent to distribute is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $1,000.
Almost all states and some municipalities have passed laws legalizing the medical and/or recreational use of marijuana use in recent years. Even growing and distributing marijuana is now legal under state law in certain states. However, if there is a conflict between federal and state law, federal law always prevails.
The medicinal use of marijuana is legal in almost all states in the U.S. today, although marijuana CBD oil, and cannabis oil are all still illegal in the State of Nebraska. Colorado may have the most liberal state laws regarding marijuana. In Colorado, it is legal to possess and use marijuana for medical and recreational purposes. It is legal to transport up to 2 ounces and legal to have as many as six plants growing in one’s garden for personal use, more if a person is a commercially licensed grower.
Generally federal law enforcement authorities do not prosecute medical or even recreational marijuana use as long as people adhere to the law of the state in which they live and do not sell marijuana across state lines.
In August of 2013, during the second term of President Obama, the Department of Justice released a memo which stated that the federal government essentially would not interfere with states in which laws had been passed to legalize marijuana to be used for whatever purpose, medical or otherwise.
During the Trump administration, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions had indicated that the federal government would pursue people in violation of federal laws regarding marijuana. As long as the laws are in place, the possibility exists that the federal government could choose to begin enforcing them.
What Amount of Marijuana Do I Have to Carry to be in Violation of Federal Law?
Possession of any amount of marijuana is a misdemeanor offense under federal laws. The question of how much marijuana is a felony only comes into play when a person grows or sells marijuana, but is not relevant when possession is charged.
Following is a list of penalties based on offense per the U.S. sentencing guidelines used by judges to determine the punishment for any amount of marijuana possessed:
For a first offense: misdemeanor, up to a year in jail and up to $1,000 in fines;
For a second offense: misdemeanor, up to 2 years in jail (with a mandatory minimum of 15 days) and up to $2,500 in fines; and
Third offense or more: misdemeanor or felony, up to 3 years in jail, with a mandatory minimum of 90 days, and up to $5,000 in fines.
So what is a mandatory minimum? Mandatory minimums are sentencing laws passed by Congress, which, as the name suggests, require a judge to impose a minimum jail sentence even if a judge were to determine that no jail time is warranted in a particular case.
.
This means that even if a judge should want to avoid jail time for a particular defendant based on the circumstances of their case, they have no choice but to impose the minimum sentence. Additionally, a person typically cannot seek parole before serving the mandatory minimum sentence.
What about Selling and Growing Marijuana?
Growing and selling marijuana is frowned upon by federal law. As one might expect, the penalties for selling or growing marijuana are more strict than the penalties for simple possession. The punishments for selling and cultivating marijuana are as follows:
Less than 50 plants (cultivating) or 50 kg (selling): a federal felony, up to five years in jail and up to $250,000 in fines;
50-99 plants or kilograms: a federal felony, up to 20 years in jail and up to $1,000,000 in fines;
100-999 plants or kilograms: a federal felony, 5-40 years in jail and up to $500,000 in fines; and
1,000 or more plants or kilograms: a federal felony, 10 years to life in jail and up to $1,000,000 in fines.
Sales to a minor or within 1,000 feet of a school, youth center, or other protected areas result in doubling of the above penalties. Also, repeat offenders are subject to increased penalties and mandatory minimums.
People convicted of selling marijuana paraphernalia are subject to a penalty of 3 years in jail. Simply possessing paraphernalia is not a crime; however, those caught with paraphernalia are subject to a charge of possession of marijuana, once the paraphernalia items are tested for marijuana residue.
What are the Legal Consequences of Marijuana Possession?
As noted above, marijuana possession charges are misdemeanors under federal law, however marijuana sentencing for possession involves both jail terms and fines. A first conviction for possession of any amount of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and up to $1,000 in fines.
A second offense is punishable by a minimum, mandatory sentence of at least 15 days in jail, but a sentence of up to 2 years in jail is possible. Whatever the jail time imposed, fines of up to $2,500 are also possible.
A third offense of possession of any amount of marijuana is punishable by imposition of a mandatory, minimum sentence of 90 days in jail and possibly as long as 3 years in jail, as well as a fine of up to $5,000.
What If My State Allows Recreational or Medicinal Marijuana?
When it comes to a conflict between federal and state law, federal law prevails. Therefore, while the state in which a person lives might have made it legal to use, possess, grow or even sell marijuana, a person can still be arrested by federal agents and prosecuted under federal law.
As noted above, current federal policy is not to pursue the residents of those states and municipalities in which certain uses of marijuana, e.g. medical or recreational, or even growing and selling marijuana have been legalized as long as residents obey state law and do not distribute marijuana across state lines.
Of course, federal policy can change with changing administrations in the nation’s capital, so people want to stay abreast of federal policy regarding marijuana use, possession, growing and distribution.
Do I Need a Lawyer for Help with Federal Marijuana Laws?
If you have been charged with a federal criminal offense in connection with marijuana, you should contact an experienced drug lawyer.
An experienced drug lawyer can give you reliable explanations of the possible punishment for the offense with which you have been charged. They can also negotiate a possible plea agreement with the federal prosecutor and prepare any possible defenses. You are most likely to get the best possible result in your case if you have an experienced drug lawyer representing your interests.

Federal Marijuana Law Guide - Marijuana and the Law
Federal Marijuana Law Guide
Marijuana was first criminalized in the US under the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, which was replaced by the 1970 Controlled Substances Act (CSA) that remains in force to this day.
The CSA classifies drugs under five ‘schedules’ determined by the presumed addictiveness and potential for abuse of the substance weighed against its medical value. As a Schedule I substance under the CSA, cannabis is considered to have no medical value with high potential for addiction and abuse, alongside drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
Conflicting Federal and State Cannabis Laws
Federal marijuana criminalization was largely uncontested by states for decades until 1996 when California became the first state to pass legislation – spurred by a voter-approved ballot initiative – to legalize medical marijuana. Under cannabis federal law, doctors in California couldn’t ‘prescribe’ it but they were able to ‘recommend’ it under the First Amendment.
This isn’t to say California’s medical cannabis program operated in its early years free of federal interference. Before it got off the ground, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) threatened to take action against doctors suspected of recommending marijuana to patients, while the US House of Representatives resoundingly approved a symbolic resolution against California’s decision to legalize medical cannabis.
Even as other states soon joined California in reforming their marijuana laws to recognize the plant’s therapeutic value and expand access to patients, federal law enforcement was frequently hostile to state-legal medical marijuana activity. Between 1996 and 2012, the federal government spent nearly half a billion dollars interfering in states’ medical cannabis programs. More than 500 raids and dozens of prosecutions were dished out against groups and individuals acting in compliance with state law.
These raids and prosecutions continued in spite of the judicial and executive branches of the federal government softening their approach, at least in rhetoric, toward state-legal medical marijuana programs. In a 2008 campaign pledge, President Barack Obama said he would not seek to interfere in state’s medical cannabis programs, while a 2009 DoJ memo advised “prosecutorial discretion” when it comes to enforcing federal law against state-legal medical cannabis programs.
The conflict between state and federal marijuana laws only started to seriously tilt in favor of states seeking to reform their marijuana laws in 2012, when Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize for recreational use and did so without significant federal blowback. On the contrary, the following year the DoJ published another set of federal cannabis law guidelines – the Cole memo – concerning states that had legalized adult-use cannabis. Its guidance echoed those of the 2009 memo regarding medical marijuana, yet federal agencies and prosecutors now appeared to take its instructions more seriously. Raids and prosecutions against marijuana operators in compliance with state law tapered off.
The advisory force of the two DoJ memos was strengthened in 2015 when the US House of Representatives passed a federal budget rider – the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment – prohibiting the DoJ from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana laws. While the vote didn’t change the legal status of cannabis and must be renewed every fiscal year, it marked – at the seventh attempt – the first time either chamber of congress voted to protect access to medical marijuana under state law. These protections were upheld in several landmark federal court rulings, such as the 2015 U.S. v Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana (Northern District of California) where the presiding judge ruled the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment “forbids the Department of Justice from enforcing this injunction against MAMM to the extent that MAMM operates in compliance with state California law.”
Not long after, the DoJ dropped its case against Harborside Health Center, a medical cannabis dispensary in Oakland. A few months later, state-legal medical marijuana operators scored their biggest victory yet in the August 2016 case of US vs McIntosh in the federal 9th Circuit Court. Not only did the judge order the DoJ to abide by the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment, he also ruled that in future federal prosecutors must prove at a preliminary hearing that the defendant violated state medical marijuana laws.
This tacit acceptance of state-level marijuana legalization, now by all three branches of the federal government, has taken the US past the point of no return. The heavy-handed days of enforced prohibition appear over in states that decided to diverge from federal marijuana laws. A rupture has now been established between the nascent state-legal cannabis industry and federal marijuana law that’s yet to be resolved.
Why Federal Marijuana Law Reform Is Both Necessary and Inevitable
While the federal government accepted that enforcement of federal marijuana laws is not desirable in states that passed marijuana legalization legislation, this truce is not a long-term solution. There are serious shortcomings to the current protections that will need to be addressed sooner or later.
This much was made clear when President Donald Trump’s first pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, decided to rescind the Cole memo in 2018, while Trump himself considered removing the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment from the 2021 federal budget. In practice, however, these episodes served only to prove the difficulty the federal government faces in rolling back newly-established protections for states that legalized cannabis. Trump quickly backed down while Jeff Sessions’ call for a “return to the rule of law” barely registered a change in states where marijuana was now legal. This is because the federal government is more or less entirely dependent on state police forces to enforce federal cannabis laws, and those police forces primarily act under the authority of state attorney generals who – at least in states that legalized marijuana – do not share Sessions’ zeal for enforcing federal marijuana laws.
So while the federal government cannot easily force a return to marijuana prohibition across the US, the de facto suspension of federal marijuana laws in states that opted to legalize is also not a tenable long-term proposition.
The Cole memo doesn’t automatically confer legal protections or rights on state-legal cannabis businesses or consumers if a prosecutor chooses to ignore the advice and pursue a marijuana-related conviction, however unlikely that conviction may prove to be. The memo also does nothing to ensure state-legal cannabis businesses can access banking and legal services, as those providers may fear federal reprisals. Marijuana businesses also can’t be sure of intellectual property rights, insurance protections or even the enforceability of standard business contracts without the support of federal law. Cannabis consumers in legal states also face repercussions with regards to, for instance, employment, naturalization, probation, parole and family law settlements.
There’s also the broader issue of inequity under US law. How can a person in one part of the country be serving a life sentence for an offense that another person engaged in the same practice in another part of the country is earning millions from? This discrepancy has led federal judges to refrain from following federal sentencing guidelines for cannabis offenses, with one judge who issued a reduced sentence doing so on the basis that the offense “bears some similarity to those marijuana distribution operations in Colorado and Washington that will not be subject to federal prosecution.”
If going back to federal marijuana prohibition across the US is impossible, and the de facto suspension of federal cannabis laws in states that legalized marijuana is untenable in the long-run, then the only option left is for legislative action on marijuana reform at the federal level.
Federal-level Marijuana Reform Efforts
In the years since these minimal protections for state-legal cannabis programs were established, marijuana legalization’s momentum has gone into overdrive. As of February 2021, 15 states have legalized adult-use cannabis, while 46 states have passed laws allowing some form of medical marijuana. This momentum is reflected both in nationwide polling on the issue which consistently finds majority support for federal marijuana legalization and its near-unanimous adoption by Democrats as a policy position, in spite of President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee’s hesitancy to embrace the measure.
This hasn’t gone unnoticed by federal lawmakers. Recent years have seen a flurry of cannabis reform bills submitted to both chambers of congress, such as the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act to deschedule cannabis from the CSA and the STATES Act to ensure state-level marijuana legalization is recognized in federal law. In 2018, President Donald Trump signed the Farm Bill into law which legalized hemp containing less than 0.3 percent THC across the US. In 2020, the House of Representatives included provisions of the SAFE Banking Act – passed as a standalone bill in 2019 – in its initial coronavirus relief package to ensure access to financial services for state-legal marijuana businesses, but these were removed from the final version following a standoff with Senate Republicans.
Most tellingly, at the end of 2020 the US House of Representatives moved to federally decriminalize cannabis when it passed the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act – the first time a chamber of congress voted to end federal marijuana prohibition. In previous years, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, it’s more than likely the MORE Act would now be lying around the upper chamber gathering dust. Now, with the Democrats in control of both chambers, there’s every chance of federal-level marijuana reform in 2021.

Marijuana - Federalism in America
Marijuana
navigation search
Share
In the twenty-first century, marijuana policy has been one of the primary arenas for determining the appropriate balance of power between the federal government and the states. This is because marijuana occupies a unique place in the American legal landscape – it is the only substance or conduct that, while prohibited by the federal government, is increasingly authorized, regulated, and taxed under state law. Marijuana policy thus provides a unique prism through which to view matters of federalism and states’ rights.
Since 1970, marijuana has been listed as a Schedule I drug under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Schedule I drugs are those determined to have no approved medical use and a high likelihood of abuse. They cannot be prescribed by a federally licensed doctor or distributed through pharmacies. The manufacture, distribution, and possession are all made criminal by federal law which impose significant punishments for large-scale violations. The Supreme Court affirmed the power of Congress to regulate (or prohibit entirely) intrastate marijuana production and possession under the Commerce Clause. Gonzales v. Raich (2005).
While state law traditionally mirrored the CSA’s treatment of marijuana, in the 1990's some states began to create exceptions to their criminal laws for those using marijuana medicinally or for those helping patients to do so. So-called medical marijuana laws were obviously inconsistent with the federal prohibition in that they permitted conduct criminalized by the CSA and even those actin in compliance with state law could be prosecuted under the CSA. Oakland v. OCBC (2000). Nonetheless, the number of states passing medical marijuana laws continued to increase, setting up a confrontation with federal policy.

In 2009 the Obama administration issued the so-called Ogden memorandum, designed to guide United States Attorneys around the country in responding to marijuana law reform in their states. (Ogden Memo (2009)). While emphasizing that marijuana remained illegal at the federal level, the Ogden memo stated that, generally speaking, enforcing the CSA against those using marijuana medically was a poor use of scarce resources. This memo had the unintended effect of accelerating the momentum of marijuana law reform as it appeared to signal a hands-off policy from Washington. Although a follow-up memorandum in 2011 attempted to scale back federal deference to state marijuana law reform (Cole Memo (2011)), it was too late. In 2012 Colorado and Washington became the first two states in the nation to seek to tax and regulate marijuana for all adults, not just for medical patients.
Following months of uncertainty the Obama administration ultimately elected to stay on the sidelines and allow state experimentations with marijuana law reform to continue. It stated that so long as state marijuana regulations were robust and dealt effectively with eight federal priorities, those in compliance with state law – whether recreational or medical – would not be the targets of federal prosecution. In 2014 Congress enacted a spending rider that has been interpreted to prevent the Department of Justice from spending appropriated funds to prosecute those individuals in compliance with state medical marijuana laws.
Although this appears to have resolved matters, the tension between state and federal marijuana laws has not disappeared. The specter of federal enforcement remains real, as was demonstrated in early 2018 when Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the previous administration’s policy of deference to state regulation of marijuana. But even absent federal enforcement, the states are far from free to put their pro-marijuana policies into operation. The continuing federal prohibition casts a wide shadow in the states. Because all marijuana conduct is illegal, federally-regulated banks are generally unwilling to deal in the proceeds of marijuana transactions, making marijuana a multi-billion dollar cash business. Furthermore, those who would use marijuana in compliance with state law risk losing their jobs, families, and government benefits because they are engaging in conduct that federal law continues to view as criminal.
Marijuana policy, then, remains a standoff between the state and federal governments. The states cannot be prohibited from liberalizing their own laws and cannot be compelled to help the federal government enforce its own marijuana laws. But neither can the states protect their citizens from the threat of federal enforcement or the collateral consequences of federal marijuana prohibition. And while the federal government has the authority to prohibit marijuana nationally and to enforce its laws regardless of state laws to the contrary, it lacks the resources, and perhaps the will, to take on an issue increasingly popular throughout the country and across the political divide.
It will thus require legislative change to solve this problem. Unless or until federal law is harmonized with the view of more than half the states, marijuana policy will remain a federalism flashpoint.

Five things you should know about federal and state marijuana laws

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 that U.S. prosecutors will enforce a federal prohibition on marijuana even in states that have legitimated the substance. The suggestion by the attorney general that the Justice Department may crack down on the drug alarmed both civil liberties groups and some local law enforcement agencies, since the Obama administration had made a practice of not enforcing federal marijuana laws against users in states where it was legalized.
Mr. Sessions has not settled the matter politically. Only a few days after his announcement, the Vermont legislature voted to legalize recreational marijuana use, making it the ninth state to do so (and the first to do so through the legislature rather than through a voter initiative).
Mr. Sessions has not settled the matter politically. Only a few days after his announcement, the Vermont legislature voted to legalize recreational marijuana use.
In the wake of these developments, here is a review of five major factors in the enforcement of marijuana laws in the United States.
The federal Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act, enacted in 1970, classifies regulated substances into five categories and permits federally registered physicians to prescribe drugs listed in all but Schedule I. The law lists “ marihuana ” as a Schedule I substance because Congress determined it had “a high potential for abuse,” had “no currently accepted medical use” and lacked “accepted safety.” It is illegal to prescribe, use, distribute, possess or cultivate any Schedule I substance except as part of an approved research study.
As a point of reference, tobacco, which is at least as addictive and harmful as marijuana and has no recognized medicinal use, is exempt from the Controlled Substances Act, as is alcohol.
Congress can deschedule or reschedule marijuana whenever it chooses. Every year since 1981 bills have been introduced to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would permit it to be prescribed for medical use and more easily researched, or to completely eliminate it from the list of controlled substances; none have ever made it out of committee. The Drug Enforcement Agency, in consultation with other administrative agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, also has authority to deschedule or reschedule substances, but the D.E.A. has rejected every petition to change marijuana’s classification.
State marijuana laws. State marijuana laws are commonly divided into three groups: medical use, (de)criminalization and legalization. State medical marijuana laws vary greatly, but all recognize the therapeutic effect of cannabis and cannabinoids. The first such law, the Compassionate Use Act, went into effect in California in 1996 and was meant to benefit “seriously ill” patients. But the broad language of the law, which permitted physicians to “recommend” marijuana whenever it was determined a “patient’s health would benefit,” led to considerable abuse. In contrast, Ohio’s medical marijuana law, enacted in 2016 and scheduled to be operational by September 2018, limits the number of licensed growers and dispensaries, narrowly defines the illnesses for which marijuana may be recommended, and requires physician recommenders to take a certifying class.
The broad language of California’s medical marijuana law led to considerable abuse.
Only four states—Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota—have no medical marijuana law. Most have passed comprehensive medical marijuana legislation, and more than a dozen other states permit the use of “low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)” products for limited medical reasons or as a defense to criminal charges.
Decriminalization is a change in the law that minimizes or eliminates penalties for marijuana use. Twenty states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana, which means that rather than arresting marijuana users, police issue citations, similar to parking or traffic tickets, that carry minimal fines and usually do not result in a criminal record. In addition, many cities and police departments throughout the nation have adopted non-enforcement policies that have the same effect as legislative decriminalization.
Legalization of marijuana is a state’s acceptance of adult recreational use and, in some states, the production and sale of marijuana. In 2012 Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize non-medical marijuana production and tax its sale. In 2016, marijuana sales in Colorado exceeded $1 billion and generated $200 million in state tax revenue. As of this writing, the District of Columbia and eight states, including California, which continues to run its medical marijuana program, have legalized marijuana. (In addition to Colorado and Washington, the others are Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon.) The governor of Vermont is expected to sign legislation adding that state to the list.
Federal enforcement history. The Clinton administration’s initial response to California’s medical marijuana law was to threaten doctors who recommended marijuana use with loss of their prescription-writing privileges. Federal courts enjoined these threats as a violation of First Amendment free speech rights but did not otherwise prohibit the federal government from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act. In 2002, President George W. Bush’s attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, defended enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against medical marijuana users who challenged the constitutionality of the law. Despite acknowledging that enforcement would cause the marijuana users, who were in total compliance with state law, considerable pain and “irreparable harm,” the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law’s application to them as a proper exercise of Congress’s authority to regulate interstate commerce.
Under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department issued several guidance memoranda regarding the enforcement of federal drug laws in states that had legalized medical and recreational marijuana. The memos, dating from 2009 to 2014, illustrate the difficulties of enforcing a stagnant federal law within a nation of increasingly tolerant states.

The earliest memo indicates that federal efforts should focus on stopping dangerous drug traffickers rather than prosecuting “individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws.” In 2011, however, perhaps in response to California’s lax medical marijuana regulations, the Justice Department indicated that “[p]ersons who are in the business of cultivating, selling or distributing marijuana, and those who knowingly facilitate such activities, are in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, regardless of state law.” By 2013, eight enforcement priorities were identified and have been used, until recently, to instruct federal prosecutors regarding where they should focus their efforts. The eight priorities are: preventing distribution to minors, preventing revenue from benefiting criminal enterprises, preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal to states where it is not, preventing the trafficking of other illegal drugs, preventing violence and the use of firearms, preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences, preventing the growth of marijuana on public lands and preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
In 2014, Congress passed the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment to an appropriations bill, which prohibits the Justice Department from funding enforcement efforts against the implementation of state marijuana laws. Now known as Rohrabacher-Blumenauer, the amendment is in effect through Jan. 19, when the latest short-term extension of funding for the federal government runs out. Lower courts have upheld this appropriation limitation and dismissed cases brought against state-authorized medical marijuana providers and individual marijuana users who strictly comply with state law, but those interpretations could be overturned.
As noted above, on Jan. 4 Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Obama administration’s eight priorities memos as unnecessary and informed federal prosecutors that they should make marijuana prosecution decisions using general law enforcement principles, which include “ priorities set by the Attorney General .” It is unlikely this change will inaugurate wide-scale arrests of individual marijuana users, but it puts everyone involved in marijuana use, including state medical marijuana employees, on notice that they could be subject to federal prosecution if Congress fails to reauthorize the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer amendment.
Federalism and pre-emption. Federal authority to regulate marijuana is based on the Commerce Clause. But state authority to regulate marijuana is based on traditional police and public health powers and the Tenth Amendment. Overlaps between federal and state powers that result in legislative conflicts are resolved by applying the constitutional principles of federalism and pre-emption. That is, state governments have sovereign powers, but they are not equals of the federal government, and the Supremacy Clause gives the federal government primacy over the states. Deference is given to states when they act pursuant to their historic police powers, but state laws that prevent the enforcement of constitutionally authorized federal laws are routinely struck down by the courts as pre-empted by federal law.
Thus, state decriminalization of marijuana does not conflict with federal law, as states are free to write their own criminal statutes. But medical marijuana and legalization laws differ in that they provide state approval, rather than mere disinterest, to federally prohibited activities.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that compliance with a state’s marijuana law is not a shield from federal prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act. Nevertheless, state marijuana laws are not in and of themselves unconstitutional. They may be implemented by the states as long as they do not interfere with federal law enforcement efforts. It is unclear whether the federal government can take action against state officials, and possibly the states themselves, for aiding marijuana use, production and distribution. Attorney General Sessions has not yet threatened to withhold federal funds from states that have legalized marijuana—as he has against “sanctuary cities” that oppose federal immigration policy—but the inconsistencies between federal and state law make life uncomfortable for many, including local law enforcement officials. Some states, for example, require authorities to return marijuana that was wrongfully (under state law) seized from state-authorized medical marijuana users during traffic stops. Lower courts are split on whether the return of that marijuana violates federal law.
Complications from antidiscrimination and other laws. Criminal prosecution is not the only problem facing private individuals, government officials and businesses involved in marijuana activities. Federal law dictates that marijuana users may be prohibited from owning guns or living in public housing, yet state disability laws prohibit discrimination against medical marijuana users. Employers and employees are uncertain how state-authorized marijuana use can impact hiring and firing decisions. Insurance companies do not know whether they violate federal law if they provide state-required medical marijuana coverage or pay claims for damaged or stolen marijuana. Military veterans, despite a recent directive authorizing Veterans Affairs doctors to discuss (but not facilitate) medical marijuana use with their patients, are concerned their participation in medical marijuana programs will impact their benefits. Business owners risk civil forfeiture of their profits and assets, and they may lose banking services that had been opened to them by the Obama administration.
There are numerous arguments for and against marijuana legalization, but the current situation is untenable. As Justice Louis D. Brandeis noted, “[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” Today, however, the entire citizenry is at risk. Patients risk a cut-off of their supply of medicine; tenants risk eviction; employees risk job loss; police departments, landlords, insurance companies and employers risk lawsuits; banks and businesses risk assets; and everyone involved in marijuana production and distribution, from the truck driver who delivers office supplies to the lawyer who drafts a lease, risks running afoul of a federal prosecutor. These risks only can be reduced by changing state or federal law.
Changing state law, willingly at least, is unlikely, as momentum and public opinion are with marijuana legalization. The most recent state marijuana law was enacted this week, and a 2017 poll indicates that 94 percent of U.S. voters favor medical marijuana and 60 percent favor the general legalization of the drug. Meanwhile, the Controlled Substances Act is 48 years old, and it is unclear whether any member of Congress supports it as currently written. Congress could deschedule marijuana and remove it from the controlled substances list, which would eliminate conflicts even in states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Alternatively, Congress could reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I substance to a Schedule II or III substance and alleviate conflicts with state medical marijuana laws. But if Congress does not act, Attorney General Sessions could effectively nullify state marijuana laws through rigorous federal enforcement.

Alright, so I've got this information about federal and state marijuana laws. Let me try to make sense of it.

First off, marijuana is illegal at the federal level because of the Controlled Substances Act, which classifies it as a Schedule I drug. That means it's considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. But, many states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, which creates a conflict because federal law still says it's illegal.

So, if marijuana is federally legal, what changes? Well, if it's legalized federally, that would override the federal prohibition, right? So, marijuana would be legal everywhere in the US, not just in certain states. But, I need to think about what that really means.

Let me see. If marijuana is legalized federally, it would likely be removed from the list of controlled substances, or at least rescheduled to a lower schedule, like Schedule II or III, which would allow for medical use and possibly recreational use, depending on how it's handled.

One big thing that would change is that people wouldn't have to worry about federal prosecution for using or selling marijuana, even in states where it's already legal. Right now, there's this tension where states have legalized it, but the federal government could still come in and arrest people, although they mostly don't.

Also, federally legalizing marijuana would probably lead to changes in banking laws. Currently, a lot of marijuana businesses have trouble getting bank accounts because banks are subject to federal regulations that make dealing with illegal substances risky. If marijuana is legal federally, banks would be more willing to work with these businesses.

Similarly, there are issues with taxes. Marijuana businesses have trouble deducting business expenses on their taxes because marijuana is illegal federally. If it's legalized, that would likely change, which could be a big help for those businesses.

Another aspect is research. Since marijuana is a Schedule I drug, it's hard for researchers to study it. If it's rescheduled or descheduled, it would make research easier, which could lead to more understanding of its medical benefits and potential risks.

International implications might also change. Right now, the US is in a tricky position because it's a signatory to international drug treaties that classify marijuana as illegal, but many states have legalized it. Federally legalizing it could require renegotiating those treaties or finding some other way to align federal law with international obligations.

Also, there's the issue of transportation across state lines. Even if marijuana is legal in two states, transporting it across state lines is currently a federal offense because of the Controlled Substances Act. Federally legalizing it would likely make interstate transportation legal.

I should also consider the impact on federal agencies. For example, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enforces the Controlled Substances Act. If marijuana is legalized federally, the DEA's role might change, or they might have to adapt their operations.

Furthermore, there are civil rights considerations. Marijuana arrests have disproportionately affected certain racial groups, even though usage rates are similar across races. Legalizing marijuana federally could help reduce these disparities.

There might also be economic impacts. Legalizing marijuana federally could lead to job creation in the marijuana industry and related fields. It could also increase tax revenues for the federal government.

On the other hand, there could be public health concerns. If marijuana is more widely available, there might be increases in usage, which could lead to more cases of addiction or other health problems. There would need to be regulations in place to monitor and address these issues.

I should also think about how federally legalizing marijuana could affect other illegal drugs. If marijuana is legalized, might that open the door to legalizing other substances? Or could it set a precedent for reevaluating drug scheduling and classifications?

Another angle is foreign policy. Some countries might look to the US as a leader in drug policy. If the US legalizes marijuana, it could influence other countries to reconsider their own drug laws.

I should probably look into how other countries have handled marijuana legalization to see what kind of effects it's had. Maybe Canada, since they've legalized it nationally.

Wait, but my task is to think about federal legalization in the US, so maybe focusing on the US context is more important.

Let me try to summarize what I've thought about so far. If marijuana is federally legalized in the US:

1. It would be legal everywhere in the US, overriding state laws that currently prohibit it.

2. Federal prosecutions for marijuana-related offenses would cease.

3. Banking and financial services would become more accessible to marijuana businesses.

4. Taxation and regulatory frameworks would need to be established.

5. Research on marijuana could advance more easily.

6. There could be changes in international drug treaties.

7. Transportation across state lines would be legal.

8. Federal agencies like the DEA might need to adjust their roles.

9. There could be reductions in racial disparities in arrests and prosecutions.

10. Economic benefits like job creation and tax revenue could occur.

11. There might be public health impacts that need to be monitored.

I think that covers the main points. Maybe I should consider some potential drawbacks or challenges as well.

For example, legalizing marijuana federally could face opposition from certain groups who believe it's harmful or who have moral objections to its use. There could be political resistance, especially from lawmakers who are against drug legalization.

Also, there might be concerns about impaired driving and public safety. If more people are using marijuana, there could be increases in accidents or other negative outcomes.

Additionally, there could be challenges in regulating the quality and potency of marijuana products to ensure consumer safety.

I should also think about how federally legalizing marijuana could affect the black market. If marijuana is legal and regulated, it might reduce the illicit market, but there could still be issues with smuggling and underground operations.

Another consideration is that some states might not want marijuana to be legal, even if it's federally legal. Would they have the ability to maintain their own prohibitions? Or would federal legalization override state laws?

I recall reading something about the Supremacy Clause, which establishes that federal law trumps state law in cases of conflict. So, if marijuana is legalized federally, state laws prohibiting it would likely be invalidated.

But, I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look into how federal legalization would interact with state laws.

Alternatively, perhaps federal legalization could allow states to set their own rules within a federal framework, similar to how alcohol is regulated.

Wait, alcohol is interesting because it's legal nationally, but states have their own rules about sale and consumption. Some even have counties or towns that are dry, meaning alcohol sales are prohibited there.

So, maybe with marijuana, even if it's federally legal, states could choose to ban it within their borders, or set their own restrictions.

But I need to think about how that would work legally.

I should consider historical precedents. For example, when alcohol prohibition was repealed with the 21st Amendment, control over alcohol was returned to the states, leading to the patchwork of laws we see today.

Perhaps a similar approach could be taken with marijuana, where federal legalization removes the prohibition, but allows states to implement their own regulations.

But, in reality, it's more complicated because marijuana is still illegal federally, whereas alcohol was legalized federally with the repeal of prohibition.

Maybe I need to think in terms of rescheduling marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act. If it's moved from Schedule I to Schedule II, that would allow for medical use and possibly tighter regulation of recreational use.

But full legalization would likely require removing it from the Controlled Substances Act altogether.

I should consider the implications for federal agencies like the FDA, which regulates drugs. If marijuana is descheduled, how would the FDA's role change?

Also, there's the matter of workplace drug testing and federal employment. Many federal jobs have strict drug testing policies. If marijuana is legalized, would those policies need to be revised?

Similarly, there are federal programs like welfare and housing that have drug use prohibitions. How would those be affected?

I should also think about the impact on federal prisons. Currently, many people are incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses. If marijuana is legalized, there could be opportunities for resentencing or releasing those prisoners.

That ties into criminal justice reform, which is a significant issue in the US.

Moreover, there could be environmental impacts to consider. For example, large-scale marijuana cultivation can have water usage and pesticide runoff issues. Federal regulations might help address these problems.

I should also think about the potential for increased taxation. If marijuana is legal federally, the federal government could impose taxes on it, which could generate revenue for things like education, drug treatment programs, or environmental remediation.

Alternatively, the money could be used to repair roads or fund other public services.

Another angle is public opinion. As I read in one of the articles, a 2017 poll indicated that 94% of US voters favor medical marijuana and 60% favor general legalization. So, there seems to be broad public support for legalization.

That could influence lawmakers to move forward with federal legalization.

However, there might still be pockets of resistance in certain regions or among particular demographics.

I should consider regional differences. For example, some states in the West and Northeast have already legalized marijuana, whereas states in the South and Midwest might be more resistant.

How would federal legalization play out in those more conservative areas?

Would there be backlash, or would the federal law be accepted?

I should also think about the impact on indigenous tribes, who have some degree of sovereignty and may have their own laws regarding marijuana.

How would federal legalization affect tribal lands and their ability to regulate marijuana use and sales?

Another aspect is international relations. As I mentioned earlier, the US is a party to international drug control treaties, such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. If marijuana is legalized federally, the US might need to renegotiate its commitments under these treaties or risk being in violation.

Some countries might view US legalization as a positive step towards drug policy reform, while others might see it as undermining global drug control efforts.

It's a complex issue with many layers.

I should probably organize my thoughts better. Let me try to categorize the potential impacts of federal marijuana legalization.

First, legal status:

- Marijuana would be legal nationwide, superseding state laws that currently prohibit it.

- Federal prosecutions for marijuana-related offenses would end.

Second, law enforcement:

- Resources previously devoted to marijuana enforcement could be redirected to other priorities.

- There might be a decrease in overall crime rates if the black market for marijuana is reduced.

Third, economic impacts:

- Creation of jobs in the marijuana industry and related sectors.

- Generation of tax revenue from marijuana sales.

- Potential for investment and economic growth in previously untapped markets.

Fourth, public health:

- Possible increases in marijuana usage rates.

- Need for education and prevention programs to address potential health risks.

- Access to marijuana for medical purposes, potentially benefiting patients with various conditions.

Fifth, social justice:

- Reduction in disproportionate arrests and incarceration of minorities.

- Possible expungement of past marijuana-related convictions.

Sixth, regulatory framework:

- Development of federal and state regulations to govern the cultivation, distribution, and sale of marijuana.

- Ensuring product safety and quality control.

Seventh, international relations:

- Need to reconcile federal legalization with international drug control treaties.

- Potential influence on other countries' drug policies.

Eighth, research and development:

- Easier access to marijuana for scientific research.

- Potential discoveries regarding medical applications and potential harms.

Ninth, banking and finance:

- Marijuana businesses could access traditional banking services, reducing reliance on cash.

- Improved financial tracking and reporting.

Tenth, taxation:

- Implementation of federal and state taxes on marijuana sales.

- Decisions on how to allocate tax revenues.

Eleventh, transportation:

- Legalization of interstate marijuana transportation.

- Need for regulations to prevent impaired driving.

Twelfth, workplace policies:

- Reevaluation of drug testing policies in federal and private workplaces.

- Balancing employee rights with workplace safety concerns.

Thirteenth, housing and benefits:

- Changes to federal housing and welfare policies regarding marijuana use.

- Possible adjustments to eligibility criteria.

Fourteenth, environmental impact:

- Regulation of marijuana cultivation to minimize environmental damage.

- Promotion of sustainable practices in the industry.

Fifteenth, impact on other drugs:

- Potential for changes in attitudes towards other controlled substances.

- Possible openings for discussing legalization or decriminalization of other drugs.

I think that covers most of the key areas. Now, I need to think about how these changes might play out in reality.

For example, if marijuana is federally legalized, there would likely be a period of transition where federal and state governments work together to establish regulations and enforcement mechanisms.

There might be debates over how much control states should have versus the federal government. Some states might want to maintain strict regulations or even prohibit marijuana within their borders, while others might opt for a more lenient approach.

It's also possible that the federal government would set minimum standards that states must follow, similar to how the National Minimum Drinking Age Act required states to set a minimum drinking age of 21.

In terms of public health, there would need to be significant education campaigns to inform the public about the risks and responsibilities associated with marijuana use.

There might also be increased focus on treatment options for those struggling with marijuana addiction or other drug-related issues.

From an economic perspective, the marijuana industry could become a significant player, comparable to the alcohol and tobacco industries.

This could lead to powerful lobbying groups advocating for favorable policies and regulations.

On the international front, the US might face pressure to align its drug policies with those of other nations or to push for reforms in international drug control frameworks.

Alternatively, other countries might follow suit and consider legalizing marijuana themselves.

Overall, federally legalizing marijuana in the US would have wide-ranging effects across multiple domains, from law enforcement and public health to economics and international relations.

It's a complex issue with both potential benefits and challenges that would need to be carefully managed.

I think that's a comprehensive overview of what could happen if marijuana is federally legalized in the US.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Federally legalizing marijuana in the US would override state prohibitions, end federal prosecutions, allow banking access for marijuana businesses, generate tax revenue, facilitate research, and address social injustices, but also present challenges in public health, regulation, and international relations.}} \]
