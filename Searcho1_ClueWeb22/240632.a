Alright, so I've got this question: "Why is there a shortage of school bus drivers?" Hmm, I don't really know much about this off the top of my head, but it seems like something that's been in the news lately. I think many schools are having trouble finding enough drivers to transport students, which must be causing a lot of stress for school districts and families alike.

First, I should probably try to understand what's causing this shortage. Maybe it's similar to the general labor shortages we've seen in other industries over the past couple of years. I recall hearing about difficulties in hiring across different sectors, so perhaps school bus driving is just another part of that trend.

But let's dig deeper. Maybe there are specific reasons why school bus drivers are in short supply. For example, maybe the pay isn't competitive compared to other jobs. Or perhaps the job is just really stressful and demanding, with long hours and responsibility for children's safety. That could deter a lot of people from wanting to take on the role.

Also, considering the age demographic of current drivers, maybe there's an aging workforce and not enough younger people are entering the field to replace those who are retiring. That could be another factor contributing to the shortage.

I should probably look up some statistics or reports on this issue to get a better grasp of what's going on. Maybe there are studies or articles that explain the root causes in more detail. Let me see if I can find some reliable sources online that discuss the school bus driver shortage.

Why Is There a School Bus Driver Shortage in the U.S.?
By Mohit Oberoi, CFA
Nov. 12 2021, Published 8:20 a.m. ET
There has been a shortage of several things in the U.S. Apart from the shortage of some daily use goods, there's also a staffing problem and school bus drivers especially seem to be in short supply. Why is there a school bus driver shortage in the U.S. and when will things get better?

While the school bus driver shortage is also related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has always been a problem especially when the school year starts.
Labor shortage situation in the U.S.
First, it's important to understand what's driving the current labor shortage situation. The U.S. labor force has come down because over 700,000 people have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, labor force participation has been low and many people haven‚Äôt returned to labor markets.

There are multiple reasons why people haven't returned to the labor market. Some of them are concerned about contracting the coronavirus, while others have to take care of their families' needs after the death of a member. A lot of people have also pulled forward their retirement since the elderly are especially at the risk from the coronavirus.

Bus driver shortage in the U.S. is a structural problem
The bus driver shortage in the U.S. is a structural problem, and it's an annual event when school starts in the fall. School bus drivers often complain of low wages and poor working conditions. Also, in many cases, the jobs aren't unionized.
God this country. We have a bus driver shortage now too.!!!!!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

However, the problem is much more severe in 2021 than usual. While the overall labor market situation is contributing to the bus driver shortage in the U.S., there are also other aspects.
Many bus drivers lost their jobs since schools were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. While students moved to Zoom calls for schooling, school bus drivers also pivoted towards other jobs. Thanks to the rebound in the labor markets, there have been a lot of new employment opportunities for school bus drivers.

Here's where the structural problem comes into play. The average wages for school bus drivers are low and it's a seasonal job that's limited to the school year. In many cases, school bus drivers are left without wages when the schools are closed.

Why is there a bus driver shortage in the U.S.?
A lot of school bus drivers seem reluctant to return to their jobs and some of them might have found jobs in alternate industries. There has also been a shortage of truck drivers in the U.S., which is leading to logistics problems for companies.
If the lorry driver shortage in the U.K. is because of brexit, why is there also a shortage in America?

Article continues below advertisement
Companies like FedEx have been paying premium wages for workers. School bus drivers' skill sets have fungibility with other driving jobs. The average wages for a truck driver are higher than that of a school bus driver.
When will the school bus driver shortage get better?
For the school bus driver shortage to get better, the overall staffing situation has to improve. In 2022, more workers might come back to the job market as COVID-19 vaccinations increase. Also, the structural problem related to low wages for school bus drivers would need to be addressed. In a free labor market where workers are free to choose their jobs, labor needs to be adequately rewarded to retain the workforce.

How Can We Solve The School Bus Driver Shortage?
Families are scrambling to get their kids to school.
Jeanne Croteau on September 8, 2021
Schools are open, but some students can‚Äôt get to campus. Parents and students across the country are scrambling to find alternative transportation due to a school bus driver shortage. While this isn‚Äôt a new problem, it seems worse than ever. What is causing this latest hurdle in an already challenging school year, and what can be done to fix it?
Pandemic Bus Driver Crisis
With the COVID delta variant and mask mandate battles creating chaos and uncertainty, we knew this third year of pandemic teaching wouldn‚Äôt be easy. What many of us didn‚Äôt imagine, however, is that kids wouldn‚Äôt have a way to get to school. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening right now.
According to a nationwide survey, at least half of the student-transportation coordinators in this country would describe their school bus driver shortage as ‚Äúsevere‚Äù or ‚Äúdesperate.‚Äù This type of crisis is unprecedented.
National School Transportation Association executive director, Curt Macysyn, told NPR, ‚ÄúThis back-to-school period is nothing like the previous periods we‚Äôve seen. In previous years, we‚Äôve seen regionalized driver shortages, but nothing to the extent that we‚Äôre seeing today.‚Äù
There are many reasons for the school bus driver shortage. As Macysyn explained, they include:
Drivers were furloughed when the pandemic forced closures in 2020.
Some drivers retired.
The pay is too low.
New hires need a commercial driver‚Äôs license.
DMVs have had limited hours, making it hard for drivers to take road tests or get qualified.
Potential drivers are worried about safety since children under 12 aren‚Äôt vaccinated.
Clearly, this is a complex issue that won‚Äôt be solved overnight. In the meantime, families are trying to navigate this additional problem.
Impact on Students & Parents
Preparing for school during this pandemic is stressful for many. In fact, some parents are sticking with virtual learning and homeschooling for now. For those who can‚Äôt or prefer not to use those options, the school bus driver shortage is a nightmare.
Yes, there are bus route issues at the start of every school year, but things are exceptionally bad right now‚Äîeven in major cities. Some Metro Detroit school districts have been forced to suspend bus routes until they can find drivers.
In Missouri, an emailed newsletter set some shocking expectations for parents. In the message, Gentry Middle School principal Josh Johnson wrote, ‚ÄúIt is possible for some students not to arrive home until 2-2¬Ω hours after school has been dismissed. If you prefer to pick up your student until these bus issues have been resolved, please feel free to do so.‚Äù
No-shows and extensive delays are common right now, so students and parents have had to find ways to cope with this situation.
Can the School Bus Driver Shortage Be Solved?
As mentioned, struggles with school bus routes and drivers are nothing new. Those existing barriers continue to persist. On top of that, though, administrators and leaders are trying to address problems brought on by the pandemic.
Here are some of the temporary solutions we‚Äôre seeing across the country:
Schools are encouraging parents to drop off and pick up their kids. Based on their own work schedules and/or access to a vehicle, this could be difficult or even impossible.
Some have turned to third-party vendors, but those drivers have been resigning too.
Chicago‚Äôs mayor has been talking to ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft to try to secure transportation for students.
Transportation companies are offering bonuses of up to $2000 in some areas.
We polled our own community of teachers to find out what they think. Here are some of the comments:
‚ÄúOne school in our county is having Paras drive buses.‚Äù ‚ÄîAlanna R.
‚ÄúThey changed the start times across my district and standardized them to be 7:30, 8:30, and 9:00 a.m. So my school now starts at 7:30 and my son at 9:00. He is in first grade and doesn‚Äôt get done until 3:39. So one bus driver can cover more routes. There are late busses everyday by hours.‚Äù ‚ÄîTeresa R.
‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs time to get serious about the behavior of kids on the busses.‚Äù ‚ÄîElizabeth C.
‚ÄúMoney, benefits, treated like real humans. That‚Äôs a start. COVID came and there were plans for busses but then there wasn‚Äôt money for it. Bus drivers are dying from COVID and not offered the same protection as teachers. I wouldn‚Äôt drive a bus either.‚Äù ‚ÄîWendy H.

Why school districts nationwide are facing bus driver shortages
The pandemic "completely exacerbated" the shortage, one school leader said.

At the start of the school year, it's not uncommon for school districts to be short bus drivers. Before the pandemic, Savannah-Chatham County Public School System in Georgia had been down 10% from what it needed, which is manageable, Paul Abbott, executive director for transportation for the district, told ABC News.
This year, he said the school district was down over 30% -- more than 110 drivers -- as it was gearing up for the return of students last week. As a result, the district has had to prioritize routes for around 20,000 students who are returning fully in person, leaving about 5,000 kids without the option of riding a school bus.
"We have the money, we have the buses, we have the parts. We have everything that we need except the critical resource -- bus drivers," Abbott said. "COVID just completely exacerbated the bus driver shortage."
The district is not alone. Schools across the country -- from Pennsylvania to Virginia to Missouri to Ohio to Texas -- have reported similar shortages.
"There's no doubt it's a national problem, similar to what we see in service industries as well," Curt Macysyn, executive director for the National School Transportation Association, which represents private school bus contractors, told ABC News.

The reasons are varied. One is health concerns, especially as COVID-19 cases are rising in many parts of the country due to the highly contagious delta variant.
"During COVID, people chose their health over a position," Macysyn said. "With the delta variant, I think some folks who might have considered a return are probably gonna stay on the sidelines a little bit longer."
School bus drivers often include retirees. Abbott's prior school district, in Richmond County, Georgia, lost many older drivers during the pandemic, he said. "A lot of them left, just really out of health reasons and concerns for their own health. And you can't blame them."

Money, from enhanced unemployment benefits to a lack of full-time hours preventing people from applying, also may be a factor, Macysyn said. People with a commercial driver's license, which is required to be a school bus driver, also may have been drawn to other jobs in the transportation industry that offer more competitive pay, Abbott said.
"CDL drivers are a commodity right now," he said. "Everybody's paying top dollar."
The average hourly wage nationwide for a school bus driver is $17, according to Salary.com.
With DMV offices closed or offering limited hours during the pandemic, that also may have prevented people from getting or maintaining their CDL, Macysyn said. "When a lot of states' DMV agencies were closed, we weren't filling the funnel with new drivers."
MORE: Back to school as COVID worsens
To recover, schools need to attract new people into the industry by highlighting the benefits of the position, such as flexible hours and summers off, Macysyn said.
"I do think that this is an opportunity for us to highlight the industry and attract new individuals into the profession," he said. "It's a matter of putting focus and attention on a level of outreach that we haven't done before."
The Savannah-Chatham County Public School System has been holding regular job fairs, placing advertising on billboards, social media and radio, and reaching out to former employees to let them know about pay grade changes, school officials said. The school also is looking at increasing the number of drivers who are guaranteed eight hours a day versus just five, Abbott said.
"We're pulling out all the stops," he said. "We're looking at attendance supplements for people who have great attendance because you want to reward great behavior too. ... We're working on focus groups -- what to do differently with pay, with benefits, with personal days. We're trying to get a good idea of some things we can do to make it more appealing for somebody to come drive."
The school district has conducted dozens of interviews for prospective drivers, though it can take several weeks, if not months, to get on the road once hired. New bus operators need to undergo background checks, physicals and, if they don't already have one, get a CDL, which can all take up to 12 weeks, according to Macysyn.

In the long term, the National School Transportation Association is lobbying the federal government to allow a license just for school bus drivers that would remove a repair-oriented, under-the-hood vehicle inspection requirement under the CDL test that is only relevant to long-haul truckers, Macysyn said.
"Our thought is, let's remove that barrier to entry," Macysyn said. "We know that folks have been discouraged from pursuing their CDL because of the under-the-hood requirement."
For now, with schools consolidating or removing routes amid the staffing shortages, parents are scrambling for alternatives -- such as having a family member take them, carpooling or having the students walk or bike.
"The concern for us is that the school bus is the safest method of transportation to and from school," Macysyn said. "We can come up with alternate transportation to and from school -- it's not going to be as safe as the yellow bus."

Why Is There a Shortage of School Bus Drivers? - American Bus Sales
Why Is There a Shortage of School Bus Drivers?
Posted March 1, 2021 by American Bus Sales
It‚Äôs no secret that there is a nationwide school bus driver shortage. Now, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages have been even more of an issue than ever before.
Let‚Äôs look at some factors that may be contributing to this shortage:
Low School Bus Driver Pay
Nearly 25% of people have admitted to leaving their current job for a higher-paying job. Although you may enjoy your position, and it may be a rewarding career, sometimes you need a job that will keep you on track financially.
Many bus drivers seek other employment opportunities because their pay isn‚Äôt as high as expected. Typically, the average bus driver will make about $16 an hour.
School Bus Drivers Want More Hours
A school bus driver will work inconsistent hours. They‚Äôll usually block off about 2-3 hours of driving in the morning and about 2-3 hours in the afternoon. Most times, these short days aren‚Äôt enough work for drivers, and even if they wanted to find a part-time job to kill time in between their drives, it‚Äôs practically impossible.
Drivers Are Hired Based on Experience
Many school bus companies will only hire drivers who already have their CDL and have driven for at least two years. If you don‚Äôt have this experience, it becomes very difficult for you to find a job in this industry.
When a company is looking to hire more school bus drivers, they may find it beneficial to hire those with little to no experience and pay them to train for the job. Investing in your employees will increase your chances of having them stay with the company for a longer period.
COVID-19 Has Impacted the Amount of School Bus Drivers
To no surprise, the current pandemic has not helped the pre-existing shortage of school bus drivers. Drivers who are at higher risk of getting the virus have taken this opportunity to retire because it‚Äôs not worth the potential health risk to continue driving.
What Can You Do to Keep Your Current Drivers?
Now that you have more information on why drivers have left their jobs in the past, it‚Äôs important to take this information and apply it to your company to help keep the drivers that you currently have. Besides familiarizing yourself with the reasons why bus drivers leave their job, here are some simple things that you can do for your current drivers to help increase their job satisfaction.
Offer Continuing Education for Your Drivers
Investing in your employees is a great way to establish a long-term relationship with them. It also shows your employees that you‚Äôre committed to them, and you believe in their potential. Besides offering continuing education classes and training, try offering additional classes to help with stress management or wellness programs to help drivers cope with the job‚Äôs stress!
Support Your Drivers
Your driver also needs to feel supported while on the job. Encourage your drivers to create their own rules and standards for their bus. They‚Äôll love being able to have authority.
Also, don‚Äôt forget to provide administrative support for your driver if they have a difficult group of children or they need help assisting concerned parents. Overall, having administrative support will help make your drivers feel appreciated and heard.
Update the Technology on Your Buses
Updating your bus with the latest technology will make your driver feel safer, more efficient, and have a more enjoyable experience on the job. Whether you add a stop-arm camera to help improve safety or a GPS navigation to help them manage their routes, your bus driver will appreciate the upgrades!
If you‚Äôre ready to upgrade your current fleet, make sure you‚Äôre visiting American Bus Sales to install the latest technology in your school buses. We strive to provide our customers with the latest technology available for their new or pre-owned school buses.

6 Key Reasons School Bus Drivers Quit - School Bus Fleet Blog - School Bus Fleet
6 Key Reasons School Bus Drivers Quit
School Bus Fleet Blog ‚Ä¢ October 3, 2019 ‚Ä¢ By Kim Morrison ‚Ä¢
Why do school bus drivers quit? In this editorial, veteran driver Kim Morrison presents a list of common concerns among his colleagues. File photo by John Horton
The following op-ed was initially posted on School Bus Fleet in January 2015. In light of a persisting driver shortage, we are rerunning it and have updated it with some links to related articles offering insights and solutions.
The op-ed expresses the author‚Äôs opinions and not necessarily those of SBF.
When I started driving a school bus quite a few years ago, there was a cantankerous old bus driver who always used to say, "There will never be another 30-year bus driver here."
At the time, many of the drivers dismissed her statement as being just another one of her crazy rants, because many of the drivers working then had already been driving a school bus for 10 years or more. But in light of the increasing school bus driver shortages we are now seeing around the country, her statement seems almost prophetic, because it is ringing true all over. If she were alive today, I would be telling her that she was right, and she would be grinning, because she saw this coming long before the rest of us.
The questions in front of us are what is causing these severe school bus driver shortages all over, why are bus drivers leaving or retiring from these positions at a faster pace, and what is so different now that makes driving a school bus less appealing than ever before?
I‚Äôve compiled many ideas and points of view on this issue from other school bus drivers, trainers, and some route supervisors or managers from across the country ‚Äî coupled with my own experience. Here are six key reasons that school bus drivers hang up their keys.
1. Low Pay
School bus drivers earn less per hour than other CDL class drivers on the road.
2. Limited Hours
We work a split shift, so there is a limited number of hours we can get. In many cases, extra work, like field trips, pays far less than the amount we get for driving our regular routes.
3. Part-Time Status
Even if we are offered benefits like full-time employees, our employers still consider us part-time employees because we work one shift in the early morning and another shift in the afternoon. The trouble is that the hours of our so-called part-time job are such that it makes it impossible to do any other part-time job, because no one will hire us for the hours we have left in our day.
4. Unaffordable Health Care
Many bus drivers who are offered health and other benefits cannot afford them ‚Äî or, as we often say, they are working for benefits ‚Äî because there is nothing much left of their check after the premiums for them are deducted.
5. Start-Up Costs
You are going to have to come up with some money, in most cases, for this job even before or at least at the start of your school bus driver training, because you are going to need a pre-employment background check, drug test and a physical. Every new driver winds up paying all or a part of the cost of all these things. Yes, you will have a Class B CDL after the training, but if you have been out of work and have no money, it is going to be a while before you get a check for this job.
6. Lack of Support
The main reason people are bailing out of this job faster rests squarely on the shoulders of upper management or administration of bus companies and school systems. Some common grievances here include: administrators not backing up school bus drivers when parents complain; policies that don‚Äôt support drivers; disciplinary actions that are perceived as inequitable; not showing appreciation for oldest employees; and too many hoops for drivers to jump through to get administrators to discipline children for unsafe behavior on the bus.
Recently, a middle school girl boarded my bus in tears because she was jumped or attacked by another girl while walking to the bus. She looked quite scared and cried the entire trip home, despite her friends‚Äô efforts to console her.
When I got home, I called her home on my own time and asked her father if she was all right. Her father was angry about what happened to her, but he thanked me several times for checking on her and thanked me again when I saw him the next day.
When parents are shocked that a school bus driver does care, is this not a clear indication that our public school systems are failing on some level?

Alright, so I've got these search results from different sources, and they all seem to be pointing to similar issues regarding the school bus driver shortage. Let me try to summarize what I'm reading here.

First off, it's clear that this is a nationwide problem, affecting school districts all over the US. It's not just one area; it's widespread. Even before the pandemic, there were shortages, but now it's apparently much worse. So, there must be some underlying reasons that have been exacerbated by the COVID situation.

One of the main reasons mentioned is low pay. School bus drivers don't make a lot of money compared to other jobs that require a commercial driver's license (CDL). For example, truck drivers often make more, so some bus drivers might be tempted to switch to truck driving for better pay. The average hourly wage for a school bus driver is around $17 an hour, which might not be enough to live on in many parts of the country.

Another issue is the limited hours. Bus drivers typically work split shifts‚Äîearly mornings and late afternoons‚Äîwhich can make it hard to have a normal workday or to take on a second job if they need extra income. This schedule can also interfere with personal life and family time.

Moreover, because of the part-time nature of the job, even if benefits are offered, they might not be as comprehensive as those in full-time positions. And for some drivers, the health care benefits that are provided might still be too expensive for them to afford, especially if they have families or pre-existing conditions.

The pandemic has also played a role. Some drivers are older and may have health concerns that make them hesitant to return to work due to the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Additionally, during the pandemic, many drivers were furloughed when schools were closed, and some may have found other jobs or retired during that time.

There's also the issue of the time it takes to become a qualified bus driver. New hires need to go through background checks, physicals, and obtain their CDL, which can take several weeks or even months. With the shortage, there isn't a quick fix to get more drivers on the road immediately.

Another point raised is that school bus driving requires specific skills and responsibilities, such as managing a group of children safely. It's not just about driving; it's about being a caregiver and a disciplinarian in some ways. That can be stressful and demanding, and not everyone is cut out for it.

Furthermore, some drivers feel unsupported by their employers. There might be instances where parents complain about drivers, and the administration doesn't back up the drivers, which can lead to frustration and a lack of job satisfaction. Also, there might be policies that are seen as unfair or overly bureaucratic, which can discourage drivers from staying in the job.

So, in summary, the school bus driver shortage seems to be caused by a combination of factors: low pay, inconvenient work hours, limited benefits, health concerns related to the pandemic, the time and effort required to become qualified, and a lack of support from employers. It's a multifaceted problem that will likely require multiple approaches to solve.

I think if I were advising a school district on how to address this issue, I would recommend looking into ways to increase driver pay and improve benefits. Maybe explore partnerships with local organizations or seek government funding to help cover the costs. Also, streamlining the hiring process and providing more support to drivers could help retain them longer.

Additionally, considering the current labor market, perhaps offering signing bonuses or incentives for new hires could attract more people to the profession. And investing in driver training programs could help bring in younger drivers who might be interested in a career in transportation.

Lastly, improving the public perception of school bus driving could also help. Highlighting the importance of the job and the positive impact drivers have on students' lives might encourage more people to consider it as a viable career option.

Well, that's my take on why there's a shortage of school bus drivers. It's a complex issue with no easy solutions, but by addressing the key pain points, school districts can work towards alleviating the shortage.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The school bus driver shortage is caused by a combination of low pay, inconvenient work hours, limited benefits, health concerns related to the pandemic, the time and effort required to become qualified, and a lack of support from employers.}} \]
