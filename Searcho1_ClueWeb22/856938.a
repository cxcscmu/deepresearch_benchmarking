Alright, so I need to figure out how nursing homes deal with elderly people's mental health after COVID. That sounds like a pretty important topic, especially considering everything that's happened over the past couple of years. I don't know much about this specific area, so I think I should start by doing some research to understand the impact of COVID on elderly mental health in nursing homes.

First, I should probably look into what kinds of mental health issues elderly people in nursing homes might be facing post-COVID. I imagine isolation, fear of infection, and the general stress of the pandemic could have taken a toll on their mental well-being. Maybe there's been an increase in anxiety, depression, or even PTSD among them.

I also wonder if nursing homes have implemented any new policies or practices to address these issues. Perhaps they've increased access to mental health services, trained staff to recognize signs of mental distress, or introduced therapies like counseling or support groups.

Another angle could be the role of family and friends in supporting the mental health of elderly residents. Visitation restrictions during COVID must have been really hard for both the residents and their loved ones. I wonder if nursing homes have found ways to facilitate virtual visits or other forms of communication to help bridge that gap.

I should also consider the long-term effects of COVID on mental health in this population. Even after the immediate threat of the virus subsides, there might be lasting psychological impacts that need to be addressed.

Hmm, maybe I should start by searching for studies or articles that look at the mental health of elderly people in nursing homes post-COVID. That should give me some concrete information to work with.

Let me try formulating a search query for this.

COVID and the Ongoing Mental Health Needs of Long-Term Care Residents
Nursing home residents faced isolation and gaps in mental health care long before COVID hit. The healthcare system cannot wait for the pandemic to pass to start addressing their needs.

Editor’s Note: For the purposes of this report, “nursing home residents” refers to those in long-term care. There is a distinction between nursing home residents who live in long-term care facilities who are unable to live independently [those discussed in this article] and those who need short-term care after, for example, a surgery or acute medical difficulty. These residents also are distinct from individuals living in long-term facilities that are called “assisted living” facilities. Assisted-living facilities have no federal oversight, unlike nursing homes which are federally regulated.
With seniors and staff in long-term care facilities among those receiving the first rounds of COVID-19 vaccines, it is hoped that the nearly year-long hardships imposed by a virus that disproportionately affects the elderly, particularly in congregate settings, will hasten to a close. Notwithstanding the delays and challenges of actually getting the vaccine into arms of these seniors, not the least of which is vaccine hesitancy reported among nursing homes residents, the fact that a vaccine is available is being heralded as the light at the end of the tunnel.
However, the vaccine itself will not mitigate the widespread mental health challenges faced by seniors – and those treating them. Mental health issues have long been under-recognized in this population, even before the pandemic.
Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders in Nursing Homes May Surprise Some
“Nursing homes basically have become psychiatric institutions,” said Brent Forester, MD, chief of the Center of Excellence in Geriatric Psychiatry at McLean Hospital and medical director for Behavioral Health Integration, Quality and Patient Experience at Mass General Brigham.
Epidemiological data show rates of depression, severe mental illness, or dementia, in 70% to 80% of nursing home residents, he told Psycom Pro, noting, “I don’t think people appreciate that enough.” (For comparison, Grabowski et al cite a range of 65 to 91% of nursing home residents with a significant mental disorder, namely mood disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders and other mental illness. 1)
Enter COVID-19 and Further Isolation
What people have appreciated is the added isolation and loneliness the pandemic has wrought on the mental health issues that many elderly individuals struggled with prior to the pandemic. Lisa Lind, PhD, a licensed psychologist and chief clinical leadership team member for Dear Oaks, a behavioral health provider focused on long-term care, underscored the effect of the pandemic on exacerbating symptoms of anxiety and depression among long-term care facility residents following the implementation of visitor restriction guidelines.
“Residents at that time were reporting an increase in anxiety related to the fear of contracting COVID, anxiety related to witnessing other residents and staff contract COVID, and some contracting COVID themselves and having to isolate,” she said, adding that depressive symptoms have also increased.
Although some data suggest that older people in community settings are actually faring better than younger people in terms of mental health during the pandemic due to factors such as increased longer life experience and wisdom, 2 others note that no detailed information yet exists on the true impact of the pandemic on residents of long-term care facilities.
According to David Grabowski, PhD, professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, “We do not yet have data yet on exactly how the pandemic has impacted individuals with mental health needs but all signs point towards this having dire consequences for residents of long-term care facilities. He cited the combined effects of more isolation (less engagement with family and other residents) with the increased stress and anxiety of the pandemic on residents’ mental health. “Tending to the mental health needs of residents will be a key priority in the post-pandemic period,” he pointed out.
It is said that the strains placed on people during a period of significant change or trauma often reflect the situation they were in prior to the change – the same holds true for the COVID-19 impact. For those living in long-term care facilities, the pandemic has further revealed the endemic mental health issues present in these communities and, more importantly, the urgent need for better integrated mental healthcare.
Statistics on Long-Term Care Facilities in the US
In February 2019, the National Center for Health Statistics published updated information on long-term care providers and service users in the United States. The report, based on the 2015-2016 National Study of Long-Term Care Providers, describes the most current information available on the number and kind of providers and service users in five major sectors of paid, regulated long-term services:
adult day service centers
home health agencies
hospices
nursing homes
assisted living and similar residential care communities
Following are some key findings focused on nursing homes:
Total number of long-term care service providers in all five categories: 65,600 serving more than 8.3 million people in the United States
Number of nursing homes: 15,600 service providers serving 1,347,600 residents
Employed nursing home staff: 945,700 full-time nursing and social workers
Residents by age: 83.5% were 65 years and older
Percentage of nursing homes that provide specific services:
skilled nursing or nursing services (100%)
dietary and nutritional services (100%)
therapeutic (99.5%)
pharmacy (97.2%)
social work (88.5%)
mental health or counseling (87.6%)
hospice services (80.7%)
dementia care units (14.9%)
Percentage of residents with diagnosed mental health issues:
Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias (47.8%)
Depression (46.3%)
Understanding the scope of mental illness in nursing homes is complex given the different data sets used to estimate the size of the population in nursing homes with mental illness, as described in 2009 study by Bagchi and colleagues . Data from Gabrowski published in 2010 – based on 1,150,734 new nursing home admissions in 2005 – showed that 2.7% (31,335) admissions indicated schizophrenia or bipolar disorder when using a narrow definition of mental illness. When using a broader definition, that number grew to 27.4% (315,003) admissions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or anxiety.
Pandemic or Not, Treatment Gaps Plague the Mental Health Needs of Long-Term Care Residents
Whether due to the pandemic or not, better quality care is needed to address the mental health needs of the individuals living in long-term care facilities. Calling the mental health needs of these residents “tremendous,” Dr. Forester specifically emphasized the need for more integrative behavioral health support in nursing homes to address the myriad of issues that often, if not addressed, lead to poor outcomes.
Typically, nursing home staff provide care via a medical team with psychiatric consultations brought in as needed.
Severe, Persistent Mental Illness Coupled with a Shortage of Mental Health Professionals
“Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness, such as treatment-resistant bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, have poor preventative healthcare and high rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease leading to premature mortality and premature institutionalization in long-term care facilities,” he explained
Dr. Forester stressed that behavioral complications associated with dementia (eg, agitation, aggression), anxiety, depression, and substance abuse are highly treatable. “Unfortunately, we have an inadequate workforce of geriatric mental health providers with expertise in the assessment, prevention, and treatment of these common psychiatric conditions in long-term care settings,” he said. Further, general preventive care such as exercise and nutrition, addressing nonadherence to medication, and other lifestyle factors are not addressed.
Dr. Grabowski also cited the shortage of people to address these issues in long-term care facilities. “Before the pandemic, we had a shortage of mental health professionals working in long-term settings,” he said. “During the pandemic, this issue has been magnified in that many mental health needs are going unmet.”
“There are major gaps in care,” he said.
Exacerbating the shortage of mental health professionals is the lack of access during the pandemic due to facility restrictions. “Psychologists and other mental health professionals have experienced difficulty accessing their patients at the time due to outbreaks in long-term care,” said Dr. Lind. “While some facilities have provided staff to facilitate telehealth services, many facilities have been unable to reliably do so resulting in a significant disruption in mental health services for many residents.”
In a 2010 literature review that looked at the quality of mental healthcare in long-term care facilities, Dr. Grabowski and colleagues detailed the extent of these gaps and others. 3 Data from one study, for example, showed that 80% of nursing home residents with mental illness did not receive help from a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or licensed social worker as evidenced on Medicare Part B claims. 1,3 Overall, when available in nursing homes, psychiatric services were commonly provided by psychiatric consultants who were not members of the nursing home staff, despite recognition by clinicians and administrators that these “as-needed” consultants were not adequate to address the mental health needs of residents. 1,4,5
When looking at effective models of mental health services provided to nursing homes, data showed that a multidisciplinary team approach, in conjunction with a “train the trainer” nurse specialist model (in which nurse training focused on identifying and addressing mental health needs in nursing home residents), was the preferred model. The train the trainer model was further linked to improved staff knowledge and performance as well as decreased staff turnover. 1,6
A decade later, however, and not much has changed in care access or models.
Restrictions on Psychiatric Medications
Another – perhaps more recent – gap in care, according to Dr. Forester, is the disincentive to provide the full array of psychiatric medications to nursing home residents given the regulatory environment. “There is a federal mandate to reduce the use of psychiatric medications, anti-psychotic medications in particular,” he said, explaining that current regulations incentivize nursing homes to not use these agents even in situations where patients are doing well on them and continuity of care is needed. 7 This CMS mandate was put into action before COVID-19.
How to Help Long-Term Care Residents Now
Integrate Teams and Bolster Training
In addition to the findings noted by Dr. Grabowski’s team above, Dr. Forester, who, as co-president of the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry, is involved in educating HCPs and mental health professionals on geriatric mental health issues, emphasized that a holistic approach utilizing integrated teams is needed to adequately care for the mental health of older adults. “There will never be enough of us [mental health professionals] to do this work, so that is why the integrated, multidisciplinary teams are helpful,” he explained.
Improving the education of nursing home staff on mental health challenges is also crucial, he said. Among the scalable models of education being implemented is an educational nursing home program through Project ECHO. The program includes training on how to address pandemic-related social isolation issues for residents, families, and staff. Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) provides virtual educational programs to underserved and remote areas through telementoring by expert teams.
“These types of programs are helpful,” said Dr. Forester. “They do not provide direct care but they support people who provide direct care so they can appropriately intervene when necessary and prevent a worse outcome.”
Address Grief in Older Adults
Grief, over the many losses associated with aging, losing loved ones, and nearing one’s own death, is a common experience among older adults.
Calling deaths from COVID-19 in long-term facilities a “tsunami of loss” for residents and staff, Toni P. Miles, MD, PhD, a physician and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the College of Public Health at the University of Georgia in Athens, underscored the toll accumulated and ongoing grief can have mental health. During the pandemic, grief has taken on different hues given the sheer numbers of people dying in close congregate settings and the inability to say proper goodbyes or hold funeral services due to infection concerns.
(More on how to identify grief in psychological assessments .)
Acknowledging the role grief can play in mental health issues, Dr. Forester emphasized the need to distinguish between normal grief and complicated grief, recently approved for the DSM as prolonged grief disorder. “I would argue that grief can become a mental health issue when it is complicated by disturbances in sleep, appetite, energy, and motivation,” he said.
To help both residents and staff of nursing homes grapple with grief, Dr. Miles developed two toolkits – one for staff and one for residents – that offer best practices in coping with death. Developed with support from the state of Georgia and available upon request through Leading Age of Georgia, Best Practices in Bereavement Care catalogues strategies used by residents and staff to navigate loss and grief. To date, Dr. Miles has mailed out 400 toolkits to nursing homes and offers webinars to supplement the training.
Support Long-Term Care Facility Staff: Helpful Resources
Staff who care for residents in long-term care facilities also need to manage their own mental health needs, particularly during the ongoing stress of the pandemic. Compassion fatigue and burnout are particularly challenging given the impact on staff of seeing so many people getting sick and dying, said Dr. Forester.
Along with fearing for their own health, staff also face anxiety and depression. “I don’t think enough guidance has been put in place for either residents or staff,” he said. “There is always a lot of staff turnover in these facilities and this is escalating [during COVID-19].”
In Summary
Residents of long-term care facilities have had to weather long periods of isolation even before COVID-19 further restricted access to visitors and to mental healthcare. The toll all of this is taking on facility and nursing home residents is not completely known – what is known is that their needs are not going to disappear with a vaccine or an end to the pandemic.
Better measures are needed now to address the ongoing mental health needs of older needs, starting with hiring, training, and the integration of care teams. By bringing together behavioral and medical treatments, the quality of life for these already vulnerable seniors may be salvaged.

Older adults have been identified as a “population of interest” by the recent Lancet Psychiatry position paper on multidisciplinary research priorities for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (Holmes et al., 2020 ). The authors discuss issues that include “isolation, loneliness, end of life care, and bereavement,” noting that these may be exacerbated by the “digital divide” (Holmes et al ., 2020 ). Psychological stress in older adults stem from not only excess mortality risk leading many to self-isolate, but also restrictions instituted to mitigate COVID-19 risk. This is highlighted by a recent review of the psychological impact of quarantine that identified an increase in post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger (Brooks et al ., 2020 ).
Learning from history is a helpful starting point. Even as far back as the 1918–1919 “Spanish” influenza pandemic, there has been discussion of an increase in rate of psychosis and suicide at that time (Harris, 2006 ). The impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 on the mental health of older adults has received some attention. Compared with 2002 (28.4 per 100,000), the suicide rate in older adults in Hong Kong was higher in 2003 (40.4 per 100,000) and 2004 (34.0 per 100,000) (Cheung et al ., 2008 ). It was postulated that loneliness and disconnectedness were associated with this increase. The prevalence of probable post-traumatic stress disorder in Hong Kong was associated with older age and residing in SARS-prevalent regions (Lee et al ., 2006 ).
The very recent history of providing mental health services to older adults in China during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging, with the “digital divide,” quarantines, and restrictions on movement having significant impact (Yang et al ., 2020 ). Many older adults have experienced reduced access to specialist services and hospitals and delayed presenting for medical care due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Nursing homes have experienced staff and personal protective equipment shortages, and their residents have comprised a significant proportion of COVID-19 mortality (Pachana et al ., 2020 ). Residents have experienced relapse of their mental health condition due to restrictions on visitors and limited access to technology to facilitate other types of contact; a phone call or wave through the window is just not the same. However, many patients have embraced interventions delivered using technology such as telehealth, particularly when provided with support.
Older adults living with dementia in the COVID-19 world have experienced reduced access to support and activities. These changes have caused distress and exacerbated behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. We have seen community-dwelling older adults with dementia referred due to inability to understand and retain information about social distancing, with relatives fearing they will be at risk of contracting COVID-19 or receiving penalties from law enforcement agencies. A concerning development is the increasing media discussion about the relative worth of human lives based on age and remaining life expectancy which could divide generations and challenge established ethical values.
Our response to COVID-19 for older adults can borrow general mental health recommendations from historic pandemic influenza preparedness initiatives including a focus on strengthening social networks and community support, communication networks, directive leadership and stress management (Douglas et al ., 2009 ). One of the few positives in the pandemic literature in older adults is the possibility that older adults may experience more adaptive coping in a crisis than younger adults, as suggested by a study in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic (Yeung et al ., 2007 ). This resilience may relate to their lived experience of coping with adversity and could potentially be harnessed now.
It is heartening to see the relative increase in attention being paid to mental health by governments, researchers, and clinicians for those affected by COVID-19, when compared to previous pandemics (Lancet Psychiatry, 2020 ). Targeted research will be critical to inform the optimization of older adults’ mental health in the face of COVID-19. It will be important to review the mental health effects of past pandemics and interventions that are effective. Additionally, we can learn from countries that have experienced the effects of COVID-19 earlier. Unfortunately, research into the mental health of older adults has been affected by social distancing, nursing home restrictions, and an overwhelmed health system. Given that the impact of this pandemic may be protracted, clinicians and researchers will need to explore novel ways to reach older adults and provide interventions to improve their mental health during COVID-19 and into the future.

Part of The Coronavirus Pandemic: What You Need to Know
The Huge Emotional Toll COVID-19 Is Taking on Nursing Home Residents
A new survey's troubling findings on their mental health due to isolation

Caregiving
The cost of isolating frail elders in nursing homes — many of which have been on a literal lockdown for months — is taking an even steeper toll than aging advocates feared. A new survey of 365 nursing home residents in 36 states, conducted in July and August, by the nonprofit Altarum Institute shows that pandemic restrictions have affected nearly every part of their lives, especially their mental health.

Altarum executives said this is the first known poll of its kind to directly ask nursing home residents about their personal experiences during COVID-19. The survey was distributed nationally as an online, public link. Altarum reached out to nursing home residents through their friends, colleagues, aging associations, ombudsmen and long term care associations.
What they learned from those who responded was that their ability to freely move around, have outside visitors or socialize with other residents has significantly decreased since March — significantly impacting their psychological well-being.
Many of the open-ended comments are heartbreaking.
"I miss my family and I'm very lonely and depressed."
One resident noted, "If the virus doesn't kill me the loneliness will."
Another commented, "I have become more anxious and depressed due to the separation from my loved ones."
And another wrote, "I have little appetite and am losing weight."

"We've come a long way in understanding how to keep people safe, and also need to understand that the quality of life is paramount for people later in life, who are often in their last two or three years of life," said Anne Montgomery, co-director of Altarum's Program to Improve Eldercare. "Being restricted for six months is a very big percentage of their remaining lifetime and very obviously devastating. So, we would hope that this would be a further signal that we need to move away from such restrictions permanently."

The devastating emotional impact on many nursing home residents has also translated into accelerated physical and mental health decline, according to the report. Forty percent of deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. In response, most implemented a strict lockdown — barring visitors, family members, ombudsman, and essentially confining residents to their rooms for much of the time, with few exceptions. Additionally many facilities have suffered staffing shortages as workers contracted the virus and replacements were often difficult, or impossible, to find.
Many Nursing Home Residents Don't Leave Their Rooms
These restrictions, while intended to keep nursing home residents safer, have made a significant impact on their day-to-day lives. "I have been restricted to my room so long my life has gotten worse. No visitors, no going out, no nothing," commented one resident surveyed.
Despite the severe restrictions placed on socialization, some people living in nursing homes say they are doing their best to adapt. "I live a full life online, taking classes, visiting with friends, attending meetings. We have our programs on the TV now," said one.
On Sept. 17, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) issued new guidance easing some visitation restrictions, although each facility may interpret the guidelines differently.
Several respondents said they feel like they are in prison.
More than three-quarters (76%) of those responding said they felt lonelier under the restrictions; which is not surprising since nearly two-thirds (64%) said they don't ever leave their rooms to socialize with other residents.
"Social isolation and loneliness is not new," said Montgomery, "But the circumstances are much more extreme."
Many people living in nursing homes feel strongly that family visits should be a priority and that the facilities need to be more creative about how to make these visits possible. "I do get lonely at times and I sometimes cry," commented one resident.
Stark Findings From the Survey
Among the survey's other findings:
Only 5% had visitors three or more times per week, compared with 56% prior to the pandemic
93% said they did not leave their nursing home for routine activities such has having a meal with family members; prior to the pandemic only 42% did not leave the facility for routine community activities
Only 28% went outside to a patio, sitting area or similar location for fresh air at least once per week, compared with 83% pre-COVID
More than half (54%) are not participating in any organized activities like exercise classes, resident meetings or religious services; only 14% of residents didn’t get involved in such activities prior to March
Just 13% of respondents said they eat meals in a communal dining room, compared with 69% pre-pandemic

Several respondents said they feel like they are in prison and that total restrictions — such as staying in their rooms, no visitors and no communal dining — are too confining. The nursing home residents felt they should be afforded the option to assume a higher risk from visiting with family and that a total "lockdown" strategy is not workable.
Social Isolation Can Lead to Premature Death
According to the CDC, social isolation significantly increases the risk of premature death from all causes — a risk that is on par with smoking, obesity and physical inactivity. Social isolation is also associated with a 50% percent increased risk of dementia. Those with dementia may also be at risk for increased isolation.  And, emotional distress is another known risk factor for premature death.
"I miss hugs and touch, especially from my family members," said one survey respondent.
"I miss my family and I'm very lonely and depressed," said another.
The revised CMS guidance released in September was designed to help nursing homes facilitate visitation in both indoor and outdoor settings and in compassionate care situations. Guidelines include the screening all visitors, use of face coverings, maintaining at least six feet distance, hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched.
CMS urged outdoor visits, which pose a lower risk of coronavirus transmission due to increased space and airflow. Indoor visitation can be allowed if there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days and the facility is not conducting outbreak testing per CMS guidelines. Indoor visitation is also subject to other requirements.
Calls for Loosening Restrictions
"The unprecedented social isolation caused by this pandemic and our nation's patchwork response has caused anguish for nursing home residents, their families, as well as for the staff who do all they can to ensure residents' well-being," said Katie Smith Sloan, president and CEO of LeadingAge, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services.

She noted that the drastic restrictions required by CMS, while attempting to protect such a high-risk population from COVID-19 infection, has also highlighted the detrimental impact of social isolation.
"Maintaining connections and visits with family members is crucial to residents' well-being," said Sloan.
While some level of isolation is critical to prevent and contain the spread of the virus in nursing homes, this survey demonstrates that long-term restrictions on visitation negatively impact residents' quality of life, according to Montgomery. This means staff need to be flexible enough to make continual modifications to care protocols, staffing duties and workflows and the physical environment to help residents adjust to safety-focused restrictions, while not compromising their emotional and mental health, she added.
The report recommended nursing homes assess residents for social isolation and loneliness and develop approaches to address these situations as part of an individual's care plan. This includes creating visiting plans for residents who wish to see friends and family and improving communication.
The report also calls on CMS to issue guidance on incorporating residents' individual preferences about what level of risk they are comfortable with regarding group activities and COVID-19.

Families Anxious Over Loved Ones in Nursing Homes, Assisted Living
Officials continue to bar guests to protect vulnerable residents from coronavirus
by Deborah Schoch, AARP, Updated April 2, 2020

Floyd Morelos of Santa Fe, New Mexico, is turned away March 12, 2020, at the entrance to a nursing home and rehabilitation center where he sought to visit his 85-year-old mother.
En español | Nursing homes are entering the third week of sequestering their residents to protect them from the fast-spreading coronavirus , and family members physically cut off from their loved ones are increasingly worried about their care and mental health.
Since the first nursing home case in Kirkland, Washington, at least 150 skilled nursing facilities in more than half the states have at least one resident with COVID-19, according to data that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released March 23 and has not updated.
Two leading industry groups and the federal government said in early March that family and friends of residents of any type of senior living community should stay away because some people can have a COVID-19 infection without symptoms . Others may be contagious days before showing symptoms.
"We know that there is a risk that people who appear healthy will enter nursing homes and assisted living communities and still infect residents,” said Mark Parkinson, president and chief executive at the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living
Amy Johnson of Windom, Minnesota, was able to visit her husband, who has frontotemporal dementia, on March 11 but didn’t make her usual weekend trip a few days later and, like others whose friends and relatives are in lockdown, doesn’t know when she’ll be able to return.
“The timing is hard because I want to be there more frequently because of the decline of the disease,” she says, adding that her husband recently became incontinent. “It’s really scary to have this out there when you have someone who doesn’t know how to be sanitary.”
Other caregivers worry because it has been more about three weeks since they have been allowed to assist staff with the daily care of their loved ones. Wives feed husbands, husbands make sure that their spouses do their physical therapy, and social isolation and depression can be big worries.
"He won't let anybody clip his fingernails or shave him besides me,” Johnson says.
Emergency measures now in place
Both the health care and assisted living trade groups, based in Washington, D.C., had urged family and friends to stay away from senior living communities before the federal government restricted nursing home visits starting March 13 after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency amid the global pandemic.
The Department of Veterans Affairs began the isolation strategy March 10 by suspending most new admissions and barring outsiders from all of its 134 nursing homes and 24 spinal cord injury centers. The exception to the no-visitors rule: when a patient is expected to die soon, a guideline now in place at all nursing homes nationwide.

How to reduce infection risk
Residents, staff and visitors all should follow the same basic steps to reduce risk of infection, experts said:
• Wash hands often with soap, for at least 20 seconds. The World Health Organization offers illustrated guidelines.
• Use alcohol-based (with at least 60 percent alcohol) sanitizer if soap is not available
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth
• Avoid close contact with those who are sick
• Stay at home if you're sick
• Cover your cough or sneeze with tissue and throw the tissue in trash
• Clean and disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs and television remotes with alcohol or with bleach wipes
"The grim reality is that for the elderly, COVID-19 is almost a perfect killing machine,” Parkinson told CNN. “In our facilities the average age is 84, and everyone has underlying medical conditions. So when you combine those factors together, we are dealing with perhaps the greatest challenge that we ever have had."
The government also told nursing home officials to cancel all group activities and communal dining. Residents and staff are being "actively" screened for fever and respiratory problems, according to a CMS memo that did not define the frequency of actively.
Health officials made the same recommendation for assisted living facilities, where older people who have fewer nursing needs live in close quarters. Assisted living, independent living and continuing care communities are primarily under individual states’ oversight.
One prominent senior advocate said he worries that the government guidelines are depriving nursing home residents of important support.
"We are deeply concerned that residents are cut off from loved ones and vice versa," Richard J. Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York City, wrote in an email.
"We know that, in addition to providing company, love and a friendly face, families provide vital monitoring and often essential care," Mollot wrote. He urged those people concerned about the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services action to write their U.S. senators and representatives.
The nationwide coronavirus death toll has surpassed the official death toll — 2,403 — in the Dec. 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor attack and far above the 3,000 people who died initially in the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Deaths at Life Care Center in Kirkland, the Seattle-area nursing home that was the first long-term care facility in this country to have an outbreak, appear to be leveling out. Deaths totaled 37 as of midnight March 22, the last time officials reported specifically on deaths there. King County Public Health now is releasing fatality information by zip code and shows an increase of one in the past week for the area that includes the facility.
Those numbers are less than 1 percent of all COVID-19 deaths nationwide in the same period. For about a week after the virus hit at Life Care Center, the nursing home had more than two-thirds of U.S. fatalities.
Keep in touch remotely
"Nursing homes may have more to fear from visitors and staff carrying the virus than vice versa, as their residents are highly susceptible to the virus," Michael Dark, staff attorney at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform (CANHR) in San Francisco, wrote in an email.
But restricting visits doesn’t mean curtailing communication from family and friends, he said. Instead, they should email, use FaceTime or Skype or even make an old-fashioned telephone call to check in.
"We are deeply concerned that residents are cut off from loved ones and vice versa. ... Families provide vital monitoring and often essential care."

President Terry Fulmer of the John A. Hartford Foundation, a New York City-based national group dedicated to improving the care of older adults, suggested that family members and residents “stay in touch with your facility and closely monitor their messages. You can ask the facility about their infection plan.”
All of these senior living communities are required to have plans to prevent and monitor infections, she said in an email.
What began March 15 as a strong suggestion from California's governor to keep all of the state's residents 65 and older, whether in senior communities or not, from venturing out even for errands has evolved into stay-at-home orders in more than half of the states.
The VA as of Thursday had almost 2,000 coronavirus cases confirmed in 48 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, including more than 300 cases in New Orleans. Only in Iowa and Rhode Island do VA facilities have no reported cases.
Most patients were quarantined in their homes, according to VA press secretary Christina Mandreucci. Sixty-eight veterans have died of COVID-19 since the epidemic began.
Think through moving patients
Most advocates continue to urge family members not to panic and say it is unwise for them to bring loved ones home to try to avoid infection.
“Moving an older adult from a long-term care center is risky and could have long-lasting impacts,” geriatrician David Gifford, chief medical officer of the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living, wrote in an email.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend such moves, he said.
Others echoed that recommendation, saying germs are likely to flow more freely outside these communities than inside. Plus, residents are in nursing homes because they need higher levels of care than generally can be provided at home.
But one nursing home physician said that he would not discourage a family from bringing a relative home from a nursing facility.
“Frail elders are not going to have a lot of reserve to fight these things out,” said Karl E. Steinberg, a nursing home and hospice care medical director near San Diego and vice president of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.
“It’s got to be a case-by-case basis. But if people have the resources, I’d strongly consider bringing them home or, alternatively, considering a small group home setting,” Steinberg said.
Ask officials where your loved one lives about staffing changes and challenges as the epidemic develops and think about whether you’re prepared to provide care at all times as a solo caregiver. Make sure you know how mobile your loved one is now because that may have changed considerably from when the resident first moved in.

Staff must sanitize shared surfaces
A CMS memo issued to states in early March advised nursing home staff to limit the sharing of medical equipment among residents. When sharing equipment is necessary, it should be properly cleaned and disinfected before it is moved to another patient.
Staff also should avoid sharing items such as pens and pads. When phones, internal communication devices or nursing stations are shared, they should be disinfected frequently, the memo said.
“All staff, including housekeeping staff, receive in-service COVID-19 infection control training in addition to online infection control training,” spokesman Larry Elveru of Kendal, a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that operates continuing-care communities in eight states, wrote in an email. Staff are required to demonstrate what they’ve learned.
Advocates for older people have long criticized many long-term care facilities for staff shortages and lack of infection care. Residents and their families can consult Medicare’s five-star rating system to learn about their nursing home’s record on infection control. But the same sort of records are not offered for assisted living facilities.
Residents and family also can review CDC guidelines for health professionals. If they’re concerned that a facility is not following those standards, they can contact their area long-term care ombudsman, according to CANHR, the San Francisco-based advocacy group.

Workers finding gowns, masks in short supply
Many long-term care facilities are having trouble getting supplies including basic surgical masks and gowns, because of hospitals’ more intense needs. For peace of mind, look online at your long-term care company's and individual facility's website for information on how they’re guarding against the virus.
Brookdale Senior Living, a long-term care company based in Brentwood, Tennessee, has placed a banner at the top of its website so people can click for more information.
If any facility has suspected cases of COVID-19, experts provide these recommendations:
• Staff should use gowns, gloves and face masks or goggles when treating ill patients.
• Residents suspected of having the virus should be placed in single rooms with closed doors.
• Dining rooms may be closed and meals delivered to all residents’ rooms.
Those who feel they must visit any group living situation for older residents should be prepared for detailed questions.
Kendal-Crosslands Communities in Chester, Pennsylvania, went from asking guests to sign in and disclose prior travel to treating every person as if they have tested positive for the virus. The continuing-care community has 500 independent living homes and apartments as well as more intensive care and now is telling everyone to shelter in place.
"Assume it's in your community and take action now," Gifford said.

Coronavirus and older adults: Your questions answered

Alright, so I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they're saying about how nursing homes handle elderly people's mental health after COVID.

First, in Doc 1 from Psycom.net, it talks about the mental health needs of long-term care residents even before the pandemic. It mentions that nursing homes have a high prevalence of residents with mental health issues like depression, severe mental illness, or dementia, ranging from 70% to 80%. That's really high. Then, with the addition of COVID-19, there's been further isolation and loneliness, which has exacerbated anxiety and depression symptoms among residents.

Doc 1 also points out that during the pandemic, there were visitor restrictions, which led to increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. It's interesting because it contrasts with some data suggesting that older people in community settings might be faring better mentally during the pandemic, but in long-term care facilities, it's a different story.

The document emphasizes that the pandemic has further revealed endemic mental health issues in these communities and highlights the urgent need for better integrated mental healthcare in nursing homes. It discusses statistics on nursing homes in the US, including the number of facilities and residents, and the services they provide. It also mentions that many nursing homes provide mental health services, but there's a shortage of mental health professionals working in these settings, which has been magnified during the pandemic.

Furthermore, Doc 1 talks about treatment gaps in addressing mental health needs in nursing homes. It cites a study showing that a significant number of residents with mental illness do not receive help from psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or licensed social workers. There's a preference for a multidisciplinary team approach and a "train the trainer" model, where nurse specialists are trained to identify and address mental health needs.

Another issue mentioned is the federal mandate to reduce the use of psychiatric medications, particularly antipsychotic medications, which might not always be appropriate, especially when continuity of care is needed.

To help with mental health in nursing homes post-COVID, the document suggests integrating teams and bolstering training for staff, improving education on mental health challenges, and addressing grief, which is common among older adults due to losses associated with aging and the pandemic.

Doc 2 is a letter to the editor in the International Psychogeriatrics journal, discussing the mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. It references historical data from past pandemics and epidemics, such as the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2003 SARS epidemic, which showed increases in psychosis, suicide rates, and post-traumatic stress disorder in older adults.

The letter highlights the challenges faced by older adults in nursing homes during COVID-19, including reduced access to specialist services, delayed medical care due to fear of contracting the virus, and the impact on residents with dementia. It also mentions the digital divide and how many older adults have had to rely on technology for mental health interventions, sometimes with support.

There's a concern raised about media discussions on the relative worth of human lives based on age and remaining life expectancy, which could lead to generational divisions and challenge ethical values.

The authors suggest that strengthening social networks, communication networks, directive leadership, and stress management are crucial in应对疫情对老年人心理健康的影响。他们还提到，与年轻人相比，老年人可能在危机中表现出更适应的应对方式，这可能与他们生活中的经历有关。

总的来说，Doc 2强调了针对老年人的特定心理健康需求，并呼吁进行针对性的研究，以优化他们在COVID-19期间及以后的心理健康状况。

接下来是Doc 3 from Next Avenue, which is a publication by AARP. This article focuses on the emotional toll of COVID-19 on nursing home residents, based on a survey conducted by Altarum Institute. The survey involved 365 nursing home residents across 36 states in July and August 2020. It's notable because it directly asks nursing home residents about their personal experiences during the pandemic.

The survey reveals that pandemic restrictions have significantly impacted nearly every aspect of their lives, particularly their mental health. Residents reported increased loneliness and depression due to isolation, reduced social interactions, and limited opportunities for outdoor activities and communal dining.

Some striking quotes from residents include statements like "I miss my family and I'm very lonely and depressed" and "If the virus doesn't kill me, the loneliness will." These comments underscore the profound emotional distress many residents are experiencing.

The survey found that:

- 76% felt lonelier under the restrictions.

- 64% never left their rooms to socialize with other residents.

- Only 5% had visitors three or more times per week, compared to 56% before the pandemic.

- 93% did not leave the nursing home for routine activities, up from 42% pre-pandemic.

- Only 28% went outside for fresh air at least once a week, down from 83% before COVID.

- Over half (54%) were not participating in any organized activities, compared to 14% previously.

- Just 13% ate meals in a communal dining room, down from 69% pre-pandemic.

These statistics paint a picture of extreme isolation and a dramatic decrease in quality of life for nursing home residents during the pandemic.

The article also mentions that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued new guidance in September 2020 to ease visitation restrictions, but the implementation varied among facilities. Some residents felt that total lockdown strategies were not sustainable and that family visits should be prioritized with appropriate safety measures.

The survey highlights the need for nursing homes to assess residents for social isolation and loneliness and to develop approaches to address these issues as part of individual care plans. It also calls for CMS to issue guidance on incorporating residents' preferences regarding the level of risk they are comfortable with for group activities.

Doc 4 is a PubMed entry for a research article titled "Impact of COVID-19 in the Mental Health in Elderly: Psychological and Biological Updates" published in Molecular Neurobiology in 2021. Although I don't have access to the full text, the abstract and keywords suggest that the article discusses both psychological and biological aspects of how COVID-19 has affected mental health in the elderly.

Given the keywords like "Aged," "Mental Disorders," "Mental Health," and "Quality of Life," it's likely that the article delves into the neurological and physiological impacts of COVID-19 on older adults, possibly including the effects of social isolation and stress on brain function and mental well-being.

Lastly, Doc 5 is an AARP article from April 2020, discussing families' concerns about their loved ones in nursing homes during the early stages of the pandemic. It highlights the challenges of physical separation and the worries about care and mental health.

The article mentions that nursing homes were sequestering residents to protect them from the virus, leading to barred visits from family and friends. This was a difficult situation for both residents and their families, with concerns about the mental health and quality of care of the residents.

The article also touches on the recommendations from health officials and industry groups to restrict visits to minimize the risk of virus transmission, despite the emotional toll on residents and families.

It's clear from these documents that the mental health of elderly people in nursing homes has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to isolation, restricted visits, and the general stress and anxiety caused by the crisis. Nursing homes are facing challenges in providing adequate mental health support, partly due to shortages of mental health professionals and the difficulties posed by the pandemic.

Potential strategies to address these issues include integrating multidisciplinary teams, training staff to better recognize and manage mental health issues, leveraging technology for communication and mental health interventions, and finding safe ways to allow family visits.

In summary, nursing homes need to implement comprehensive approaches to support the mental health of their elderly residents in the aftermath of COVID-19, focusing on both immediate needs and long-term strategies to mitigate the lasting effects of the pandemic on residents' mental well-being.
