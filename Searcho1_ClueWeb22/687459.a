Alright, so I've got this question: "How does management greed influence budget decisions?" Hmm, interesting topic. I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think I can figure it out. First off, I need to understand what management greed is. I guess management greed refers to the excessive desire of managers or leaders in a company to maximize their own benefits, maybe at the expense of other stakeholders like employees, customers, or even the company itself.

Okay, so if managers are greedy, how might that affect their budget decisions? Budget decisions are about allocating resources, right? Deciding where to spend money and how much to spend on different aspects of the business. If managers are greedy, they might make decisions that benefit themselves personally rather than what's best for the company overall.

Let me think of some possible ways this could happen. Maybe they allocate more funds to departments or projects that directly benefit them personally, like giving themselves bonuses or investing in ventures that could increase their own wealth. Or perhaps they cut corners in areas that aren't directly related to their own interests, which could harm the company in the long run.

Wait a minute, I'm just speculating here. Maybe I should look up some information to get a better understanding. Maybe there are case studies or examples where management greed has influenced budget decisions negatively.

Top 10 Ridiculous Examples of Corporate Greed
By Karl Smallwood February 18, 2014 Updated: February 18, 2016 6 Comments 10 Mins Read
We can’t begrudge a business for making money — that’s the basis of capitalism, baby. But we can get annoyed when businesses decide to make or save money in ways that are clearly not in the best interest of us, the customer. Or when businesses show us their really unattractive, penny-pinching side, because no one wants to see that.
10. McDonald’s Saves Money by Using Less Cheese
The McDouble is one of McDonald’s staple menu items. We’d comment on it being quite telling that one of their most popular items today is their most popular item from a decade ago, if we weren’t super annoyed at the next sentence.
Pretty much the whole reason the McDouble exists is because the company wanted to take the ever-popular Double Cheeseburger off of the Dollar Menu, presumably because it was no longer cost-effective. After removing it and putting it on the regular menu with an inflated price, the McDouble took its place. The McDouble was essentially the exact same burger, minus a slice of cheese.
Now, we can fully understand why McDonald’s did this, but we have an issue. Why not just take off that single slice of pickle everyone throws away, and save money that way? Seriously McDonald’s, how could you miss that?
9. The Airline That Removed a Single Olive to Save $40,000, and the One That Removed Toilets to Make Space
The story goes that American Airlines removed a single olive from every salad served in first class to save money. That alone isn’t a big deal, because who’s going to miss one measly olive? But the annoying part is that there are hundreds of alternate ways an airline could save money. Simply washing the planes saves hundreds of dollars on fuel because it makes the plane weigh less. But no, it’s easier to just take away that olive. It’s not like those people are paying thousands of dollars for the privilege of flying first class, is it?
But whereas American Airlines wants to annoy their richest passengers, Ryan Air has no qualms about annoying everybody. This is the only explanation we can think of for why they decided to remove all but one of their toilets, thus allowing them to cram more people onto a place where one bad stomach is going to result in everyone soiling themselves at 30,000 feet. Wow; those guys have “not caring about your customers” down to an art form. It’s kind of beautiful, in a we-want-to-punch-them-in-the-face kind of way.
8. Ikea Makes Their Store Harder to Navigate to Make You Buy More Stuff
Ikea being like Narnia is a joke so tired we could barely bring ourselves to dress like a lion and hide in their wardrobes last Halloween. We still did of course, but our heart wasn’t in it.
Now, you’re probably thinking it’s just those crazy Swedish folks and their inferior, non-American floor layouts that are the problem. Alas no — they’re actually designed that way on purpose. You see, the average Ikea store is specifically designed to make moving around the store as confusing as possible, the idea being that the longer you spend in the store, the more likely you are to go, “Oh my god, have you seen how cheap these lamps are? We must buy 30 of them and turn our living room into a disco!”
Yes, Ikea is happy to inconvenience millions of customers, and make countless more think they’re lost and never going to see sunlight again, just to make them spend as much money as possible on crap they’ll never be able to put together anyway.
7. Orbitz Charges Apple Users More, Just Because They Can
If you happen to be reading this article from a Mac computer, then congratulations on your purchasing power. We’re not being sarcastic — people who own Macs supposedly have more money than those who don’t. Or at least according to Orbitz they do.
The vacation-hawking site was recently found to be employing software that would detect whether or not a person was browsing their site from a Mac. If they were, the site would show the user more expensive places and listings first.
The site defended the move by saying their Mac customers often spent more money, so by showing these customers more expensive listings first, Orbitz was merely cutting out the middleman, and potentially making a ton of extra money to boot.
6. Wal-Mart Bought Every American Flag It Could Just After 9/11
We think it’s safe to say that the events of 9/11 brought out the patriotic side of a lot of people, and when a person feels a little patriotic, it’s understandable that they’d want to do so with an American flag. If that’s your thing, go right ahead and wave that sucker proudly.
With that in mind it would take a really shady company to take advantage of such a tragic event. Oh, hey there’s Wal-Mart right on cue. Just after 9/11, Wal-Mart noticed that there was a huge spike in sales of American flags and things emblazoned with American Flags — t-shirts, mugs, dogs, etc. Seeing a gap in the market, and absolutely embracing the spirit of good ‘ol American capitalism, Wal-Mart bought every single American flag in the country, effectively cornering the entire market before anyone else could react.
5. Verizon Bans Tethering, So People will Pay More for Data Plans
Without getting too technical, tethering is the act of using your phone as a portable modem, thus allowing you to access the Internet without using a broadband connection. Pay attention to that last part in particular, because when you tether your phone there’s one thing you’re not doing: paying for a broadband connection.
Verizon, using its corporate clout, spearheaded a campaign to stop tethering apps, arguing that you using your UNLIMITED DATA PLAN that you were paying your dollars for, to use data in an unlimited fashion, wasn’t fair on them. Because Verizon doesn’t make enough money, evidently.
However, Verizon eventually relented, and agreed that stopping people from downloading tethering apps wasn’t fair. So it agreed to let people with unlimited data plans tether and use the data all they wanted, so long as they paid extra for “ mobile broadband service .” You know, even though their plan already included UNLIMITED DATA. This basically means that Verizon could charge customers twice if it detects they using the their phone’s data plan to access the Internet in a way they don’t approve of.
4. Shrinking Packaging But Pretending It’s Bigger (and Overcharging You Accordingly)
In a tough economy, you kind of expect companies to make cutbacks. One way to do so is by making portions smaller. However, you’d hope they’d at least be honest about it, or at the very least not lie about it.
Well, you’re reading the wrong list if you expect that. In the business world, there’s something known as the grocery shrink ray, which is basically a way of shrinking products without you realizing they’ve been shrunk. Dozens of companies have tried this in some way, shape, or form over the last few years. Tactics involve making boxes that are slightly taller yet slightly thinner, scooping out the bottom of a jar so you can put less product in it, and a host of other tactics specifically designed to make sure you don’t notice that you’re being sold less and less food for the exact same amount of money.
Seriously, go look in your cupboard right now. We can guarantee there’s something in there that’s smaller, thinner, or taller than a similar product you bought last year. And you paid a whole bunch more for the privilege.
3. Selling a Product as Free-Range, Even Though It Isn’t, Simply to Charge More
Free-range eggs are supposed to give the chicken laying your toast toppers the best possible life, mainly so you don’t have to feel guilty about eating their unborn young. They cost a little more, but it’s worth it for the well-being of the chickens, or it would be if people didn’t use the label to milk people for as much money as they could without caring about the chickens at all.
In Australia, due to incredibly lax laws regarding what actually constitutes “free range,” the EcoEgg company was able to label their eggs as free-range while keeping their chickens in deplorable conditions that were the exact opposite of what people paying their mark-up would expect. This allowed them to sell the eggs for as much as double the price of eggs from caged hens, while treating them almost as badly. You have to admit, that’s an impressive level of douchebaggery right there.
2. Paying Producers 29 Pence When They Asked for 30
Milk is one of those things virtually everyone needs to buy at least once a week, so you’d expect that the people producing it have a pretty sweet deal, since they pretty much have guaranteed sales every week. Right?
Well not in England, where dairy farmers found themselves being squeezed by some of the biggest supermarkets. The farmers were asking for 30 pence a liter, a figure they stated was the absolute minimum they could live on. Some stores, despite the fact they were making tons of profit anyway, only raised the amount they’d give farmers to 29 pence . You may notice this is exactly one penny less than the farmers asked for, a penny they could easily take from their own profits. But screw that — it’s easier to just pay the farmers a tiny bit less than what they need, and watch them struggle. Struggle makes milk taste sweeter, you know.
1. The Amazing List of Sony Proprietary Failures
Sony is a great company that has made some pretty great devices, but ye Gods are they greedy. For example, if you went to the store and bought yourself a shiny new PlayStation Vita, you’d be stuck paying about $100 for a 64GB memory card. If you wanted to pay less for a different card, then tough tits, because you literally had no other options. The Vita only works with proprietary, Sony-made memory cards. These cards just so happen to cost a crapload more than what a regular memory card costs, for no real reason other than “screw you, customer.”
This isn’t a new thing with Sony either — when they released the first PSP, you could only use Sony-created memory cards that cost way more than regular ones. When they released the PSP Go, they straight-up added $50 to the sale price for no other reason than to give stores a bigger profit margin. The PSP itself only worked with UMD disks, a format made only by Sony that no one wanted to support.
Go back another few years and you’ll find Minidisks, a tiny recordable disk that was set to take on CDs, but never sold because Sony jacked up the price. What we’re trying to say is: Sony is great, but if they made condoms they’d only work on penises sold by Sony.

Behavioral Aspects of Budgeting | Type |- Accountinguide
Behavioral Aspects of Budgeting
Based on Hopwood (1973), he had identified three styles of using the budget to evaluate management performance, which is Budget constrained style, Profit conscious style, and Non-accounting style.
Behavioral aspects of budgeting
Budget Constraint Style
This budget style will try to ensure that the employee works hard and achieve the company budget within the short term. The budget is the only criterion to evaluate management performance. There is no justification that can use to evaluate a manager.  For example, manufacturing is running out of raw material during a peak production period due to some reasons which is not under company control. The procurement manager has placed a particular order at a slightly high price in order to have material on time with a fast shipping option.
However, he will consider as poor performance because he purchases material at a higher price than budget. This approach will lead to conflict between managers and teams due to the concept of a budget is always right. The team may feel that the decision is not making any scenes, while the top manager only follows the budget. Sometimes the manager tries to achieve the short term budget at the expense of company long term benefit. In a serious case, it will encourage the manager to manipulate the report to top management.
Profit conscious style
This budget style allows the front line employees to make decision base on their judgment which is aim to increase company long term benefit. The management will provide guidance but not a strict rule or policy. It encourages flexibility rather than completely follow the budget. In the above example, the procurement manager will rewarded for his flexibility which help to get material on time so the company can meet customers order and prevent any production interruption. It will strengthen employee and management relationships. The manager will open a discussion with the employee rather than push them to follow a strict rule. As a result, the company will be able to make a good profit in the long term.
Non Accounting Style
This budget style does not pay attention to the financial figure. It evaluates management performance base on other factors such as product quality, number of users, and customer satisfaction. The best example of this budget is tech companies such as Instagram, Uber, and Tesla. These companies had to make a loss for such a long time, but they are in a good position where the market share increase with high customer satisfaction. The share price keeps increasing as the shareholders expect the company to make a big profit in the future.

Greed, Money, and Its Effect On Managing  It’s true that money is a strong motivator for employees, but one thing it can’t do is make people like their jobs. And if your employees don’t like what they’re doing, their performance will suffer. Here’s how you can bring out the best in your employees and also have a positive effect on your bottom line.
The problem with greed
Just take a look at the economic crash of 2009 and one will see the impact of greed on the economic system. Nowadays it seems enough is not enough. The organizational drive to increase margins, lower costs, improve productivity continues to be the main emphasis in business. After all this is what our schools teach. What gets lost is the balance between the drive for just making money and making work enjoyable. When people find joy in their work, they want to help to improve the business and are more creative and willing to offer suggestions. While the desire by management is for collaboration, often the management does the opposite placing people in competition vs. one another. This leads to the mistrust between employees and management.
Greed takes over
Soon, people start to compete against each other in the race for the increasing salaries and awards. In the end the winners feel more pressure to stay on top and the losers feel like well losers! To improve the teamwork the emphasis should be on the collaboration and not on competition.
I have seen so many performance systems which are set in January and frozen until the following December. As business environment changes, management needs to work together with their staff to change goals and objectives. In many organizations performance goals are established early by top management and as a result these goals and the possibility of reward becomes the only thing which people are focused on. When the performance system is tied directly to specific goals with no flexibility, greed takes over. Short-cuts are made, integrity is compromised and as we have seen with the financial crash of 2009, ethics disappear.
Why people dislike their work
People grow to dislike their work for three main reasons. The work no longer aligns their abilities and interests. The environment no longer enables them to grow and develop. The management is poor and not supportive.
Often management forgets that motivation at work is complex and driven by a number of factors. Often the silly contests, performance goals and motivational lunches produce the opposite of the desired effect.
Many HR programs for example aim to get employees motivated by such external factors as the better review, the holiday party, and the annual bonus. Better would be to offer education helping people learn how to motivate themselves which in return would produce more productivity and joy at work. Just once I would like to see a performance review which measures the amount of joy at work. When people love their work the organization benefits in many ways. Creativity is high, communication is open and people take risks.
The best managers know that you can’t expect long term success when the only motivational strategy is external short term rewards.
Don’t reward, especially with money
What would an organization do if they couldn’t reward with money? I often ask this question and always amazed with the blank looks I receive.
There are many ways.
First give people work worth doing. Put a process in place to help match people to the right work. There are many people in the organization that may have strong skills but no longer interested in work they are doing. Find new levels of work for them. There are also people in the organization who are very interested in aspects of the business but lack the skills. Give them new learning opportunities.
When people enjoy their work, it becomes the reward itself especially for the older worker. Provide opportunities for self-assessment, group collaboration and risk taking without penalty for failure. This would be more helpful than offering bonuses for achieving new goals. Behaviorism has not done anyone a favor with the carrot and stick approach.
The problem with ranking and rating and competition
Many high tech firms and others cherish their annual ranking and rating systems competing workers against each other. It drives away creativity, joy, and passion for workers. This approach may work short term for the younger worker but not for the more experienced worker over 40.
Why should this matter to the organization? Despite the economic crisis, there are still more work related choices than ever before. People can still choose to leave and go elsewhere. Only the most successful firms will thrive with people who stay for a long period of time.
Organizations which put their employees against one another will find this strategy inadequate for the long term.
We need better role models
The best managers know how to balance achieving work results and enabling people to find joy in their work. The best managers demonstrate that they care about their people despite their performance. The best managers know that people don’t wake up in the morning to do a bad job. The best managers step back and study the overall system always seeking to make improvements where needed.
Place emphasis on the team
Often at work, we have challenges and are not sure what to do. In other cases we feel unchallenged but with many skills. Placing the emphasis on teamwork ensures a culture of working together, helping, teaching, and leading. Teams solve problems better than individuals. This can occur only when the system promotes collaboration vs. competition. The best managers reward teams and encourage more collaboration.
The management system must change
Many management systems based on either behaviorism by B.F Skinner or Scientific management by Frederick Taylor are outdated and need to be changed. People today have more choices about what to do and where to do their work. Society itself has become more mature in the last 100 years. People are growing to expect more out of their work than just a paycheck and a bonus. The best managers provide outlets for creativity, innovation, and autonomy.
Make collaboration the goal
When people are encouraged to work with one another, fear tends to disappear in the environment and productivity can increase. With collaboration, people become more aware of the interdependency with others. Also, they are more interested in results of their combined work.
Make the work the reward!
As people feel joy at work, this becomes the reward. The best managers work hard to stay out of the way as much as possible.
Eliminate fear and threat
Adults don’t respond well to threats and when it repeats on a regular basis they start to sabotage the system undermining the aim for quality results.
Time for a change and new approach
The ever so popular Dilbert cartoon series was funny because it was true! The era of greed is over. We need a new era of best managers who try new approaches which enable people to have joy and meaning at work WHILE also getting great business results!

Behavioral Aspects of Budgeting in Managerial Accounting
View Stock/View Stock/Getty Images
An official budget may look like a rational, objective document, but it's often anything but. Budgeting is a key part of managerial accounting, which focuses on using financial information for planning and decision-making. Unlike with financial accounting, managers have to consider human nature, not just numbers, when putting together a budget. For instance, the managers who draw up a budget may have personal priorities that skew the numbers. The employees who live with the budget may resent the limits it puts on them.
Getting Buy-In
The simplest, quickest way for management to draw up a budget is to do it top-down, without consulting the lower ranks. This is a popular approach in corporations with centralized decision-making, but it can cause problems. Workers and lower-level managers may think the budget sets an unrealistic standard and resent being told to live by it. When management solicits feedback and employee input, it takes longer. Employees who feel they've helped set the budget, however, are more likely to make it work.
Self-Interested Managers
Budgets aren't always objective, because management isn't objective. Whoever participates in drawing up the budget may have vested interests. For example, a department head has a stake in emphasizing her department's need for extra resources and a bigger share of the money. That can lead to him inflating estimates of the money the department needs or how much it contributes to the company. An effective budget-making process has to include enough objective analysis that it can get past the human factor.

Constraints and Resentment
Some employees feel a budget is a form of punishment. Managers can use budgets to deny even reasonable requests or penalize employees for spending too much. Workers may feel they can't do their jobs properly because of restrictions. Employees can become even more hostile if meeting the budget is a key standard in assessing performance. An article in "Accounting Historians Journal" says employees shackled to a bad budget are likely to pad estimates and fudge figures to get around it.
Making It Work
Getting employee input in drawing up the budget can help them commit to making it work. It also helps if managers present budgets as something they and their staff will tackle as a team, working together. Efforts to involve employees have to be sincere, though. A phony display of interest in the employees' view or a show of hearing their concerns won't cut it. Employees see through those tricks, and that makes them even more cynical about the management goals and decisions.

Alright, so I've got some information here from these documents. Let me see how they relate to the question about management greed influencing budget decisions.

First, there's Doc 1, which is from Toptenz.net, listing examples of corporate greed. Some of these examples show how companies make decisions that prioritize saving money or increasing profits, sometimes at the expense of customer satisfaction or ethical considerations. For instance, American Airlines removing an olive from first-class salads to save money, or Ikea designing their stores to be confusing to encourage more spending. These examples illustrate how companies might make budget decisions that reflect a greedy mindset, focusing on maximizing profits even in small ways.

Doc 2 is from Chegg.com, discussing an example where a manager makes decisions that benefit her financially at the expense of the firm. This directly relates to management greed influencing decisions. The ethical issue highlighted here is a "conflict of interest," where the manager's personal financial interests conflict with her duties to the company. This can lead to budget decisions that aren't in the best interest of the company or its stakeholders.

Doc 3 is from Accountinguide.com and discusses behavioral aspects of budgeting, categorizing styles into budget-constrained, profit-conscious, and non-accounting styles. The budget-constrained style seems rigid, where managers are evaluated strictly based on adhering to the budget, which might lead to short-term thinking and neglect of long-term benefits. This could be influenced by management's greed for meeting short-term financial targets.

Doc 4 is from ZenBusiness.com and talks about greed, money, and its effect on managing. It argues that an overemphasis on financial rewards and competition can lead to a toxic work environment, where employees focus solely on personal gain rather than collaborative success. This aligns with the idea that management greed can create a culture where budget decisions prioritize individual rewards over collective well-being.

Doc 5 is from Bizfluent and discusses behavioral aspects of budgeting in managerial accounting. It mentions that managers may have self-interested motivations when creating budgets, which can skew the numbers to benefit their departments or themselves. This again points to how management greed can influence budget decisions, potentially leading to unrealistic or unfair allocations of resources.

From these documents, it seems clear that management greed can significantly influence budget decisions in several ways:

1. **Prioritizing Short-Term Gains:** Managers may make budget decisions that maximize immediate profits or personal benefits, even if these decisions are detrimental in the long run.

2. **Skewed Priorities:** Self-interested managers might allocate more resources to areas that benefit them personally, at the expense of other important aspects of the business.

3. **Rigidity and Lack of Flexibility:** A budget-constrained approach may ignore broader business needs or market changes, focusing solely on meeting financial targets.

4. **Creating a Toxic Work Environment:** Overemphasizing financial rewards can foster a competitive, cutthroat culture where employees are pitted against each other, leading to decreased morale and collaboration.

5. **Ethical Dilemmas:** Conflicts of interest can arise when managers make budget decisions that benefit them personally but harm the company or its stakeholders.

In conclusion, management greed can lead to budget decisions that are shortsighted, self-serving, and damaging to the overall health and sustainability of the organization. It's crucial for companies to implement robust governance and ethical standards to mitigate these risks.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Management greed can lead to budget decisions that prioritize short-term gains, skew resource allocation for personal benefit, foster a toxic work environment, and create ethical dilemmas, all of which can harm the organization's long-term health and sustainability.}} \]
