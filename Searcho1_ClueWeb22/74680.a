As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can certainly help you understand how domestic violence affects society based on research and data available. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what domestic violence is. Domestic violence refers to a pattern of behavior in any relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner or family member. It can take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats.

Now, to understand how this affects society, I should consider both the immediate impacts on individuals and the broader societal consequences.

Let me start by considering the immediate effects on victims. Domestic violence can lead to physical injuries, chronic health problems, mental health issues like depression and anxiety, and even death in severe cases. These personal traumas not only affect the victims but also their children, friends, and extended family.

Moreover, domestic violence often leads to economic hardships. Victims may lose their jobs due to absence caused by injuries or have to leave their homes, leading to homelessness or instability. This can strain social services and impact the economy.

I should also think about the legal and criminal justice system's role. Domestic violence cases consume significant resources in terms of law enforcement, court proceedings, and prison populations. This diverts resources that could be used for other public services.

Additionally, domestic violence has intergenerational effects. Children who witness or experience violence are more likely to perpetuate violent behaviors in their own relationships, creating a cycle that persists across generations.

It's also important to consider the impact on communities. High rates of domestic violence can lead to a general sense of insecurity and can affect community cohesion and stability.

Furthermore, there are indirect costs such as medical expenses, lost productivity, and the need for support services like counseling and shelters.

I think it would be helpful to look at some statistics to quantify these impacts. For example, according to the World Health Organization, domestic violence is a major public health problem and a violation of human rights. It's estimated that about one in three women worldwide have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives.

In terms of economic impact, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States estimated that intimate partner violence alone cost the U.S. economy over $8.3 billion per year, including both direct medical costs and indirect costs like lost productivity.

Moreover, domestic violence can have long-term effects on society's overall well-being and development. It undermines gender equality, limits women's participation in the workforce and politics, and affects children's educational outcomes and future opportunities.

Considering all these factors, it's clear that domestic violence has profound and multifaceted effects on society. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive approaches that include prevention education, support for victims, accountability for perpetrators, and efforts to change societal norms that tolerate or excuse violence.

In conclusion, domestic violence affects society by causing physical and emotional harm to individuals, straining economic resources, consuming criminal justice system resources, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of violence, reducing community safety and cohesion, and undermining gender equality and social development.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Domestic violence affects society by causing physical and emotional harm to individuals, straining economic resources, consuming criminal justice system resources, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of violence, reducing community safety and cohesion, and undermining gender equality and social development.}} \]
