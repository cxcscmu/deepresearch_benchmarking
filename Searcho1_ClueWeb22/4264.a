So I have this question: "Does personality change over time?" Hmm, that's interesting. I've always thought that people have certain traits that define their personality, but I've also noticed that people can change or grow over the years. So, does personality actually change, or is it more stable?

First, I need to understand what personality is. Personality refers to the unique combination of characteristics, behaviors, and patterns that make up an individual's distinctive character. It includes things like temperament, attitudes, values, and social habits. So, it's a broad concept that covers a lot of aspects of a person's behavior and thoughts.

Now, regarding whether it changes over time, I guess it depends on various factors. Some people might argue that personality is relatively stable throughout adulthood, while others might say that life experiences can shape and alter personality traits over time.

I recall hearing about the five-factor model of personality, which includes openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These are often referred to as the Big Five personality traits. Maybe looking into how these traits develop or change over time could help answer the question.

Let me consider some real-life examples. Take, for instance, someone who was very shy and introverted as a teenager but gradually became more outgoing and confident in their twenties and thirties. That seems like a change in personality traits. Or someone who experienced a traumatic event and became more cautious or anxious afterward. These scenarios suggest that personality can evolve in response to life events and personal growth.

On the other hand, there are people who seem to maintain their core personality traits throughout their lives. For example, someone who has always been optimistic and enthusiastic from a young age continues to exhibit those qualities well into old age. So, maybe some aspects of personality are more fixed than others.

Perhaps it's a combination of both stability and change. Certain fundamental traits might remain relatively constant, while other aspects can be more malleable and susceptible to change based on experiences, learning, and maturation.

I should probably look up some research on this topic to get a better understanding. Maybe there are longitudinal studies that have tracked personality changes over time or theories in psychology that address this issue.

Let me try to search for some information on whether personality changes over time.

Does Your Personality Change Over Time? You Are Who You Are, But Here's How You'll Grow

Experts Reveal Just How Much Your Personality Really Changes As You Get Older

Looking back on Julia at age 13 and Julia at 26, it’s become clear to me that I am who I am. But that doesn’t necessarily mean I’m always the same, if that makes sense. It’s like this: While a few core values, views, and character traits have stuck with me throughout my entire life —  like the fact that I’m naturally a jealous person, a perfectionist, and love with my whole heart — I’ve definitely grown wiser, stronger, and to this day, I continue to develop into the person I was meant to be. Your personality changes over time, and according to new research, that’s perfectly normal. However, certain traits tend to stick with you for your entire life, so really, the only way to know for sure if your personality has changed over the years is to compare your present self to your past self — not to others around you.
Before you can really grasp what, specifically, about your personality is bound to stick and change, it’s important to keep in mind that most experts believe your personality forms during early childhood, Robert Glatter, M.D., an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, tells Elite Daily. In other words, you’re pretty much your own person right off the bat. However, Glatter says, your personality is ultimately a combination of two things: genetics and life experience, which means certain elements of who you are can be subject to change depending on a) what life throws at you, and b) how you’ll adapt to your surroundings.

To assess how your personality changes over time, a first-of-its-kind study was performed by researchers from the University of Houston, the University of Tuebingen in Germany, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who drew data drawn from a personality questionnaire given to high school students in 1960, ScienceDaily reports. The team followed up with those surveyed almost 50 years later, asking questions that compared and contrasted their teenage personalities to what their personalities were like in the present.
The study's findings, which have been published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, showed that, generally speaking, your dominant personality traits are most likely going to stay dominant throughout your entire life. But at the same time, the research found, your personality is also pretty malleable in that, well, life just sort of happens, and sometimes those life events cause you to gain a different perspective and change your mind accordingly. And according to Dr. Sherry Benton, founder of TAO Connect, a psychology professor emeritus, and former counseling center director at the University of Florida (who wasn't involved in this particular study), this is 100 percent natural and, in a sense, kind of inevitable.
"All of our experiences are constantly changing us, and modifications to our personality are inevitable," Benton tells Elite Daily over email, adding that, while you and I might not always have control over what life has in store for us, we can "consciously change our thinking and behavior in positive ways that improve our adaptation to life and satisfaction." In other words, even if you feel like the deck you've been dealt in life is kind of a dud, that doesn't necessarily mean your personality, or the way you feel, or the things you believe in, have to be a reflection of that. To an extent, you're in control of who you are as a person, so the best thing you can do is accept what you can't control, and work on changing what you can.
So what exactly doesn’t change about your personality? Well, to put it into perspective, think of it this way: Some people, when they’re little, absolutely detest broccoli. Then, when they grow up, they learn to appreciate the nutrients in green veggies and end up adding broccoli to almost every meal — they can’t get enough of the stuff. Those minute details are subject to change, but let’s say you’ve always identified as being an introvert, aka someone who tends to value their alone time more than others. That, Benton says, is most likely not going to change.
If you're a true introvert, Brenton tells Elite Daily, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll wake up one morning and become an extrovert with a flick of a switch. However, "you can build excellent social skills and function well when more extroverted behavior is called for," she explains. Because the thing is, in life, you’re always going to have to adapt to your surroundings to some extent. This doesn’t mean you’re changing who you are at your core; it just means you’re moving with the current. Again, this is totally natural and, in some instances, all too necessary.
Something to keep in mind in regards to how your personality changes over time, though, is that just because certain personality traits of yours, or the personalities of other people, don't seem to be changing over time, that doesn't mean you or anyone else stays exactly the same throughout their entire lives. "Our personality can and will be impacted by the company we keep [and] the physical environment we find ourselves in, and the combination creates changes in our personality," Shannon Thomas, an award-winning therapist and survivor of psychological abuse, tells Elite Daily. There are multiple layers to your personality, she says, and the best way to acknowledge them and determine whether or not they've evolved is by taking note of who you are and how the circumstances around you have shaped your identity and how you respond to things. At the end of the day, we're all just kind of growing into the best versions of ourselves that we can be, and that really all you can do.

Does your personality change as you get older?
By Isobel Whitcomb published August 23, 2020
Good news: we get better over time.

Between adolescence and adulthood, you go through a host of changes — jobs, regrettable haircuts and relationships that come and go. But what about who you are at your core? As you grow older, does your personality change?
Personality is the pattern of thoughts, feelings and behaviors unique to a person. People tend to think of personality as fixed. But according to psychologists, that's not how it works. "Personality is a developmental phenomenon. It's not just a static thing that you're stuck with and can't get over," said Brent Roberts, a psychologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
That's not to say that you're a different person each day you wake up. In the short term, change can be nearly imperceptible, Roberts told Live Science. Longitudinal studies, in which researchers survey the personalities of participants regularly over many years, suggest that our personality is actually stable on shorter time scales.

In one study, published in 2000 in the journal Psychological Bulletin, researchers analyzed the results of 152 longitudinal studies on personality, which followed participants ranging in age from childhood to their early 70s. Each of these studies measured trends in the Big Five personality traits. This cluster of traits, which include extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and neuroticism, are a mainstay of personality research. The researchers found that individuals' levels of each personality trait, relative to other participants, tended to stay consistent within each decade of life.
That pattern of consistency begins around age 3, and perhaps even earlier, said Brent Donnellan, professor and chair of psychology at Michigan State University. When psychologists study children, they don't measure personality traits in the same way they do for adults. Instead, they look at temperament — the intensity of a person's reactions to the world. We come into the world with unique temperaments, and research suggests that our temperaments as children — for example, whether we're easy going or prone to temper tantrums, eager or more reluctant to approach strangers — correspond to adult personality traits. "A shy 3-year-old acts a lot different from a shy 20-something. But there's an underlying core," Donnellan told Live Science.
Earlier temperament seems to affect later life experience. For example, one 1995 study published in the journal Child Development followed children from the age of 3 until the age of 18. The researchers found, for instance, that children who were shyer and more withdrawn tended to grow into unhappier teenagers.
But those decades add up. Throughout all those years, our personality is still changing, but slowly, Roberts said. "It's something that's subtle," he added. You don't notice it on that five-to-10-year time scale, but in the long term, it becomes pronounced. In 1960, psychologists surveyed over 440,000 high school students — around 5% of all students in the country at that time. The students answered questions about everything from how they reacted to emotional situations to how efficiently they got work done. Fifty years later, researchers tracked down 1,952 of these former students and gave them the same survey. The results, published in 2018 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that in their 60s, participants scored much higher than they had as teenagers on questions measuring calmness, self-confidence, leadership and social sensitivity.
Again and again, longitudinal studies have found similar results. Personality tends to get "better" over time. Psychologists call it "the maturity principle." People become more extraverted, emotionally stable, agreeable and conscientious as they grow older. Over the long haul, these changes are often pronounced.
Some individuals might change less than others, but in general, the maturity principle applies to everyone. That makes personality change even harder to recognize in ourselves — how your personality compares with that of your peers doesn't change as much as our overall change in personality, because everyone else is changing right along with you. "There's good evidence that the average self-control of a 30-year-old is higher than a 20-year-old," Donnellan said. "At the same time, people who are relatively self-controlled at 18 also tend to be relatively self-controlled at age 30."
So why do we change so much? Evidence suggests it's not dramatic life events, such as marriage, the birth of a child or loss of a loved one. Some psychologists actually suggest these events reinforce your personality as you bring your characteristics with you to that particular situation, Donnellan said.
Instead, changing expectations placed on us — as we adjust to university, the work force, starting a family — slowly wears us in, almost like a pair of shoes, Roberts said. "Over time you are asked in many contexts across life to do things a bit differently," he said. "There's not a user manual for how to act, but there's very clear implicit norms for how we should behave in these situations." So we adapt.
Depending on how you look at it, it's a revelation that's either unsettling or hopeful. Over time, personality does change, progressively and consistently — like tectonic plates shifting rather than an earthquake. "That opens up the question: Over the life course, how much of a different person do we become?" Roberts said.

Can Your Personality Change Over Your Lifetime?
Can Your Personality Change Over Your Lifetime?
A new study finds that some personality traits are fairly stable and others tend to change, helping us to mature over time.
By Jill Suttie| October 15, 2018
When I was 16 years old, I was a pretty outgoing teen with lots of friends and a busy social calendar. I took my academics seriously and was diligent about doing homework. But I also tended to worry a lot and could cry at the drop of a hat.
Now here I am more than 50 years later, and, in many ways, I seem much the same: extraverted and conscientious, but a bit neurotic. Does that mean that my personality hasn’t changed over the last half-century?
Not necessarily. Many of us tend to think of personality as being fixed and unchangeable—the part of you that is inherently who you are. But according to a recent study, while our early personalities may provide a baseline, they are surprisingly malleable as we age.
In this study, researchers had access to unusual survey data. American adolescents had filled out questionnaires about their personalities in the 1960s and then had done so again fifty years later, reporting on personal qualities associated with the “ Big Five ” personality traits:
Extraversion: How outgoing, social, cheerful, or full of energy and enthusiasm you are in social settings.
Agreeableness: How warm, friendly, helpful, generous, and tactful you are.
Emotional stability (or its opposite, neuroticism): How calm, content, and unflappable—versus anxious, angry, jealous, lonely, or insecure—you are.
Conscientiousness: How organized, efficient, and committed you are to finishing projects or reaching your goals.
Openness to experience: How curious, adventuresome, and receptive you are to new ideas, emotions, and experiences.
Some of the findings were quite provocative. Most notably, people’s personality traits did not always stay the same over the five decades, with many people showing quite dramatic changes.
“Some of the changes we saw in personality traits over the 50 years were very, very large,” says the lead author of the study, Rodica Damian of the University of Houston. “For emotional stability, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, the changes were one[s] which would be clearly visible to others.”
On the other hand, that didn’t mean that people didn’t stay true to their personality traits over time at all. Coauthor Brent Roberts of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign says that much of our personality does seem to stay the same—just not as much as we might expect. For example, an extraverted teenager like me would have a 63 percent chance of still identifying as an extravert in their 60s, he says.
Why does this matter? Thinking of personality as fixed could lead us to feel like we can never grow, or to dismiss people with certain qualities we don’t like, concerned that change isn’t possible when that’s not the case.
Still, we don’t simply change our personalities in random ways, explain the researchers. What seems to be more consistent over time is the relationship among all of our personality traits. This means that if someone tended to be really conscientious but a bit disagreeable or neurotic early on, they might keep that relative personality profile as they aged, even if some of their traits shifted a bit.
Additionally, the researchers found that adolescents as a group tended to move in a positive direction for particular traits—like emotional stability, conscientiousness, and agreeableness—after 50 years, suggesting a growth in social maturity.
“These attributes of social maturity are good things to acquire, if you want to get along with your spouse and coworkers and stay healthy,” Roberts says.
This finding fits well with some of Roberts’s prior research showing that people experience smaller, incremental personality changes over shorter periods of time. And it helps confirms his theory that personality change is cumulative over our lifespan, likely happens in response to our life experiences, and often leans in a positive, helpful direction.
So, apparently, our personalities are a mix of stable and unstable. Roberts advises parents and teachers to keep that in mind when they try to influence their children to be more responsible or mature. Change, when it happens, occurs gradually rather than all at once, he says, which means we need patience with kids who are growing into themselves.

“If you go into the enterprise of shaping your child’s personality, be humble in your approach…and much more forgiving,” he says.
Even the elderly, whom we might expect to be more rigid and set in their ways, can change. Therapists who work with older clients with neurotic tendencies or troubled relationships should not feel discouraged or give up, says Damian, given what research shows is possible.
Damian also argues that this research could inform people in long-term relationships. Rather than expecting someone to be the same person they were decades ago, partners would be better served by learning to value what remains constant in someone’s personality while simultaneously embracing personality shifts as they occur.
“If you married someone because they’re a fine person, they’re probably still going to be a fine person later on; so that’s reassuring,” she says. “But at the same time, it’s important to keep an eye on them to see how they’re changing, so you don’t get blindsided by the changes and grow apart.”
So, am I changing myself? I hope so—at least on some level. I like the idea of letting go of some of my neuroticism, while becoming more agreeable and conscientious as I enter my older years.
Who knows? Maybe I am the teen I used to be…only a bit more mature.

You are not fixed in stone. Your personality changes over time. Here’s how – Part 1
You grow up, your personality gets fixed, and that’s you for life… or is it? It looks like nobody’s personality is set in stone. We change, and that’s great news for your career. Read more…
You’re Different! How Your Personality Changes Over Time – Part 1
Plenty of us have an aspect our personalities we’re not exactly thrilled with, something we’d like to change. What’s yours? You might feel you’re too reserved, too loud, speak too plainly, get exasperated too quickly or are far too patient and lenient with challenging people.
Not so long ago, the word on the streets was that people don’t change with age and experience. But it looks like we’re not fixed forever after all. Now it’s becoming clear we do change as we get older, and nobody’s personality is set in stone. The news has obvious and profound consequences for the world of work. Here’s part one of our two-part article about the way personalities change over time, with experience, and what that might mean to your everyday working life.
The ‘big 5’ personality traits
You’ve probably heard of them. The big 5 personality traits have long been pinned down as openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and neuroticism, each representing a range between two extreme points. It’s the relative amount of each trait that makes up your personality. But a growing body of evidence proves that people can and do change over time, thanks to a wide range of very different influences.
Are we really set in stone?
Until recently most of us considered our personalities to be set hard, representing the very essence of the ‘self’. It’s mostly down to the psychologist William James who, in 1887, theorised the human personality was ‘set like plaster’ by the age of 30. Like many other odd ideas that enter the public consciousness, settle there and somehow become the truth, it fast became received wisdom. And until recently, nobody bothered to check the facts.
Now it looks like the personality – in other words our thought patterns and behaviours – doesn’t persist through thick and thin. It flexes, bends, changes and morphs as we experience new things, gather fresh skills, meet different people, move to new places, face different setbacks and enjoy successes. Your personality is far more mutable than you thought. And while that might feel weird, if there’s an element of your working ‘self’ that you think could stand improvement, it’s great news.
The evidence – Studies into the way personalities change
Wendy Johnson, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, studies personality. In her experience personality is partially genetic, but it’s far from clear whether nature or nurture is the main driver. While babies are not born with a personality per se, they certainly have their own characteristic ways of behaving and reacting to the world, and that’s what people like her call our ‘temperament’. This is affected by our genes and environment pre-birth. Anxious women are, for example, more likely to give birth to stressed out children than chilled women.
Childhood experiences are also powerful stuff. Children tend to work harder and become more extroverted around a bunch of hard-working, extroverted peers, for example. Your parents play a part according to Harvard’s Jerome Kagan. His studies of reactivity reveal that when parents encourage reactive infants to be sociable and bold, they grow up less shy, less fearful of the world. Interestingly, this also helps pin down why temperament doesn’t always predict the ‘big five’ personality traits. Babies who smile a lot, for example, don’t necessarily grow up to become extroverts.
By the time you’re officially a grown-up, around 40% of the variation in the big five traits is accounted for by your genes at a general population level. But that doesn’t mean genes and the environment act independently. They never do, according to Johnson. In fact no genes have been identified as clearly linked to any of the big 5. Not one. Life – and genetics – just isn’t that simple, isn’t that determinative.
So our genes and the environment interact in ways so complex we can’t untangle them…. yet. And the process of growth and change doesn’t stop at aged 30, as long-ago William James believed. According to research from 2003, which monitored adults over long periods of time, people tend to become more agreeable as they age, as well as more conscientious and emotionally stable.
Petar Milojev and his team at New Zealand’s Massey University have also analysed the way our personalities change over time. They examined data about 4000 people aged 20 – 80, finding personality is the least stable when we’re young adults, then again at aged 60+. This makes sense as regards environment-led personality changes, since youth and age both come with dramatic life changes.
Major life events affect our personalities too, and it can happen at any age. Romantic relationships can cut neuroticism right back, while one study showed divorce tends to make women more extroverted and men less conscientious. Being made redundant affects us too. Christopher Boyce at the University of Stirling says unemployment has a dramatic negative impact, making people less agreeable and less conscientious. It also makes sense that investing a lot in your career tends to increase levels of conscientiousness.
Something as simple as moving to a new town or country might change your personality. Maybe that’s why New Yorkers are so famously neurotic and loud, and Londoners score so low on the ‘agreeableness’ scale. But what does all this mean to you, in your role, right now?
What does a morphing personality mean to your career?
If you were given a personality test when you first started work, or at any stage in your career, the results are not set in stone. As you learn, grow and experience life, you move on. The attributes you displayed back then are probably different from the attributes you have now.
Can you feel you’re different, feel you’ve changed over time? Can you pin down exactly how you’ve changed? If so, it could open up thrilling new vistas in your working world, give you access to places you never dreamed you could go, help you acquire skills you never thought you’d be able to master.
If an out-of-date self-image is hindering progress and holding you back, simply knowing you’ve changed can be all you need to move forwards. And knowing you’re capable of change can lighten your working life no end.
In part 2, we’ll look at more research into the ways our personalities change over time: through psychotherapy, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, learning a new language, and the latest remarkable research into the unexpected psychological benefits of psychedelic substances. And we’ll look more closely at the big five personality traits, which maybe aren’t the best or most helpful way to classify people after all.
If you want to explore how you might have changed over time and see what this means for your career right now, do get in touch.

From once upon a time to nowadays, people mostly believe that: “A leopard can’t change his spots”. This issue has been being debated for many years. In my opinion, I disagree absolutely with the notion that your traits maintain forever. In the following paragraphs I’m going to show my arguments to support my views.
On one hand, humankind from coming into the world to death that is always to have many diverse periods. Personality is a consistent combination which is formed and changed over time. It is influenced by many elements around you. Firstly, about your family and parent. You grow up in your family and have to be impacted by rearing, personality and behavior of your parent. When you were child, you couldn’t be conscious of something and you had to play the ape from parent. For instance, a family includes father and mother who constantly scold and have evil treatment, consequently children become rude and bad behavior. But when they come of age, they have enough about self-image, they will change themselves. It is the reason why someone’s demeanour will be distinct at age 30 as it was age 15.
In addition to this, not only this but also peers, cowokers or external agents on the whole it is circumstance of society. About peers, like I observed that: If you often have some friends who are loquacious, no long after you will become chatty than before. In particular, cowoker-pressure makes you have to alter yourself. In this society always exists many struggles. Your jobs too afftect on fashioning your character, both in dealing with coworker and in dealing with boss. Employer will reject you if your personality is not satisfiable with work. Therefore you demand to change your personality trait. This will be useful for you continue to get along with your job.
In conclusion, there is no doubt that personality transforms over time because of influencing from parent, peers, coworker and other variables. Is it advantageous that you eliminate negative personality traits than you retain them? You can learn some new tricks.

When you were child, you couldn’t be conscious of something (I do not understand. Even young babies are conscious of their surroundings.) and you had to play the ape from (wrong expression) imitate your parent. For instance, if a family includes a father and mother who constantly scold and punish the children, have evil treatment,consequently children become rude and bad ly behaved. behavior. But when they come of age, they have enough self esteem and self awareness and can about self-image, they will change themselves.

Alright, I've got some information here from different sources about whether personality changes over time. Let's see what they say.

First, there's this article from Elite Daily. It talks about how some people think you are who you are, but also acknowledges that people can grow and change. It mentions the five-factor model of personality, which includes openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The article suggests that while some core traits might remain relatively constant, other aspects can change based on experiences and learning.

Then, there's a piece from Live Science that discusses the idea of the "maturity principle." It says that personality tends to get "better" over time, with people becoming more extraverted, emotionally stable, agreeable, and conscientious as they age. The article mentions a study where high school students were surveyed about their personalities in 1960 and then again 50 years later, and there were noticeable changes in their personalities, especially in traits like calmness, self-confidence, leadership, and social sensitivity.

Next, there's an article from the Greater Good Magazine at UC Berkeley. It talks about a study where adolescents' personalities were surveyed in the 1960s and then again 50 years later. The study found that while some personality traits changed significantly, others remained relatively stable. The researchers found that traits like emotional stability, conscientiousness, and agreeableness showed notable changes over time, but not as much for extraversion and openness.

Another source is from Listening Partnership, which seems to be a website about personal development. It discusses how personalities are not set in stone and can change over time due to various influences like life experiences, learning new skills, meeting different people, and facing challenges. The article suggests that this flexibility in personality is good news for career development, as it allows individuals to adapt and grow in their professional lives.

Lastly, there's a post from Englishforums.com, which appears to be a student's IELTS essay on the topic of whether personality changes over time. The essay argues that personality does change over time due to influences from family, peers, and work environments. The student provides examples of how upbringing and social interactions can shape and alter personality traits.

From these sources, it seems that there is a general consensus that personality is not fixed and can change over time, although the extent and nature of these changes may vary. Factors like life experiences, relationships, and aging appear to play significant roles in shaping personality development.

Now, considering my own experience, I can relate to some of these ideas. For instance, I remember being more shy and introverted as a teenager, but as I entered adulthood, I became more outgoing and confident, especially in professional settings. This aligns with the maturity principle mentioned in the Live Science article.

However, I also have some traits that seem to have remained consistent over time. For example, I've always been curious and open to new experiences, which ties into the openness trait in the five-factor model. So, it seems that while some aspects of personality can evolve, others might be more enduring.

It's also interesting to note that the sources mention how early temperament can influence later personality traits. For example, a shy child might grow into a more reserved adult, but the expression of that shyness changes with age and experience.

Moreover, the idea that personality changes can be both gradual and cumulative makes sense. Small adjustments and adaptations over time can lead to significant differences in personality traits over decades.

In terms of practical implications, understanding that personality can change might be encouraging for people looking to improve certain aspects of themselves. It suggests that personal growth and development are possible, even in adulthood.

On the other hand, recognizing that some traits are more stable might help in setting realistic expectations for change. For instance, someone who is inherently more neurotic may find it challenging to completely overhaul that aspect of their personality, but they can work on managing their anxiety and stress more effectively.

Additionally, the role of environment and social context in shaping personality is noteworthy. The people we surround ourselves with, the cultures we immerse in, and the experiences we have all contribute to who we become over time.

In conclusion, based on the information gathered from various sources, it appears that personality does change over time, influenced by a multitude of factors including life experiences, relationships, and aging. While some core traits may remain relatively stable, others are more malleable and can evolve significantly over the years.

\boxed{\text{Yes, personality changes over time.}}
