I'm trying to figure out how the lack of borders impacts the future of epidemiology and public health. Hmm, borders are like boundaries between countries, right? So, if there are no borders, that means people and things can move freely from one place to another without any restrictions. How does that affect diseases and public health?

First, I need to understand what epidemiology is. Epidemiology is the study of how diseases spread and how to control them. So, if borders don't exist, diseases might spread more easily across different regions because people can travel without any barriers. That could make it harder to contain outbreaks.

Let me think about some examples. Like, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries closed their borders to try to stop the virus from entering. If there were no borders, that wouldn't have been possible, and the virus would have spread more quickly around the world.

Also, borders often have checkpoints where health screenings can be done. If someone is sick, they can be detected and treated before they enter another country. Without borders, that wouldn't happen, and sick people could travel anywhere, potentially infecting others.

On the other hand, maybe in a world without borders, there would be better global cooperation in healthcare. Countries might share information and resources more easily because there are no boundaries to limit communication and collaboration.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe borders aren't just physical barriers; they also represent political boundaries. So, even without physical borders, countries might still have their own policies and may not necessarily cooperate more.

Let me try to look this up to get a better understanding. Maybe I should search for something like "impact of open borders on disease spread" or "epidemiology in a borderless world."

Pandemics and Open Borders
6
By:
Bryan Caplan
Does the current pandemic seal the case against open borders ?  Though I foresee many readers’ incredulity, the correct answer is: no way.  Why not?  Key point: Borders are already about 98% closed to immigration.  As I’ve explained before:
Let C=total number of immigrants – legal and illegal – who annually enter the U.S. under existing laws.
Let F=the total number of immigrants who would annually enter the U.S. under open borders.
Under perfectly open borders, C=F.  Under perfectly closed borders, C=0.  Where does the status quo fall on this continuum?  The obvious metric:
Open Borders Index=C/F
With closed borders, the Open Borders Index=0.  With open borders, the Open Borders Index=1.
Regardless of your views on immigration, it’s hard to see how your estimate of the actually existing Open Borders Index could exceed .05.  After all, there are hundreds of millions of people who would love to move to the U.S. just to shine our shoes…
Which brings us to the crucial question: How much protection have 98% closed borders given us against the pandemic?  The answer: Virtually none.
To successfully prevent the spread of infection, you would have to do vastly more than permanently stop immigration.  You would also have to permanently stop both trade and tourism.  As long as foreigners can fly over for a visit, or unload their goods on our docks, foreigners can and will infect us with their diseases.  Indeed, as long as natives can fly away for a visit, or unload our goods on other country’s docks, natives can and will infect us with their diseases.  The sad fact is that even very low absolute levels of international contact have been more than sufficient to spread infection almost everywhere on Earth .  The marginal cost of higher levels of contact is therefore minimal.  Do you really think any countries in Europe would be much safer for long if they had merely “stayed out of the EU”?
In fact, if you’re focused solely on preventing the spread of infectious disease, immigrants are plainly better than tourists and sailors.  Few would-be immigrants would be deterred by a mandatory health inspection prior to entry, because they expect large long-run gains.  For tourists and sailors, in contrast, a mandatory health inspection would often be a deal-breaker.  Remember: Even a simple visa requirement reduces tourism by an estimated 70% .  Just imagine the effects of a serious medical exam for every entering or returning international traveler.
Admittedly, you could bite the bullet of full isolation, but that’s crazy.  Hoxha’s Albania and Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il’s North Korea were awful for many reasons, but autarchy was plainly high up the list.  And to repeat, to make this work you can’t simply keep foreigners out .  You must also keep natives in – or at least tell them, “Once you leave, you can never come back.”
What about temporary travel restrictions to quarantine a severe international disease?  As I’ve explained many times, I am not an absolutist .  Given strong evidence that modest restrictions on mobility have dramatic benefits, such restrictions are justifiable – intranationally as well as internationally.  But that is – and should be – a high bar indeed.  The freedom of movement that we have lost is the freedom of movement that we have denied to non-citizens for a century.

more travel can lead to more cross-immunity, which can *decrease* the probability of a global pandemic (of course, this is not very pertinent in the case of an immediate pandemic risk).

Spot on. Footnote: Mandatory health checks (for tourists and travelers) could also be anonymized. In the event of a pandemic, this would not help directly for containment purposes, but it would be helpful for general monitoring. Alternatively, you could also think about carrying out the health check via a kind of trustee – e.g. an international organization or the country of origin of the traveler – who is only obliged to provide further information in specific well-defined cases.

Given that the world’s borders are roughly 98% closed, wouldn’t it follow that the open borders world analysed in “Trillion Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk” would be hit with a roughly 98% higher infection rate during the beginning stages of COVID-19? Of course, the pandemic wouldn’t continue to spread at such a rate once mandatory health checks and social distancing measures were implemented. but the initial damage would still have been done. The natural response to this would be to argue that given the rarity of global pandemics and the fact that globalization has probably prevented a large number of potential pandemics, and given the ethical and economic benefits of open borders, the pros of open borders outweigh the cons of a COVID-like pandemic. However, the recorded benefits of globalization on public immunity are calculated in a world whose borders are 98% closed. and, given that humans are becoming steadily more resistant to our own medicine, surely the risks imposed by a pandemic in an open borders utopia would be so astronomical (both in terms of economic collapse and the loss of human lives) that it would outweigh the ethical and economic benefits of hypothetical open borders. After all, didn’t the framers of the American constitution write “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in that order for a reason? Life exists ontologically prior to liberty and so is a greater priority for the state. Perhaps the risk of the death of a large fraction of the human population is so terrible, that it warrants curtailing the liberty of free movement and association by 98%.

Your metric isn’t doing the work you want it to, though. Analogize with laws against, say, murder. With no laws preventing murder we’d see more murders, with our current laws we see some. Does it follow that our current laws, allowing as they do for some murders, are effectively useless and should be repealed?
To prevent all murders we would have to be brutally repressive, just as we would need to be to prevent all illegal immigration. It does not follow from that, though, that our current level of legal prohibition is wrong or should be removed.

The analogy holds. Effective laws against murder prevent, say, 98% of murders. And that’s good.
Murders don’t usually grow exponentially from an initial handful of cases. And allowing murders doesn’t double world GDP.

What seals the case against open borders is your admission that hundreds of millions of impoverished people would flood across America’s open borders.
Does anyone recall how long Bryan has been on record with that prediction?

Summary and Assessment
T he cold war era has passed. The fall of the Berlin Wallin 1989 marked the beginning of the disappearance of old borders and a new global era of unparalleled human movement and interaction. Although the new global arena has created economic opportunities and growth, the benefits have not been equally distributed, and the risks—especially the health risks—of this increasingly interconnected and fast-paced world continue to grow. As people, products, food, and capital travel the world in unprecedented numbers and at historic speeds, so, too, do the myriad of disease-causing microorganisms. The worldwide resurgence of dengue fever, the introduction of West Nile virus into New York City in 1999, the rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Russia, and the global spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) are but a few examples of the profound effects of globalizing forces on the emergence, distribution, and spread of infectious diseases. No nation is immune to the growing global threat that can be posed by an isolated outbreak of infectious disease in a seemingly remote part of the world. Today, whether carried by an unknowing traveler or an opportunistic vector, human pathogens can rapidly arrive anywhere in the world.
At the same time, the very interdependency and connectedness that create such opportunities for the global spread of pathogens also offer mechanisms for innovative, multinational efforts to address the threat. A growing network of such efforts, combined with the global proliferation of technology and information, continues to strengthen the global public health capacity to prevent and control the spread of emerging and reemerging

infectious diseases. One participant in the Workshop on the Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control described the situation thus: just as the globalization of infectious diseases is characterized by a transformation of separate entities into a unified epidemiological system, disease control capacity in one part of the globe can readily be deployed to fight diseases in other parts of the world.
Workshop participants discussed the impacts of increasingly integrated trade, economic development, human movement, and cultural exchange on patterns of disease emergence and reemergence; identified opportunities for countering those impacts; examined the scientific evidence supporting current and potential global strategies; and considered new response methods and tools available for use by private industry, public health agencies, regulatory agencies, policy makers, and academic researchers. Participants included experts from the international community, industry, academia, the public health community, and government; invited international participants included key representatives from the Americas, the European Union, and Russia. Detailed summaries of the workshop’s formal presentations and roundtable discussions are presented in Chapters 1 through 4 of this report.
At one point during the workshop, a call was made to heed the danger of equating globalization with Americanization, as an international point of view is crucial to a true understanding of the issues. Participants were also asked to strike a balance between what could be perceived as the negative aspects of globalization and its humanizing and empowering potential. As one participant explained, to examine the globalization of emerging infectious disease, one must address a more general tension that characterizes any globalization phenomenon: that between globalization as opportunity, the view taken by Friedman (2000) in The Lexus and the Olive Tree, and as something that is frightening and potentially dangerous, the perspective taken in the more radical social scientific literature (see Appendix A ). As another participant put it, while examining the responses needed to meet this Malthusian challenge, one concludes that the solutions may be unearthed from the problem.
THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF THE GLOBALIZATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE
Globalization is by no means a new phenomenon; transcontinental trade and the movement of people date back at least 2,000 years, to the era of the ancient Silk Road trade route. The global spread of infectious disease has followed a parallel course. Indeed, the emergence and spread of infectious disease are, in a sense, the epitome of globalization. By Roman times, world trade routes had effectively joined Europe, Asia, and North America

into one giant breeding ground for microbes. Millions of Roman citizens were killed between 165 and 180 AD when smallpox finally reached Rome during the Plague of Antoninus. Three centuries later, the bubonic plague hit Europe for the first time (542–543 AD) as the Plague of Justinian. It returned in full force as the Black Death in the fourteenth century, when a new route for overland trade with China provided rapid transit for fleainfested furs from plague-ridden Central Asia.
Even before the development of world trade routes, however, human pathogens had experienced two major bonanzas. First, when people lived as hunter-gatherers, they were constantly on the move, making it difficult for microbes to keep up with their human hosts. Once people started living as farmers, they began residing in larger numbers in the same place—and were in daily contact with their accumulating feces—for extended periods of time. Second, the advent of cities brought even larger numbers of people together under even worse sanitary conditions. In the Middle Ages, when people threw human waste out their windows in England, they were said to be “blessing the passerby.”
Now, two millennia later, human pathogens are experiencing yet another bonanza from a new era of globalization characterized by faster travel over greater distances and worldwide trade. Although some experts mark the fall of the Berlin Wall as the beginning of this new era, others argue that it is not so new. Even a hundred years ago, at the turn of the nineteenth century, the tremendous impact of increased trade and travel on infectious disease was evident in the emergence of plague epidemics in numerous port cities around the world. As Echenberg (2002) notes, plague epidemics in colonial African cities were closely tied to the increased communication, travel, and trade that accompanied the advent of the steamship. The economic and social impacts of these epidemics were profound. In Johannesburg, in what is now South Africa, the occurrence of plague led to the relocation of black residents in an effort to remove what the white colonists believed was the source of the disease. At about the same time, the influenza pandemic killed many millions of people worldwide.
Thus the current era of globalization is more properly viewed as an intensification of trends that have occurred throughout history. Never before have so many people moved so quickly throughout the world, whether by choice or force. Never before has the population density been higher, with more people living in urban areas. Never before have food, animals, commodities, and capital been transported so freely and quickly across political boundaries. And never before have pathogens had such ample opportunity to hitch global rides on airplanes, people, and products.
The future of globalization is still in the making. Despite the successful attempts of the developed world during the course of the last century to control many infectious diseases and even to eradicate some deadly afflic-

tions, 13 million people worldwide still die from such diseases every year (see Figure S-1 ).
Although the burden is greatest for the developing world, infectious diseases are a growing threat to all nations. The problem is compounded by the emergence of new diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1 that occur unexpectedly and require urgent interventions (see Figures S-2a and S-2b ).
The uncertainties of what can and will happen posed challenges to the workshop participants as they discussed the issues. At the same time, their collective wisdom presented opportunities to establish a framework for progress. The growing threat of the emergence, reemergence, and rapid global spread of infectious disease calls for a new, global paradigm of participation by the public health community. The need for collaboration has never been greater. Long-term, multinational training and partnerships among government, health care, financial, and other institutions are vital to building the global public health capacity necessary to address the threat posed worldwide by even an isolated incident of an infectious disease.

full and equal participation of partners in the developing world will be critical to this effort.
What exactly does such a collaborative, international framework entail? What opportunities does globalization afford to support the effort? How can these new global tools be used to their maximum advantage? What obstacles must be overcome? These are some of the many questions deliberated by the workshop participants, as summarized in this report.
Chapters 1 and 2 describe how globalizing forces have affected the prevention and control of infectious disease. The topics discussed range from the impact of the international flow of capital on emerging infectious diseases to the opportunities provided by the new, unprecedented influx of spending on defense against bioterrorism. Chapter 3 describes a variety of new opportunities for enhancing infectious disease control, such as global surveillance capabilities and the changing nature of transnational public health training programs. Chapter 4 summarizes some key components of the new global public health framework: the role of public–private partnerships, the role of international law, and the importance of a social science perspective for understanding and studying emerging infectious diseases. Finally, the appendices to this report consist of the workshop agenda and papers contributed by David Fidler, Jonathan Mayer, and Andrey Demin.
A WORLD IN MOTION
As the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease pandemic surely should have taught us, in the context of infectious diseases, there is nowhere in the world from which we are remote and no one from whom we are disconnected.
—IOM, 1992
Over the past two centuries, the average distance and speed of human travel have increased a thousand-fold, but incubation times for infectious diseases have remained the same. What historically may have been only a small, localized outbreak can now develop in a matter of days into a large, worldwide epidemic. Not only have the speed and distance of human travel accelerated and expanded, but unprecedented numbers of people are also on the move. Thirty years ago there were only about 200 million international tourist arrivals annually, compared with an expected 900 million or more by 2010. The global spread of HIV/AIDS is only one, albeit the most devastating, example of the impact of this tremendous human mobility on infectious disease.
Tourists are not the only people taking advantage of open borders and international travel opportunities. Each year millions of people leave their homes, either temporarily or permanently, in search of work or an im-

proved quality of life, and millions more are forcibly displaced by war. These migrant populations, especially refugees, are among the most vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases. In many developed countries, the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases, such as multidrug-resistant TB, are frequently linked to the massive influx of immigrants from poor countries with a higher prevalence of such diseases. The situation is expected to worsen in the future as the world population grows, demographic and economic gaps between the developed and developing worlds deepen, and greater numbers of people either are forcibly displaced or leave their homes by choice in search of a better life.
Although increased human mobility may be the most obvious manifestation of globalization, it is by no means the most important. As several workshop participants noted, the global spread of capitalism and the free market is the main driving force behind the current era of globalization. Much discussion at the workshop thus focused on the rapidly changing nature of the global marketplace; the ease with which food, commodities, capital, and economic and political decision-making powers are being passed around the world; and the important implications of these changes for infectious disease emergence and control.
The same advances in transportation technology that facilitate global travel by humans also allow the rapid transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors. It has been hypothesized, for example, that the vehicle for the introduction of West Nile virus into the United States in 1999, the first occurrence of this disease in the western hemisphere, was an airplane carrying an infected mosquito vector (Cetron, 2002). That mosquito vectors can hitch rides in the wheel wells of airplanes is well known. Controversial evidence also suggests that global warming, much of which is generated by human trade-related activities, may be leading to an increase in the geographic expansion and distribution of vectors.
Historically, most food has been produced and consumed locally. Over the last two decades, however, as consumer demand and expectations have increased and as food production and processing activities have become more geographically fragmented (e.g., foods produced in one locale being processed elsewhere), the epidemiology of foodborne disease has changed significantly. More recently, changes in international trade law, including the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, have altered even more dramatically the ways in which all products, food and others, are bought and sold. For example, before the establishment of WTO in 1995, trade in animals and animal products was conducted according to a policy of zero risk. Now, imported products are treated no less favorably than domestic products, at least with regard to animal health restrictions. The experience of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom and Europe illustrates the tremendous risk that accompanies the seem-

ingly unlimited growth and opportunity offered by new international trade regulations enforced by WTO.
It is cause for alarm that many countries do not have comprehensive food safety programs integrated into their public health strategies. The problem is not limited to the developing world or to food products imported from those nations. Outbreaks of foodborne illness have revealed several inadequacies in food safety regulation capabilities even in the United States. The free flow of food also raises serious concerns about the global spread of antibiotic resistance associated with the consumption of antibiotic-fed food animals.
Finally, although the use of the term “globalization” in the health sciences literature generally refers to growing global interdependency, particularly as manifested by increased international travel, the phenomenon of globalization encompasses much more. It also refers to the changing nature of the world’s global political economy, the development of a truly global marketplace, and the power relationships embedded within this new economy. In fact, given that the spread of capitalism and the free market is the main driving force behind globalization, the health sciences community might benefit from examining the ways in which this movement of capital affects emerging infectious diseases. An excellent demonstration of this point is the use of foreign capital to fund dam construction and other similar environmental modification projects, which almost always alter, either directly or indirectly, local vector ecologies and human–pathogen interactions. For example, not only is construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China altering the potential for the transmission of schistosomiasis and other diseases by disrupting local vector ecologies, but it is also increasing the risk of transmission even further by forcing people to leave their homes and live in highly concentrated areas. In light of the damaging effects of many projects on their local and regional environments and public health, workshop participants suggested that perhaps current economic models need to be reexamined, and that the potential (and costly) public health ramifications of investment decisions need some-how to be incorporated into those models.
EXAMINING THE CONSEQUENCES
As the public health ramifications of dam construction and other environmental modification projects illustrate, the growing international market and the increased mobility of the global population have already and will continue to play a central role in shaping the global infectious disease landscape, both literally and figuratively. Other global developments discussed at the workshop have important public health implications as well, including globally fueled armed conflicts and the massive displacement of

people, the inability to monitor and provide adequate health care to the continually growing numbers of mobile people displaced because of war or other reasons, the incapacity to monitor foodborne and trade-related infectious disease risks worldwide, and the growing actual and perceived threats of bioterrorism. These developments have at least one thing in common: if left unchecked, they could have profound and potentially devastating consequences for global public health.
Some argue that as the global economy improves, the living conditions of poor populations will also improve. As one participant suggested, however, this is not necessarily true. Poor countries of the world are still poor, violence is increasing, and the same diseases still exist. As information becomes easier to access in even the remotest corners of the world, everyone will know how everyone else is living and under what circumstances. Greater numbers of people will leave their homes in search of work and an improved quality of life, and greater numbers of people will be forcibly displaced. As the world population continues to grow, as urban areas in the developing world continue to expand and further strain their already resource-limited governments, and as the global marketplace continues to hone the already sharp demarcation in wealth—and health—that exists between rich and poor countries, the ensuing social unrest and loss of state control will likely fuel even more communal conflict, forced migration, and terrorism.
Unless the public health infrastructure is modified to accommodate the health care needs of mobile populations and unless the capacity to monitor mobile populations is strengthened, both pre- and postarrival, the United States and other developed countries will be unable to handle the massive influx of immigrant and refugee populations. One participant described the surveillance of mobile populations as a “new but necessary idea.” The global spread of TB, particularly multidrug-resistant TB, illustrates what can result from the failure to monitor and provide health care for mobile populations. The gap in the prevalence of TB between U.S.-born and foreign-born U.S. residents is already huge; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foreign-born residents accounted for 46 percent of new cases of TB in the United States in 2000 (CDC, 2002). Other developed countries are experiencing the same phenomenon; for example, according to a 1998 study, 92 percent of all multidrug-resistant TB cases in Canada were imported (Grondin, 2002). Not only are migrants and refugees more likely than the general population to become infected, but they also put others at risk.
Standards are therefore needed for monitoring the health of mobile populations. While such standards are necessary, however, they will not be sufficient. Unless their underlying causes are addressed, armed conflict and the threat of terrorism will continue to plague the world, drive mass migra-

Box S-1
Cyclosporiasis Outbreaks in California
In a retrospective study, Mohle-Boetani and colleagues (2000) analyzed a number of factors that contributed to the recognition of cyclosporiasis during eight months of outbreaks in California in the spring of 1997. The authors interviewed index patients with the disease and reviewed the proportion of cases detected because of enhanced laboratory surveillance. Diagnosis of cyclosporiasis requires special testing not done with standard ova and parasite methods. Six of the eight index cases were diagnosed more than two weeks after onset of symptoms. In six of the eight cases, stool testing was done after patients brought information to their physicians and requested the tests. The information came from Internet searches and from newspapers and other media coverage. In one instance, a physician was prompted by a television report to test for cyclosporiasis.
Multiple communication channels link physicians and patients and educate both. This study shows how knowledge derived from websites and the media led to the diagnosis of a disease previously unknown to many clinicians. Enhanced laboratory surveillance also contributed to detection of the parasite.

tion, and increase the risk of the emergence and spread of infectious disease. In the case of wars, almost all of which involve the use of small arms, workshop participants cited limiting the availability of such arms as an example of a tangible step that could be taken, given that the legal small arms trade is amenable to modification through U.S. policy (Leaning, 2002).
As with the monitoring of mobile populations, unless the capacity to monitor the global transport of foodborne and trade-related vectorborne infectious diseases is improved, such diseases will continue to pose serious public health risks. Although some argue that the risk of imported foodborne disease is relatively low—at least in the United States and in comparison with the risk of domestically derived foodborne disease—others argue that the surprisingly low incidence of the former reflects more a lack of surveillance than a lack of disease. The 1996–1998 outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in North America, caused by contaminated raspberries imported from Guatemala (see Box S-1 ), may not be as isolated an incident as one might think. One of the reasons this outbreak received so much attention was the scientific excitement surrounding the relatively newly discovered pathogenic culprit. Yet even if foodborne outbreaks caused by imported products are uncommon, the potential for such outbreaks is increasing. Although WTO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and a handful of other re-

gional organizations have recently attempted to improve surveillance for foodborne and trade-related infectious diseases, this is still a somewhat underappreciated need.
Finally, one of the most prominent features of the new global landscape is the increased threat of bioterrorism. As one participant put it, today we are standing at the crossroads of two historical trajectories: one stemming from a day in 1453 when Constantinople fell to the Turks after centuries of conflict between the Christian West and the Muslim East, an event that signified the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance; the other stemming from an event that occurred nearly 500 years later, when the British scientific journal Nature published an article by two young scientists, James Watson and Frances Crick, reporting the discovery of the DNA double helix. Thus, as the world enters the twenty-first century, society is simultaneously witnessing the reemergence of conflict between western and eastern cultures, the denouement of the age of physics, and the ascendance of the age of biology. The result is the convergence of global terrorism and the widespread availability of molecular biology techniques. At the heart of this collision is the use of infectious disease as a weapon.
The threat of increased bioterrorism was made real by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent mailing of letters laden with anthrax spores in October 2001. The challenges faced by international health programs have increased as a result. The current Bush Administration has responded with a 319 percent increase in spending on defense against bioterrorism—to $5.9billion for fiscal year 2003. The funds will be used to improve detection and surveillance systems, strengthen medical capabilities, improve planning and coordination, foster research, expand training exercises and communication strategies, and address policies that create bureaucratic barriers to strengthening the U.S. capacity to address bioterrorism. The promised funding will potentially provide many new opportunities to strengthen the U.S. public health capacity to address multiple emerging infectious disease threats, both domestically and worldwide. This unprecedented level of funding offers a rare chance to make a difference in the surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, although workshop participants expressed several concerns regarding the use and the sustainability of this funding.
OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES
The recent funding for biodefense initiatives is but one example of the many benefits of the globalization of efforts to combat microbial threats. Other benefits and advances include the growth and changing nature of training and research partnerships between developed and developing coun-

tries, the development of new treatments and vaccines that could potentially save millions of lives, and advances in information technology.
Despite a century of European involvement and decades of U.S. involvement in tropical medicine and infectious disease research and training programs, only recently have partnerships between developed and developing countries (also termed North–South partnerships) evolved into the type of egalitarian, bidirectional arrangement required for the global control of infectious disease. Most such programs, such as that of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded in Liverpool, England, in 1898, were originally designed to develop Northern capacity and expertise in tropical medicine. However, to develop the global public health capacity needed to respond rapidly and effectively to an unexpected pandemic, whether introduced naturally or intentionally, more resources and focus must be directed toward strengthening the public health capacity of the developing world.
Several participants cited the Peru-based Gorgas Course in Clinical Tropical Medicine, a collaborative effort between the University of Alabama and the Instituto de Medicina Tropical “Alexander von Humboldt,” as an example of the kind of program that is needed. This collaboration empowers its Southern participants in a way that lays the groundwork for building a sustainable intellectual and public health capacity in that developing nation. The Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health is undertaking similar efforts by planning and implementing a range of training programs overseas.
The need to strengthen the public health capacity in the developing world should not, however, detract from the still urgent need to incorporate public health education and training into the curricula of U.S. medical and veterinary schools. A number of recent microbial threats have been zoonotic. To address these and other future threats effectively, links need to be established between medical and veterinary schools. Human and animal health issues must be addressed in a coordinated manner if the public health workforce is to be trained to combat zoonotic diseases. Moreover, many practicing physicians in developed nations have never seen a case of measles, let alone malaria. Thus, transnational programs should continue to serve the original goal of strengthening the public health capacity in the North as well. After all, there is much to be learned in and from the developing world.
Peru has a long and rich history of experience with infectious diseases. For example, Peruvian mummies have yielded evidence that the first known TB epidemic occurred in that country nearly 2,000 years ago. Several hundred years ago, Spaniards introduced smallpox into Peru when they first landed on the shores of the Americas (Peru, in turn, sent syphilis back to sixteenth-century Europe, where Spanish troops spread the epidemic throughout the continent). In the last 25 years, one-third of all new infec-

tious diseases described in the published literature have been discovered in Latin America. And the upwelling of the cold deep water off the coast of Peru, a decidedly local phenomenon, has become a worldwide problem in the form of the El Niño 2 Southern Oscillation, which in turn has had a significant effect on the ecology and public health–related consequences of infectious diseases worldwide.
North-south training partnerships are but one example of the type of multinational collaboration that the increasing interconnectedness of the world not only allows but demands. Workshop participants also cited the vital source of expertise and knowledge of infectious diseases represented by scientists from the former Soviet Union and the potential role Russia could play in transnational public health education and training.
Russia has been participating in other international efforts to prevent and control the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. Leading the way is the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology Vector (SRC VB Vector) in Koltsovo. Despite the achievements of SCR VB Vector, however, an enormous amount of work remains to be done to strengthen Russia’s public health capacity. The country is experiencing the emergence and reemergence of multiple infectious disease agents, from hepatitis A virus to HIV and is on the verge of experiencing major epidemics. This crisis has been attributed to the tremendous economic, social, and public health fallout from the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. The pieces have yet to come back together again, and Russian leaders are urgently in need of a new public health paradigm.
As the situation in Russia demonstrates, taking full advantage of new global opportunities does not necessarily come easily. Antiretroviral agents, for example, have more than proven their public health worth in the United States and other developed countries for the treatment of HIV and other infections. However, sub-Saharan Africa—the region of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS—and other resource-constrained settings are in urgent need of a way to scale up the delivery of antiretroviral therapy. It would be neither prudent nor practical to apply the U.S. model of the introduction and dissemination of antiretroviral agents. HIV infections resistant to antiretroviral agents have already become a serious problem in the United States, in part because of premature introduction of the drugs; if

El Niño is a warming of the surface waters of the tropical Pacific that occurs every 3–5 years, temporarily affecting weather worldwide. The irregular cycling back and forth between warm and cold phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle in the equatorial Pacific results from a complex interplay between the strength of surface winds that blow westward along the equator and subsurface currents and temperatures. El Niño events are marked by higher-than-average pressure over the western Pacific and lower-than-average pressure over the eastern Pacific.

resistance to these agents emerges in Africa, it is likely that no amount of money or political will be able to stem the resulting crisis.
In addition, although vaccines have more than earned their reputation as one of the greatest public health tools in history, their utility in many developing countries is limited by weak or nonexistent public health infrastructures and a lack of resources. Despite the early successes of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization—formed in 2000 in response to the growing gap in levels of vaccine usage between developed and developing countries—numerous impediments to accelerating the global deployment of the available vaccines remain. For example, the limitations imposed by local conditions must be accounted for if new public health measures are to be implemented and new technologies transferred. Also, in the rush to achieve desirable short-term outcomes, local programs tend to be scaled up rapidly. The sudden infusion of billions of dollars into these systems, however, raises the question of how quickly this money can be spent wisely. Too often, hasty decisions have detrimental long-term consequences, and the cure ends up being worse than the problem.
Drug and vaccine delivery is only half of the problem. Equally urgent is the need to redress the imbalance between drug research and development efforts directed toward developed and developing nations. As one participant noted, although pharmaceutical companies have produced more than 2,000 new compounds over the last decade, only six of these are for the treatment of tropical diseases. As the global economy becomes even more interconnected, this will likely become an extremely difficult challenge to overcome.
Global surveillance is another example of a tool that holds tremendous promise but still faces many difficult political, scientific, and coordination challenges. Many countries fail to report local outbreaks in an effort to avoid potentially huge negative economic and political repercussions, such as trade sanctions and travel advisories. For several reasons, international reactions to public reports of infectious disease outbreaks typically far exceed what is warranted by the actual situation and public health risks. Even regional surveillance can be difficult to achieve, as the efforts in the Caribbean demonstrate (Corber, 2002).
A novel but for the most part untested idea introduced during the workshop was the establishment of a global public health bank for the storage and distribution of limited resources that might otherwise not be used to their maximum advantage. It was suggested that this program could be managed by a global health broker and would enable resources to be shared across borders (Timpieri, 2002).
Finally, most would agree that the Internet offers obvious and tremendous potential for infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and control. Never before have information and data been so easy to access and share.

The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/) and the Global Atlas of Infectious Diseases (http://www.whqathena.who.int/globalatlas/) are but two examples of how the Internet and other advances in information technology are being exploited in the fight against infectious diseases.
FRAMEWORK FOR PROGRESS
Recent large increases in spending on international health—for example, through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and President Bush’s recently proposed Millennium Challenge Account—reflect growing awareness and appreciation of the importance of global health. A number of factors account for these changing perceptions. First and foremost, support for international health efforts is no longer perceived as a costly charity endeavor; rather, it has become a cost-effective way of doing business. Even a century ago, millionaire ship owner Sir Alfred Lewis Jones founded the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, which sponsored 32 expeditions to the tropics between 1989 and 1913. Jones and other members of the Liverpool, England, business community recognized the wisdom of investing in the study of tropical diseases given that employee illnesses and deaths from malaria abroad led to reduced productivity and increased health expenditures at home.
Not only is poor public health bad for business, but it also threatens international political stability and U.S. national security. For example, at the same time that high HIV infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa limit the potential for international trade partnerships, they threaten the political and social stability of the entire region, thus posing a significant national security risk to the United States. The situation is exacerbated when armed forces are hit by high HIV infection rates, weakening military and peacekeeping capacities.
Despite increased funding and dramatic changes in the general perception of international health, several participants agreed that strengthening the global capacity to prevent and control the emergence and spread of infectious diseases will require even more money and newer approaches. Others emphasized the importance of recognizing the difference between the need for more money and the need to spend the available money more wisely. Without a strong infrastructure and knowledge base in place, large influxes of money are often wasted. It is crucial, therefore, that international systems and local agencies have the capacity to program significant amounts of money effectively. On the other hand, the tremendous amount of resources needed to address the most pressing global health problems, such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the global spread of drug-resistant malaria, cannot and should not be underestimated.

Participants identified four key components of a newer approach to infectious disease control:
A global mind-set,
Long-term collaborations, particularly public–private partnerships, among states, interstate and regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and various other nonstate actors,
Larger, more flexible financial consortiums, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and
The concept of public goods, especially with regard to product development and the dissemination of knowledge.
With regard to the need for a global mind-set, the colors of the geopolitical map in no way reflect what is going on epidemiologically. A rational approach to infectious disease control must be based on science, not political boundaries. At the same time, however, public health agencies are generally constrained by the reality that they operate according to politically defined organizational structures. India, for example, has more than 50 different zones, each with its unique epidemiological conditions, yet the country is treated by WHO as a single unit or member state (Miller, 2002).
Since 1994, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has attempted to define its mission in a more global context by taking a global approach to infectious diseases. CDC’s strategy focuses on strengthening global capacity in six priority areas: international outbreak assistance, disease surveillance, applied research on diseases of global importance, application of proven public health tools, initiatives for disease control, and public health training for capacity building. This strategy can serve as a point of reference for the development of national, regional, and global strategies for addressing the globalization of infectious diseases.
Public–private partnerships serve as a vital conduit for providing public health care supplies and services to populations, particularly in the developing world, that would otherwise not receive them. Examples include a multitude of recently developed innovative, achievement-oriented joint venture collaborations and partnerships involving the privatization of health care delivery services, with the public sector setting the rules and monitoring the quality of service. These arrangements are characterized by their mutually beneficial nature and shared decision making, among other attributes. Yet despite the clear and growing demand for the participation of multinational corporations in these partnerships and in global health efforts in general, engaging their full interest still poses a considerable challenge. This situation is very worrisome. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, for example, may not be sustainable without

the commitment of nongovernmental entities, in terms of not only financing, but also technical and intellectual support.
Beyond a newer approach to infectious disease control on the part of the public health sector, globalization demands a new legal framework. The changing nature of the sovereignty and territorial basis of governments has tremendous implications for public health legislation and the role of international law in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. International health regulations are being revised accordingly, but this may not be enough. Governance and the rule of law may have changed in such a way that even the revised regulations may not meet the legal needs of a new, internationally coordinated approach to the management of public health.
Finally, globalization demands a new social scientific framework for studying and understanding the emergence of infectious diseases. This is not a new realization. Five of the six factors related to the emergence of infectious diseases identified in a 1992 Institute of Medicine report on microbial threats (IOM, 1992) were social in nature, and the sixth, microbial adaptation and change, is partly the result of social behavior and social change. Yet the study of emerging infectious diseases is still conducted almost entirely within the realm of the biological sciences. The political ecology of disease might serve as new conceptual approach to studying and understanding the emergence of infectious diseases.

Open Borders: A Threat to Public Health
Open Borders: A Threat to Public Health
By Ronald W. Mortensen on October 28, 2014
The Obama administration's unrelenting focus on open borders has exposed Americans to deadly diseases and has politicized the public health agencies that are charged with protecting the health of Americans — the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
Rather than putting the health of Americans first, these agencies, which once took their roles to protect the public seriously, now go to great lengths to ensure that foreign nationals from countries with serious diseases are allowed to freely enter the United States. And they only act to protect the public when forced to do so by public pressure and by state officials.
The CDC, NIH, and their fellow travelers use the same arguments to justify allowing individuals from Ebola areas into the United States as other open border advocates do to justify a never ending flow of illegal immigrants:
The borders cannot be controlled so we have to let everyone in.
We can't ask foreign nationals to respect American sovereignty and American immigration laws, otherwise they will just lie to get around them.
If we don't have open borders, foreign nationals won't trust the authorities and won't cooperate with them.
If we do impose travel restrictions, people who are ill will just find ways to sneak in and if they sneak in they will go underground and infect Americans unless they are granted legal status to bring them out of the shadows.
When Ebola broke out in West Africa, the CDC and other public health agencies sent large numbers of their staff into the affected countries and CDC Director Tom Frieden traveled to the hot zone. However, after seeing the extent and devastation caused by Ebola, he took no steps to prevent it from being brought into the United States by travelers from the affected countries.
When Ebola was eventually introduced into the United States by a traveler from Liberia, Frieden told Americans that everything was fine. Interestingly, the CDC, which had staff scattered throughout West Africa, was for all intents and purposes absent from Dallas and the CDC's ineffective protocols are now thought to have contributed to the infection of healthcare workers. The CDC then reportedly told a Dallas nurse with Ebola symptoms to board an airplane and didn't stop a person who had possibly been exposed from going on a crowded cruise ship. (Mexico and Belize did see something wrong and refused the ship entry into their ports).
While Senegal, a developing country, was closing its borders with Guinea and stopping Ebola dead in its tracks, America was virtually inviting Ebola to enter through its open borders. While leaders of countries throughout Africa were requiring anyone from an Ebola area to be out of the area and symptom-free for at least 21 days before traveling to their countries, the CDC, NIH, HHS, and DHS were rolling out the red carpet for people from the hot zones and allowing them to travel freely throughout the entire United States during the full 21-day incubation period as long as the didn't have a fever at the very moment they left their home countries or at the very moment they entered the United States. Thus, the Ebola-infected individual from Liberia was able to get on a plane before his fever started and to enter the United States using his previously issued American visa in spite of the fact that he was a likely visa overstay.
While other African nations were cancelling airline service to ensure that ebola didn't spread to their countries, the CDC along with the World Health Organization (WHO), which now admits that it failed to act in a timely manner when ebola first broke out in West Africa, continues to oppose all travel bans. As a result of their policies, ebola showed up in the United States, where CDC protocols and guidelines proved to be little more than smoke and mirrors.
While Air France, British Airways, and numerous other airlines suspended service to Liberia, Atlanta-based Delta airlines, which had previously announced its discontinuance of service to Liberia, initially did an about face and continued its services because, as Delta's CEO said in August: "the great thing" about Delta having its headquarters in Atlanta is proximity to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: "We have a deep relationship with CDC. ... We're continuing to operate under their guidance and advice."
When Ebola ultimately arrived in the United States, despite CDC and NIH assurances that America was ready for the disease, it quickly became evident that America was not prepared. In spite of this, the CDC and NIH continue to demand that America's borders remain open to foreign nationals from the affected countries. This, of course, allows anyone who can get on a plane to enter the United States before symptoms begin to show, which can take up to 21 days.
When public pressure finally forced the CDC and NIH to do something to protect Americans, the agencies tried to make Americans think that they were doing something while really doing nothing — just like those in charge of securing America's borders do. So they started screening people for fevers at five airports. This smoke and mirrors strategy was so transparent that even NIH Director Anthony Fauci acknowledged that people will lie when asked if they have been exposed to Ebola in order to get into the United States and that the window for catching someone with a fever is limited to the time that they are having their temperature taken upon arrival in the United States.
In a bipartisan effort, the governors of New York, New Jersey, and Illinois called the CDC and NIH's bluff and imposed quarantines on certain people entering the United States from Ebola zones. Then the U.S. Army quarantined troops returning from the Ebola zone for 21 days while the CDC continues to allow its staff members to return from the same areas without quarantine.
At one time the role of the federal government was to protect American citizens by controlling the nation's borders and protecting its citizens from public health hazards. Now it seems that the federal government is more interested in pursuing an open-borders policy regardless of the dangers that this poses to its citizens. Is it any wonder that confidence in the federal government and national leaders is at an all-time low?

Summary and Assessment
The cold war era has passed. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the beginning of the disappearance of old borders and a new global era of unparalleled human movement and interaction. Although the new global arena has created economic opportunities and growth, the benefits have not been equally distributed, and the risks—especially the health risks—of this increasingly interconnected and fast-paced world continue to grow. As people, products, food, and capital travel the world in unprecedented numbers and at historic speeds, so, too, do the myriad of disease-causing microorganisms. The worldwide resurgence of dengue fever, the introduction of West Nile virus into New York City in 1999, the rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Russia, and the global spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) are but a few examples of the profound effects of globalizing forces on the emergence, distribution, and spread of infectious diseases. No nation is immune to the growing global threat that can be posed by an isolated outbreak of infectious disease in a seemingly remote part of the world. Today, whether carried by an unknowing traveler or an opportunistic vector, human pathogens can rapidly arrive anywhere in the world.
At the same time, the very interdependency and connectedness that create such opportunities for the global spread of pathogens also offer mechanisms for innovative, multinational efforts to address the threat. A growing network of such efforts, combined with the global proliferation of technology and information, continues to strengthen the global public health capacity to prevent and control the spread of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. One participant in the Workshop on the Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control described the situation thus: just as the globalization of infectious diseases is characterized by a transformation of separate entities into a unified epidemiological system, disease control capacity in one part of the globe can readily be deployed to fight diseases in other parts of the world.
Workshop participants discussed the impacts of increasingly integrated trade, economic development, human movement, and cultural exchange on patterns of disease emergence and reemergence; identified opportunities for countering those impacts; examined the scientific evidence supporting current and potential global strategies; and considered new response methods and tools available for use by private industry, public health agencies, regulatory agencies, policy makers, and academic researchers. Participants included experts from the international community, industry, academia, the public health community, and government; invited international participants included key representatives from the Americas, the European Union, and Russia. Detailed summaries of the workshop’s formal presentations and roundtable discussions are presented in Chapters 1 through 4 of this report.
At one point during the workshop, a call was made to heed the danger of equating globalization with Americanization, as an international point of view is crucial to a true understanding of the issues. Participants were also asked to strike a balance between what could be perceived as the negative aspects of globalization and its humanizing and empowering potential. As one participant explained, to examine the globalization of emerging infectious disease, one must address a more general tension that characterizes any globalization phenomenon: that between globalization as opportunity, the view taken by Friedman (2000) in The Lexus and the Olive Tree, and as something that is frightening and potentially dangerous, the perspective taken in the more radical social scientific literature (see Appendix A ). As another participant put it, while examining the responses needed to meet this Malthusian challenge, one concludes that the solutions may be unearthed from the problem.
Go to:
THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF THE GLOBALIZATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE
Globalization is by no means a new phenomenon; transcontinental trade and the movement of people date back at least 2,000 years, to the era of the ancient Silk Road trade route. The global spread of infectious disease has followed a parallel course. Indeed, the emergence and spread of infectious disease are, in a sense, the epitome of globalization. By Roman times, world trade routes had effectively joined Europe, Asia, and North America into one giant breeding ground for microbes. Millions of Roman citizens were killed between 165 and 180 AD when smallpox finally reached Rome during the Plague of Antoninus. Three centuries later, the bubonic plague hit Europe for the first time (542–543 AD) as the Plague of Justinian. It returned in full force as the Black Death in the fourteenth century, when a new route for overland trade with China provided rapid transit for flea-infested furs from plague-ridden Central Asia.
Even before the development of world trade routes, however, human pathogens had experienced two major bonanzas. First, when people lived as hunter-gatherers, they were constantly on the move, making it difficult for microbes to keep up with their human hosts. Once people started living as farmers, they began residing in larger numbers in the same place—and were in daily contact with their accumulating feces—for extended periods of time. Second, the advent of cities brought even larger numbers of people together under even worse sanitary conditions. In the Middle Ages, when people threw human waste out their windows in England, they were said to be “blessing the passerby.”
Now, two millennia later, human pathogens are experiencing yet another bonanza from a new era of globalization characterized by faster travel over greater distances and worldwide trade. Although some experts mark the fall of the Berlin Wall as the beginning of this new era, others argue that it is not so new. Even a hundred years ago, at the turn of the nineteenth century, the tremendous impact of increased trade and travel on infectious disease was evident in the emergence of plague epidemics in numerous port cities around the world. As Echenberg (2002) notes, plague epidemics in colonial African cities were closely tied to the increased communication, travel, and trade that accompanied the advent of the steamship. The economic and social impacts of these epidemics were profound. In Johannesburg, in what is now South Africa, the occurrence of plague led to the relocation of black residents in an effort to remove what the white colonists believed was the source of the disease. At about the same time, the influenza pandemic killed many millions of people worldwide.
Thus the current era of globalization is more properly viewed as an intensification of trends that have occurred throughout history. Never before have so many people moved so quickly throughout the world, whether by choice or force. Never before has the population density been higher, with more people living in urban areas. Never before have food, animals, commodities, and capital been transported so freely and quickly across political boundaries. And never before have pathogens had such ample opportunity to hitch global rides on airplanes, people, and products.
The future of globalization is still in the making. Despite the successful attempts of the developed world during the course of the last century to control many infectious diseases and even to eradicate some deadly afflictions, 13 million people worldwide still die from such diseases every year (see Figure S-1 ).
FIGURE S-1

Although the burden is greatest for the developing world, infectious diseases are a growing threat to all nations. The problem is compounded by the emergence of new diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1 that occur unexpectedly and require urgent interventions (see Figures S-2a and S-2b ).

The uncertainties of what can and will happen posed challenges to the workshop participants as they discussed the issues. At the same time, their collective wisdom presented opportunities to establish a framework for progress. The growing threat of the emergence, reemergence, and rapid global spread of infectious disease calls for a new, global paradigm of participation by the public health community. The need for collaboration has never been greater. Long-term, multinational training and partnerships among government, health care, financial, and other institutions are vital to building the global public health capacity necessary to address the threat posed worldwide by even an isolated incident of an infectious disease. The full and equal participation of partners in the developing world will be critical to this effort.
What exactly does such a collaborative, international framework entail? What opportunities does globalization afford to support the effort? How can these new global tools be used to their maximum advantage? What obstacles must be overcome? These are some of the many questions deliberated by the workshop participants, as summarized in this report.
Chapters 1 and 2 describe how globalizing forces have affected the prevention and control of infectious disease. The topics discussed range from the impact of the international flow of capital on emerging infectious diseases to the opportunities provided by the new, unprecedented influx of spending on defense against bioterrorism. Chapter 3 describes a variety of new opportunities for enhancing infectious disease control, such as global surveillance capabilities and the changing nature of transnational public health training programs. Chapter 4 summarizes some key components of the new global public health framework: the role of public–private partnerships, the role of international law, and the importance of a social science perspective for understanding and studying emerging infectious diseases. Finally, the appendices to this report consist of the workshop agenda and papers contributed by David Fidler, Jonathan Mayer, and Andrey Demin.

A WORLD IN MOTION
As the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease pandemic surely should have taught us, in the context of infectious diseases, there is nowhere in the world from which we are remote and no one from whom we are disconnected.
— IOM, 1992
Over the past two centuries, the average distance and speed of human travel have increased a thousand-fold, but incubation times for infectious diseases have remained the same. What historically may have been only a small, localized outbreak can now develop in a matter of days into a large, worldwide epidemic. Not only have the speed and distance of human travel accelerated and expanded, but unprecedented numbers of people are also on the move. Thirty years ago there were only about 200 million international tourist arrivals annually, compared with an expected 900 million or more by 2010. The global spread of HIV/AIDS is only one, albeit the most devastating, example of the impact of this tremendous human mobility on infectious disease.
Tourists are not the only people taking advantage of open borders and international travel opportunities. Each year millions of people leave their homes, either temporarily or permanently, in search of work or an improved quality of life, and millions more are forcibly displaced by war. These migrant populations, especially refugees, are among the most vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases. In many developed countries, the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases, such as multidrug-resistant TB, are frequently linked to the massive influx of immigrants from poor countries with a higher prevalence of such diseases. The situation is expected to worsen in the future as the world population grows, demographic and economic gaps between the developed and developing worlds deepen, and greater numbers of people either are forcibly displaced or leave their homes by choice in search of a better life.
Although increased human mobility may be the most obvious manifestation of globalization, it is by no means the most important. As several workshop participants noted, the global spread of capitalism and the free market is the main driving force behind the current era of globalization. Much discussion at the workshop thus focused on the rapidly changing nature of the global marketplace; the ease with which food, commodities, capital, and economic and political decision-making powers are being passed around the world; and the important implications of these changes for infectious disease emergence and control.
The same advances in transportation technology that facilitate global travel by humans also allow the rapid transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors. It has been hypothesized, for example, that the vehicle for the introduction of West Nile virus into the United States in 1999, the first occurrence of this disease in the western hemisphere, was an airplane carrying an infected mosquito vector (Cetron, 2002 ). That mosquito vectors can hitch rides in the wheel wells of airplanes is well known. Controversial evidence also suggests that global warming, much of which is generated by human trade-related activities, may be leading to an increase in the geographic expansion and distribution of vectors.
Historically, most food has been produced and consumed locally. Over the last two decades, however, as consumer demand and expectations have increased and as food production and processing activities have become more geographically fragmented (e.g., foods produced in one locale being processed elsewhere), the epidemiology of foodborne disease has changed significantly. More recently, changes in international trade law, including the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, have altered even more dramatically the ways in which all products, food and others, are bought and sold. For example, before the establishment of WTO in 1995, trade in animals and animal products was conducted according to a policy of zero risk. Now, imported products are treated no less favorably than domestic products, at least with regard to animal health restrictions. The experience of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom and Europe illustrates the tremendous risk that accompanies the seemingly unlimited growth and opportunity offered by new international trade regulations enforced by WTO.
It is cause for alarm that many countries do not have comprehensive food safety programs integrated into their public health strategies. The problem is not limited to the developing world or to food products imported from those nations. Outbreaks of foodborne illness have revealed several inadequacies in food safety regulation capabilities even in the United States. The free flow of food also raises serious concerns about the global spread of antibiotic resistance associated with the consumption of antibiotic-fed food animals.
Finally, although the use of the term “globalization” in the health sciences literature generally refers to growing global interdependency, particularly as manifested by increased international travel, the phenomenon of globalization encompasses much more. It also refers to the changing nature of the world’s global political economy, the development of a truly global marketplace, and the power relationships embedded within this new economy. In fact, given that the spread of capitalism and the free market is the main driving force behind globalization, the health sciences community might benefit from examining the ways in which this movement of capital affects emerging infectious diseases. An excellent demonstration of this point is the use of foreign capital to fund dam construction and other similar environmental modification projects, which almost always alter, either directly or indirectly, local vector ecologies and human–pathogen interactions. For example, not only is construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China altering the potential for the transmission of schistosomiasis and other diseases by disrupting local vector ecologies, but it is also increasing the risk of transmission even further by forcing people to leave their homes and live in highly concentrated areas. In light of the damaging effects of many projects on their local and regional environments and public health, workshop participants suggested that perhaps current economic models need to be reexamined, and that the potential (and costly) public health ramifications of investment decisions need somehow to be incorporated into those models.
Go to:
EXAMINING THE CONSEQUENCES
As the public health ramifications of dam construction and other environmental modification projects illustrate, the growing international market and the increased mobility of the global population have already and will continue to play a central role in shaping the global infectious disease landscape, both literally and figuratively. Other global developments discussed at the workshop have important public health implications as well, including globally fueled armed conflicts and the massive displacement of people, the inability to monitor and provide adequate health care to the continually growing numbers of mobile people displaced because of war or other reasons, the incapacity to monitor foodborne and trade-related infectious disease risks worldwide, and the growing actual and perceived threats of bioterrorism. These developments have at least one thing in common: if left unchecked, they could have profound and potentially devastating consequences for global public health.
Some argue that as the global economy improves, the living conditions of poor populations will also improve. As one participant suggested, however, this is not necessarily true. Poor countries of the world are still poor, violence is increasing, and the same diseases still exist. As information becomes easier to access in even the remotest corners of the world, everyone will know how everyone else is living and under what circumstances. Greater numbers of people will leave their homes in search of work and an improved quality of life, and greater numbers of people will be forcibly displaced. As the world population continues to grow, as urban areas in the developing world continue to expand and further strain their already resource-limited governments, and as the global marketplace continues to hone the already sharp demarcation in wealth—and health—that exists between rich and poor countries, the ensuing social unrest and loss of state control will likely fuel even more communal conflict, forced migration, and terrorism.
Unless the public health infrastructure is modified to accommodate the health care needs of mobile populations and unless the capacity to monitor mobile populations is strengthened, both pre- and postarrival, the United States and other developed countries will be unable to handle the massive influx of immigrant and refugee populations. One participant described the surveillance of mobile populations as a “new but necessary idea.” The global spread of TB, particularly multidrug-resistant TB, illustrates what can result from the failure to monitor and provide health care for mobile populations. The gap in the prevalence of TB between U.S.-born and foreign-born U.S. residents is already huge; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foreign-born residents accounted for 46 percent of new cases of TB in the United States in 2000 (CDC, 2002 ). Other developed countries are experiencing the same phenomenon; for example, according to a 1998 study, 92 percent of all multidrug-resistant TB cases in Canada were imported (Grondin, 2002 ). Not only are migrants and refugees more likely than the general population to become infected, but they also put others at risk.
Standards are therefore needed for monitoring the health of mobile populations. While such standards are necessary, however, they will not be sufficient. Unless their underlying causes are addressed, armed conflict and the threat of terrorism will continue to plague the world, drive mass migration, and increase the risk of the emergence and spread of infectious disease. In the case of wars, almost all of which involve the use of small arms, workshop participants cited limiting the availability of such arms as an example of a tangible step that could be taken, given that the legal small arms trade is amenable to modification through U.S. policy (Leaning, 2002 ).
As with the monitoring of mobile populations, unless the capacity to monitor the global transport of foodborne and trade-related vectorborne infectious diseases is improved, such diseases will continue to pose serious public health risks. Although some argue that the risk of imported foodborne disease is relatively low—at least in the United States and in comparison with the risk of domestically derived foodborne disease—others argue that the surprisingly low incidence of the former reflects more a lack of surveillance than a lack of disease. The 1996–1998 outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in North America, caused by contaminated raspberries imported from Guatemala (see Box S-1 ), may not be as isolated an incident as one might think. One of the reasons this outbreak received so much attention was the scientific excitement surrounding the relatively newly discovered pathogenic culprit. Yet even if foodborne outbreaks caused by imported products are uncommon, the potential for such outbreaks is increasing. Although WTO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and a handful of other regional organizations have recently attempted to improve surveillance for foodborne and trade-related infectious diseases, this is still a somewhat underappreciated need.
Box S-1
Cyclosporiasis Outbreaks in California. In a retrospective study, Mohle-Boetani and colleagues (2000) analyzed a number of factors that contributed to the recognition of cyclosporiasis during eight months of outbreaks in California in the spring of 1997. (more...)
Finally, one of the most prominent features of the new global landscape is the increased threat of bioterrorism. As one participant put it, today we are standing at the crossroads of two historical trajectories: one stemming from a day in 1453 when Constantinople fell to the Turks after centuries of conflict between the Christian West and the Muslim East, an event that signified the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance; the other stemming from an event that occurred nearly 500 years later, when the British scientific journal Nature published an article by two young scientists, James Watson and Frances Crick, reporting the discovery of the DNA double helix. Thus, as the world enters the twenty-first century, society is simultaneously witnessing the reemergence of conflict between western and eastern cultures, the denouement of the age of physics, and the ascendance of the age of biology. The result is the convergence of global terrorism and the widespread availability of molecular biology techniques. At the heart of this collision is the use of infectious disease as a weapon.
The threat of increased bioterrorism was made real by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent mailing of letters laden with anthrax spores in October 2001. The challenges faced by international health programs have increased as a result. The current Bush Administration has responded with a 319 percent increase in spending on defense against bioterrorism—to $5.9 billion for fiscal year 2003. The funds will be used to improve detection and surveillance systems, strengthen medical capabilities, improve planning and coordination, foster research, expand training exercises and communication strategies, and address policies that create bureaucratic barriers to strengthening the U.S. capacity to address bioterrorism. The promised funding will potentially provide many new opportunities to strengthen the U.S. public health capacity to address multiple emerging infectious disease threats, both domestically and worldwide. This unprecedented level of funding offers a rare chance to make a difference in the surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, although workshop participants expressed several concerns regarding the use and the sustainability of this funding.

OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES
The recent funding for biodefense initiatives is but one example of the many benefits of the globalization of efforts to combat microbial threats. Other benefits and advances include the growth and changing nature of training and research partnerships between developed and developing countries, the development of new treatments and vaccines that could potentially save millions of lives, and advances in information technology.
Despite a century of European involvement and decades of U.S. involvement in tropical medicine and infectious disease research and training programs, only recently have partnerships between developed and developing countries (also termed North–South partnerships) evolved into the type of egalitarian, bidirectional arrangement required for the global control of infectious disease. Most such programs, such as that of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded in Liverpool, England, in 1898, were originally designed to develop Northern capacity and expertise in tropical medicine. However, to develop the global public health capacity needed to respond rapidly and effectively to an unexpected pandemic, whether introduced naturally or intentionally, more resources and focus must be directed toward strengthening the public health capacity of the developing world.
Several participants cited the Peru-based Gorgas Course in Clinical Tropical Medicine, a collaborative effort between the University of Alabama and the Instituto de Medicina Tropical “Alexander von Humboldt,” as an example of the kind of program that is needed. This collaboration empowers its Southern participants in a way that lays the groundwork for building a sustainable intellectual and public health capacity in that developing nation. The Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health is undertaking similar efforts by planning and implementing a range of training programs overseas.
The need to strengthen the public health capacity in the developing world should not, however, detract from the still urgent need to incorporate public health education and training into the curricula of U.S. medical and veterinary schools. A number of recent microbial threats have been zoonotic. To address these and other future threats effectively, links need to be established between medical and veterinary schools. Human and animal health issues must be addressed in a coordinated manner if the public health workforce is to be trained to combat zoonotic diseases. Moreover, many practicing physicians in developed nations have never seen a case of measles, let alone malaria. Thus, transnational programs should continue to serve the original goal of strengthening the public health capacity in the North as well. After all, there is much to be learned in and from the developing world.
Peru has a long and rich history of experience with infectious diseases. For example, Peruvian mummies have yielded evidence that the first known TB epidemic occurred in that country nearly 2,000 years ago. Several hundred years ago, Spaniards introduced smallpox into Peru when they first landed on the shores of the Americas (Peru, in turn, sent syphilis back to sixteenth-century Europe, where Spanish troops spread the epidemic throughout the continent). In the last 25 years, one-third of all new infectious diseases described in the published literature have been discovered in Latin America. And the upwelling of the cold deep water off the coast of Peru, a decidedly local phenomenon, has become a worldwide problem in the form of the El Niño 2 Southern Oscillation, which in turn has had a significant effect on the ecology and public health–related consequences of infectious diseases worldwide.
North-south training partnerships are but one example of the type of multinational collaboration that the increasing interconnectedness of the world not only allows but demands. Workshop participants also cited the vital source of expertise and knowledge of infectious diseases represented by scientists from the former Soviet Union and the potential role Russia could play in transnational public health education and training.
Russia has been participating in other international efforts to prevent and control the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. Leading the way is the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology Vector (SRC VB Vector) in Koltsovo. Despite the achievements of SCR VB Vector, however, an enormous amount of work remains to be done to strengthen Russia’s public health capacity. The country is experiencing the emergence and reemergence of multiple infectious disease agents, from hepatitis A virus to HIV and is on the verge of experiencing major epidemics. This crisis has been attributed to the tremendous economic, social, and public health fallout from the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. The pieces have yet to come back together again, and Russian leaders are urgently in need of a new public health paradigm.
As the situation in Russia demonstrates, taking full advantage of new global opportunities does not necessarily come easily. Antiretroviral agents, for example, have more than proven their public health worth in the United States and other developed countries for the treatment of HIV and other infections. However, sub-Saharan Africa—the region of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS—and other resource-constrained settings are in urgent need of a way to scale up the delivery of antiretroviral therapy. It would be neither prudent nor practical to apply the U.S. model of the introduction and dissemination of antiretroviral agents. HIV infections resistant to antiretroviral agents have already become a serious problem in the United States, in part because of premature introduction of the drugs; if resistance to these agents emerges in Africa, it is likely that no amount of money or political will be able to stem the resulting crisis.
In addition, although vaccines have more than earned their reputation as one of the greatest public health tools in history, their utility in many developing countries is limited by weak or nonexistent public health infrastructures and a lack of resources. Despite the early successes of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization—formed in 2000 in response to the growing gap in levels of vaccine usage between developed and developing countries—numerous impediments to accelerating the global deployment of the available vaccines remain. For example, the limitations imposed by local conditions must be accounted for if new public health measures are to be implemented and new technologies transferred. Also, in the rush to achieve desirable short-term outcomes, local programs tend to be scaled up rapidly. The sudden infusion of billions of dollars into these systems, however, raises the question of how quickly this money can be spent wisely. Too often, hasty decisions have detrimental long-term consequences, and the cure ends up being worse than the problem.
Drug and vaccine delivery is only half of the problem. Equally urgent is the need to redress the imbalance between drug research and development efforts directed toward developed and developing nations. As one participant noted, although pharmaceutical companies have produced more than 2,000 new compounds over the last decade, only six of these are for the treatment of tropical diseases. As the global economy becomes even more interconnected, this will likely become an extremely difficult challenge to overcome.
Global surveillance is another example of a tool that holds tremendous promise but still faces many difficult political, scientific, and coordination challenges. Many countries fail to report local outbreaks in an effort to avoid potentially huge negative economic and political repercussions, such as trade sanctions and travel advisories. For several reasons, international reactions to public reports of infectious disease outbreaks typically far exceed what is warranted by the actual situation and public health risks. Even regional surveillance can be difficult to achieve, as the efforts in the Caribbean demonstrate (Corber, 2002 ).
A novel but for the most part untested idea introduced during the workshop was the establishment of a global public health bank for the storage and distribution of limited resources that might otherwise not be used to their maximum advantage. It was suggested that this program could be managed by a global health broker and would enable resources to be shared across borders (Timpieri, 2002 ).
Finally, most would agree that the Internet offers obvious and tremendous potential for infectious disease surveillance, prevention, and control. Never before have information and data been so easy to access and share. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/en/) and the Global Atlas of Infectious Diseases (http://www.whqathena.who.int/globalatlas/) are but two examples of how the Internet and other advances in information technology are being exploited in the fight against infectious diseases.

FRAMEWORK FOR PROGRESS
Recent large increases in spending on international health—for example, through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and President Bush’s recently proposed Millennium Challenge Account—reflect growing awareness and appreciation of the importance of global health. A number of factors account for these changing perceptions. First and foremost, support for international health efforts is no longer perceived as a costly charity endeavor; rather, it has become a cost-effective way of doing business. Even a century ago, millionaire ship owner Sir Alfred Lewis Jones founded the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, which sponsored 32 expeditions to the tropics between 1989 and 1913. Jones and other members of the Liverpool, England, business community recognized the wisdom of investing in the study of tropical diseases given that employee illnesses and deaths from malaria abroad led to reduced productivity and increased health expenditures at home.
Not only is poor public health bad for business, but it also threatens international political stability and U.S. national security. For example, at the same time that high HIV infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa limit the potential for international trade partnerships, they threaten the political and social stability of the entire region, thus posing a significant national security risk to the United States. The situation is exacerbated when armed forces are hit by high HIV infection rates, weakening military and peace-keeping capacities.
Despite increased funding and dramatic changes in the general perception of international health, several participants agreed that strengthening the global capacity to prevent and control the emergence and spread of infectious diseases will require even more money and newer approaches. Others emphasized the importance of recognizing the difference between the need for more money and the need to spend the available money more wisely. Without a strong infrastructure and knowledge base in place, large influxes of money are often wasted. It is crucial, therefore, that international systems and local agencies have the capacity to program significant amounts of money effectively. On the other hand, the tremendous amount of resources needed to address the most pressing global health problems, such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the global spread of drug-resistant malaria, cannot and should not be underestimated.
Participants identified four key components of a newer approach to infectious disease control:
A global mind-set,
Long-term collaborations, particularly public–private partnerships, among states, interstate and regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and various other nonstate actors,
Larger, more flexible financial consortiums, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and
The concept of public goods, especially with regard to product development and the dissemination of knowledge.
With regard to the need for a global mind-set, the colors of the geopolitical map in no way reflect what is going on epidemiologically. A rational approach to infectious disease control must be based on science, not political boundaries. At the same time, however, public health agencies are generally constrained by the reality that they operate according to politically defined organizational structures. India, for example, has more than 50 different zones, each with its unique epidemiological conditions, yet the country is treated by WHO as a single unit or member state (Miller, 2002 ).
Since 1994, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has attempted to define its mission in a more global context by taking a global approach to infectious diseases. CDC’s strategy focuses on strengthening global capacity in six priority areas: international outbreak assistance, disease surveillance, applied research on diseases of global importance, application of proven public health tools, initiatives for disease control, and public health training for capacity building. This strategy can serve as a point of reference for the development of national, regional, and global strategies for addressing the globalization of infectious diseases.
Public–private partnerships serve as a vital conduit for providing public health care supplies and services to populations, particularly in the developing world, that would otherwise not receive them. Examples include a multitude of recently developed innovative, achievement-oriented joint venture collaborations and partnerships involving the privatization of health care delivery services, with the public sector setting the rules and monitoring the quality of service. These arrangements are characterized by their mutually beneficial nature and shared decision making, among other attributes. Yet despite the clear and growing demand for the participation of multinational corporations in these partnerships and in global health efforts in general, engaging their full interest still poses a considerable challenge. This situation is very worrisome. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, for example, may not be sustainable without the commitment of nongovernmental entities, in terms of not only financing, but also technical and intellectual support.
Beyond a newer approach to infectious disease control on the part of the public health sector, globalization demands a new legal framework. The changing nature of the sovereignty and territorial basis of governments has tremendous implications for public health legislation and the role of international law in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. International health regulations are being revised accordingly, but this may not be enough. Governance and the rule of law may have changed in such a way that even the revised regulations may not meet the legal needs of a new, internationally coordinated approach to the management of public health.
Finally, globalization demands a new social scientific framework for studying and understanding the emergence of infectious diseases. This is not a new realization. Five of the six factors related to the emergence of infectious diseases identified in a 1992 Institute of Medicine report on microbial threats (IOM, 1992) were social in nature, and the sixth, microbial adaptation and change, is partly the result of social behavior and social change. Yet the study of emerging infectious diseases is still conducted almost entirely within the realm of the biological sciences. The political ecology of disease might serve as new conceptual approach to studying and understanding the emergence of infectious diseases.

El Niño is a warming of the surface waters of the tropical Pacific that occurs every 3–5 years, temporarily affecting weather worldwide. The irregular cycling back and forth between warm and cold phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation cycle in the equatorial Pacific results from a complex interplay between the strength of surface winds that blow westward along the equator and subsurface currents and temperatures. El Niño events are marked by higher-than-average pressure over the western Pacific and lower-than-average pressure over the eastern Pacific.

Globalization is characterized by liberalization of international trade, increased travel between countries and migration, and more exposure to the dominant Western media. Knowledge and technology are now shared at great speeds among people of different nationalities because of the wider availability of Internet connection. Governments around the world have more opportunities to work together in the globalized world. Despite the enormous positive benefits of globalization however, it also has negative consequences. Before the world became globalized, infection more or less remained on each country’s borders. With the ease of international travel today however, people all over the world are in greater risk of infection by diseases coming from different countries. While the risk of infection may be higher in a globalized world, there are also more means to control the spread of such diseases through the coordination of new international public health partners.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that health itself became globalized along with the world. Globalization has various effects on the health of populations, especially in developing countries which have fewer resources to deal with the phenomenon. With planes travelling nonstop across the globe, infectious diseases can now spread from one country to another in a matter of days or hours. People’s lifestyles are also changing, including patterns of food consumption, alcohol and tobacco use, and physical activity. Many of these changes are negative in nature, for instance, the diminishing physical activity of people. The WHO thinks that such transformations are more harmful to developing countries which have to deal with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease (O’Laughlin et al., 2004, p.12).
Economic processes, political events, technological developments, cultural systems, and environmental factors are all forces that drive globalization. These forces may determine whether a certain pathogen can survive and spread in a given territory, infect populations, and cause the outbreak of disease. There are also many ways by which globalization may affect the treatment and control of diseases. For example, migration of workers can affect the rate of household incomes and the availability of health professionals. Health standards across the globe are also changing because of international agreements about healthcare systems. Thus, globalization may increase or decrease infections depending on where a certain population lives. Many experts agree however, that globalization is generally harmful in terms of healthcare in developing countries (Kawachi & Wamala, 2007, p.20).
Poor nations are less equipped to deal with the increased risk of infection because of their developing institutions. The WHO says that undernutrition is the leading cause of disease and death among children in developing countries. Undernutrition is basically a result of poverty and the consequent malnutrition in these nations (O’Laughlin et al., 2004, p.13). Globalization also poses a challenge for developed countries. Many experts in the United States have proposed that the country should include health in its foreign policy agenda. Accordingly, the US should do its part in developing a global health law that would protect its citizens from the increasing risk of infectious diseases on a global scale. Some have argued that issues such as infectious diseases and bioterrorism should be paid more attention since they concern national security. Government policies should also consider the security of national borders and the increasing mobility of people and pathogens (Institute of Medicine, 2003, p.40).
The current global spread of the A(H1N1) virus, commonly known as “swine flu” and the recent outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in East Asia demonstrate the new and greater challenge that the globalized world faces. The world today is just beginning to realize how big the threat of infectious diseases really is. People in developed countries used to think that infectious diseases have been conquered because of the wide availability of vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. Current issues in international health are now forcing people to view the situation more seriously however, as governments move toward international cooperation to better control the spread of infectious diseases (Fidler, 1999, p.6).
The realities of globalization all point to the greater risk of diseases spreading across bigger populations. For example, agrarian societies located near domesticated animals are more susceptible to zoonotic infections, such as cowpax, swine flu, and SARS. Urbanized communities where large numbers of people live in close proximity to each other are also vulnerable to infections transmitted through human contact, like influenza and plague. The constant travelling of people, from rural to urban and urban to rural communities, increase the likelihood of these diseases from spreading in wider territories (Merson, et al., 2006, p.687).
The threat of infectious diseases in a globalized world can be better understood if we review the association of meningococcal disease with the Haj, the traditional pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Because of easier ways to travel and increasing incomes, more and more people attend the Haj with a 100% increase in numbers each decade since 1949. In 2001, almost 2 million people went to the Haj, 75% of them coming from other countries. The setting of the Haj is perfect for the transmission of infectious diseases since large numbers of people interact with one another during pilgrimage. Medical experts have long discovered that the Haj actually regularly results in epidemics of meningococcal disease. The pilgrimage is linked to cases of meningococcal disease in many countries around the world. Secondary epidemics also usually occur two years after in countries where the participants return to (Merson, et al., 2006, p.687).
The fact that epidemics of meningococcal disease are linked with the Haj is a testimony to the seriousness of the challenge the world currently faces in terms of international health. Fortunately, while meningococcal disease is deadly when left untreated, there are vaccines that can prevent the transmission of this illness. The bigger problem is when the world encounters an infectious disease that has unknown prevention and cure. The SARS outbreak in East Asia in 2003 demonstrates the difficulty of controlling the spread of infectious diseases from one country. Currently, the apparent spread of A(H1N1) from Mexico to countries even in Southeast Asia also show how dangerous the situation is.
The A(H1N1) virus is a new form of the swine flu virus that has existed a long time ago. The world was unprepared for a deadlier version of the virus though, and many people in different countries panicked when the virus spread to their shores. Mexico, the apparent origin of the virus, was unprepared for the outbreak of the disease which took away several lives. However, it seems as if wealthier countries like the United States are as unprepared as Mexico in dealing with the transmission of the infection. Weeks after cases were reported in Mexico, A(H1N1) has reached countries such as Canada, China, Hong Kong, and many more. Although airports implemented policies aimed at containing the virus, the transmission of the virus from one country to another wasn’t stopped. There is currently no vaccine against the virus and the world seemed to be relieved to find out that the virus isn’t as deadly as initially feared. What happens however, if the virus suddenly evolves into a deadlier form? How will governments worldwide react to the absolute danger it poses to their populations? It is safe to say that people were just lucky this time that the virus turned out to be mild. Had it been more deadly, it would have caused more destruction, especially in developing countries where governments have fewer resources to control the spread of infectious diseases.
Globalization may affect the spread of infectious diseases not only through the increased mobility of people, but also through the increased trade worldwide. The WHO seeks to decrease trade barriers between nations. Trade agreements led by the WHO have resulted in increases in gross world population and trade. Populations of people living in market economies also increased because of the promotion of free trade. The wealth created in this type of trade determines the amount of resources a government may use to provide for the health care of its people.  For example, the Asian financial crisis had some negative effects on the health of people since governments had less money to spend for the control of infectious diseases. This resulted in greater rates of infections like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases or STDs (Kawachi & Wamala, 2007, p.21).
Some experts point out that the widening economic inequality within and between countries is a major factor in the vulnerability of poorer populations to infectious diseases. This is evident in the spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and HIV in populations with poor healthcare. Outbreaks of MDR TB have been reported in institutions like prisons, homeless shelters, and medical facilities in cities like San Francisco, Boston, and Washington DC. Breakdown of social order and political fragmentation are also associated with the rate of infectious diseases as evidenced by Russia and Eastern Europe in the 1990s when social cohesion was in deep trouble because of the uncertainty in Russian states. All of these clearly point out that developing countries which exhibit all these characteristics of relatively weak institutions are in more danger of succumbing to infectious diseases (Orme et al., 2007, p.19).
Bridging of the different countries of the world has always been associated with the spread of communicable diseases. When trade routes by land and sea were opened in the 1st Century to link the Mediterranean, China, and India, infectious diseases spread in many countries in the world. In the 13th century, massive outbreaks of infectious diseases occurred during the Mongol expansion to Europe (Jacobsen, 2007, p.170). The great plague in A.D. 165 is associated with the growing commerce between the Mediterranean and Asia at that time. The plague killed a quarter of the population of the Roman Empire. The “black death,” the epidemic which took away a third of the European population, was also transmitted to China as the Mongol empire expanded in central Asia. The disease later reached the Mediterranean and the Crimea as caravans went from one border to another due to trade (French, 2000, p.41).
Today, trade routes are not only restricted to two or three regions in the world, in fact, they encompass the entire globe. Planes, ships, and automobiles are much faster than the caravans and sailing ships of olden days. In a matter of hours, living and nonliving things that may carry infectious diseases are transported from one country to another (Apostolopoulos & Sonmez, 2007, p.8). These developments in trade and geographical mobility of people are definitely changing the way infections spread to different populations. In the case of SARS, international air travel was one of the biggest factors in its spread. Unlike in the old days where a ship identified as carrying infection can be easily quarantined in a port, today, the round the clock operation of airports make it almost impossible to stop an infection from spreading fast. In fact, it took smallpox centuries before it was able to cross the Atlantic. SARS however, spread to 30 different countries in five continents in just a few weeks (Bennett & Tomossy, 2006, p.3).
The SARS epidemic and the current A(H1N1) spread across the globe both demonstrate the need for healthcare systems in the world to improve their ability to respond immediately. Epidemics take greater tool on the healthcare systems of developing countries which can’t deploy enough resources to control the spread of the disease. In both of these cases, poor policies in hospitals and medical centers have also led to the disease infecting medical workers themselves. In the case of SARS in Beijing, 123 fever clinics were immediately set up, 79 new radiograph machines, 76 new ambulances, and 759 new mechanical ventilators were obtained to respond to the outbreak. Canada took notice of this surge capacity and observed that all nations should develop the capacity to boost their healthcare systems when epidemics strike. The spread of A(H1N1) at various points in the globe underscored this need once again, which developing countries may find difficult to meet because of economic constraints (Bennett & Tomossy, 2006, p.4).
One of the most important aspects of infectious disease control in a globalized world is the availability of epidemiologic and clinical data. Today, the furthest nations have come to international cooperation regarding infectious disease control is the International Health Regulations (IHR) which was adopted by the WHO in 1951 and revised in 1973. While the regulations were admirable because of its coordination of efforts by member countries, it only covers cholera, plague and yellow fever. The IHR needs to improve on specific policies on how countries may notify the world about outbreaks, incentives for compliance with such policies, and mechanisms for collaboration regarding control of infectious diseases (Merson, et al., 2006, p.689).
The Mexican government was recently heavily criticized because of its slow release of data about the spread of A(H1N1). The international media initially didn’t know what was exactly happening, what the disease was, and how many people had already succumbed to it. The same thing happened to China during the SARS outbreak in 2003. Many experts believed that the real reason the Chinese government didn’t immediately report the outbreak was because it feared to lose investment and trade revenues. Both these instances show the need for the WHO to create incentive programs to reward nations for their compliance on international health regulations, as well as penalize nations which do otherwise (Merson, et al., 2006, p.690-691). Had Mexico and China moved quickly in disseminating information about their respective outbreaks, governments of other countries would have had more time to put resources in place to stop the transmission of such diseases to their shores.
International health regulations are not the only solution to the problem of infectious diseases in a global world. Another potential solution is to further improve information and communication technologies that are critical in the sharing of knowledge. The Internet has been enormously useful in informing people about new and emerging diseases. Its use must be better promoted by healthcare systems so everyone will be ready in case another epidemic begins to manifest. Some countries are now using the Internet to make specialists available for consultation to other medical professionals around the world. This system reduces the cost of providing healthcare by making data available online instead of sending actual medical workers to destinations around the globe (Institute of Medicine, 2003, p.39). Developing countries would benefit more through this kind of system of healthcare as they have fewer resources to pay for the services of foreign physicians in their countries.
All in all, controlling infectious diseases in a globalized world must come in the form of international cooperation. A single nation can’t handle the threat of an outbreak alone. It must appeal to the help of others to effectively stop the outbreak immediately. The WHO must continue developing its international regulations on infectious disease control by adding more diseases to the list, such as A(H1N1) and SARS. All member countries should then be clearly informed of these regulations and they must comply with them regardless of possible consequences on their trade profits. Security in airports and other points of entry must also be fortified since infections can travel at amazing speeds in the globalized world. Detection and diagnosis must be quick in all points of entry to ensure that an outbreak is immediately contained.
Different modes of communication must be more extensively used to share information more quickly regarding infectious diseases. Internet use must be promoted in all medical institutions, so knowledge can quickly be disseminated. In all of these solutions to infectious disease control, developed countries must always be concerned of the plight of developing countries. Developed countries must help them the best they can to stop infections from reaching their countries. Globalization may be dangerous in terms of infectious diseases but it also carries with it the solutions to eliminate the problem.

So, from what I've read, it seems that globalization has both positive and negative effects on the spread of infectious diseases. On one hand, increased travel and trade can lead to the rapid spread of diseases across borders. On the other hand, globalization also facilitates international cooperation and the sharing of resources and information, which can help in controlling and preventing the spread of diseases.

In the first article I found, the author argues that open borders could lead to higher infection rates for diseases like COVID-19, but also acknowledges that complete isolation isn't practical or desirable. They suggest that while open borders might increase the initial spread, measures like mandatory health checks could mitigate some risks.

The second article from the National Academies Press discusses how globalization affects the emergence and control of infectious diseases. It highlights that while globalization brings economic opportunities, it also increases the interconnectedness that can facilitate the spread of diseases. The article emphasizes the need for global collaboration and capacity-building in public health to address these challenges.

Another article from the Center for Immigration Studies argues that open borders pose a threat to public health, using Ebola as an example. The author criticizes public health agencies for prioritizing open borders over public safety and suggests that these agencies have become politicized.

Lastly, a book summary from NCBI discusses the impact of globalization on infectious diseases, noting that while globalization increases the risk of disease spread, it also provides opportunities for enhanced surveillance and control through international partnerships.

From these sources, it seems that the lack of borders would indeed increase the risk of infectious diseases spreading globally due to increased human mobility and trade. However, the same interconnectedness that facilitates disease spread also enables quicker responses through global surveillance, information sharing, and collaborative efforts in research and control measures.

Therefore, the answer to the question "How does the lack of borders impact the future of epidemiology and public health?" is that it presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenges include the faster and wider spread of infectious diseases, while the opportunities lie in enhanced global cooperation, improved surveillance systems, and better resource allocation to combat these diseases.

\boxed{\text{Increased disease spread but also enhanced global cooperation in public health}} 

## Final Solution
The lack of borders significantly impacts the future of epidemiology and public health by exacerbating the spread of infectious diseases due to increased human mobility and trade, but also by fostering enhanced global cooperation in public health efforts.

### Challenges Posed by Lack of Borders

1. **Accelerated Disease Spread**: The absence of borders facilitates the rapid movement of people and goods, allowing diseases to spread more quickly across larger areas. Historical examples, such as the spread of the bubonic plague via trade routes, illustrate this phenomenon.

2. **Global Interconnectedness**: Modern transportation allows pathogens to traverse the globe in hours, outpacing the incubation periods of many diseases. This makes it challenging to contain outbreaks locally before they become global pandemics.

3. **Strained Public Health Systems**: Mass migrations and refugee crises, often exacerbated by borderless scenarios, can overwhelm public health infrastructure, particularly in resource-limited settings.

4. **Economic and Political Repercussions**: Disease outbreaks can lead to significant economic downturns and political instability, further complicating public health responses.

### Opportunities Presented by Globalization

1. **Enhanced Surveillance and Information Sharing**: Global connectivity allows for real-time sharing of data and best practices, enabling quicker identification and response to outbreaks.

2. **International Collaboration**: Public health agencies can collaborate more effectively across borders to develop and implement control measures, share resources, and conduct joint research.

3. **Improved Healthcare Infrastructure**: Investment in global health initiatives can strengthen healthcare systems in developing countries, creating a more resilient global public health network.

4. **Advancements in Technology and Research**: Globalization accelerates the development and distribution of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tools, benefiting populations worldwide.

### Conclusion

While the lack of borders increases the risk of infectious disease spread, it also provides avenues for improved global public health strategies. The key lies in balancing the need for open movement with robust public health measures, ensuring that the benefits of globalization are maximized while mitigating its risks.
