So I'm trying to figure out why we feel nostalgia. I've experienced it plenty of times—those warm, bittersweet feelings when I think about the past, maybe childhood memories or special moments with loved ones. But what actually causes that feeling? Is it just missing the good old days, or is there more to it?

I think I should start by understanding what nostalgia really is. Maybe it's some kind of emotion or a mix of feelings. I've heard people say they're nostalgic for a certain time or place, but I'm not sure what drives that sentiment.

Perhaps I should look up the definition of nostalgia. That might give me a starting point. Let me search for "definition of nostalgia."

History and Etymology for nostalgia
borrowed from New Latin, from Greek nóstos "return, homecoming" (nominal derivative, with o-ablaut and the suffix -to-, from the base of néomai, neîsthai "to come/go [home, back], return") + -o- -o- + -algia -algia; néomai going back to the Indo-European verbal base *nes- "escape danger, return safely," whence also Germanic *nesan- "to be saved, return safely" (whence Old English nesan, genesan "to be saved, survive" [strong verb class V], Old Saxon ginesan "to be saved, convalesce," Old High German, "to recover, be saved," Gothic ganisan "to be saved"), Sanskrit násate "approaches, resorts to someone, joins"; from a causative stem *nos-éi̯e- Germanic *nazjan-, whence Old English nerian "to save, preserve," Old Frisian nera "to save, nourish, Old Saxon nerian "to rescue, redeem, nourish," Old High German nerien, nerren "to nourish, support, save, heal," Gothic nasjan "to save, heal"; and from lengthened grade *nōzjan- Old Icelandic nœra "to refresh, nourish"
Note: The Latin word nostalgia was coined by the physician Johannes Hofer (1669-1752), a native of Mühlhausen/Mulhouse in Alsace, in his doctoral thesis Dissertatio medica de ΝΟΣΤΑΛΓΙΑ, oder Heimwehe (Basel, 1688), as a calque of the German word Heimweh. — Also assigned to the Indo-European verbal base *nes- by some are Tocharian A nasam, B nesau "(I) am," though Douglas Adams (A Dictionary of Tocharian B, Revised and Enlarged, Rodopi, 2013, s.v.) proposes a more attractive solution.

Alright, so I've got these definitions from different dictionaries. They all seem to agree that nostalgia is a feeling of longing or yearning for the past, often associated with happy memories or a sense of home. Some definitions mention it as a mixture of sadness and pleasure, which makes sense because when you think back to good times, you might feel happy, but also a bit sad that those times are over.

I remember reading somewhere that nostalgia can be triggered by certain smells, songs, or places that remind you of the past. For example, a particular song might take you back to high school dances, or the smell of freshly cut grass might remind you of summers spent playing outside as a kid.

But why do we experience nostalgia? Is it just a natural part of human memory, or is there some deeper psychological reason behind it? Maybe it's a way for us to cope with change or to find comfort in familiar memories.

I think I should look into the psychology behind nostalgia to understand it better.

Nostalgia: a Neuropsychiatric Understanding | ACR
Nostalgia: a Neuropsychiatric Understanding
Citation:
Alan R.  Hirsch (1992) ,"Nostalgia: a Neuropsychiatric Understanding", in NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 19, eds. John F. Sherry,  Jr. and Brian Sternthal, Provo, UT : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 390-395.
Advances in Consumer Research Volume 19, 1992 Pages 390-395
NOSTALGIA: A NEUROPSYCHIATRIC UNDERSTANDING
Alan R. Hirsch, Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation,  LTD.
Nostalgia, or the bittersweet yearning for the past has been eloquently  analyzed in terms of society and consumerism, but what of its neuropsychiatric substrate  and its implication? (Havlena, et al). It is these I shall address today.
Within the psychiatric framework, nostalgia may be considered a yearning  to return home to the past -- more than this, it is a yearning for an idealized past -- a  longing for a sanitized impression of the past, what in psychoanalysis is referred to as a  screen memory -- not a true recreation of the past, but rather a combination of many  different memories, all integrated together, and in the process all negative emotions  filtered out. For a personal example of screen memory think of your first ever vivid  memory. Although to you it seems a realistic recall of an early childhood event, it in  fact is a compilation of memories all integrated into one. This can be demonstrated in  psychoanalysis: during the analysis of the transference neurosis, the patient's earliest  memory undergoes changes and divides into multiple components that are separate, definable  childhood memories.
If one defines nostalgia as a yearning for an idealized past, the  bittersweet nature of it becomes clearer. One can never return to this past, it never  truly existed. And the present reality, no matter how good, can never be as good as an  ideal -- which nostalgia has created. Thus the saying "you can't go home again."
Nostalgia, unlike screen memory, does not relate to a specific memory, but  rather to an emotional state. This idealized emotional state is framed within a past era,  and the yearning for the idealized emotional state manifests as an attempt to recreate  that past era by reproducing activities performed then and by using symbolic  representations of the past.
Idealized past emotions become displaced onto inanimate objects, sounds,  smells and tastes that were experienced concurrently with the emotions. This same  mechanism of displacement is utilized in medicine for its negative impact in the treatment  of alcoholism. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is used as an adversive conditioning agent to inhibit  recurrent use of alcohol in addicts. (Kaplan, et al 1988, p. 227).
The nostalgic urge to recreate the past within the present is, in many  ways, a driving force for behavior -- how frequently we marry spouses with characteristics  reminiscent of those of our parents. As other examples, we may adopt the political  affiliations and prejudices of our forebears, become democrats, republicans, or even  racists because our parents were.
Similarly, the nostalgic urge to recreate the past explains why so many  abused children marry abusive spouses, and children of alcoholics marry alcoholic spouses  -- not because their childhood was happy, but rather because they seek to recreate their  idealized sanitized memories of their childhood by identifying with symbolic  manifestations of the past which they find in their alcoholic or abusive spouses.
This same paradigm governs the repetition of failures on the part of  "neurotics" who behave as if oblivious to logical rationale. This is seen in  persons with recurrent failing relationships (those marrying seven or eight times), those  with recurrent failures at business, and even those with recurrent experiences of being  victimized.
Through daily behavior, the nostalgic urges may also be partially  gratified -- food choices for example (hence the passing down from generation to  generation of family recipes) -- with an actual primitive incorporation into the self of  the nostalgic object.
Observing holidays precipitates nostalgic desires, while it simultaneously  recreates past experiences, hence fulfilling the nostalgic yearning. Emotionally-laden  rituals discharge nostalgic energies through the physical activity of the ritual, while  forging linkages with the past. Religious practices may be viewed as an immersion in  institutionalized nostalgia -- unchanged over the millenia, hence gratifying nostalgic  wishes. This explains how the intertwining of religion with the major holidays (Christmas,  Thanksgiving, Easter) achieves the greatest impact and relief of nostalgic drives.
Thus, nostalgia may be viewed in psychiatric terms as a driving force for  actual behavior -- the attempt to recreate an idealized past in the present. By attempting  to recreate this idealized past, one discharges psychic energies to fulfill nostalgic  yearnings. Some results of these attempts throughout society may be seen in the production  of sequels to movies, TV shows, and in the common practice of naming first-born sons after  their fathers.
Nostalgia exists in the pathological, as well as the normal, states. Some  severely regressed schizophrenics actually live within the delusional system of their  idealized memories.(Hill). In pathological bereavement, obsession with loss of the  idealized past causes depression.(Kaplan et al, 1988, p. 299). In senile dementia of the  Alzheimer's type, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, where recent memory is markedly  hampered, nostalgic memories are still available, hence substituting the past for the  present.(Lishman;Hales et al).
On the other hand, in an antithetical state to nostalgia, those suffering  from posttraumatic stress disorder do not yearn for the past but rather desire to  eliminate memory for the past.(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).  However, in both nostalgia and in posttraumatic stress disorder immediate stimuli can  precipitate emotionally-laden memories. These stimuli are context specific. For instance,  many Viet Nam veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder describe odors of seafood or  burning diesel fuel as precipitants for the flashback phenomena.(Kline et al). Flashbacks  for those who were Korean veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder describe odors of  beaches and wet canvas as precipitants. And Persian Gulf veterans describe  gustatory-evoked recall from drinking ionized water.(Coombs).
Homesickness is not true nostalgia, but rather a geographic nostalgia -- a  yearning for a different space rather than a different time -- for return to idealized  memories of a location and people left behind.
All the senses may be used to precipitate the nostalgic experience --  hearing music (witness the popularity of "classics" of the '60s, '70s, '80s,  etc.), seeing pictures (photo albums in fashion with their recurring trends), and possibly  the most significant, smelling odors.
Even as early as 1908, Freud recognized a strong link between odors and  the emotions.(Freud). Anatomically, the nose directly connects with the olfactory lobe in  the limbic system -- that area of the brain considered the seat of the emotions. The  olfactory lobe is actually part and parcel of the limbic system.(MacLean). Therefore, the  most powerful impact upon the emotions is through the sense of smell. In a universal  phenomena called olfactory-evoked recall, an odor can bring back a memory from the past.  Often a vivid visual image is evoked along with an associated positive mood state. A  classic example was described by Marcel Proust in the first volume of his novel A La  Recherche Du Temps Perdu (English translation Remembrance of Things Past).(Proust). The  aroma of madeleine dipped in tea evoked in the author a flood of memories and feelings of  nostalgia.
The understanding that odors evoke more powerful reactions than the other  senses do is not particularly new. It is well known that the aroma of freshly baked goods  conjures up warm childhood memories. When an odor of baked bread was released in a U.S.  supermarket, sales in the bakery section increased threefold. Movie theater managers  infuse the air in their lobbies with the aroma of popcorn to entice patrons to buy. The  smell of chocolate chip cookies released into the air in front of cookie stands induces  the people to salivate and buy cookies. The unique, leathery "new car scent" is  an exciting enticement to most customers and a positive inducement to make a purchase.  Victoria's Secret, a successful women's underclothing chain, uses a special floral  potpourri throughout its stores. Many of the customers say that the aroma lifts their  spirits.
Some odors, however, can have a negative impact. Among 1002 people queried  in a 1989 Gallop poll throughout the United States, the most disliked odor was the odor of  fish.(unpublished study, 1989). We might well expect any store located next to a seafood  market to have their sales negatively affected by the odor.
An ordinary person can smell 10,000 odors.(Ackerman). But no two people  react in exactly the same way.
In general women are more sensitive to odors than are men.(Doty et al).  Ethnicity and geographical background strongly affect odor sensitivity. Japanese perfume  may not be a popular sales item in North America. Among sample populations taken across  the U.S., Korean-Americans had a keener ability to identify odors than either black or  white Americans. Native Japanese were least able to identify the odors used in the study.
As might be expected, our judgement as to the pleasantness or the  unpleasantness of various odors depends too upon who we are and where we live. In one  study, sample populations from 20 nations were asked to evaluate 22 different  fragrances.(Davis et al). The populations with similar odor preferences could be grouped  geographically. One group with similar odor preferences included residents of California,  Kansas, Japan, West Germany, Taiwan, Canada, Italians in Brazil, Phillipines and Taiwanese  in California. A second group with similar preferences included residents of Australia,  Sweden, France, Norway, East Germany, Finland, Mexico, Japanese in Brazil and Africans in  Brazil. This clustering of odor preferences implies a similar clustering of preferences  with regard to foods and perfumes.
Among the 1002 people mentioned previously, the particular area of the  United States from which they came had a decisive influence on their responses to odors  (Table 1).(unpublished study, 1989). Although in general, baked goods were the most common  precipitant of an olfactory-evoked recall, among persons from the east coast, the smell of  flowers prompted an olfactory-evoked recall of their childhoods. Among persons from the  south, the smell of fresh air prompted a similar recall - among those from the midwest,  the smell of farm animals, and among those from the west coast, the smell of meat cooking  or barbecuing. Evoked memories of childhood are usually associated with a positive  emotional state which may then be transferred to the place where the evoked memories are  experienced -- the store and the items for sale. The makers of certain oriental perfumes  already take advantage of this effect by adding the smell of baby powder to their  formulas, baby powder being associated in most persons' minds with a safe, clean  environment.
In order to further investigate olfactory-evoked recall, in September of  1991, 989 English-speaking individuals selected at random in Water Tower Place shopping  mall in Chicago consented to be interviewed in person for this Institutional Review Board  approved study. Respondents reported basic demographic data including the decade of their  birth and their predominant geographic location during childhood. Psychological data  revealed the existence of olfactory evoked recall, the particular smells that precipitated  childhood memories and the overall level of happiness with the individual's childhood.
Demographic Profile: 478 were male, 511 were female. Decades of birth  ranged from the 1900s to the 1970s as follows: 1900s - 3, 1910s - 16, 1920s - 43, 1930s -  70, 1940s - 118, 1950s 204, 1960s - 338, 1970s - 197 (Table 2). In order to achieve  statistical significance, data for people born in the 1900s, 1910s and 1920s were combined  into a single grouping. While most were reared in Chicago (325) or its suburbs (176), 45  states were represented and 39 countries as well.
TABLE 1
QUESTION: "WHAT SMELLS OR ODORS REMIND YOU OF YOUR CHILDHOOD?"
Statistics were analyzed using Chi-square test on contingency tables or  Z-test for the difference between pairs of proportions.
Results: Overall, 85.2% displayed olfactory evoked recall, a generational  effect was demonstrated in this regard (Table 3).
Eighty-six and eight tenths percent of those born after 1930 displayed  olfactory-evoked recall, whereas only 61.3% of those born before 1930 displayed it. This  implies that the marketing of products through nostalgia with odors would be more  efficacious in a target consumer group born after 1930. This is not surprising since  olfactory ability decreases with age: one-half of those over 65 and three-quarters of  those over 80 years of age have a reduced ability to smell.(Doty et al). In addition,  memory worsens with age further explaining our findings in the elderly.(Bartus et al).
As mentioned, women have better olfactory ability than do men. Yet in our  study at Water Tower, no statistically significant difference was shown between the  genders in their self-reports of odor-evoked nostalgia (Table 4). Hence, regardless of  sex, aroma is an important nostalgia inducer. Based on the Z-test for the difference  between two proportions, a statistically significant generational difference was found  (Table 5). Those born from the 1930s on were more likely to have nostalgia induced by food  odors and less likely to have nostalgia induced by nature odors than those born before the  1930s.
Those born before the 1930s cited smells of nature including pine, hay,  horses, sea air and meadows, whereas those born in 1930 to 1979 were reminded of their  childhood by such smells as plastic, scented markers, airplane fuel, vaporub, sweet tarts,  and playdough. This shift away from natural odors and toward artificial ones may portend  future problems for society. If we are concerned about ecology partly out of nostalgia for  nature odors, then 50 years from now, how will the environmental movement be of much  concern to the people who are nostalgic only for manmade chemicals?
TABLE 2
TABLE 3
TABLE 4
TABLE 5
TABLE 6
Clearly, in targeting a younger consumer group, food smells would be more  efficacious than would nature smells, but the opposite would be true in targeting an older  group. Odors were divided into foul and nonfoul smells. Foul smells (i.e. garbage, urine,  manure) were defined by a panel of olfactory experts. Eight and eight tenths percent of  those who reported olfactory-induced nostalgia said that foul smells were the precipitant.  Eight and seven tenths percent (or one person in 12) reported an unhappy childhood. This  was independent of birth decade or gender. And whether one had a happy childhood  influenced which kind of smell evoked a childhood memory. The one person in 12 who  reported having an unhappy childhood, was more than twice as likely to describe such foul  odors as mothballs, body odor, dog waste, sewer gas, bus fumes, and mother's menstrual  cycle (Table 6). This suggests that psychotherapists might well inquire into what odor  induces childhood memories as a further method of gaining insight into personality.
Interestingly, happiness in childhood did not correlate with ability for  olfactory evoked recall -- suggesting the universal nature of this phenomenon.
About equal numbers, 91% of men and 92% of women, reported a happy  childhood.
Implications of our findings for marketers are: 1) approximately 85% of  both men and women report smell-induced nostalgia -- suggesting smell is an important tool  in marketing, 2) consumers under 60 years old are better targets for marketing nostalgia  than older consumers, 3) while a wide range of smells could be utilized to induce  nostalgic recall, food smells are a more effective stimulus for the younger consumer while  nature smells are more effective for the older consumer, 4) in attempting to sell a  product now, odorize it to maximize nostalgia of present-day consumers, 5) the product now  odorized may come to be the focus of nostalgia for future consumers, 6) use of nostalgia  through activation of the limbic system through the sense of smell will produce the  strongest emotional appeal as a means of product marketing.
Through odors, nostalgia may be induced with greatest ease. One may  speculate that nostalgic desires will increase in the coming decade since it seems likely  that the more dissatisfied we are with the present, the more we idealize the past (a  temporal equivalent of "the grass is greener on the other side" or as Richard  Llewellyn wrote, "how green was my valley").(Liwellyn). Therefore, in the hard  times ahead, it will be easier to sell nostalgia.

The Psychology of Nostalgia: Why Do We Feel a Longing for the Past?

Psychology & Mental Health
Should we dwell on the past? Until recently, psychologists would likely have argued not to. However, longing for the past, otherwise known as nostalgia, is now gaining recognition as a useful tool for people fighting anxiety and depression. As a result, nostalgia is a growing focus of global inquiry and research in psychology.
In this post, we will look at what nostalgia is, what causes nostalgia, and what some of the psychological benefits of nostalgia, and potential pitfalls, can be.
What is nostalgia?
“A feeling of sadness mixed with pleasure and affection when you think of happy times in the past ” (Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries)
Coined by a 17th Century Swiss military doctor, the word itself is rooted in the Greek words nostos (meaning longing for a return home) and algos (the pain linked to this longing).
Similarly, in “ Nostalgia: A Neuropsychiatric Understanding ”, nostalgia psychologist Alan Hirsch links nostalgia to a yearning for the past. However, the past longed for is an idealized version of itself, with positive emotions existing in your memory with the accompanying “negative emotions filtered out”.
Nevertheless, whilst nostalgia is rooted in a somewhat rose-tinted version of the past, recent studies have shown that nostalgia can offer new perspectives on our present state of being, reminding us of our connectivity with others.
Indeed, Hepper et. al.’s study across 18 countries and 5 continents on ‘ Pancultural nostalgia ’ found nostalgia encouraged feelings of empathy and social connection and even worked as a form of antidote to feelings of loneliness and depression.
What causes nostalgia, according to psychology?
Whether we are going through tough times, or things are simply changing in our personal lives, memories of simpler times are a common refuge that can provide us solace.
Furthermore, research has shown that nostalgia is a common response to change. As such, when we are going through a transition in our lives, be it becoming an adult, reaching retirement age, moving to a new country or even struggling to cope with technological advances, we are driven to nostalgic yearning.
Interestingly then, nostalgia is typically caused by negative emotions but typically fosters an improved mood and increases positive emotions. However, this nostalgia comes with a bittersweet taste, since we can only experience the good times intangibly and fleetingly.
Moreover, a 1985 psychoanalytic paper on nostalgia found extreme cases of nostalgia could be debilitative due to this search for something that never truly was there.
Given this, should we view nostalgia as a malady to overcome or a useful tool to help guide us through turbulent waters?
The psychological benefits of nostalgia
Researchers into the psychology of nostalgia at the University of Southampton have found that nostalgia can act as a neurological defense system that helps us to overcome negative thoughts or experiences.
Nostalgia achieves this as it helps people to achieve a temporary change in how they perceive their current state. This enables them the strength to persevere through hard times. Moreover, by connecting people with their past in their own mind’s eye, it reminds them that their present state of being is temporary.
So even if they are feeling isolated in the present, nostalgia reminds them of intimacy they have achieved in the past and reminds them that positive times can lie ahead and that they are not alone.
Nostalgia also has benefits for the wider community, with people in nostalgic states having been found in the same study to be more likely to demonstrate altruistic traits and commit to volunteering.
Similarly, children who have been encouraged to think about the past more, making them more prone to feelings of nostalgia, were found to be less likely to demonstrate selfish traits.
Nostalgia has also been shown to have physiological as well as psychological effects. For example, Zhou et al.’s 2012 study on the psychology of nostalgia found that participants in their study who were left in a cold room were more likely to experience nostalgia.
Moreover, they found that those experiencing nostalgia perceived the ambient temperature to be higher and could tolerate colder conditions than participants not reporting feelings of nostalgia.
The great news is, a single positive memory last’s a lifetime so even for those with troubled pasts, nostalgia can be a useful psychological tool to draw upon to help people navigate troublesome waters.
A cautionary note
As already alluded to, nostalgia was previously seen as a malady rather than a potentially useful tool to fight against depression. Indeed, if we allow ourselves to retreat too much into the romanticized past we have created for ourselves, then it can have negative implications.
This relates to something Barbara B. Stern termed ‘ Historical Nostalgia’, or the desire to escape from the present into an unreachable, imaginary, and idealized past. Therefore, it is important to take care to not rely too heavily on nostalgia as the major benefits are felt in its transitory effects.
Nostalgia can be a useful tool to help us overcome challenges in our lives, help us feel connected to others when we are feeling isolated or alone, and even foster improved connections with our community.
So next time you feel wistful about the past, enjoy it and let this natural response to life’s changes give you hope for a brighter tomorrow.

Nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. [2] The word nostalgia is a learned formation of a Greek compound, consisting of νόστος (nóstos ), meaning "homecoming", a Homeric word, and ἄλγος (álgos ), meaning "sorrow" or "despair", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by Swedish mercenaries fighting away from home. [3] Described as a medical condition—a form of melancholy —in the Early Modern period,[4] it became an important trope in Romanticism.[2]
Nostalgia is associated with a yearning for the past, its personalities, possibilities, and events, especially the "good ol' days" or a "warm childhood". [5]
The scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding one's personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia as induced during these studies. Emotion is a strong evoker of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain. These recollections of one's past are usually important events, people one cares about, and places where one has spent time. Music,[6] entertainment (movies,[7] video games,[8] etc.), and weather [9] can also be strong triggers of nostalgia.

Functions[edit]
Nostalgia's definition has changed greatly over time. Consistent with its Greek word roots meaning "homecoming" and "pain," nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition expressing extreme homesickness.[4] The modern view is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that many people experience often. Nostalgia has been found to have important psychological functions, such as to improve mood, increase social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide existential meaning. [10] Many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them. Such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of "nostalgia proneness." [11] [12] Nostalgia has also been associated with learning and memory consolidation. [13]
Improve mood[edit]
Although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results in increasing one's mood and heightening positive emotions, which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections. One way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one's happiness. Batcho (2013) found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages—planning and implementing strategies, and reframing the issue positively. These studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia-prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times. Nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them, thus increasing support in challenging times. [14]
Increase social connectedness[edit]

Tweed run, 2013
Nostalgia also sometimes involves memories of people you were close to, and thus it can increase one's sense of social support and connections. Nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships. According to Zhou et al. (2008), lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support. Loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia, which actually increases perceptions of social support. Thus, Zhou and colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness. [15]
Enhance positive self-regard[edit]
Nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves. Vess et al. (2012) found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences. Additionally, in a second study conducted, some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not. The researchers looked again at self-attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self-centered attributes. Vess et al. (2012), however, found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection. [16]
Provide existential meaning[edit]
Nostalgia helps increase one's self-esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress. Routledge (2011) and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one's sense of meaning in life. The second study revealed that nostalgia increases one's perceived meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness. Thirdly, the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus increasing one's nostalgic reflections. By triggering nostalgia, though, one's defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study. The final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one's well-being. Follow-up studies also completed by Routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better buffer existential threat. [17] [18]
Promote psychological growth[edit]
Nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth-oriented behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth-oriented people. Baldwin & Landau (2014) found that nostalgia leads people to rate themselves higher on items like "I am the kind of person who embraces unfamiliar people, events, and places." Nostalgia also increased interest in growth-related behavior such as "I would like to explore someplace that I have never been before." In the first study, these effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced positive affect—the extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good. In the second study, nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced self-esteem. [19]
As a deception[edit]
One recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia, which in some forms can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical facts. [20] This study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid in South Africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways, [21] 'restorative nostalgia' a wish to return to that past, and 'reflective nostalgia' which is more critically aware.
As a comfort[edit]
Reliving past memories may provide comfort and contribute to mental health. [22] One notable recent medical study has looked at the physiological effects thinking about past 'good' memories can have. They found that thinking about the past 'fondly' actually increased perceptions of physical warmth. [23]
As a political tool[edit]
In a 2014 study conducted by Routledge, he and a team observed that the more people reported having major disruptions and uncertainties in their lives, the more they nostalgically longed for the past. Routledge suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past, politicians can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that make nostalgia especially attractive—and effective—as a tool of political persuasion. [24] [25]
Other aspects[edit]
As a medical condition[edit]
Further information: Homesickness
The term was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669–1752) in his Basel dissertation. Hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays "homesickness" for the condition also known as mal du Suisse "Swedish illness, because of its frequent occurrence in Swedish mercenaries who in the plains of Sweden were pining for their landscapes. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, and death.
English homesickness is a loan translation of nostalgia. Sir Joseph Banks used the word in his journal during the first voyage of Captain Cook. On 3 September 1770 he stated that the sailors "were now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the Physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia", but his journal was not published in his lifetime. [26] Cases resulting in death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by being discharged and sent home. Receiving a diagnosis was, however, generally regarded as an insult.
In the eighteenth century, scientists were looking for a locus of nostalgia, a nostalgic bone. By the 1850s nostalgia was losing its status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a symptom or stage of a pathological process. It was considered as a form of melancholia and a predisposing condition among suicides. Nostalgia was, however, still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the American Civil War.[27] By the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical category had almost completely vanished. Nostalgia was still being recognized in both the First and Second World Wars, especially by the American armed forces. Great lengths were taken to study and understand the condition to stem the tide of troops leaving the front in droves (see the BBC documentary Century of the Self ).
Nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event or item from their past. The resulting emotion can vary from happiness to sorrow. The term "feeling nostalgic" is more commonly used to describe pleasurable emotions associated with and/or a longing to go back to a particular period of time.
Romanticism[edit]
Swedish nostalgia was linked to the singing of Kuhreihen, which were forbidden to Swedish mercenaries because they led to nostalgia to the point of desertion, illness or death. The 1767 Dictionnaire de Musique by Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that Swedish mercenaries were threatened with severe punishment to prevent them from singing their Swedish songs. It became somewhat of a topos in Romantic literature, and figures in the poem Der Schweizer by Achim von Arnim (1805) and in Clemens Brentano 's Des Knaben Wunderhorn (1809) as well as in the opera Le Chalet by Adolphe Charles Adam (1834) which was performed for Queen Victoria under the title The Swedish Cottage. The Romantic connection of nostalgia, was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for Sweden and the development of early tourism in Sweden that took hold of the European cultural elite in the 19th century. German Romanticism coined an opposite to Heimweh, Fernweh "far-sickness," "longing to be far away," like wanderlust expressing the Romantic desire to travel and explore.
Music[edit]
Hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person. A song heard once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date remembered and events that occurred then. However, if it is heard throughout life, it may lose its association with any specific period or experience. [6]
Books[edit]
A person can deliberately trigger feelings of nostalgia by listening to familiar music, looking at old photos, or visiting comforting environments of the past. [28] With this knowledge widely available, many books have been published specifically to evoke the feeling of nostalgia. Books are just one of many media used in the monetization of nostalgia [29][circular reference].
In Rhetoric and Communication[edit]
Nostalgia has been frequently studied as a tool of rhetoric and persuasion. Communication scholar Stephen Depoe, [30] for example, writes that in nostalgic messaging: “a speaker highlights a comparison between a more favorable, idealized past and a less favorable present in order to stimulate [nostalgia]. . . . [linking] his/her own policies to qualities of the idealized past in order to induce support” (179). Rhetorician William Kurlinkus [31] [32] taxonomizes nostalgia on this foundation, arguing that nostalgic rhetoric generally contains three parts:
A loss or threat in the present: the chaotic change that nostalgia responds to. Though some theorists [33] argue that the ideal must truly be lost, other scholars including Kurlinkus argue that the ideal may simply be threatened to trigger nostalgia.
A nostalgic crux: a person, group, corporation, et al. that is blamed for the loss of the nostalgic ideal. To perform such scapegoating, the nostalgic crux is usually presented as a force of newness and change. Defeating this outsider is positioned as a source of recovering the god memory. Such cruxes have include groups from polluting corporations to immigrants.
Hope: Finally, Kurlinkus argues that though nostalgia is often performed ironically it almost always has a true hope for recovering the god memory (whether this means some kind of true restoration or a more symbolic recovery of an ethic). Such hope differentiates nostalgia from similar emotions like melancholia, which contains all of nostalgia's longing for lost ideals without a desire to move out of that past.
Kurlinkus coined the term "nostalgic other" to describe the ways in which some populations of people become trapped in other people's nostalgic stories of them, idealized as natural while simultaneously denied sovereignty or the right to change in the present. "Nostalgic others differ from other scholarly discourse in that their alterity is not primarily based in race or ethnicity." Kurlinkus wrote. "Rather, in concurrent identifications and divisions, the nostalgic other is distinguished from the rhetor by time. We live in the present; they live in the past. The creation of the nostalgic other allows mainstream populations to commodify the racial purity and stability of the past but refuses the community agency to change in the present by highlighting its negative traits.
As an advertising tool[edit]
In media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume, watch, or buy advertised products. [34] Modern technology facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style, and design of an advertisement. [35] The feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these media require the participation of multiple senses, are able to represent their ideas entirely, and therefore become more reminiscent of life.
Due to efficient advertising schemes, consumers need not have experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel nostalgic for it. This is due to a phenomenon referred to as vicarious nostalgia. Vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of wistful yearning for a moment that occurred prior to, or outside of, the span of one's memory, but is relatable (has sentimental value) due to repeated mediated exposure to it. [36] The constant propagating of advertisements and other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible, and changes the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently, the way consumers use their purchasing power.
Examples of nostalgia used to provoke public interest include nostalgia-themed websites [37] such as The Nostalgia Machine and DoYouRemember?, and revamps of old movies, [38] TV shows, and books. Vintage, rustic and old-fashioned design styles can also be seen in nostalgia-based ad campaigns that companies such as Coca-Cola and Levi Strauss & Co. use. [36]
Developed within the marketing discipline, forestalgia [1], defined as an individual's yearning for an idealized future, serves as a future-focused counterpart to nostalgia. [39] Like nostalgia, where only the happy memories are retained, forestalgia explains customers’ intentions to escape the present to a romanticized future where current concerns are no longer an issue. Marketing researchers found that when promoting hedonic and utilitarian products, far-past nostalgia and far-future forestalgia advertisements were most effective in the promotion of utilitarian products. In contrast, hedonic products were better suited for advertisements framed in far-past nostalgia or near-future forestalgia.

Abstract
The literature on nostalgia is summarized under the headings: (1) symptoms, (2) susceptibility (as related to race and nationality, age, temperament, intelligence, education, rural and urban backgrounds), (3) conditions precipitating nostaligia, (4) theories (physiological, anatomical, and psychological), and (5) prevention and treatment.

Okay, so I've got a bunch of information about nostalgia from different sources. It seems like nostalgia is a complex emotion that involves a mix of feelings about the past. From what I've read, it's not just about missing the good old days; it's more about yearning for an idealized version of the past. Some definitions describe it as a bittersweet feeling, which makes sense because thinking about happy memories can make you feel good, but also a bit sad that those times are over.

I found an article from the Association for Consumer Research that talks about nostalgia in terms of psychiatry. It says that nostalgia is a yearning to return to an idealized past, which is often not entirely accurate because negative emotions are filtered out. So, it's like creating a perfect memory that never really existed. That explains why nostalgia can be both sweet and sad—because you can't really go back to that idealized time.

Another interesting point is that nostalgia can drive behavior. For example, people might marry someone who reminds them of their parents or adopt political views similar to their ancestors because of this yearning for the past. It's fascinating how deeply rooted these influences can be.

In terms of triggers, smells seem to be a big one. There's a concept called olfactory-evoked recall, where certain smells can transport you back to a specific memory. This is something I've experienced personally—like smelling cookies baking and being instantly transported back to my grandmother's house.

There's also a study mentioned where they found that about 85% of people experience olfactory-evoked nostalgia, and that this tendency is stronger in younger generations. So, maybe as we get older, our ability to experience nostalgia through smells decreases, which aligns with the general understanding that our senses diminish with age.

Moreover, nostalgia seems to have some psychological benefits. It can improve mood, increase feelings of social connectedness, enhance self-esteem, and provide a sense of meaning in life. So, it's not just some melancholic feeling; it can actually be beneficial for our mental well-being.

However, there's also a cautionary note that if we rely too much on nostalgia, it can become maladaptive. If we spend too much time dwelling on the past, we might miss out on the present and future opportunities. So, while nostalgia can be a helpful tool, it's essential to strike a balance.

In the context of marketing and advertising, nostalgia is often used to evoke positive emotions and create a connection with consumers. Companies use vintage designs, old slogans, or classic products to tap into people's nostalgic feelings, which can influence their purchasing decisions.

Overall, nostalgia seems to be a multifaceted emotion with both positive and negative aspects. It's deeply intertwined with our memories, senses, and even our behavior. Understanding nostalgia can help us appreciate its role in our lives and use it in a healthy way.

So, to sum it up, nostalgia is a complex emotion involving a yearning for an idealized past, often triggered by sensory experiences like smells and sights. It has both psychological benefits and potential pitfalls, and it's widely used in marketing to influence consumer behavior.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Nostalgia is a complex emotion involving a yearning for an idealized past, often triggered by sensory experiences, with both psychological benefits and potential pitfalls, and widely used in marketing.}} \]
