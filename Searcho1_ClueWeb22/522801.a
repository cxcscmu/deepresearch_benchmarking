So I need to figure out ways to reduce air pollution. Air pollution is a big problem nowadays, and it affects everyone's health and the environment. I should probably start by understanding what causes air pollution and then look for methods to mitigate those sources.

First, I need to know the main sources of air pollution. I think the biggest contributors are vehicles, industrial emissions, burning of fossil fuels, and maybe some natural sources like dust and volcanic eruptions. But I should confirm that.

Let me consider doing a search to get more accurate information on the sources of air pollution. Maybe there are more detailed categories or recent studies that can help me understand this better.

What are the Sources of Air Pollution? 8 causes of pollution
Share
In the category of air pollution, we can differentiate between various particles and toxic gases. Where do they come from, and is there a way to limit their emissions? We explain it below.
At first glance, the air pollution problem might seem easy to solve – switching to electric vehicles and renewable sources of energy and imposing stricter regulations on industrial emissions should be enough. Well, in theory, it is simple. However, mobilizing every sector is a challenging task that requires major investment. That is the main reason why so many countries struggle with this problem regardless of increasing accessibility to green energy and other solutions that can provide us with the cleaner air.
It doesn’t help that the sources of air pollution vary and can cause two distinct types of smog that require different approaches to combat. The first one, photochemical, appears in high temperatures, mostly because of exhaust fumes that cause a high concentration of nitrogen oxide. The second, sulfurous, is associated with burning coal and appears in the winter months.
The natural sources of air pollution
The sources of air pollution are mostly tied to human activity. However, that doesn’t mean that there are no natural ones. In fact, some natural phenomena can cause noticeable drops in air quality. These include:
volcano eruptions – during them, large amounts of sulfur dioxide and ash is emitted into the air;
desert dust – considered a type of particulate matter that can cause mucosa irritation and respiratory problems;
animal digestion & melting of glaciers – both cause a release of methane to the atmosphere;
wildfires – ashes from fires can cause heavy air pollution.
The anthropogenic sources of air pollution
There is no doubt that natural sources can contribute to air pollution. However, it is the anthropogenic ones that cause the majority of emissions. Contrary to the natural ones, these are constant, not occasional. Which sources of air pollution are the result of human activity?
Pollution with carbon oxides, nitrogen dioxides, and sulfur oxides
In this case, emissions are mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Public transport and power plants are the main contributors here. We can divide these sources into:
exhaust fumes – petrol vehicles release plenty of toxic gases after burning fossil fuels in their engines. The most dangerous include sulfur dioxides, ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide, aldehydes, and hydrocarbons.
coal-burning – this activity causes sulfurous smog. The spectrum of toxic gases is similar to above. During the coal burning process, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are usually released into the air, as well as carbon dioxide which contributes to climate change.
Pollution with methane and ammonia
Here, the main culprits are the agricultural industry and waste storage. The first one is responsible for around 90% of emissions of methane and ammonia. Landfills are big emitters of methane, too.

Sources and causes | pollution
Sources and causes
Air pollution comes from both natural and man made sources. Though globally man made pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.
Motor vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of air pollution. China, United States,Russia, Mexico, and Japan are the world leaders in air pollution emissions. Principal stationary pollution sources include chemical plants, coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, petrochemicalplants, nuclear waste disposal activity, incinerators, large livestock farms (dairy cows, pigs, poultry, etc.), PVC factories, metals production factories, plastics factories, and other heavy industry. Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides
Air pollution produced by ships may alter clouds, affecting global temperatures.
About 400 million metric tons of hazardous wastes are generated each year. The United States alone produces about 250 million metric tons. Americans constitute less than 5% of the world’s population, but produce roughly 25% of the world’s CO 2 , and generate approximately 30% of world’s waste. [20] [21] In 2007, China has overtaken the United States as the world’s biggest producer of CO 2 , while still far behind based on per capita pollution – ranked 78th among the world’s nations.
In February 2007, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing the work of 2,500 scientists, economists, and policymakers from more than 120 countries, said that humans have been the primary cause of global warming since 1950. Humans have ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the consequences of global warming, a major climate report concluded. But to change the climate, the transition from fossil fuels like coal and oil needs to occur within decades, according to the final report this year from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
Some of the more common soil contaminants are chlorinated hydrocarbons (CFH), heavy metals (such as chromium, cadmium–found in rechargeable batteries, and lead–found in lead paint, aviation fuel and still in some countries, gasoline), MTBE, zinc, arsenic andbenzene. In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called Fateful Harvest unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal landfills are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, commonly called dioxins for simplicity, such as TCDD.
Pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. For example, hurricanes often involve water contamination from sewage, and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats or automobiles. Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil rigs or refineries are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.
In the case of noise pollution the dominant source class is the motor vehicle, producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide.

Air pollution can cause significant health problems
Air pollution not only causes environmental hazards but significant health problems as well. Long-term exposure to polluted air often result in respiratory illnesses such as asthma and bronchitis, and can sometimes lead to the development of cancer .
While air pollution cannot always be seen, pungent-smelling chemicals (such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia) may alert you to its presence. The main causes of air pollution can be categorized by source:
Mobile: Cars, buses, planes, trucks and trains.
Stationary: Power plants, oil refineries, industrial facilities and factories.
Area: Agricultural areas, cities and wood-burning fireplaces.
Natural: Wind-blown dust, wildfires and volcanoes.
Mobile sources
The global transport sector (automobiles) accounts for almost 25% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, and this number is rising.
Stationary sources
Coal-burning power plants are a major contributor, whereas diesel generators are a growing concern in off-grid areas.
Industrial processes and solvent usage in the chemical and mining industries also pollute the air.
Area sources
Two major sources of air pollution from agriculture are livestock (which produces methane and ammonia) and the burning of agricultural waste. Methane emissions contribute to ground-level ozone, which causes asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Methane is also a more potent global warming gas than carbon dioxide.
Open waste burning and organic waste in landfills release harmful dioxins, furans, methane and black carbon into the atmosphere. The problem is most severe in urbanizing regions and developing countries.
Indoor burning of fossil fuels, wood and other biomass-based fuels to cook, heat and light homes is considered a cause of air pollution.
Second-hand cigarette smoke is also considered air pollution.
Natural sources
Volcanic eruptions, dust storms, smoke from wildlife fires and other natural phenomena also cause pollution.
Sand and dust storms are particularly concerning, since fine particles of dust can travel thousands of miles through these storms, carrying pathogens and harmful substances that cause respiratory problems.
Who is most affected by air pollution?
Studies show that people with lower socioeconomic status and minority populations are disproportionately exposed to air pollution and more vulnerable to adverse health effects. Populations who are at a higher risk of health problems due to air pollution are:
Infants and young children
Adults age 65 years or older
People who:
Have lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Have cardiovascular diseases
Live in poorer areas
Lack access to health care
Work or exercise outdoors
Are exposed to contaminated air at the workplace
Spend a lot of time near busy roadways
Smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoke
What can help reduce air pollution?
Depending on where you live, indoor air can be more harmful than outdoor air. For example, if the filters in your air conditioner aren’t changed regularly, air gets combined with dirt and other pollutants, which can lead to air pollution inside the house. Installing an air purifier can help.
Pollutants are getting added to the air, as well as oceans and landmasses, faster than our planet can remove them through natural processes. Results can be seen in acid rain, smog and global warming. And the rise of several health problems can be directly attributed to exposure to these harmful pollutants.
Sustainability and reduced carbon emission can help curb the ever-increasing air pollution that is detrimental to our health and quality of life. Other measures include:
Reducing consumption of resources
Recycling energy and available resources
Reusing where possible (energy sources, fashion, food, etc.)

Publisher Summary
National anthropogenic annual emission inventories can, on their own, give a misleading picture regarding the appropriate sources to control. What is important for most pollutants are those sources that make major contributions to elevated concentrations during pollution episodes. As most people live in cities, urban inventories are important for identifying these sources. The main source of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels, particularly in power stations and motor vehicles. Emissions from both these sources have begun to decline in recent years owing to the introduction of efficient abatement measures. In most urban areas, road transport is the dominant source of pollution as measures to reduce wintertime smogs in earlier decades lead to the re-location of many large stationary sources to rural or semi-rural sites. Road transport is the single most important source of most of the classical air pollutants. The exceptions are sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds. To develop effective control strategies for reducing urban emissions, it is important to know which type of vehicles are contributing most to the total road traffic emissions. It is not possible to measure emissions from every single one. Instead, emissions are generally calculated from a measure of activity relating to the emissions, such as fuel consumption for stationary sources and distance traveled for mobile sources. Emission factors, derived from measurements of individual or representative sources, are then multiplied by the appropriate statistic to give the emission rate.

Sources of Air Pollution   CLAIRE HOLMAN SENCO, Bristol, UK   INTRODUCTION   Air pollution comes from a wide variety of sources. For the classical pollutants- sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM) -the single most important source is generally the combustion of fossil fuels. Of particular importance is the burning of fuels for road transport and electricity generation.   Some pollutants are emitted directly into the atmosphere and are known as primary pollutants. Others are formed in the air as a result of chemical reactions with other pol- lutants and atmospheric gases; these are known as secondary pollutants. Carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide are examples of primary pollutants, while ozone is an exam- ple of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and some particulate matter, are both primary and secondary pollutants. They are both emitted directly into the atmosphere, and formed from other pollutants. In the case of nitrogen dioxide some is emitted directly from power stations and vehicle exhaust, while most is formed by the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) in the air. Fine particulate matter is emit- ted directly from a number of natural and anthropogenic sources as well as being formed within the atmosphere. Secondary PMlo is formed mainly from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. A less important source is the reaction of ammonia with hydrochloric acid gas (from the combustion of coal and municipal incineration). In some areas the reactions of hydrocarbons in the air to produce organic particles is an important source of secondary PMlo.   The distinction between primary and secondary pollutants is important for under- standing air pollution and devising pollution abatement strategies. For primary pollutants   AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH Copyright .9 1999 Academic Press ISBN 0-12-352335-4 All rights of re#raduction in any farm reserved   there is a proportional relationship between emissions and ambient concentrations. However, for a secondary pollutant reducing emissions of the precursor does not lead to a proportional reduction in its ambient concentration. For some pollutants in some cir- cumstances a reduction of precursor emissions may lead to an increase in concentrations. This is most notable in the case of urban ozone, where reducing local emissions of nitro- gen oxides can lead to an increase in local ozone concentrations.   Quantitative information on the rate of emission of air pollutants from different sources is vital for the development of appropriate abatement strategies. By identifying the major sources of both primary pollutants and the precursors of secondary pollutants, the best means of improving air quality can be identified. Where there are several measures of varying cost and ease of implementation, pollution control authorities need to know which measure, or package of measures, will be most cost-effective in improving air qual- ity to the desired level.   Annual emission inventories, that is a database of the emissions of primary pollutants from all known sources for a defined geographical area and year, are routinely compiled at national level, and increasingly at the urban level. National emission inventories are used both within a country for prioritizing pollution control measures and internation- ally in the negotiations for pollution control treaties, such as the protocols under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). Urban inventories are an essential input for air quality modelling studies designed to predict the concentration of various air pollutants under different emission reduction scenarios. However, for this purpose the annual inven- tories need to be converted into hourly estimates of emissions and require a fine degree of spatial detail.   These inventories provide the information necessary to identify the main sources of primary pollutants and the precursors of secondary pollutants. Typically they contain information on the amount of pollution released from major industrial plants, road transport, and other sources, and average figures for the emissions from smaller sources throughout the area. Their accuracy depends on the data used to compile them. Emissions of air pollutants are estimated from knowledge of the processes that form them. For some pollutants this is relatively straightforward, as emissions are depend- ent largely on the composition of the fuel. Information on fuel consumption and composition and knowledge of the presence and type of pollution abatement tech- nology is sufficient to produce a good estimate of emissions from many sources. For other pollutants, emissions depend on combustion conditions, such as temperature and pressure, as well as on pollution abatement technology, and are thus more difficult to estimate. Emission inventories for such pollutants are therefore liable to be less accurate.   Emissions from power stations are known fairly accurately as there are a relatively small number of large sources. However, estimating emissions from a large number of small sources is much more difficult and these estimates are less accurate. For example, in the UK there are about 20 million households and 25 million vehicles. The latter pose a particular problem in the estimation of emissions because there are a large number of factors that influence their emissions, including how the vehicles are driven, traffic conditions, types of vehicle and emission control systems fitted.   Inventories can only give an indication of the relative contribution of different sources to ambient concentrations of air pollution. Large point sources tend to emit at a much greater height above the ground than area sources such as road traffic and domestic heating. These lower sources are likely to play a more important role, per tonne emitted, in determining local air quality than those from large point sources. Sources of pollution outside an inventory area may also contribute to pollution within the area.   This chapter discusses the major sources of the main primary air pollutants including the contribution of the different sources to total emissions of a range of pollutants in the European Union (EU), the USA and selected urban areas in the UK. This is followed by a description of how emission inventories are constructed using the UK's National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory as an example. Finally, as road transport is the single most important source of pollution in many urban areas in Europe, North America and elsewhere, the factors influencing their emissions are discussed.   SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION   Introduction   This section briefly describes the main sources of the classical primary air pollutants- SO 2, NO~ (oxides of nitrogen: generally NO 2 + NO), CO, VOCs and PM. In the section on VOCs the sources of two compounds- benzene and 1,3-butadiene- are included. The main sources of ammonia are also described because of its important role in the for- mation of secondary PM. This is followed by a brief description of the main sources of selected persistent organic compounds and metals. Other air pollutants including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20), carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and per- fluorocarbons (PFCs) are not included in this chapter because they are not directly toxic to human health, being principally greenhouse gases. The halocarbons, mainly CFCs, are also responsible for the depletion of stratospheric ozone.   The two main sources of the classical air pollutants are power stations and road trans- port. The contribution of different sources, however, varies between countries and within countries. In the EU in 1994, combustion in energy and transformation industries were responsible for 61% of total SO 2, and 19% of NO~ emissions. Road transport con-tributed 49% of NO~ and 4% of SO 2 (European Environment Agency, 1997a). In the UK the contributions from power stations and road transport were very similar to the EU averages (Department of the Environment, 1996). However, in several Eastern European countries road transport contributes only about 10-20% of the total NO~ emissions (European Environment Agency, 1996), reflecting the lower traffic levels in these countries.   Comparisons between the EU and the USA are not always straightforward as different source categories and methodologies for estimating emissions are used. However, it appears that power stations are a more important source of SO 2 and NO x in the USA than in the EU. In 1994 70% and 33% of the total SO 2 and NO x emissions came from this source, whilst 1% and 32%, respectively, came from road transport (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1995a).   Typically urban areas have a higher contribution from road traffic and a lower contribution from power stations than nationally. This is because most power stations and other large stationary sources are no longer located in cities in developed countries; instead they have been moved to rural locations. For example, in the British conurbations of Greater London, West Midlands and Greater Manchester, road transport was respon- sible for 63-85% of the total NO x emissions in 1995 compared with 46% nationally (National Environmental Technology Centre, 1997).   For the classical pollutants, data are provided in this section on the contribution of dif- ferent sources in USA, EU, UK and the British conurbations of Greater London, West Midlands and Greater Manchester. The main anthropogenic source categories used are those from the CORINAIR* 1994 inventory for Europe with waste treatment and dis- posal; agriculture, forestry and land use changes combined as 'other' sources. Data for the USA, UK and the British conurbations has been roughly fitted into these source cate- gories, and are not strictly comparable. The data are for 1994 except for the British cities, for which the data come from 1995. Despite the different years and the source categories, the tables give a good indication of the relative contribution of the difference sources in different areas.     Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2)   The major source of sulfur dioxide is the combustion of fossil fuels containing sulfur, in particular from power stations burning coal and heavy fuel oil. Natural gas, petrol and diesel fuels have a relatively low sulfur content.   In the past the main source of sulfur dioxide was the burning of coal in homes, facto- ries, offices, schools and other buildings. Today in most Western towns and cities buildings are heated by natural gas and electricity. The latter is generated in large power stations typically situated in rural areas rather than close to towns. There remain, however, a few cities in Western Europe where there are no supplies of natural gas, and coal and heating oil remain important sources of space and water heating.   Table 8.1 shows the relative contributions from these sources to total SO 2 emissions in the USA, EU, UK and selected British cities. Industrial combustion, especially for the generation of electricity, is the dominant source in all areas.   Although road transport is a minor source of sulfur dioxide at the national level, in some urban areas it can be important. Raised concentrations of sulfur dioxide have been detected alongside busy roads. However, as a result of controls on the permitted sulfur levels in automotive fuels introduced in the mid-1990s both in the USA and EU, it is likely that these elevated concentrations at the roadside will disappear. In the EU, further limits on the sulfur content of diesel and petrol have been agreed for the year 2000. These restrictions were not primarily introduced to reduce emissions of SO 2 from road trans- port, but instead to facilitate the reduction in emissions of other pollutants. Sulfur in diesel contributes to the exhaust PM, whilst in petrol it affects the performance of catalytic converters and other components of the pollution control system.   * This is the atmospheric emission inventory of the CORINE (Coordination d'Information Environmentale) programme, set up for the collection of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the EU. Inventories for 1985, 1990 and 1994 have been completed. The 1995 inventory is currently being compiled by the European Environment Agency.

Sources: European Environment Agency (1996), US Environmental Protection Agency (1995a), National Environmental Technology Centre (1997), London Research Centre (1996, 1997, 1998).   Nitrogen Oxides (NO x)   Nitrogen oxides are a key pollutant because their emission leads to elevated concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, and is a precursor of ozone formed in the troposphere. They also con- tribute to the atmospheric fine particulate matter burden as a result of oxidation to form nitrate aerosols.   Nitrogen oxides (NO x) are formed in the atmosphere by lightning, forest fires and bac- terial activity in soils. These sources are important on the global scale but in Europe and North America anthropogenic sources dominate.   NO x is formed during high-temperature combustion, largely from the nitrogen and oxygen present in air, but also from the oxidation of nitrogen contained in fuels. The main sources are internal combustion engines, fossil fuel-fired power stations and industrial combustion. Table 8.2 shows that road transport contributes about one half of all emis- sions in the EU, but considerably more in British urban areas. In the USA industrial combustion is responsible for about half of all emissions.   Almost all NO~ is emitted as nitric oxide (NO) which is then rapidly oxidized to the more toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO2).     Carbon Monoxide (CO)   Most anthropogenic carbon monoxide is generated in combustion processes. Internal combustion engines, both in on-road vehicles and in diverse off-road uses, comprise the   Table 8.2 Estimated contributions of the main sources to total NO x emissions     Source"  Contribution (%)    EU  USA  UK  Greater  West  Greater    London  Midlands  Manchester    Combustion in energy and transformation industries Non-industrial combustion  193324 4 2  5  2 11  {  } 10  {  }  33    Combustion in manufacturing industry Production processes Extraction and distribution of fossil fuels  8{}10 2 16 1  0 4  3 1 0  1 0  1 0    Solvent and other product use Road transport Other mobile sources and machinery Other  0 49 15 1  32 13 3  0 49 7 0  0 75 7 1  0 85 2 3  0 63 3 1      ~These are the main anthropogenic source categories used in the CORINAIR 1994 inventory for Europe (waste treatment and disposal; agriculture, forestry and land use changes have been combined as other).

The majority of the carbon in automotive fuels is oxidized to carbon dioxide, while a small fraction is incompletely oxidized to carbon monoxide. Table 8.3 shows that the contribution of road transport ranges from 62% in the EU and USA to nearly 100% in some urban areas.   Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)   VOCs comprise a wide range of chemical compounds including hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics), oxygenates (alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and ethers) and halogen- containing species. Methane is an important component of VOCs but its environmental impact derives mainly from its contribution to global warming, and it is increasingly being considered separately from the other VOCs. The major environmental impact of non- methane VOCs (NMVOCs) is their role in the formation of tropospheric ozone. The impact of individual VOCs varies considerably. All are precursors of ozone but their ability to form ozone varies markedly. In addition, a few VOCs are considered toxic to human health, such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene. The main sources of these two pollu- tants are described below.   The sources of anthropogenic NMVOCs are more diverse than those of many other pollutants, but predominantly come from solvent use, road transport and industrial processes. This is shown in Table 8.4. Important sources of VOCs from solvent use include surface coatings, glues and adhesives, printing and degreasing. These sources are often difficult to control as there are a large number of mainly small sources. In road trans- port, petrol vehicles without catalysts emit considerably more VOCs than comparable   Table 8.4 Estimated contributions of the main sources to total NMVOC emissions     Source a  Contribution (%)    EU  USA  UK  Greater  West  Greater    London  Midlands  Manchester    Combustion in energy and transformation industries Non-industrial combustion  14  <1( "1 3  02  <10 2  < 1  { } 2    Combustion in manufacturing industry Production processes Extraction and distribution of fossil fuels Solvent and other product use Road transport Other mobile sources and machinery Other  0 6 5 25 32 5 20  ~48~ [ J 27 10 13  0 19 11 31 29 2 5  < 1 <1 11 24 60 2 1  0 <1 3 49 46 <1 1  59 1 14 20 < 1 4      aThese are the main anthropogenic source categories used in the CORINAIR 1994 inventory for Europe (waste treatment and disposal; agriculture, forestry and land use changes have been combined as other).

Emissions from petrol cars with catalysts are similar to those from diesel cars. Important industrial sources for VOC emissions include the chemical industry, food and drink industry, and the storage, han- dling and processing of products (Warren Spring Laboratory, 1993).   Natural sources of NMVOCs can also be important, particularly in summer when ozone pollution episodes occur. Vegetation, primarily forests, emit large amounts of VOCs when temperatures are high. These biogenic emissions consist of a wide variety of species including isoprene, terpenes and oxygenated compounds. Isoprene is the most reactive and has been found to play a significant role in ozone formation in the USA.   Whilst the EU emission inventory includes natural sources, there is considerable uncer- tainty over the results obtained in predicting ozone formation. To undertake air quality modelling of the formation of ozone in Europe using the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program/Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (EMEP MSC-W) ozone model, the emissions of natural NMVOCs have been re-estimated using the 'Biogenic Emissions Inventory System' developed in the US (EMEP, 1994). This takes account of vegetation cover and the effects of temperature and solar radiation on emissions. Estimates on a yearly basis suggest that anthropogenic sources of VOC may be greater than those of isoprene for virtually all European countries. However, this is not always the case on a monthly basis. Isoprene emissions in the hotter countries, e.g. Spain, may exceed anthro- pogenic VOC emissions during the summer months. There remains considerable uncertainty over these estimates of isoprene emissions. It has been suggested that the uncertainties may be as high as a factor of 5-10 during particular ozone episodes. In addi- tion, preliminary estimates suggest that emissions of the so-called 'unidentified' biogenic VOCs may be of the same order as those of isoprene.   Benzene   The main sources of benzene in the atmosphere are the production, distribution and use of automotive fuels. In the UK in 1994 road transport contributed 72% of all benzene emis- sions. In the USA, a greater number of sources contribute to benzene emissions. In 1990, road transport has been estimated to contribute 43%, with off-road vehicles, oil and gas pro- duction, wood burning, forest fires and prescribed burning, e.g. of waste, contributing another 50% (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1996a). In the British conurbations of Greater London, West Midlands and Greater Manchester, road transport was responsible for 82, 99.5 and 93% respectively in 1995 (London Research Centre, 1996, 1997, 1998).   Petrol vehicles emit more benzene in exhaust than diesel vehicles, even when catalytic converters are used to control emissions from petrol cars. Benzene is present in petrol and can evaporate into the air from fuel storage containers and during refuelling. Currently the maximum benzene content of petrol permitted in the EU is 5% by volume, although there is considerable variation across Europe. In the UK it is typically around 2%. In the US the maximum benzene level in reformulated gasoline is 1%. Levels in standard gasoline are not permitted to be higher than those in 1990 when the average level was 1.6%. Benzene is also formed in the combustion process from other aromatics. The aromatic content is not explicitly controlled in either USA or EU automotive fuel specifications, although the EU Fuel Quality Directive will introduce a maximum total aromatic content of between 42% from 2000, and 35% from 2005. It will also introduce a 19% maximum for benzene.             1,3-Butadiene   There are no known natural sources of 1,3-butadiene. It is used as an industrial chemical particularly in the manufacture of synthetic rubber for tyres, and some liquefied petro- leum gas (LPG) contains up to 8% by volume (Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards, 1994). The main source of 1,3-butadiene in the atmosphere is the combustion of petrol and diesel fuel, but some also comes from the burning of other fossil fuels. In the British conurbations it has been estimated that over 95% comes from road transport (London Research Centre, 1996, 1997, 1998). In the USA in 1990, mobile sources (on and off road) were estimated to contribute over 75% of total 1,3-butadiene emissions, the remainder largely coming from forest fires and prescribed burning (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1996a).   Petrol and diesel contains little 1,3-butadiene, but it is formed during combustion in the engine. The exhaust from a petrol car (fitted with a three-way catalyst) contains less 1,3-butadiene than that from a diesel car. This is because catalytic converters are efficient at removing 1,3-butadiene (Quality of Urban Air Review Group, 1993).   In some areas forest fires can be a significant source of 1,3-butadiene in the atmosphere (Pechin and Associates, 1994).     Particulate Matter   Particulate matter is not a single pollutant, but is made up of particles of many different sizes and chemical composition, from a wide range of natural and anthropogenic sources.   The concentration of airborne particles may be measured in several different ways, which is reflected in the way that emissions of particles are estimated. In the past estimates have tended to be of total suspended particles (TSP) and/or black smoke (BS)*, but increasingly estimates of PM10 (particles generally less than 10 ~m aero-dynamic diameter) emissions are being made. In the UK, for example, annual estimates of emissions of both black smoke and PM10 are made, while in the USA, annual emissions of both TSP and PM10 are estimated. For many sources, however, quantify- ing emission rates is extremely difficult. Examples include wind-blown soil, street dust re-suspended by traffic, and sea spray. It is also difficult to define the original source of secondary particles. These are mainly ammonium sulfate and nitrate, arising from the oxidation of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. The acids formed are neutralized in the atmosphere by ammonia. Certain organic compounds can also be precursors to secondary PM.   Table 8.5 shows the contribution of the difference sources to total PM10 emissions in different areas. The US inventory for PM10 shows that the vast majority of emissions do not come from combustion processes, but come from 'other' sources. These are mainly fugitive dust including those formed from paved and unpaved roads, and agriculture and forestry. The European inventories suggest that the dominant source of PM10 is fossil fuel combustion in industry and road transport. This discrepancy arises because   * Black smoke emissions are calculated by multiplying the particle mass by a factor representing the relative blackness of the particles (from 1.0 for coal to 3.0 for diesel particles).

Data for USA, UK and the British conurbations has been fitted to these source categories, and are not strictly comparable. The data is for 1993 for Europe, 1994 for USA, and 1995 for the UK and British cities. The table gives a good indication of the relative contribution of the difference sources in different areas.   Sources: TNO (1997), US Environmental Protection Agency (1995a), National Environmental Technology Centre (1997), London Research Centre (1996, 1997, 1998).   the US inventory includes a number of sources that are difficult to quantify, such as natural wind erosion, which are excluded or treated differently in the European inven- tories.   Fugitive dust emissions and wind erosion together contributed about 75% of the total US 1994 emissions. None of the European inventories includes natural sources, such as sea spray and wind blown dust and re-suspension of dust from roads because of the great uncertainty of the emission rates for these sources. The data used to derive emissions esti- mates for these sources come largely from the USA where the climate is often dryer and natural sources are more important. Direct extrapolation of USA emission estimates to Europe is difficult. Even in the USA, the emission estimates for wind-blown dust and re- suspended road dust have not been regarded as reliable and the methodology for dealing with these sources is currently being revised.   Estimates of emissions of particulate matter due to wind erosion are very sensitive to regional soil conditions and weather. For example, the US EPA have estimated that in 1988 emissions from wind erosion were 16 million tonnes, while in 1994 it was about 2 million tonnes. The lack of precipitation prior to the planting of spring crops, especially in central and western USA, contributed to greater wind erosion (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1995a)   The differences in these PM10 inventories illustrate the need to use consistent method- ologies if comparisons between different areas are to be made.   Airborne PM10 is often divided into fine and coarse PM10. Fine particles are often regarded to be the PM2. 5 fraction (i.e. those particles with an aerodynamic diameter gen- erally less than 2.5 pm) and the coarse particles to be PM10_2.5. The major sources of the fine particles are fossil fuel combustion, vegetation burning, and the smelting or other processing of metals. Secondary PM are also fine particles. The coarse particles typically contain aluminosilicate and other oxides of crustal elements, and is mainly fugitive dust from roads, industry, agriculture, construction and demolition, and fly ash from fossil fuel combustion.   Table 8.6 shows the contribution of different source to the total emissions of PM of three different sizes (PM10, PM2. 5 and PM0.1) in Europe for 1993 (TNO, 1997). The total mass of PM0.1 is estimated to be an order of magnitude less than that of PM10 and the contribution from road transport and industrial processes is much higher. The contribu- tion from stationary combustion sources is much lower. Road transport is the single most important source of the very fine primary particles.   Table 8.6 Estimated contributions of the main sources ofPM10, PM2. 5, and PM0.1 emissions in Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union) in 1993     Source  Contribution (%)    PM10  PM2. 5  PM0.1    Power generation  29  32  17    Industrial combustion  14  11  5    Small combustion sources  13  11  7    Production processes  14  15  24    Road transport  17  20  41    Other mobile sources  1  1  3    Agriculture  9  8  0    Waste processing plants  2  3  4    Total (kt)  4 800  2 700  390    Source: TNO (1997).      Emission inventories can provide reasonably good estimates of particle emissions from fuel combustion and industry, but a different approach is needed to quantify the role of secondary PM and fugitive sources such as re-suspended road dust, wind-blown dust and sea spray. For this, receptor modelling techniques have been used. These are based on investigating the chemical composition of the PM, and the relationships between the different PM components and gaseous pollutants, using meteorological data to infer sources.   In the UK, various approaches to source apportionment have led to the view that there are three principal sources of PM10 in British cities: road traffic, secondary PM and re-sus- pended surface dusts and soils. Construction and demolition activities can be important sources locally (Deacon et al., 1997). In the winter, episodes of elevated PM10 concen- trations are associated mainly with vehicle exhaust emissions, while in the summer there is a greater contribution from secondary PM (Quality of Urban Air Review Group, 1996). At a site in Birmingham where both PM10 and PM2. 5 are measured, PM2. 5 con- tributes about 80% of the PM10 in the winter months. In the summer there is a far larger contribution from larger particles, with PM10_2. 5 contributing on average almost half the PM10.   Most of the PM10 from road transport comes from diesel vehicles. Cars running on leaded petrol can also be an important source, particularly in Europe where a significant number of cars still use this fuel.   Similar source apportionment techniques used in the USA suggest that in western states fugitive dust, motor vehicles and wood smoke are the major sources of airborne PM, while in the eastern states stationary combustion and fugitive dust are the main sources (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1995c).   Attempts have been made in the USA to produce an emission inventory including both primary emissions and secondary formation of particles. Pechin and Associates (1994) have estimated that secondary PM2. 5 exceeds primary PM2. 5 emissions by a factor of four.   Ammonia   Little is known about the sources of ammonia and their emission rates compared with our knowledge of some of the other gaseous pollutants. The main source is believed to be agri- culture, mainly livestock wastes, with a small contribution from fertilizer application. Industrial processes are also thought to be a significant source. Other sources such as uncultivated soils, human respiration and traffic are generally considered to be small. It has been suggested that low-temperature combustion, for example domestic bonfires and decaying vegetation, may make a significant contribution.   The spatial distribution of ammonia emissions is quite different from those of SO 2 and NO~, reflecting the distribution of livestock, particularly cattle. Ammonia emissions have increased in recent decades with more intensive husbandry.   In the EU in 1994 it is estimated that 95% of the ammonia emissions were from agri- culture, with road transport, waste treatment and production processes contributing to the other 5% (European Environment Agency, 1997a). In the UK, non-agricultural sources are estimated to contribute about 12.5 per cent of the total emissions. Within the agri- culture sector cattle are estimated to contribute 50% of the total emission, pigs and poultry 10% each, and sheep 5%. The remainder comes from the use of fertilizers. The total emission in the UK in 1995 was estimated to be 320 kt. This estimate is very uncertain and research to improve it suggests that the figure may need to be revised downwards (National Environmental Technology Centre, 1997).     Persistent Organic Compounds   Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)   Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemical compounds with two or more fused aromatic rings. Their major source is the incomplete combustion of organic mate- rial. They are emitted in both the vapour phase and absorbed onto particles. There are few data available on the emissions from different sources and, according to the UK National Atmospheric Emission Inventory, estimates are only accurate to within an order of mag- nitude (National Environmental Technology Centre, 1997).   PAHs and their derivatives come mainly from stationary sources, particularly wood burning (residential heating and wild fires), open tyre burning, coal combustion and pri- mary aluminium production. In the UK in 1994 nearly half was estimated to come from domestic combustion of coal and wood, a quarter from non-combustion industrial processes and a quarter from road transport. In a US Environmental Protection Agency (1996b) estimate of emissions of seven PAHs the major sources identified were residen- tial wood burning, forest fires and prescribed burning, together contributing 75% of the total emissions. In an estimate of emissions of 16 PAHs residential wood burning and gasoline distribution contributed 75% of the total emissions.   Dioxins   The main source of dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, PCDD) and furans (polychlorinated dibenzofurans, PCDF) is the combustion of chlorine-containing compounds. In particular, the incineration of municipal solid waste at insufficient temperatures is thought to be the major source of these compounds. Other potential sources include vehicles, domestic and industrial coal combustion.   In the UK in 1993 the largest source of dioxins and furans was waste incineration, which accounted for 75% of the total emissions (National Environmental Technology Centre, 1997). A 1990 US inventory of dioxins (adjusted to the toxic equivalent of 2,3,7,8-TCDD) showed that waste incineration (municipal, medical and other biologi- cal incineration) contributed a similar percentage of total emissions (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1996b).   Polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs)   PCBs were made industrially from 1929 until the late 1970s for use in electrical trans- formers and capacitors. They were also used in carbon-less papers and inks. Although they are no longer manufactured, PCBs continue to be emitted into the atmosphere from PCB-filled transformers and capacitors still in use, the scrapping of redundant PCB- contaminated electrical goods, and during the recycling of contaminated scrap metal.   Metals   Lead   There are several natural sources of lead in the atmosphere including weathering of rocks, volcanic activity and the uptake and subsequent release by plants. Other natural sources include sea spray, wind-blown dust and forest fires.   The major source of lead in the urban atmosphere is road traffic. Since the 1920s lead compounds have been added to petrol to improve its performance. This source is declining as a result of the increased use of unleaded petrol (which is not completely lead-free) and a reduction in the maximum permitted level in leaded petrol. Although emissions have declined by 80% since 1970, road transport is still responsible for about 75% of all emissions in the UK (National Environment Technology Centre, 1997). This will decline as the new EU Fuel Quality Directive essentially bans its use in petrol from the year 2000. Lead is also released into the atmosphere during the mining and smelting of ores, the production, use, recycling and disposal of lead-containing products and the burning of fossil fuels and wood.   Other metals   There are trace amounts of many metals in the atmosphere from natural processes such as the weathering of rocks, wind erosion and suspension of soils, and volcanic activity.   There are three main anthropogenic sources of metals in the atmosphere: burning of fossil fuels, waste incineration and the metal production and processing industries. The relative importance of each varies with the different metals emitted.   The burning of fossil fuels is an anthropogenic source of antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, vana- dium and zinc. Waste incineration is important for cadmium and mercury, while the smelting of metals is an important source for arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc. Chromium and manganese come from processes involved in the production of iron and steel.   In urban areas, close to busy roads, vehicle tyre and component wear can be a signifi- cant source of a range of metals including platinum released from catalysts.   ESTIMATING EMISSIONS     Introduction   It is not possible to measure emissions from all sources, or even from all the different source types. In practice, estimates of atmospheric emissions are based on the results of measurements made at selected or representative samples of the main source categories. The methodologies used to estimate emissions are constantly being refined and improved.   In an inventory area there will often be millions of individual sources of pollution. Emissions are calculated, generally from a measure of activity of sources related to the emissions. These are typically fuel consumption for stationary sources and distance travelled for mobile sources. Emission factors, derived from measurements of individual or representative sources, are then multiplied by the appropriate statistic, to give the emission rate:   Emission rate = Chosen statistic • Emission factor   For many pollutants the major source of emission is the combustion of fossil fuels. Consequently fuel consumption statistics are widely used in the estimation of emissions. When using fuel consumption statistics it is important that consumption data rather than delivery data are used, as fuels are often stockpiled or used outside the inventory area. The latter is particularly important when considering aviation emissions. Most emission inven- tories only consider aircraft activity during landing and take-off cycles and exclude cruising emissions. The rate of emission is greatest during the landing and take-off cycles and thus of most relevance to air quality.   Emissions from sources such as industrial processes, gas pipelines, and solvent and petrol evaporation require different types of activity statistics. These might be process output, or sales of a product. For some industrial processes emission estimates are based on an emission measurement over a period of time and the number of such periods that occur in the required estimation period.   In practice, the calculation of emissions tends to be more complicated than outlined above but the principles remain the same. Of all the sectors, estimating road transport emissions is the most complex as emissions come from such a large number of different sources, each with different emission characteristics depending on vehicle and fuel tech- nology, and on how the vehicle is maintained and driven. The approach used is described later in this chapter.   Emission inventories may contain data for three types of sources:   .9   line sources including roads and railways;     .9   area sources including space and water heating for buildings;     .9   point sources, typically large power stations or industrial plant.       In some inventories, emissions from line sources are included separately along the line of the road, railway track, etc. In other inventories, line sources are included in area sources. Area sources are generally defined as those sources that individually emit relatively little but collectively result in significant emissions. In an emissions inventory these small or dif- fuse sources are averaged over a defined area, which may be a local administrative area (e.g. District Council area in the UK) or a regular grid (for example the EMEP 50 • 50 km grid).   For point sources emission estimates are provided for each individual plant or emission source within a plant, usually in conjunction with data on location, capacity or through- put, operating conditions, etc. The tendency is for more sources to be included as point sources as legislative requirements extend to more source types and pollutants and open- ness provides more such relevant data. Many inventories have suffered from authorities refusing to divulge confidential industrial information.   The detailed methodology used in constructing inventories depends on the availabil- ity of suitable information. In some countries data are readily available; in others, there are few reliable data available and many assumptions have to be made. Often, emission fac- tors developed in other countries are used; this may or may not be appropriate.   As more information becomes available inventories have become more reliable. Figure   8.1 shows how estimates of NO x emissions for the UK for the year 1980 have changed as a result of refinements to the inventory methodology. The x-axis gives the year in which revisions to the methodology where introduced, and the y-axis shows the resulting change in estimated emissions.   3000   2500   2000. .

UK's National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI)   The UK's National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI) is briefly described below to illustrate some of the factors taken into account when constructing emission inven- tories. Details of the NAEI inventory is given in UK Emissions of Air Pollutants 1970-1995 (National Environmental Technology Centre, 1997). It currently covers more than 30 pollutants including all the classical air pollutants, PAHs, PCBs, and a selection of halocarbons, pesticides and heavy metals. Where possible, estimates are made for the period 1970 to 1995, but for some pollutants there is insufficient infor- mation to produce an annual time-series. In this summary of the NAEI methodology only the main classical pollutants are discussed. The report gives details of the emission factors used. A database of emission factors for the main industrial and transport sources used in compiling emission inventories for British cities is also available from the London Research Centre's web page (http://www.london-research.gov.uk). Information for compiling other inventories is available from the US Environmental Protection Agency (1995b), IPCC/UNEP! OECD/IEA (1995) and EMEP/CORI- NAIR (1996).   In the NAEI, emissions for most sectors/pollutants are estimated from fuel consump-   tion figures for each fuel and economic sector. For non-combustion sources estimates of   emissions are based on knowledge of individual sources, obtained largely from UK   research. The NAEI is reported in the EMEP/CORINAIR format, which is less detailed   than the original NAEI categories used to calculate the emissions.   The inventory is divided into a number of modules for different types of source. In this   chapter the description of the NAEI focuses on those sources that contribute significantly   to emissions of the classical pollutants, and ignores those sources which are major sources   of the greenhouse gases such as methane (e.g. gas leakage and landfill).   Stationary combustion   In NAEI the base combustion module is used to estimate emissions from the majority of" stationary sources including:   .9   domestic     .9   public service     .9   refineries     .9   iron and steel     .9   other industry     .9   gas production     .9   agriculture.       The base combustion module uses the following equation to calculate emissions:   E(p, s, f) = A(s, f) • e(p, s, f)   where E(p, s, f) is the emission of pollutant p from source s from the combustion of fuel f (kg); A(s, f) is the combustion of fuel f in sources (kg or therms); and e(p, s, f) is the   emission factor of pollutant p from source s from combustion of fuel f   The emissions factors are expressed in terms of kg pollutant/t for solid and liquid fuels and g/therm for gases. For gases, NAEI factors are based on the gross calorific value of   the fuel, not the net calorific value as in some other inventories (e.g. CORINAIR and   IPCC).   For power stations the NO x emissions from coal and oil combustion are based on esti- mates from individual power stations, and are not based on estimates from fuel consumption. Emission estimates for coal-fired plant include those from the fuel oil used to light up the boilers. For PM10, the emission estimates of the operators are used where available. These take account of the operation of electrostatic precipitators. Where these data are incomplete, emission rates for the appropriate fuel are used. Included in the power station category are emissions from generators using landfill and sewage gas.   The emission from the production of fuels requires careful allocation between the process that produces the fuel and the final burning of the fuel. In the NAEI the carbon content of the coal, or coke, consumed in the conversion processes, and the carbon con- tent of the product (e.g. coke, blast furnace gas, town gas) is calculated to give an estimate of the carbon emissions during the process. Emissions of other pollutants are estimated from a factor reflecting the ratio of the total carbon input to the process to the amount of carbon emitted.   Industrial Processes   For industrial processes emission factors are typically based on the mass of emission per mass of product. For example, estimates of emissions of NO x from the manufacture of nitric acid use an emission factor of 3.98 t per kt of 100% acid produced.   There are a very large number of processes which emit NMVOCs. Even within a single industry the variation in the processes used and the extent and type of abatement techniques used make it difficult to apply a single emission factor. Often emissions from sources are small individually, but important collectively. In addition, many different com- pounds are released into the atmosphere, and measurement techniques may not respond equally well to all compounds.   In the NAIE NMVOC emissions are estimated for the following industries:   .9   oil refineries     .9   iron and steel     .9   road construction     .9   chemical industry     .9   bread baking     .9   alcoholic beverages     .9   other food       The NAEI estimates of NMVOC emissions have poor precision because data for some individual processes and solvent use are incomplete. The UK total NMVOC emissions are currently estimated to be precise to _+50%.   Offshore Oil and Gas   The emission factors used in calculating emissions from offshore oil and gas exploitation are based on emissions per platform or per terminal. These are based on work commis- sioned by the UK Offshore Operators Association.   Construction   The NAIE estimates the order of magnitude of annual emission of PM10 from construc- tion sites. In 1995 this was 0.5-8.3 kt. Difficulties in estimating these emissions do not allow a greater degree of precision. The emissions depend on the size of site, the amount of construction and traffic activity on the site, and on the weather conditions. Material carried outside the site and deposited on nearby roads may be entrained either by passing traffic or the wind and may become a significant local source. The NAEI uses data on the number of houses and the amount of commercial and industrial floor-space constructed each year, as well as construction time, to make an estimate of the total area under construction.   An emission factor for total particulate emissions of 2.69 t/ha has been suggested from an American study (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1995b). Assuming that only 20% of TSP is PM10, this gives an emission factor of 0.538 t/(ha month). The number of days in the UK with rain is about 150 to 200 per year, suggesting that the emission factor should be no more than half that derived from US measurements, where there is a con- siderably drier climate. These factors together produce an estimate of the annual PM10 emissions in the range 0.5-8.3 kt.   Solvent use   NMVOC emissions for solvent use are estimated for the following sectors:   .9   decorative paint     .9   industrial coating     .9   film coating     .9   surface cleaning     .9   dry cleaning     .9   agrochemicals     .9   printing     .9   industrial adhesives     .9   aerosols     .9   non-aerosol consumer products     .9   seed oil extraction     .9   leather coating     .9   leather degreasing     .9   textile coating manufacture     .9   rubber goods manufacture     .9   wood impregnation     .9   other solvent use.       The emission estimates are largely based on data on the use of solvents supplied by the rel- evant industry associations and manufacturers. As noted above, there is great uncertainty about the NMVOC emission estimates because of missing data from solvent use and some industrial processes.   Road Transport   For road transport the emissions of CO2, SO 2 and black smoke are estimated from petrol and diesel consumption. The sulfur dioxide emissions factors vary annually and are based on the sulfur content of the fuels. Estimates of black smoke emissions are derived using soiling factors for different fuels. For example, emissions from diesel combustion are considered three times more, and from petrol combustion 0.43 less dark per unit mass than coal smoke. Emissions of these pollutants can be broken down by vehicle type based on their estimated fuel consumption.   The emissions of NO x, CO and NMVOC are calculated from emission factors based on performance rather than fuel consumption. Emissions from cold starts, hot engines and evaporative losses are each calculated separately.   Emissions from motor vehicles depend on the emission regulations in force when they were built, the type of vehicle and the fuel used. For estimating the hot emissions, that is those from a fully warmed up engine, an estimate of the number of vehicle kilometres driven by each vehicle type on each road type are needed. This is then multiplied by the appropriate emission factor to give the hot emission estimate. This requires the following information:   .9   Vehicle kilometres driven, split into four road types:     .9   urban     .9   rural single carriageway     .9   rural dual carriageway     .9   motorway         .9   Vehicle categories:     .9   cars (split into petrol and diesel)     .9   light goods vehicles (split into petrol and diesel)     .9   heavy duty vehicles (spit into small and large according to number of axles)     .9   buses and coaches     .9   motorcycles         .9   Vehicle type split, that is the number in each vehicle class built to each regulation:       .9 petrol cars  pre ECE    ECE 15.00    ECE 15.01    ECE 15.02    ECE 15.03    ECE 15.04    EC Stage 1 (current three-way catalyst)    .9 diesel cars  Pre EC stage 1    EC Stage 1    .9 petrol LGV  Pre EC stage 1    EC Stage 1    .9 diesel LGV  Pre EC stage 1    EC Stage 1    .9 small HGV  Old    Pre EC Stage 1      EC stage 1    .9 large HGV  Old    Pre EC Stage 1    EC stage 1    .9 buses & coaches  Old    Pre EC Stage 1    EC stage 1    .9 motorcycles  Current <50 cc    Current > 50 cc 2-stroke    Current > 50 cc 4-stroke    .9 Emission factors      The vehicle type split is produced from data on vehicle sales and the age distribution of vehicles on the road using a fleet model. This gives, for each year, the fraction of each type of vehicle in the fleet that were made to each regulation.   For petrol cars, account is taken of the decrease in annual mileage with increasing vehicle age.   The emission factors are based on measurements of emissions from vehicles, mainly using on-road measurements. The units are g/km driven for each type of vehicle. There are large variations from vehicle to vehicle (of the same order as the measurements them- selves), and the emissions factors used in calculations are means of the measured emissions. For some groups of vehicles, e.g. buses and motorcycles, there are few data and the uncertainties are large.   The emission factors include a number of implicit assumptions. For example, the impact of load and road gradient on emissions from goods vehicles are not explicitly included. It is also assumed that the vehicles are not grossly abused.   The methodology for estimating road transport emissions is most advanced for cars. The results of emission measurements from a large number of cars have been used to pro- duce speed-emission curves for different technology cars (see next section). Data on the vehicle-speed distribution for each of the four road types is combined with the appro- priate point on the speed emission curve, to give an estimate of emissions from all cars driven on each type of road. The emissions from all vehicles and road types are then summed to give total emissions. The emissions from other forms of road transport are not so well known and single emission factors for each road type are used.   When an engine is cold its emissions are greater than when it has warmed up. Cold start emission factors are derived from the difference in emissions measured from cars with cold and warmed up engines. These tests are usually undertaken at a temperature of about 25~ and so do not take account of the effect of ambient temperature on cold start emis- sions, which is known to be significant. The number of cold starts is estimated from information on the average trip length and the total number of vehicle kilometres. This gives the number of trips, and it is assumed that two-thirds of these are from cold. The number of cold starts is estimated from this and multiplied by the extra cold start emis- sion. Cold start emission factors are included for diesel cars and light goods vehicles but are unavailable for heavy goods vehicles and buses.   Evaporative emissions of NMVOC are based on an emission factor of 5.9 g/kg fuel. This factor is applied to all petrol used in the UK and is considered to be appropriate for the temperatures and fuel volatility found in the UK. This does not take account of seasonal changes in fuel volatility, ambient temperature nor of the use of abatement tech- nology such as carbon canisters.   Estimating PM10 from road transport is done slightly differently than for the other pol- lutants. For petrol cars and light goods vehicles the emission factors depend on whether the vehicle is run on leaded or unleaded petrol and whether it is fitted with a three-way catalyst. The same value is used irrespective of road type. For diesel vehicles emission factors are based on measurement data as for the other pollutants.   Aircraft   Aircraft emissions are estimated for landing and take-off and flight up to a height of about 1000 m. This roughly represents the boundary layer and the emissions into it. The emis- sions are estimated from the number of aircraft movements at British airports and emission factors derived from studies at Heathrow and Gatwick airports.   Other Mobile Sources   Emissions from the other mobile sources: railways, coastal shipping and fishing are esti- mate using the base combustion module as described in the section above on stationary combustion.   Off-road sources were explicitly included in the NAEI in 1995 for the first time. Prior to that these emissions were included under other sectors. As emissions from other sources are declining these uncontrolled sources are beginning to make a significant contribution to total emissions of some pollutants. These include a range of mobile equipment pow- ered by diesel or petrol fuelled engines including agricultural equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters, construction equipment such as bulldozers and excavators, lawn mowers, aircraft support equipment, and industrial machines such as portable generators and compressors. The 1995 estimates are based on a modification of the methodology given in EMEP/CORINAIR (1996).   Precision of Emission Estimates   The current state-of-the-art inventory methodologies still require many assumptions and extrapolation of data, and thus there remains considerable uncertainty over the estimated total emissions. For some pollutants the uncertainty is much greater than for others.   Table 8.7 shows the estimated precision of the UK NAIE. It is necessary to make assumptions about emissions due to the insufficient measurement of emissions from industrial plants and motor vehicles. For example, the results of short measuring pro- grammes are often used to infer annual average emissions. Fuel consumption statistics are often inaccurate because of the common practice of reporting deliveries rather than con- sumption. In addition, there can be considerable uncertainty in the secondary data used. For example, vehicle kilometres are derived from sample surveys of road traffic which are themselves subject to uncertainties.

FORECASTING EMISSIONS   It is often useful to be able to forecast how emissions may change in coming years, both for 'business as usual' scenarios and for various pollution abatement scenarios. In partic- ular, this allows the impact of potential new abatement measures to be assessed and the likelihood of meeting pre-defined targets (such as targets in the Protocols to CLRTAP) to be determined.   Levels of economic activity, demographic influences and the use of abatement measures all affect the trends in anthropogenic emissions of air pollution. Up until the 1950s emissions tended to grow as the economy (and population) increased and to decline in periods of recession. Since then the relationship between economic growth and emissions has become more complex as many processes and products have become more energy effi- cient, and a wide range of abatement techniques have been utilized. In addition, consumer choice of products has also influenced emissions. For example, the change from coal to gas and electricity for space and water heating played an important role in reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke in London from the 1960s onwards. In countries such as France, with high usage of diesel cars*, the emissions of PM are higher than in countries with similar traffic levels, but where diesel cars are less popular.   The prediction of future emissions requires forecasts of how the relevant activity statistic and emission factors will change over time: official government forecasts of energy use and traffic levels are often used. For example, in the UK the national road transport forecasts are used to forecast future transport emissions. Some emission forecasting models incor- porate modules which can define future demand for travel, goods, etc. based on factors such as gross domestic product (GDP), population and household size. An example of the latter is the FOREMOVE model developed by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for the European Commission for forecasting future road transport emissions.   Emission forecasting models must take account of both mandatory and voluntary changes in processes and product specifications as these may influence emissions. The impact of such measures can be difficult to estimate. For example, technology used to meet new emissions standards for cars which have been agreed by the legislators but not yet introduced into the marketplace may affect the cold start emissions, hot emissions, or both. The allocation of the emission benefits between these types of emission is often fairly   *About half of new cars in France run on diesel.   arbitrary. Typically, emissions estimates for future technology vehicles are reduced in pro- portion to the emission limits for current and future vehicles.   HARMONIZATION OF INVENTORY METHODOLOGIES   The construction of emission inventories requires detailed information about each source, including its level of activity, the composition of the fuel used, and the impact of any pol- lution abatement technology, as outlined above in the description of the NAEI. When there are literally millions of sources this is not a trivial exercise, and different countries have over a number of years developed their own estimation methodologies. The adoption of international agreements requiring the reporting of national emissions, such as CLRTAP and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, has led to the need to develop consistent methodologies to ensure that realistic comparisons of emissions from different countries can be made.   In Europe the European Environment Agency (EEA) oversees the collation of data for the CORINAIR inventory. This is the atmospheric emissions inventory of the CORINE programme, set up to gather, coordinate and ensure consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Union. CORINAIR currently covers 27 countries both within and outside the European Union and eight pol- lutants (SO 2, NO x, NMVOCs, NH 3, CO, CH 4, N20 and CO2). The inventory includes 260 source categories at different levels of detail. The establishment of a common European methodology has been evolving over the past 15 years, beginning in 1983 with an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED) project to produce an inventory for 17 member countries. In 1985 the European Commission's Environment Directive (DGXI) funded the compilation of an emission inventory for the 12 Member States for 1980 and 1983. The inventory covered SO 2, NO x, VOC and par- ticulate matter. The first CORINAIR inventory was for 1985 covering SO2, NO x and VOCs. Subsequently, emission inventories for 1990 and 1994 have been compiled with the intention of producing an annual inventory for Europe. The 1995 CORINAIR inventory is being compiled as this chapter is being written.   The Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP), formed by a Protocol under CLRTAP, has, with the EEA, produced guidelines for estimation and reporting of emission data in 1996 (EMEP/CORINAIR). Reporting of emission data to the Executive Body of the Convention is required to fulfil obligations regarding strategies and policies in compliance with the implementation of Convention's Protocols. Parties are required to submit annual national emissions of SO 2, NO,c, NMVOC, CH 4, CO and NH 3 using the 11 main source categories agreed with CORINAIR by 31 December following each year. Parties are also required to provide EMEP periodically with emission data within a defined 50 • 50 km grid. This is used as input to integrated assessment models such as the Regional Air Pollution Information and Simulation (RAINS) model developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, Austria) which is used to pre- dict the impact of emission reduction strategies on acidification, eutrophication (excessive deposition of nitrates) and tropospheric ozone concentrations across Europe.   The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories was published in   1995 (IPCC/UNEP/OECD/IEA, 1995). This lays down a common framework for reporting emissions. It recognizes that IPCC needs to accommodate other existing inven- tory programmes and gives information on how to convert from a CORINAIR inventory to an IPCC one. The IPCC Guidelines contain default methodologies and assumptions for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Users are encouraged to use these only when national data are not available. Methodologies for estimating all anthro- pogenic emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 are described in detail, and background information is provided on the estimation of emissions of N20 and tropospheric ozone precursors, i.e. CO, NO x and NMVOC.       FACTORS INFLUENCING ROAD TRANSPORT EMISSIONS   The major source of air pollution in most urban areas in developed countries, and increas- ingly in developing countries, is road transport. Due to the importance of this source in terms of urban air quality, factors which influence emissions from this source are briefly described in this section.   As discussed above, in urban areas the contribution to total emissions from road transport is generally greater than indicated by national emission data. This is because there is typically more traffic and less industry in urban areas. To develop effective control strategies for reduc- ing urban emissions it is important to know which type of vehicles contribute most to the total road traffic emissions. Table 8.8 shows the relative contribution of seven categories of vehicle in London. Petrol cars are the single most important source of CO, NO x and NMVOC, while lorries are an important source of SO 2 and PM10. These vehicles are also an important source of NO x, contributing about a quarter of all emissions in London.   Table 8.8 Percentage contribution of different types of vehicles to total emissions in London in 1995   Source Contribution (%)   CO NO x SO 2 PMlo NMVOC   Cars (petrol) 88 42 4 11 53 Cars (diesel) < 1 2 2 5 < 1 Vans (petrol) 4 3 < 1 1 2 Vans (diesel) < 1 2 2 5 1 Lorries 1 23 12 50 2 Buses 3 4 2 6 <1 Motorcycles 1 < 1 < 1 < 1 2 Total road transport 97 75 23 78 60   Source: London Research Centre (1998).   In London the majority of cars are petrol fuelled, whilst virtually all lorries are diesel fuelled. High emissions of CO and VOC are characteristic of petrol cars without three- way catalytic converters (these were not mandatory in the UK until January 1993, so the majority on the road in 1995 were non-catalyst cars). PM10 production is characteristic of diesel fuelled vehicles. The higher emissions of sulfur dioxide from lorries compared with cars is due to diesel containing more sulfur than petrol.   For many vehicles little is known about their on-road emissions under real-world con- ditions. For heavy duty vehicles much of the emission testing has been carried out using engines on bench dynamometers rather than in vehicles. This is because heavy duty engines can be used for a variety of applications, and the end use of an engine is often not known when it is manufactured. As a consequence, the legislation controlling emissions requires tests to be carried out using bench dynamometers. However, a number of emis- sions testing laboratories have recently acquired chassis dynamometers for use with large vehicles such as lorries and buses, and better data are becoming available. In addition there has been some on-road testing of emissions from large vehicles.   Technology   Probably the greatest influence on emissions from road transport is the technology used in the construction of the vehicle. Over the past 30 years emissions from road vehicles have been controlled by increasingly stringent legislation. Today, emissions of the main gaseous pollutants from petrol cars are less than 1% of the levels emitted before emissions legislation was introduced around 1970. Even now, with the use of controlled three-way catalysts on all new cars in the US and EU, further reductions in emissions are possible through improvements to the combustion process, and increasing the efficiency and durability of the catalyst. Most of the emissions during the regulatory driving cycles occur during the first few minutes when the catalyst is warming up. A number of tech- niques including close coupled catalysts (i.e. situated close to the engine) and electrically heated catalysts have been developed to reduce these emissions.   The improvements in emissions from diesel vehicles have been less dramatic. There is a trade-offbetween measures to improve combustion efficiency, which reduce PM emis- sion, and those that reduce NO x emissions. Three-way catalysts cannot be used on diesel vehicles because there is too much oxygen in the exhaust for the reduction of NO x to nitrogen to occur. It has been suggested that PM emissions should be reduced using post- combustion after-treatment, such as particle traps, and that engine technology improvements be devoted to reducing the NO x emissions. Although there have been many successful field trials with particle traps, they have not generally been widely adopted. They have been used mostly in countries where diesel oil with very low levels of sulfur is widely available (e.g. Sweden).   There are some significant differences in the emissions from the two types of diesel technology currently used. Indirect injection (IDI) diesel engines are used mainly for light duty vehicles, whilst direct injection technology (DI) is used mainly for heavy duty vehi- cles. The fuel consumption of DI engines is less than IDI, but the NO~ and PM emissions and noise are higher. Much effort is being devoted by motor manufacturers to reduce the emissions of small DI engines. Currently in Europe these vehicles are allowed to emit more than their IDI counterparts, but this derogation is due to be removed by the turn of the century.   The method of aspiration also has a significant impact on emissions. Turbo-charging reduces emissions of CO, NO x and PM compared with naturally aspirated diesel engines.   Large reductions in NO x emissions from diesel vehicles are likely to depend on the development of a DeNO x catalyst capable of efficiently removing NO x in an oxygen- rich environment. DeNO~ devices are being developed, and are currently produced by some Japanese car makers, but have yet to prove to be both durable and to have high emission removal efficiency for long periods in service in other countries. In Japan they have been fitted to vehicles with direct injection gasoline engines (a new form of lean-burn petrol engine). This technique has the advantage of improved fuel consumption, but as the combustion runs lean, three-way catalysts cannot be used to reduce emissions. Current DeNO x catalysts do not have a very high efficiency compared with three-way catalysts. Prototype DeNO x catalysts that are more efficient tend to be more sensitive to sulfur in the fuel. Japanese petrol has very low sulfur compared with petrol in the USA and EU, and with diesel. To obtain large reductions in NO x, DeNO x catalyst technology requires very low sulfur fuel to be widely available.   Increasing fuel efficiency of cars is very important, especially in Europe, where legisla- tors are putting increasing pressure on motor manufacturers to improve the fuel consumption of their products to reduce CO 2 emissions. This may encourage a move towards DI diesel engines for cars. Similar pressures are driving petrol technology in the same direction, such that in the next decade direct injection petrol cars may become relatively commonplace. At least one Japanese manufacturer has a direct injection petrol car on the European market.     Fuel   Two types of internal combustion engine are used in road vehicles: spark ignition (petrol) and compression ignition (diesel). Petrol engines are generally used in motorcycles, passenger cars and vans, while diesel engines are used in all types of vehicle except motor- cycles. In the USA and some European countries, such as Sweden, there are few diesel cars in use. In other European countries, diesel cars have become very popular in recent years. In France, half of all new cars sold use diesel, and in the UK sales have increased from under 6% in 1990 to around 20% by the mid-1990s. It is not thought that the popular- ity of diesel cars in the UK will reach that in France and there is some evidence that the proportion of diesel powered new cars is declining.   Comparison between Diesel and Petrol   Diesel cars have lower emissions of the gaseous regulated pollutants (CO, NO x and VOC) than petrol cars without catalysts, and evaporative emissions are low. However, they have significantly higher emissions of PM. Emissions from petrol cars are dramatically reduced using three-way catalytic converters (TWC). In comparison with TWC cars, diesel cars emit more NO x, but less CO and VOC. They also emit less CO 2.   PM emissions from petrol cars are not routinely measured, and are not controlled in either EU or US emissions legislation. The mass of particles emitted from diesel cars may be more than an order of magnitude higher than those from petrol cars with three-way catalysts. PM emissions from cars running on leaded petrol are greater than from those using unleaded petrol (without a catalyst), as the lead contributes to the PM burden of the exhaust.   A recent UK study investigating emissions of particles from vehicles of different tech- nologies suggests that for light duty vehicles the different technologies can be ranked, based on PM emissions, as follows (ETSU, 1997):   old technology IDI diesel> DI with catalyst -old technology IDI with particulate trap >current IDI diesel>>non-catalyst petrol with leaded petrol>catalyst petrol   Many different VOC species are emitted from vehicle exhausts and each exhibits a dif- ferent toxicity and photochemical ozone creation potential. Petrol cars tend to emit more of the lighter VOCs (C1-C 6) while diesel cars emit more heavier VOCs (C13+)(Quality of Urban Air Review Group, 1993). Benzene emissions are about three times higher from petrol cars with catalysts than from diesel, while toluene emissions are an order of magnitude higher. Aldehyde emissions are higher from diesel cars. The carcinogens 1,3- butadiene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are, however, present in higher concentrations in diesel exhaust than in that from a petrol car with a catalyst. A compar- ison of emissions from petrol and diesel cars, with and without catalysts, is given in Table 8.9.

Source: Quality of Urban Air Review Group, 1993   Reformulated Fuels   The relationships between fuel properties, engine performance and exhaust emissions are often complex. There may be trade-offs in that changes in the fuel composition to bene- fit one pollutant may have an adverse effect on others. It can also be difficult to isolate the effect on emissions of one fuel parameter from others. For example, reducing PAHs in diesel reduces emissions of these compounds. However, these compounds increase the fuel density and the effect may be due to this physical change.   In recent years there have been two major collaborative programmes between the oil and motor industries to investigate these effects. The first, the US Auto Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program (AQIRP), concentrated on petrol, while the European Programme on Emissions, Fuels and Engine Technologies (EPEFE) investigated both petrol and diesel properties.   EPEFE (ACEA/EUROPlA) showed that the key parameters affecting emissions from   diesel vehicles are sulfur, cetane number, density and the amount of polycyclic aromatic compounds in the fuel. There is general agreement that there is a linear relationship between fuel sulfur content and PM emissions from diesel engines. The size of the effect may be small for indirect injection diesel light duty vehicles. Increasing the cetane number reduces CO and VOC emissions, but increases PM emissions from light duty engines. For heavy duty vehicles increasing cetane number also reduced the NO x emis- sions. Reducing the diesel density lowers NO x emissions in heavy duty engines but increases the emissions in light duty vehicles. PM emissions from light duty vehicles are lowered. Reducing PAH in diesel reduces the NO x and PM emissions from both types of vehicle.   One of the key pollutants emitted from diesel vehicles is NO x. Since EPEFE, the European motor manufacturers association (ACEA and ESTU) have investigated the impact of total aromatic content and cetane index on NO x emissions from diesel vehicles. ACEA believes that it has robust evidence to suggest that reducing total aromatics in diesel reduces NOx emissions from both light and heavy duty vehicles (Signer, 1997; ACEA, 1997).   For petrol, the important parameters include aromatic content, Reid vapour pressure (RVP), distillation characteristics and oxygen content. The sulfur content of petrol is also important because it can act as a catalyst-poison, reducing catalyst efficiency, and inter- feres with the operation of oxygen sensors and on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems. Similar effects are likely to be observed with advanced light duty diesel vehicles fitted with oxidation catalysts and OBD systems. Other trace elements in gasoline, such as lead and manganese, exhibit similar effects.   Oxygenates (such as MTBE) in petrol reduce CO emissions and to a lesser extent HC, but may increase emissions of NOxand aldehydes. RVP affects the amount of evaporative emissions. The effect of the fuel's distillation characteristics (El00 -the per- centage that evaporates at 100~ and aromatic content are interdependent. At a constant El00 reducing aromatics reduced VOC and CO emissions but increased NO x emissions when measured over the urban and extra-urban driving cycles. This effect on NOxis subject to some controversy as almost all other studies have shown a decrease in NOxemissions with increasing aromatic content of petrol. Even in EPEFE, over the urban driving cycle, this effect was noted. The results have been explained by the motor manufacturers to be due to the use of three prototype vehicles poorly calibrated for the fuel.   The composition of the fuel can also affect the emissions of individual VOC com-pounds. Benzene emissions from petrol vehicles depend on the amount of benzene and aromatics in the fuel. About half the benzene emitted comes from benzene in the fuel; the remainder is formed during the combustion of other aromatics.   For cars without canisters (typically those without catalysts) there is an exponential increase in evaporative emissions with Reid vapour pressure and ambient temperature. For cars fitted with canisters evaporative emissions only occur when the canister becomes over- loaded. The small canister currently fitted to petrol cars does not control refuelling losses, and increasingly 'stage 2' vapour control systems are being fitted to petrol pumps to reduce these emissions.   Fuel additives can also have an important impact on emissions. The classical example is emissions of lead compounds as a result of lead additives in petrol. Some fuels contain detergents to stop the build-up of sooty particles in engines.   Alternative Fuels   The role of alternative fuels to reduce emissions from traffic has received considerable attention in recent years. Many reports have been published comparing the relative merits of the different fuels (e.g. in the UK: Poulton, 1994; ETSU, 1996).   From all these studies a general consensus emerges. There may be a role for the gaseous fuels in the short term for some types of vehicle. Biofuels, hydrogen and electricity, how- ever, are unlikely to be widely used in the next 10 years for a variety of reasons depending on the individual fuel. These include being economically uncompetitive, the unavailablity of technology suitable of meeting customer requirements in terms of performance, safety and durability, and uncertain security of fuel supply. Thus their use is likely to be restricted to small niche markets. The fuels considered most likely to make a major impact in the short term are compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG).   There have been numerous studies measuring emissions from gas-fuelled vehicles and comparing the results with similar vehicles conventionally fuelled. It is difficult to make direct comparisons between different studies without investigating the many parameters that influence emissions from vehicles. In the past, gas-fuelled vehicles were often poorly converted from petrol vehicles, and emissions could be high compared with those from conventionally fuelled vehicles. However, the current state-of-the-art gas-fuelled vehicles can offer real emission benefits, especially when compared with diesel vehicles. Emissions of the two key diesel pollutants, PM and NOx,are significantly lower.     Vehicle Maintenance   Poorly maintained vehicles consume more fuel and emit higher levels of CO and VOC than those that are regularly serviced. Factors such as running over-rich, poorly adjusted ignition timing and worn spark plugs can all affect emissions. The effect of correct tuning for cars without catalysts is particularly important, and a number of studies have shown that tuning, in general, results in a reduction in emissions of CO, VOC and PM. On the other hand, there is an increase in NO, emissions.   For three-way catalyst cars the most frequent reasons for high emissions are first, the failure of the oxygen sensor, and second, failure of the catalyst itself. Often the driver is unaware that the pollution abatement system has failed.   Catalysts gradually degrade with use, making them less efficient. Old catalysts tend to take longer to reach the light-off temperature and deposits may build up on the surface of the catalyst. These effects can be accelerated by trace elements in petrol, such as lead and sulfur.   Diesel vehicles are more stable and require less servicing than petrol vehicles. However, it is important that vehicles are serviced according to the manufacturers' specifications: a recent survey of 63 in-use lorries in the Netherlands found that 70% were not (TNO, 1995). Emissions can increase as a result of deposits on the fuel injector or wear of cylin- der or piston rings, leading to increased consumption of lubricants. Emissions of PM and VOC are likely to increase while those of NOxare likely to remain constant or even decline as the efficiency of combustion falls. The emission of visible smoke indicates a poorly maintained vehicle.   There is some evidence that modern heavy duty diesel engines (built to Euro I emission standards or equivalent) are less inclined to deposits building up in the fuel injection system because the high operating pressure keeps them free of obstructions.   A number of steps have been taken to reduce emissions from malfunctioning vehicles. First, in many part of the USA and Europe inspection and maintenance schemes have been introduced as part of the periodical road-worthiness test. Second, in the USA on- board diagnostic systems are fitted to warn the driver of a malfunctioning pollution control system. Similar systems are due to be fitted to new EU petrol cars from the year 2000.     Operational Factors   The way a vehicle is driven has a large impact on its emissions. This is influenced by the type of road the vehicle is being driven on, the level of congestion, traffic management, and driver attitude and behaviour. In general, when an engine is operating under load, there is efficient combustion and emissions of VOCs are low and NOxhigh, and when the vehicle is idling emissions of CO are high and NOxlow.   In diesel engines high emissions of VOC occur when an engine is started from cold, when idling or under part load, and may appear as 'white smoke' from the exhaust. At low loads emissions of NOxare low.   Several processes contribute to the formation of particles in the engine. When the engine is operating at high loads, the carbon fraction is predominantly produced, while at low loads the VOC fraction, from both the fuel and lubricant, becomes more important.   Speed   Emissions from vehicles tend to be lowest when they are driven at moderate speeds and highest when driven at low or high average speeds, giving a characteristic U-shaped speed-emission curve. A speed-emission curve for NOxis shown in Fig. 8.2 for a medium sized European petrol car with a three-way catalyst. It should be noted that the data are derived from average and not instantaneous speeds. Thus at the lowest speed this includes the stopping and starting characteristic of urban traffic.   Larger vehicles tend to emit more pollutants per kilometre driven than smaller vehicles. Thus generally cars emit less than vans which emit less than lorries. There can, however, be exceptions to this general rule. For example, emissions ofNOxfrom a small car driven at high speed are likely to be greater than those from a large car driving at the same road speed. This is because the large car will only be driving at part load, while the small car will be driving closer to full load.   Traffic Congestion   Congestion has a significant impact on petrol vehicle emissions. Measurements by the former Warren Spring Laboratory (Quality of Urban Air Review Group, 1993) suggest that where there is congestion this factor is more important than the cold start emission penalty. However, cold starts are more widespread- all cars are affected- whereas con- gestion is more localized and occurs mainly during the peak traffic hours.

Source: European Environment Agency (1997b).   CO, VOCs and NOxfrom petrol cars with catalysts increase with congestion.   Diesel cars appear to be less affected by congestion. CO and VOC emissions are lower under congested driving conditions. NOxemissions, in contrast, are considerably higher, similar to those of a petrol car without a catalyst, and much higher than a petrol car with a catalyst.   Aggressive Driving   A Dutch study has shown that when drivers are asked to drive 'aggressively' emissions increase significantly compared with those when they are asked to drive 'normally' (Heaton et al., 1992). The average emissions of CO increased by a factor of about 3.5 and the NO xby a factor of about 2 from petrol cars with catalysts.   Vehicle Load   Emissions from goods vehicles depends on whether they are laden or not. On-road meas- urements in the UK suggest that emissions generally increase by a factor of between 1 and 2 when fully laden compared when empty.   Road Gradient   Road gradient affects the resistance of a vehicle to traction, which in turn affects vehicle emissions. In principle, the emissions of both light and heavy duty vehicles are affected, but the impact is small for light duty vehicles. However, because of their greater mass the influence of road gradient on emissions is much more significant for heavy duty vehicles (European Environment Agency, 1997b).   160   140   120   100   o   o 80     o 60      X   U.I   40   20   -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80   Ambient temperature (~   Fig. 8.3 Cold start CO emission penalty with ambient temperature. Source: Personal communication from John Hickman of the Transport Research Laboratory (1997).     Cold Starts   Emissions, particularly of CO and VOCs, are greatest when the engine is cold. It has been estimated that in the UK in 1990 (when there were very few petrol cars with catalysts) approximately one-third of the total VOC and CO emissions from passenger cars was emitted from cold start (Holman et al., 1993). Cold starts are relatively unimportant for NO x emissions.   Cold start emissions are relatively more important for cars fitted with catalytic con- verters than non-catalyst petrol cars because it takes a few minutes for the catalyst to reach its operational temperature. Thus during those early minutes of a journey when emission from the engine are highest, the catalyst does not work efficiently.   Ambient temperature has an important affect on emissions, especially when the engine is started from cold. Data from the UK Transport Research Laboratory show that the 'cold start emission penalty' increases exponentially with decreasing ambient temperature. This is shown for CO in Fig. 8.3 (personal communication from John Hickman of the Transport Research Laboratory, 1997). For diesel cars the influence of ambient tempera- ture on cold start emissions is less marked.   There is some evidence that ambient temperature also has a small impact on hot emissions.     CONCLUSIONS   Techniques to estimate sources of pollution have improved considerably over the years, but there remains considerable uncertainty, particularly for pollutants such as NMVOCs which come from a diverse range of mainly small sources, and PM which is both a primary and secondary pollutant. Emission estimates for anthropogenic sources of NMVOCs are probably within +_50%, and for PM +_25% of true values. To obtain the complete picture it is important to include natural as well as anthropogenic sources. For natural sources the estimates are much more uncertain.   National anthropogenic annual emission inventories can, on their own, give a misleading picture regarding the appropriate sources to control. What is important for most pollutants are those sources that make major contributions to elevated concentra- tions during pollution episodes. As most people live in cities, urban inventories (and air quality modelling) are important for identifying these sources.   The main source of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels, particularly in power sta- tions and motor vehicles. Emissions from both these sources have begun to decline in recent years owing to the introduction of efficient abatement measures. In most urban areas, road transport is the dominant source of pollution as measures to reduce wintertime smogs in earlier decades lead to the re-location of many large stationary sources to rural or semi-rural sites.   Road transport is the single most important source of most of the classical air pollu- tants. The exceptions are sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds. To develop effective control strategies for reducing urban emissions it is important to know which type of vehicles are contributing most to the total road traffic emissions.   In an inventory area there will typically be millions of individual sources of pollution. It is not possible to measure emissions from every single one. Instead, emissions are cal- culated, generally from a measure of activity relating to the emissions, such as fuel consumption for stationary sources and distance travelled for mobile sources. Emission factors, derived from measurements of individual or representative sources, are then multiplied by the appropriate statistic, to give the emission rate.
