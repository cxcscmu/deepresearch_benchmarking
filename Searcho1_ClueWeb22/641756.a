As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide you with information and perspectives on the topic of world hunger based on research and analysis.

World hunger is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects millions of people around the globe. It is not caused by a single factor but rather by a combination of political, economic, social, and environmental factors. Here are some key reasons why world hunger persists:

1. Poverty: Poverty is one of the primary causes of hunger. People living in poverty often lack the financial resources to purchase sufficient food or the means to produce their own food.

2. Conflict and instability: Armed conflicts and political instability can disrupt food production and distribution systems, leading to food shortages and increased hunger.

3. Climate change: Climate change affects agriculture and food production, leading to crop failures, reduced yields, and increased food prices.

4. Unequal distribution of resources: In many countries, resources such as land, water, and technology are unevenly distributed, making it difficult for small-scale farmers to produce enough food.

5. Lack of infrastructure: Poor transportation, storage, and distribution systems can lead to food waste and limit access to food in remote or underserved areas.

6. Economic policies: Some economic policies, such as trade liberalization and agricultural subsidies, can have negative impacts on small-scale farmers and contribute to hunger.

7. Population growth: As the global population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, putting pressure on food systems and resources.

8. Waste and inefficiency: A significant amount of food is wasted throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption, which contributes to hunger.

Addressing world hunger requires comprehensive and sustained efforts from governments, international organizations, civil society, and individuals. This includes investing in agriculture and rural development, promoting social protection programs, improving access to education and healthcare, and addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{World hunger is caused by a combination of poverty, conflict, climate change, unequal resource distribution, lack of infrastructure, economic policies, population growth, and food waste.}} \]
