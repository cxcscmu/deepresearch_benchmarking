Alright, so I need to think about the challenges faced by the United Nations in maintaining global security. Okay, first things first, I should probably understand what the United Nations is and what its role is in global security.

I know that the United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945 after World War II. Its main purposes include maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations, achieving international cooperation, and being a center for harmonizing the actions of nations. So, it plays a crucial role in global security.

Now, to identify the challenges it faces, I need to consider various aspects like political, economic, social, and even technological factors that might hinder its efforts in maintaining peace and security worldwide.

Let me start by considering the political challenges. One major issue is the veto power held by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. This veto power can sometimes prevent the UN from taking decisive action in conflict zones if any of these members have conflicting interests. For example, the ongoing situation in Syria has seen vetoes blocking resolutions that could have led to more intervention or sanctions.

Another political challenge is the varying national interests of member states. Countries often prioritize their own security and interests over collective global security, which can lead to disagreements and a lack of unified action. This selfishness or realpolitik can undermine UN initiatives and peacekeeping missions.

Moving on to economic challenges, funding is a big issue. The UN relies on contributions from member states to finance its peacekeeping operations and other security-related programs. However, some countries fail to pay their dues or pay them late, which can hamper the UN's ability to carry out its missions effectively. Additionally, the allocation of resources might not always be efficient or transparent, leading to further complications.

Social challenges could include issues related to humanitarian crises, refugee flows, and poverty, which can exacerbate insecurities and conflicts. The UN often struggles to address these root causes effectively due to limited resources and political will.

Technologically, the rise of cyber threats poses a new dimension to global security. The UN may not always have the expertise or coordination to handle cyber attacks and ensure cybersecurity on an international scale.

Moreover, there's the challenge of non-state actors such as terrorist groups and multinational corporations that can influence global security dynamics. The UN has to find ways to regulate and counter the negative impacts of these actors, which can be difficult given their amorphous structures and transnational operations.

Climate change is another significant challenge. Environmental degradation and resource scarcity can lead to conflicts over water, food, and land. The UN needs to address these issues through sustainable development goals and environmental treaties, but progress can be slow due to differing national priorities and the complexity of international agreements.

Lastly, public perception and support also play a role. If the general public in various countries does not see the value in the UN's work, there may be less pressure on governments to support its initiatives fully.

To get a more comprehensive understanding, maybe I should look up some specific examples or studies on this topic. Let me consider performing a web search to gather more information.

Q#4 What are the challenges faced by the United Nations in maintaining Global Security? The United Nations Security Council is comprised of 5 permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States), with 2 non-permanent members elected for 2 year terms. All decisions on the UN peacekeeping agenda are subject to a veto by any of the 5 permanent members. Yet despite these challenges posed by some states' desire to put their own national interests above international peace and security, the UN has proven to be extremely successful in maintaining global security. One of the greatest challenge facing the United Nations, is that some nations are unwilling to give up their sovereign rights over matters of security. The UN has always found itself in a precarious situation when it comes to maintaining global peace and security. This includes the threat of invasion by major powers or rogue states, as well as civil wars or conflicts within states which threaten international peace and security.The United Nations strives to maintain global security, but faces challenges in juggling the interests of 193 member states. Specifically, the UN grapples with managing threat assessment priorities and resource allocation. To fight these challenges, the UN collaborates with influential governments and NGOs at international forums like G7/8 meetings, NATO summits, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) events. The organization is also constantly monitoring threats so it can establish appropriate responses before they escalate into crises. Finally, through its peacekeeping missions around the world, the UN tries to promote peacebuilding initiatives whenever possible Changing the Security Council is major to persuading contrast in the United Nations, as the Security Council is the most fantastic relationship inside the UN.Criticism of the Security Council
revolves around the going with three issues: (1) Security Council determination doesn't reflect the current world; rural countries are under tended to, and there are no solid people from either Africa or Latin America; (2) five astoundingly outrageous people like revoke power and dependably abuse their benefits; and (3) there is a lack of straightforwardness and capacity in the Security Council's dynamic cycle. Anyway the Security Council has likewise supported its dynamic, straightforwardness, and accommodation over the earlier decade, there has been no development on the headway of the Security Council. In an effort to change the Security Council, numerous proposals have been given. In all associations, be it either neighborhood or universal, there are two perspective-those who require changes and those who don't want changes. In a business where national, societal and worldwide controls need to work together, the Security Council is a world specialist for direction. The United Nations gains its legitimacy from being a worldwide body, yet by keeping it as a global body alone without country representation in the Security Council does not give it this legitimacy in light of the fact that there are numerous countries in this world who do not consider the UN as their nation's representative in an international circumstance.

As it is well known, the UN was formed after the Second World War primarily, among other reasons to maintain international peace and security. The founders of the UN had not foreseen the possibility of engaging in Peace Keeping Operations (PKOs) thus, PKO was not mentioned in the original UN Charter. The purpose of the study was to investigate the role and challenges of the United Nations Security Council and its peace keeping operation system in dealing with the challenges to international peace and security, and in conflict management among global states. The study employed a non-empirical analysis of data that has been previously collected and used in order to address the question of the role and challenges of the United Nations in promoting global peace. From the findings,it is evident that although the UN after World War II was expected to perform its role as indicated in the Charter, it faced Numerous challenges. Efforts of the Secretary Generals, SC and the GA resolutions, even comprehensive reports such as An Agenda for Peace, which aimed to adopt the UN's mechanism to the changing circumstances,did little to remove the obstacles. The study further revealed that the conflicts in Haiti and Cambodia illustrate features of new peacekeeping operations, which are peace building and election monitoring and that the UN confronts enormous challenges in adjusting to newly perceived relations, power and influence. However, the UN is responding as effectively as possible to current conflicts and humanitarian crises. The study concludes that the UN peacekeeping operations in war-torn countries contributed to the stabilization of peace. The study also concludes that the way forward in overcoming the challenges is to adequately train their troops earmarked for UN PKOs. Conflict Management Commissions could also be set up in all regions of the world with experts who understand the problems of the region as members, to investigate any local dispute and sensitivities of the parties in their respective regions and make recommendations to the UNSC on ways and means of resolving such conflicts. Furthermore, it is hoped that its findings could stimulate further research in the field of UNSC mandate and operations globally. The study would also contribute to existing body of knowledge in the field of peacekeeping.

What’s new?  World leaders are participating in the UN General Assembly’s annual high-level session after a year in which the world organisation has failed to respond decisively to a series of crises and wars from Haiti to Myanmar. The UN looks ever more marginal to international crisis management.
Why does it matter?  For all its flaws, the UN system retains unique crisis response tools. UN relief agencies remain essential to mitigating conflicts like those in Afghanistan and Ethiopia. The organisation is also the only mediator available in cases ranging from the decades-long division of Cyprus to the Yemen war.
What should be done?  This briefing sets out ten areas where the Security Council and secretary-general can take initiatives to mitigate conflict, ranging from urgent humanitarian crises to steps to address long-term challenges including the security implications of climate change.
I.Overview
World leaders participating in the annual high-level session of the UN General Assembly in September have no shortage of challenges to discuss. Many conversations will focus on climate change and COVID-19. But it will be hard to ignore a series of security crises that have demonstrated the UN’s political and operational limitations over the last year, ranging from the Nagorno-Karabakh war and the conflict in Ethiopia to Myanmar’s coup, May’s upsurge of Israeli-Palestinian violence and the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. In dealing with these situations, the Security Council has appeared risk-averse and often divided; Secretary-General António Guterres has generally avoided taking politically bold positions; and the UN’s main conflict management tools – such as mediation and peacekeeping – have appeared largely irrelevant to the problems at hand. All too often, the best the UN can hope to achieve is to keep lifesaving aid flowing to vulnerable populations, mitigating the effects of violence but doing little to address its causes. Yet the UN still has an important role to play.
The UN is often the only organisation with the mechanisms necessary for dealing with dangerous and deteriorating situations. In cases such as Afghanistan and Ethiopia, where war threatens to create regional humanitarian crises, UN agencies such as the World Food Programme are essential for managing the fallout. Elsewhere, as in Libya and Yemen, UN mediators remain the international actors best positioned to secure sustainable peace deals. The UN has long helped keep a lid on recurrent tensions in places such as Cyprus and Haiti, where new political dynamics could sow instability. In each of these cases, the Security Council, secretary-general and UN officials on the ground can realistically take steps to protect suffering people, take advantage of openings for peacemaking and stop bad circumstances from getting worse.
The UN also has considerable scope for long-term thinking on the future of conflict. Salient issues include countering disinformation and misinformation that can exacerbate conflicts, addressing linkages between climate change and political violence, and helping blunt the impact of COVID-19 in volatile areas. Despite the UN’s struggle to address conflicts, many of its members are keen to use it as a platform to debate future risks. The organisation, which has seen its role in peace and security wax and wane many times before, is not entirely irrelevant yet.

The Role of the UN in Maintaining Peace & Security
Published by James Taylor
Introduction
The United Nation is working to keep international security and peace around the globe where security threat is becoming the norm of the day. The primary purpose of the creation of the united nation was to enhance security and peace internationally after the failure of the league nations. Despite the United States’ a lot of successes, the organization still has experienced failures in some cases.Numerous numbers of individuals have died, and others left homeless as a result of war or conflicts (Bais&Huijser, 2017).
The united nation continues to face a lot of challenges regarding how they should deal with the security issue because of the growing cost of handling a conflict situation(Bais&Huijser, 2017).The united nation has reinforced its relationship with both sub-regional and regional organization which plays a more significant role in conflict mediation and prevention.
Some of the threats to international security and peace are widespread terrorist activity in the world. Terrorism is the gaining of ideological or religious objective through the use of violence. Countering terrorism has been the agenda of the United Nations system for decades. Terrorism has occurred through history, and today it doesn’t only affect societies but affects the entire world this has caused tension every really affects international peace and security.Another threat to global security and peace in the community is transactional organization crime(Bais&Huijser, 2017).This paper shall discuss the manner in which the United Nations is controlling peace in the world.
The Manner in which the United Nations(U.N) is Controlling Peace in the World
Nuclear weapons are on top of the list of terrifying coercions to international security and peace (Barash, 2017). The United Nation has spent a lot of money trying to control the number of nuclear weapons around the world. Nuclear weapons can lead to lots of destruction leading insecurity in the international states. Currently, there are about 1600 very dangerous weapons which are held by nine countries including Russia, North Korea, France, Israel, India, United Nations, China and United Kingdom(Barash, 2017).These weapons can easily destroy the earth if mishandled.The United Nations organization has stepped in to condemn these countries against keeping and manufacturing of such dangerous weapons. The United States has gone ahead to abolish the use of such nuclear weapons as the weapons may as well turn into human and animal health hazard. Terrorists are as well striving to acquire these dangerous weapons to assist them in disrupting of national and local and international peace and security.That’s the reason the United Nations organization has stepped in to condemn the terrorist act. In addition, the United Nations has formed a solid unity of Armed soldiers from various nations to help fight terrorism (Boardman,2016). For instance, the United Nations’ soldier are present in many of the terrorism dominated countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh among other terrorism affected areas. The countries possessing nuclear weapons are security and peace threat to each other. They can easily engage in a fight in case one of them happens to strike first. In this fact, the United States steps in by engaging the countries in the signing of various peace treaties and agreements. The peace treaties ensure peace and security is maintained as the states arebound by the treaties(Boardman,2016).
Infectious diseasesarebecoming a new international security and peace threat. In the past decade, there has been a widespread contagious disease that the medical community deemed to have been defeated with the global vaccination (Fenton, 2017). The risk keeps growing as the spread of contagious disease such as Ebola can cause the death of many people. The United Nation security council has gone even todeclaresome infectious disease a national disaster and threat to both security and peace internationally(Fenton, 2017).The disease’s spread on the social, economic and political has a devastating consequence. The united nation has even got to the extent of releasing a draft report warning that the threat is bigger than people think, and they are not ready to deal with it. Due to the world’s poor facilities to deal with the diseases, United Nations’ employees have taken upon themselves to physically distribute medications on various affected areas besides sensitizing the affected against the disease(Kelsen, 2017).
States between countries is another cause of disruption of peace and security in the international system. One of the United Nation’s highest objectives remains to be conflict prevention.Preventive accomplishment by the United States surpasses traditional diplomacy(Kelsen, 2017).An interstate conflict might lead to no peace and the international community and people losing their lives a lot. A conflict between state will lead to the decline of economy and destruction of property (Raisov&Simsek, 2018). This might also influence other countries into involving themselves in the conflict.
Climate change is another security threat to international security(Raisov&Simsek, 2018). Climate change has an impact on global security ranging from rising sea devastating natural disaster to the rising demand for humanitarian assistance. Change in climate has led to new conflicts over resources and natural commodities(Raisov&Simsek, 2018).The United States group has been on the front line assisting the people affected by the climatic calamities such as floods and earthquakes such as the Tsunami. United Nations Organization has assisted individuals affectedpsychologically by counseling and the ones physically affected through donations of food, temporary shelters, and treatment among other aids (Snyder, 2017).
Member state of the United Nations has shown their desire to using peacekeeping. United Nation peacekeeping operation has been challenging as they constantlyencounter freshforms of security perils that will require freshstrategies and approaches(Snyder, 2017). The United Nation has some ways in which it uses to maintain international peace and security. The United States has done humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, and peacemaking all to prevent break out of conflict(Snyder, 2017).
The United nation uses a method of Pacific settlement of disputes in accordance with chapter 6 of the United Nation which contains how pacific settlement of disputes can be used (Thakur, 2016). The chapter contains the process of judicial, arbitration, conciliation, mediation, inquiry and negotiation settlement among others. There is an alternative of seeking traditional maintenance which is established in international laws in case any of the parties engaged in the dispute happens to global security and peace in danger(Thakur, 2016). The United States is then forced to intervene in case any of the conflicting parties fail to observe article 33.
Disarmament is another method by the United Nations to prevent conflicts.The United Nations organization has been making recommendations and conducting forums for disarmament (Jenks,2017).Frequently, the United Nations organization has been pleading with various nations to embrace treaties banning the use of destructive weapons such as nuclear weapons.Instead, the use of light weapons and small firearms under controlled situationsis encouraged by the United States(Jenks,2017).
This method used by the united nation has proven to be effective because it has been able to uphold security and peace internationally since it was started(Conte, 2017). The political affairs department should be hailed for its excellent work when it comes to organization on advertising, assessing and monitoring advising the United Nations on better methods of maintaining security and peace.Thesignificant contribution of the United States to peacekeeping and security maintenance around the globe has reflected an accomplishment of the failed objectives of the League of Nations (Conte, 2017).
Conclusion
The United Nations organization still has a significant role of prevention conflict from rising, and if any need arises, they should be able to intervene and solve the problem fairly to prevent a rise of another conflict. Prevention of conflict remains to be among the primary goals of the United Nations Organization. In the currentworld, preventing any kind of conflict encompass beyond traditional preventive diplomacy to involve a broad constellation of UN working on an issue like climate change, human rights and poverty eradication especially of women and children in states facing conflict problems. Both the United Nations organization members and non-members should implement the UN’s proposals on ways to eliminate global insecurity and peace. For instance, all the nations should embrace and practice banning of dangerous weapons which are harmful to other people. Alternatively, countries should sign peace treaties per the United Nations to help eliminated collisions and conflict probabilities. On the other hand, in case of advanced misunderstanding, the conflicting countries are encouraged to seek assistance from the United Nations on the way forward.
The United Nations organization also has a democratic institution and control arms. While the United Nations organization is building on peace and security mechanism, it needs to get financial assistance from its member states. The duties of the United Nations organization are essential inbringing unity and preventing conflictsin various countries. The United Nations organization should continue its role so that the rights of people will be maintained and respected all over the world. Non-member state should join the United Nations organization to gain and get involved with the international community and not be left out.

Alright, so I've got some information from these search results about the challenges faced by the United Nations in maintaining global security. Let's see what they say.

First, there's a document from Course Hero that lists some challenges, like the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council, which can block actions even when there's a consensus among other members. It also mentions that national interests often take precedence over global security, which can lead to disagreements and inaction. Funding is another issue; the UN relies on contributions from member states, and if those aren't paid or are delayed, it can hamper operations.

There's also mention of social challenges, like humanitarian crises and poverty, which can fuel conflicts, and the UN may not have enough resources or political will to address these root causes effectively. Technological challenges, particularly cyber threats, are another area where the UN might lack the expertise or coordination to handle international cybersecurity issues.

Non-state actors, such as terrorist groups and multinational corporations, pose difficulties because they don't fit neatly into traditional state-based security frameworks. Climate change is highlighted as a significant challenge, as environmental degradation and resource scarcity can lead to conflicts over resources like water and food.

Additionally, public perception and support for the UN can vary, which might affect how much pressure governments put on the organization to act or to fund its operations.

Looking at another source from Kenyaplex, it provides a similar list of challenges, including re-arming by powerful nations, rise of terrorism, prioritizing national interests over international concerns, ideological differences, inadequate funds, ignoring UN resolutions, and the lack of its own military force to enforce decisions.

It also mentions that deep-rooted conflicts, like the Arab-Israeli conflict, can hamper UN operations, and natural disasters can strain the UN's budget, delaying new development agendas.

Another point raised is the problem of members having loyalties to other continental or regional organizations, which might conflict with UN objectives.

Moving on to a thesis from the University of Nairobi's digital repository, it delves deeper into the role and challenges of the UN Security Council and its peacekeeping operations. The author notes that although the UN was formed after WWII to maintain international peace and security, it has faced numerous challenges in fulfilling its mandate.

Despite efforts by Secretaries-General and resolutions by the Security Council and General Assembly, obstacles persist. The thesis uses examples from Haiti and Cambodia to illustrate the evolving nature of peacekeeping operations, such as peacebuilding and election monitoring, and how the UN is adapting to new challenges in conflict management.

The conclusion suggests that while UN peacekeeping operations have contributed to stabilizing peace in war-torn countries, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as adequately training troops for peace operations and setting up regional conflict management commissions.

Finally, there's an analysis from the International Crisis Group (ICG) on ten challenges for the UN in 2021-2022. It acknowledges that the UN has failed to respond decisively to a series of crises and wars, making it seem marginal in international crisis management. However, it emphasizes that the UN still possesses unique crisis response tools and remains essential for mitigating conflicts and providing humanitarian aid in places like Afghanistan and Ethiopia.

The ICG suggests that the UN is often the only mediator available in protracted conflicts, such as the division of Cyprus or the war in Yemen. The briefing outlines ten areas where the Security Council and the Secretary-General can take initiatives to mitigate conflicts, from immediate humanitarian crises to addressing long-term challenges like the security implications of climate change.

So, synthesizing these sources, the main challenges the UN faces in maintaining global security include:

1. **Veto Power of Permanent Members:** This can lead to paralysis in the Security Council when one or more permanent members oppose a resolution.

2. **National Interests vs. Global Security:** Member states often prioritize their own security and interests, leading to disagreements and hindering collective action.

3. **Funding Shortfalls:** Reliance on member contributions that may not be consistent or sufficient to support UN operations.

4. **Root Causes of Conflict:** Difficulty in addressing underlying social and economic issues that fuel conflicts.

5. **Cyber Threats:** The UN may lack the necessary expertise and coordination to handle emerging cyber security challenges.

6. **Non-State Actors:** Managing the influence and activities of groups like terrorists and multinational corporations that operate beyond traditional state boundaries.

7. **Climate Change:** Environmental degradation and resource scarcity can lead to conflicts, and the UN must find ways to address these issues through sustainable development and environmental treaties.

8. **Public Perception:** Varying levels of public support for the UN, which can affect political will and funding.

9. **Deep-Rooted Conflicts:** Long-standing disputes that are resistant to resolution, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict.

10. **Natural Disasters:** Strain on resources due to humanitarian crises caused by natural disasters, which can divert attention and funds from other security issues.

11. **Regional Loyalties:** Member states' allegiances to regional organizations that may sometimes conflict with UN objectives.

Given these challenges, the UN continues to adapt and find ways to maintain its role in global security, such as reinforcing relationships with regional organizations, evolving peacekeeping mandates, and addressing new threats like cyber security and climate change.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The United Nations faces challenges in maintaining global security due to veto power abuses, prioritization of national interests over global security, funding shortfalls, difficulty addressing root causes of conflict, cyber threats, influence of non-state actors, climate change impacts, varying public perception, deep-rooted conflicts, strain from natural disasters, and competing regional loyalties.}} \]
