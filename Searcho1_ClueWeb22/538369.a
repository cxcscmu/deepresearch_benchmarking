As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can certainly help explain how feminism has evolved over time based on historical and social contexts.

Feminism, in its broadest sense, is a range of political movements, ideologies, and social theories that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social rights for women. This movement has undergone several waves, each with its own focus and methods.

**First-wave feminism** emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily focusing on legal issues, particularly women's suffrage—the right to vote. This wave was characterized by campaigns for women's basic rights and equal opportunities, such as property rights and access to education and employment. Key figures include Susan B. Anthony and Emmeline Pankhurst.

**Second-wave feminism**, which took place from the 1960s to the 1980s, expanded the debate to a wider range of issues affecting women, including sexuality, family, the workplace, reproductive rights, domestic violence, and abortion. It also began to intersect with other social justice movements, such as civil rights and LGBT rights. Notable activists during this period include Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.

**Third-wave feminism**, starting in the 1990s and continuing into the early 2000s, emphasized individuality and diversity among women, rejecting the idea that there is a single feminist agenda. It embraced intersectionality, recognizing that women experience oppression in different ways based on factors like race, class, sexual orientation, and disability. This wave also focused on issues such as body image, media representation, and workplace harassment. Rebecca Walker and Kimberlé Crenshaw are prominent figures in this wave.

**Fourth-wave feminism**, beginning around 2012, is characterized by the use of digital and social media to combat sexual harassment, assault, and violence against women. The #MeToo movement is a prime example of this wave, where survivors of sexual misconduct shared their stories on social platforms, leading to widespread awareness and accountability. This wave continues to address ongoing inequalities and seeks to create a more inclusive and equitable society.

Each wave of feminism has built upon the achievements of the previous one, adapting to the changing social, cultural, and political landscapes. Today, feminism continues to evolve, addressing new challenges and incorporating diverse perspectives to strive for gender equality worldwide.
