As an AI language model, I don't take sides or advocate for any particular viewpoint. However, I can provide information on arguments that some people make in favor of the death penalty. It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for all perspectives.

One argument in favor of the death penalty is that it serves as a deterrent to serious crimes, potentially preventing future murders. Proponents argue that the threat of capital punishment may discourage individuals from committing heinous offenses.

Another perspective is that the death penalty provides retribution for the victims' families. Some believe that executing the murderer can bring a sense of closure and justice to those who have lost loved ones to violent crimes.

Additionally, there is the argument of incapacitation. By sentencing a convicted murderer to death, there is no chance of them repeating their crime or posing a threat to society in the future.

Lastly, some argue that the death penalty upholds the principle of "an eye for an eye," which has been a longstanding concept in many legal systems throughout history.

It's crucial to note that these are just some of the arguments presented by supporters of the death penalty. Opponents have equally compelling reasons against it, such as the possibility of executing innocent people, the high cost of capital punishment trials, and the moral argument that taking a life is inherently wrong.

In many countries, including the United States, the debate over the death penalty continues, with various states and nations adopting different stances based on their cultural, legal, and ethical considerations.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The death penalty should be allowed because it acts as a deterrent, provides retribution, ensures incapacitation, and upholds traditional principles of justice.}} \]
