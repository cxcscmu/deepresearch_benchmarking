So I need to figure out how the Cold War influenced American foreign and domestic policy. I don't remember a lot about the Cold War, except that it was between the US and the Soviet Union, and it was a tense time. But I need to understand how it affected both foreign and domestic policies. Maybe I should start by refreshing my memory on what the Cold War was all about.

Cold War
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Cold War was the tense fighting between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union (also called the USSR) and its allies between the end of World War II and the fall of the Soviet Union. [1] [2] It is called the "Cold" War because the Americans and the Soviet Union never actually fought each other directly. Instead, they attacked each other in conflicts known as proxy wars where a powerful country starts a war that they don't fight in.

Conflicting countries[change | change source]
Most of the countries on one side were allied by NATO, whose most powerful country was the United States. Most of the countries on the other side were allied by the Warsaw Pact, whose most powerful country was the Soviet Union.[3]
The Western Bloc was the name of the capitalist countries led by the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an alliance created in 1949 and included the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Greece, and Turkey. Other countries allied with the Western Bloc include Israel, Brazil, South Korea, Kenya (1960-1991), Bangladesh (1964-1968), Pakistan, North Yemen, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
The Eastern Bloc was the group of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact was an alliance created in 1955 and included the USSR, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary (until 1976), Poland, and Romania. Other countries allied with the Eastern Bloc included Angola (1975–1991), Cuba, Bolivia, Cambodia (1977–1979), South Yemen, Tunisia, Nepal, Bhutan, Libya (1974–1991), Mongolia (1976–1988), Jamaica, North Korea, China and Laos (1975–1991).
Background[change | change source]
In February 1917, Tsar Nicholas II of the Russian Empire was overthrown because people were unhappy with their living conditions (like being a serf ), especially during World War I. The new government in Russia was a democratic socialist government. Unfortunately, it was ineffective, and people were still unhappy. In November 1917, a communist group called the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the new government and were supported by groups of workers called Soviets. The Bolsheviks created a new communist government called the Russian Soviet Federation Socialist Republic (also called simply Soviet Russia or the Russian SFSR).
However, not everyone supported the communists. Many countries that had been part of the Russian Empire had left, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Belarus. The Russian Civil Wa r began, with the Soviet Russian Red Army fighting against the White Army of anticommunist Russians. The White Army was not very united or organized. The Allied Powers of World War I, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, invaded Russia to support the White Army and stop the Red Army. The Red Army eventually won the war in 1922, and established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (also called the Soviet Union), along with the newly-formed Socialist Republics of Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
The start of the Cold War in 1947 was caused by a belief that all governments would become either communist or capitalist. The Western Allies feared that the Soviet Union would spread communism to the rest of Europe and was very concerned that Soviet agents had learnt how to make atomic bombs after the war.
Both nations had opposed Nazi Germany although the United States worked with Nazi scientists [4] [5] and Soviet Union had chosen not to fight with Germany in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the two occupied Poland in 1939. However, Germany turned against the Soviet Union in June 1941 and invaded it during Operation Barbarossa .
After World War II[change | change source]
The "Big Three" at the Yalta Conference: Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin, early 1945
After World War II, Germany was left in ruins. The victorious Allies that occupied it split it into four parts. in the western half of Germany, one part was given to the United States, one to the United Kingdom, and one to France. The eastern half was occupied by the USSR. The city of Berlin was also split among the four countries even though it was entirely within the eastern half.
Winston Churchill, Harry S. Truman and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference, mid-1945.
The Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland or BRD), or West Germany, was recognized by the Western Allies in June 1949 and was a capitalist democracy. West Berlin was considered a part of the country. The Soviets named their section of Germany the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik or DDR), or East Germany, later in 1949; it was a communist dictatorship.
From April 1948 to May 1949, the Soviets blockaded West Berlin to prevent the city from using West Germany's currency. The United States and its allies supplied the city by airplanes until September 1949 in what became known as the Berlin Airlift. Many East Germans wanted to live in West Germany for having greater quality of life and political freedom. In 1961, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, dividing the two halves of the city, and heavily guarded it to prevent more people from escaping to the west. The wall was considered a symbol of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain that divided Europe.
1950s[change | change source]
President Truman signs the National Security Act Amendment of 1949 with guests in the Oval Office.
Espionage, or "spying," has been around for a long time and was very important during the Cold War. After its successful nuclear espionage in the Manhattan Project, the Soviets created their spy organs, especially the KGB. The CIA led Americans efforts abroad, and the FBI led counterespionage. Catching foreign spies and fighting domestic subversion were KGB functions.
In 1953, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin died, and Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev took his place. Khrushchev later took sole control of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's Secret Speech marked a period of de-Stalinization, and Khrushchev tried to undo many of the things done by Stalin (such as the Gulag prisons and Stalin's cult of personality).
In the United States, there was a "Red Scare", and when the Soviets detonated their own atom bomb, there was a big political fallout and the United States government made everybody scared about communists. Famous people in many fields who had been Communist sympathizers in the past like Larry Adler lost their positions. Many actors were 'blacklisted' and so were not hired to act in movies, which ruined their careers. US Senator Joseph McCarthy was believed by many when he accused some important Americans of being communists, including some high government officials.

General Douglas MacArthur, UN Command CiC (seated), observes the naval shelling of Incheon from the USS Mount McKinley, September 15, 1950
The 1950s were the beginning of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. It began with the Soviets putting the Sputnik 1 satellite into orbit around the Earth as the first country in space. The United States responded by starting NASA and soon sent up its own satellites. The Soviets also sent the first man (Yuri Gagarin) into Earth orbit and claimed that proved communism to be the better ideology.
In the 1950s, the United States (under President Dwight Eisenhower) created a policy called "New Look" to cut defense spending and to increase the number of nuclear weapons as a deterrent in order to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking the West. The Soviets also increased their nuclear force, which resulted in mutual assured destruction .
In the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Cold War alliances were broken in an important way for the first time with the Soviet Union and United States favoring one side and Britain and France the other. The Western Allies also decided to let Soviet troops suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 .
US Vice-President Richard Nixon engaged in several talks with Khrushchev during the 1950s. One of these was the 1959 "Kitchen Debate" in a model kitchen in Moscow. The debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the Americans and the Soviets. The following year, the United States U-2 spy plane crashed in the Soviet Union. Tensions between the two countries increased.
Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)[change | change source]
Main article: Cuban Missile Crisis
Flag of the 26th of July Movement
Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon during Brezhnev's June 1973 visit to Washington; this was a high-water mark in détente between the United States and the Soviet Union
After the United States had invaded Cuba and failed in the Bay of Pigs, the Soviet Union attempted to supply Cuba with nuclear missiles. The missiles in Cuba would have allowed the Soviet Union to target almost the entire United States effectively. In response the United States sent a large number of ships to blockade Cuba to prevent the Soviet Union from sharing the weapons. The United States and Soviet Union agreed that the Soviet Union would no longer give nuclear weapons to Cuba if the United States didn't invade Cuba again. That was the highest period of tension during the Cold War and was the closest the world came to a nuclear war, with possible global conflict to follow.
Détente (1962–1981)[change | change source]
After the agreement that ended the Cuban Missile Crisis, relations between both sides eased up. Several treaties, designed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, were signed. In 1964, the US under President Lyndon Johnson invaded North Vietnam, which resulted in a humiliating defeat for the Americans and South Vietnam in 1975. During this period of détente, the United States began building a good relationship with the People's Republic of China, which had once been an ally of the Soviet Union.
End[change | change source]
Reagan speaks at the Berlin Wall 's Brandenburg Gate, which inspired Mikhail Gorbachev to "tear down this wall ."
The policy of détente ended in 1981, when US President Ronald Reagan ordered a massive military build-up to challenge Soviet influence around the world. The United States began to support anti-communists all over the world with money and weapons. The idea was to help them overthrow their communist governments.
The Soviets had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all-time high. They tried to keep up with the United States in military spending but could not do so. In the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which started in 1979, the Soviets had a difficult time fighting resistance groups, with some of them armed and trained by the United States. The Soviets' failed invasion of Afghanistan is often compared to the American failure during the Vietnam War.
Gorbachev and Reagan sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty at the White House, 1987
In the late 1980s, the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix world problems caused by the war, with the ultimate aim of eliminating nuclear weapons. However, that did not take place because Reagan insisted on having a nuclear missile defence system. The people of the Soviet Union were divided. Some wanted Gorbachev to fight harder to eliminate nuclear weapons, but others did not want him to be talking to the United States at all. The mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political infighting, and the people were no longer united behind one goal. Also, the Communist Party started to crumble.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and without communist rule holding together the countries that comprised the Soviet Union, it was divided into smaller countries in 1991 like Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Georgia. Eastern Europe got very poor and broken and returned to capitalism. The Cold War was over. [6]
Not all historians agree on when the Cold War ended. Some think it ended when the Berlin Wall fell, but others think it ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. [7]

The Cold War is the name given to the relationship that developed primarily between the USA and the USSR after World War Two. The Cold War was to dominate international affairs for decades and many major crises occurred – the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Hungary and the Berlin Wall being just some. For many, the growth in weapons of mass destruction was the most worrying issue.
A clash of very different beliefs and ideology – capitalism versus communism – each held with almost religious conviction, formed the basis of an international power struggle with both sides vying for dominance, exploiting every opportunity for expansion anywhere in the world.
Note that USSR in 1945 was Russia post-1917 and included all the various countries that now exist individually (Ukraine, Georgia etc) but after the war they were part of this huge country up until the collapse of the Soviet Union (the other name for the USSR).
Logic would dictate that as the USA and the USSR fought as allies during World War Two, their relationship after the war would be firm and friendly. This never happened and any appearance that these two powers were friendly during the war is illusory.
American and Soviet Union relations before World War Two
Cold War Chronology
Before the war, America had depicted the Soviet Union as almost the devil-incarnate. The Soviet Union had depicted America likewise so their ‘friendship’ during the war was simply the result of having a mutual enemy – Nazi Germany. In fact, one of America’s leading generals, Patton, stated that he felt that the Allied army should unite with what was left of the Wehrmacht in 1945, utilise the military genius that existed within it (such as the V2’s etc.) and fight the oncoming Soviet Red Army. Churchill himself was furious that Eisenhower, as supreme head of Allied command, had agreed that the Red Army should be allowed to get to Berlin first ahead of the Allied army. His anger was shared by Montgomery, Britain’s senior military figure.
Suspicion brews between America and Soviet Union
So the extreme distrust that existed during the war, was certainly present before the end of the war……..and this was between Allies. The Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, was also distrustful of the Americans after Truman only told him of a new terrifying weapon that he was going to use against the Japanese. The first Stalin knew of what this weapon could do was when reports on Hiroshima got back to Moscow.
So this was the scene after the war ended in 1945. Both sides distrusted the other. One had a vast army in the field (the Soviet Union with its Red Army supremely lead by Zhukov) while the other, the Americans had the most powerful weapon in the world, the A-bomb and the Soviets had no way on knowing how many America had.
What exactly was the Cold War?
In diplomatic terms there are three types of war.
Hot War : this is actual warfare. All talks have failed and the armies are fighting.
Warm War : this is where talks are still going on and there would always be a chance of a peaceful outcome but armies, navies etc. are being fully mobilised and war plans are being put into operation ready for the command to fight.
Cold War : this term is used to describe the relationship between America and the Soviet Union 1945 to 1980. Neither side ever fought the other – the consequences would be too appalling – but they did ‘fight’ for their beliefs using client states who fought for their beliefs on their behalf e.g. South Vietnam was anticommunist and was supplied by America during the war while North Vietnam was pro-Communist and fought the south (and the Americans) using weapons from communist Russia or communist China. In Afghanistan, the Americans supplied the rebel Afghans after the Soviet Union invaded in 1979 while they never physically involved themselves thus avoiding a direct clash with the Soviet Union.
The one time this process nearly broke down was the Cuban Missile Crisis.
So why were these two super powers so distrustful of each other?
America
Soviet Union
Free elections
No elections or fixed
Democratic
Autocratic / Dictatorship
Capitalist
Communist
‘Survival of the fittest’
Everybody helps everybody
Richest world power
Poor economic base
Personal freedom
Society controlled by the NKVD (secret police)
Freedom of the media
Total censorship
This lack of mutually understanding an alien culture, would lead the world down a very dangerous path – it led to the development of weapons of awesome destructive capability and the creation of some intriguing policies such as MAD – Mutually Assured Destruction.

“ ” Under the four oceans and the seven seas, American and Soviet submarines fight a near-war every day of the year. Relentlessly, they search for one another, trailing an adversary when they can and trying to evade one when detected. They make every move of a real war, except shoot.

The Cold War was a prolonged period of geopolitical conflict between the United States (and its allies) and the Soviet Union (and its allies). It was called a "cold" war because the two sides never directly engaged in direct full-scale war with each other, instead using diplomacy, deterrence, money, ideology, subversion, propaganda, and proxies to try to best each other. [note 1] The main reason for this was that both "superpowers" possessed nuclear weapons, which, to most sane people, made the idea of a "hot" war unthinkable. Most events of the period were related to the Cold War in some way. One of the superpowers took sides in almost every conflict, usually provoking a response from the other. Even minor things like the movement of a well-known ballet star from one country to the other became part of the superpower dick-measuring contest. [3]
Due to the nature of the conflict, it's difficult to really pin down a start or end date. The classical start date for the Cold War is 1946, after the publication of the "Long Telegram" by an American diplomat in Moscow, which convinced the US government that the Soviets were a hostile force that needed to be forcibly contained. [4] [5] That said, it's also quite reasonable to place the start of the Cold War at the Yalta Conference during World War Two, when Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin diplomatically grappled with each other as to what a post- Nazi Europe would look like. [6] [7] Or perhaps it began even earlier in 1943, with the US discovery of widespread Soviet industrial espionage and their subsequent retaliation. [8] The end date, meanwhile, is usually said to be either the fall of the Berlin Wall or the dissolution of the Soviet empire (Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc ).
There is a recurring battle among historians over who "started" the Cold War, with traditionalists blaming Stalin and revisionists blaming Truman.[9] Most current scholars believe that between the mutual suspicion and the strongly differing plans for the post-war system, the question is really moot. When the Soviets were around, they claimed that the struggle started when a British -American coalition invaded Russia during their civil war [10] [11] and tried to assassinate Vladimir Lenin (some revisionists still rock this look). [12] :185-192 Anyway, the winners get to write history, or since nuclear weapons to end it .
There is also debate today over who ended the Cold War. A certain American conservative party claims that Saint Reagan single-handedly ended the Cold War with a speech in front of a wall. However, it's mostly accepted in the reality-based community that it was a combination of internal difficulties in the USSR (namely a large military budget, ethnic tensions, and the fact that command economies are stupid), Gorbachev 's attempts at reforms, a Pope, and pressure from various US presidents. It is an oft-forgotten (and inconvenient) truth that the Soviet Union's downfall was a surprise for all parties. [13] [14]
Defeating the Soviets involved the clandestine takeover of dozens of countries and attempts to control "The Grand Chessboard" of Asia, [15] home to more than two-thirds of the world's energy reserves. Most of the wars of the past fifty years has been a runoff of this goal. Many political scientists have said that the bipolar great power system that accompanied the Cold War was very stable, and many fear that the subsequent unipolar world could end up more war-prone than before; however, many also believe that the data so far suggests otherwise. [16] The number of countries possessing nuclear weapons has steadily increased over two decades, though, so it's not all sunshine and roses.

Origins[edit]
Canadian armored car in Siberia, 1919.
Although most conventional histories place the beginning of the Cold War at or around the end of World War Two, it's arguable that it actually began much, much earlier than that.
Already in the nineteenth century, the French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville observed that the United States and Russia were the two nations that were still enjoying prodigious territorial growth, to such an extent that they would each dominate much of the world. Tocqueville wrote in Democracy in America (1835): “Today there are two great peoples on earth who, starting from different points, seem to advance toward the same goal: these are the Russians and the ... Americans. Their point of departure is different, their paths are varied; nonetheless, each one of them seems called by a secret design of Providence to hold in its hands one day the destinies of half the world.”
Russian Civil War[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Russian Civil War
Some historians believe the Cold War began as early as the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. [17] :57 The Russian Civil War began when tsarists, liberals, Menshiviks, and others teamed up to oppose the recently empowered Bolsheviks.[18] The anti-Bolshevik alliance quickly received assistance from abroad.
Russia's former allies went so far as to invade it in order to stop the spread of communism (this should sound familiar). British troops seized Arkhangelsk in northern Russia, and American troops sent by General John J. Pershing joined them. [19] Also battling the Bolsheviks were French, Belgian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Canadian, Italian, Japanese, Czechoslovak, Yugoslav, and Australian soldiers. Although about 13,000 US troops joined the fight, President Woodrow Wilson 's vaguely-stated objectives prevented them from really doing anything, and troop morale suffered because no one really knew why they were there. [20] As always happens when foreigners invade Russia, winter cames and makes the situation unsalvageable, forcing the allies to withdraw from Russia. The intervention as a whole was bloody and pointless, and it permanently soured relations between the US and the USSR.
Hostility continued between the East and the West after the Bolshevik victory. Vladimir Lenin infamously stated that the new Soviet Union was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement" and that the Soviet Union and the world's communists would use subversion and revolution as the weapons by which they would spread their influence. [21] :62
Yalta Conference[edit]
Winston Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at Yalta.
The Soviets would later cooperate with America and the Western European democracies against Hitler and the Axis after Nazi Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by attacking the Soviet Union during World War II. However, the Soviets and the Western allies fundamentally disagreed over how the postwar map of Europe should look. The democracies wanted central Europe to be shaped into democratic republics, while the Soviets wanted an array of puppet states that would buffer them from potential western threats. [17] :156 In February 1945, the allied leaders met in the Crimean city of Yalta in order to resolve these differences.
The Allies, who had previously agreed to divide Germany into an east and a west, also agreed that all of Germany's war industries would be dismantled, that war criminals would be tried before an international tribunal in Nuremberg, and that none of the Allies had any further obligation to the Germans than to prevent them all from starving to death. [22] In terms of the disagreements, Stalin had the diplomatic upper hand since his troops were a mere 50 miles outside of Berlin. [23] The Allies, meanwhile, had competing agendas. Churchill was focused on ensuring free elections in eastern Europe while Roosevelt was more concerned with enlisting Soviet aid against Japan to end the war in Asia. [23]
In the end, Stalin played the democratic leaders like fiddles. In return for agreeing to join the United Nations, agreeing to allow free elections in occupied Europe, and agreeing to invade Japan when the time came, Stalin got the Western powers to consent to his occupation of much of the continent and a stake in Manchuria. [24] [25] After Nazi Germany fell, Stalin simply reneged on his promise to allow free elections and used his occupation forces to ensure that the nations of eastern and central Europe would become his communist puppet states. [22]
Soviet operations against Japan[edit]
Soviet invasion of northern China.
In August of 1945, the Soviet Union broke its non-aggression pact with Japan and declared war on it as they had promised to do at Yalta. The Soviets immediately invaded Japan's puppet state Manchukuo (previously known as 'Manchuria') in northern China, catching the Japanese by surprise. [26] When the Japanese put up stiff resistance at the Yalu river (on the border of Manchuria and Korea), the Soviets launched naval invasions into northern Korea (then a colony of Japan known as Chōsen). [26]
Japan then surrendered shortly after the US dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki. After this, the Americans landed in southern Korea and arbitrarily decided to split the peninsula along the 38 th parallel, ensuring that Korea's historic capital and largest city, Seoul, was in American hands. [27] Although both sides promised to hold elections and reunify Korea, neither side trusted the other and both wanted Korea to remain ideologically aligned with them. Thus, Korea remained split and eventually became the totalitarian communist state of North Korea and the capitalist military dictatorship of South Korea .
In northern China, the Japanese had no choice but to surrender to the Soviets, who promptly handed over most of the captured weapons and territory to Mao Zedong 's communist forces and gave them the upper hand in the inevitable resumption of the Chinese Civil War.[28] :338
Potsdam Conference[edit]
Back in Europe, the Allies met in the Potsdam Conference to hash out more details of their administration of Germany. However, America's new president, Harry Truman, neither liked or trusted Stalin, and the two leaders clashed over various issues. [29] :62 Stalin protested when Truman refused to allow the Soviets any influence in American-occupied Japan. [30] :28
The most pressing issue, however, was the US' use of two nuclear weapons against Japan. Stalin, likely realizing that Truman planned to use those weapons to threaten him, said that America's use of the weapons was a "superbarbarity" and that "the balance has been destroyed… That cannot be." [17] :24-26
The Cold War[edit]
Occupation zones in Germany.
Containment[edit]
The Iron Curtain[edit]
“ ” Nobody knows what Soviet Russia and its Communist international organisation intends to do in the immediate future, or what are the limits, if any, to their expansive and proselytising tendencies… From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.
—Winston Churchill, 1946. [31]
The rapidly souring relations between the United States and the Soviet Union created an atmosphere of confusion among US diplomats and policymakers, and the US' leaders had no real idea how to deal with a communist superpower. Hoping for advice, the US government contacted George Kennan, US Chargé d’Affaires at the embassy in Moscow in 1946. Kennan replied with what is now called the "Long Telegram", a document that permanently shaped US policy towards communism. [32] He formulated an early form of domino theory, claiming that communist nations naturally spread their ideology like a "malignant parasite" and that the US must take drastic measures both at home and abroad to stop this from happening. [33] Kennan also expanded on his points in an article published under a pseudonym, writing "the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies." [32] These helped Truman solidify his foreign policy into a doctrine that he called containment. As a result, the US finally abandoned its historical isolationism, and the US military budget increased from $13 billion in 1950 to $60 billion in 1951. [34]
Churchill, for his part, gave a speech in which he popularized (but not invented) the term "iron curtain" to describe the way that the Soviets were dragging the nations of Europe into despotism.[35] Stalin retaliated by comparing Churchill to Hitler, saying that Churchill wanted the "English-speaking nations" to dominate the world and claiming that the Soviets were simply acting in self-defense. [36] :143 The Soviet Union as a whole set the stage for its part in the Cold War by enacting the policy recommendations of the Novikov Telegram, a message sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US, Nikolai Novikov. [37] Novikov argued that the US had emerged from the war as an aspiring imperialist power that hoped to dominate the world, and saw the Soviet Union as its sole obstacle. [38]
Crises in Turkey and Greece[edit]
The USS Franklin D. Roosevelt in Greece, 1946.
The two superpowers were immediately pitted against each other by events in the Balkans. The Greek Civil War erupted almost immediately after the end of Axis occupation between Greek constitutional monarchists and Greek communists. [39]Turkey also became a hot spot in 1946 when the Soviet Union demanded that they allow unlimited Soviet shipping through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. Refusing to cave to Soviet pressure, the Turks instead chose to seek protection from the US and join NATO.[40]
Most importantly, however, these crises helped solidify Truman's containment doctrine. In 1947, Truman sent a message to Congress warning of communist expansionism, and they promptly approved $400 million for the purpose of aiding Turkey and Greece. [41] This created a pattern of US financial interventionism that would remain throughout the Cold War. US aid bolstered the right-wing forces in Greece, allowing them to eventually achieve victory in 1949. [42] [43]
The Marshall Plan[edit]
East and West.
In 1948, the US launched an economic aid program designed to stabilize the postwar economies of 17 countries in western and southern Europe. Although apparently an act of goodwill, the Marshall Plan was actually motivated by fear of communist expansion. US policymakers feared that poverty, unemployment, and homelessness in postwar Europe were reinforcing the appeal of communist parties to European voters. The US even offered aid to those nations occupied by the Soviet Union, likely hoping to expand their influence there, but the Soviets refused. The US distributed some $13 billion worth of economic aid, and the Europeans coordinated on their end by establishing the Committee of European Economic Cooperation, a precursor to the eventual Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). [44]
The Eastern Bloc shapes up[edit]
In the postwar years, the Soviets blatantly broke Stalin's promises at Yalta. Rather than allowing free elections in eastern and central Europe, the Soviets instead acted on their plan for a buffer area of puppet states. [45] They forced a communist government on Romania, cancelled elections in Poland, and executed pro-democracy advocates and politicians in Bulgaria.[46] In 1947, the Soviet Union created the Cominform, an organization nominally meant to encourage international cooperation among communist states, but in reality the legal mechanism by which the Soviets would control their puppets. [47] The Cominform effectively made the Eastern Bloc official.
Czechoslovakia was the lone Soviet-occupied country that managed to survive as a free nation. However, the Soviets were not about to tolerate that. Rather than wait for elections, communist forces staged a coup against the legitimate Czechoslovak government in 1948 and purged opposition members from government either by sending them into forced labor on collective farms or by outright murdering them. [48]
Josip Broz Tito, the communist leader of Yugoslavia, split with Stalin in 1948 and was expelled from the Cominform during the so-called Tito-Stalin split.[49] Tito's nationalist tendencies led him to refuse becoming a Soviet client, and he sought to build his own sphere of influence. He went on to violently purge Stalinists from Yugoslavia and found the Non-Aligned Movement. [50]
Berlin crisis[edit]
Meanwhile, the western powers merged their occupation zones in Germany while using Marshall Plan aid to rebuild its industry. The US had very quickly decided that a unified or neutral Germany was undesirable, despite the fact that the Soviets had met the preconditions set by the US for offering a new deal on Germany. [51] :67 In retaliation for the merge, Stalin imposed a blockade against West Berlin that closed all transportation routes and halted food and supply shipments. [52] [53] Rather than halting political unity in West Germany, the blockade actually accelerated it. All three western powers consented to a series of conventions that drafted a constitution and created the Federal Republic of Germany in spring 1949. [54]
In response to the creation of a West German state, the Soviets held sham elections in their own occupation zone. Voters used non-secret ballots and could only choose among communist-controlled parties. [55] In fall 1949, the German Democratic Republic came into existence. [56] [note 2]
The western powers also resisted the Soviet blockade of West Berlin, spurred on by a pro-western demonstration by 300,000 Berliners. [57] The US, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the tremendous "Berlin airlift" to supply West Berlin with food and other provisions. [58] Realizing the futility, Stalin backed down and ended the blockade.
Beginning of the nuclear arms race[edit]
“ ” On the morning of Sept. 14, 1954, in the Ural Mountains about 600 miles southeast of Moscow, the Soviet military exploded an atomic bomb in the air near 45,000 Red Army troops and thousands of civilians as part of a military exercise. How many people were killed or maimed or became ill as a result of the exercise may never be known.
—Marlise Simons [59]
Soviet espionage managed to obtain details of the US Manhattan Project, and in August 1949, the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb as a test in Kazakhstan.[60] The RDS-1, as the Soviets called it, or Joe-1, [61] :371 as the Americans code-named it, was extremely similar to the "Fat Man" device the US had used on Nagasaki. [62] :164 [61] :261 Meanwhile, the US was conducting nuclear tests of its own, starting with Operation Crossroads in 1946, the first test since World War II [63] and the first of many tests in the Marshall Islands. In 1952, the US detonated its first hydrogen bomb, which stunned everyone by creating a mushroom cloud 100 miles wide and 25 miles high and leaving a mile-wide crater. [64] The US also tested nukes in Nevada near Las Vegas. [65]
As the Cold War progressed, it was defined by the nuclear arms race between the two powers as they invented bigger and bigger weapons and more elaborate ways of delivering them, as well as means of counteracting them. [66] [67] In the early stages, the US built up its fleet of B-36s and B-47s, massive bombers designed to fly across entire continents to drop nuclear bombs, and the Soviet Union responded with the MiG-15, a jet fighter purpose-built for intercepting low-flying bombers such as the B-36 and B-47. [68] :5-6 In turn, this and other improvements in Soviet air defenses resulted in development of new high-altitude bombers such as the B-52 and attempts to refit existing aircraft for high-altitude flights by cutting down on weight. [68] :93,98 Later on, as nuclear warheads got smaller and lighter, so did the delivery systems. Nuclear missiles became more feasible, the US started fielding entire carriers full of aircraft that could carry "tactical" nuclear weapons, and there were brief forays into nuclear artillery (such as the Davy Crockett recoil-less rifle), nuclear anti-submarine depth charges (such as Mark 90) and torpedoes (such as the Mark 45, sometimes said to have probability of kill of 2, i.e. it destroyed both the sub that it hit and the sub that launched it), and nuclear landmines.[68] :9-12 The UK, France, and China also developed nuclear weapons.
In order to ensure collective 'defense' (mutually-assured destruction or "MAD") in the new era of apocalyptic weapons, the US and nations in Western Europe signed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into existence in 1949. [69] NATO planners projected that holding off a Soviet invasion of western Europe would require a huge army: an estimated 96 divisions worth, in the span of at least a hundred thousand men—men they didn't have. As a result, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became President of the United States, he attempted to compensate for the lack of manpower by encouraging the development of larger warheads, the production and deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, and covert CIA operations against the USSR and its allies. [68] :9
In the late 1940s, the US Army attempted to detect Soviet nuclear tests using highly-sensitive microphones strapped onto chains of balloons floating high in the atmosphere, as part of a top-secret experiment called Project Mogul. One of these balloons crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, and the farmer who discovered the wreckage and the local Army men in the area, neither of whom had any idea of its true, classified purpose, thought it was the remains of a UFO. It was later declared to be a weather balloon, but decades later, in the 1980s, conspiracy theorists brought back the idea that it was actually an alien spacecraft. [70]

The "Loss of China"[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Chinese Civil War
After the war with Japan, the Nationalist and Communist governments of China went back to war with each other. In the new Cold War climate, Mao's communists were given a number of advantages: the Stalinist-backed North Koreans provided supplies and manpower, [71] :110 and the Soviets handed the recently "liberated" Japanese Manchuria over to the communists to act as a base of operations. [72] The inevitable victory by the Chinese communists forced the nationalists into exile on Taiwan and doomed China to decades of brutal dictatorship. It also created a political firestorm in the US.

The "China Lobby" in Congress had attempted to pressure Truman into sending troops into China. [73] These people became harsh critics of Truman after the nationalist loss, saying that Truman was responsible for an "avoidable catastrophe." [74] :55–56
McCarthyism[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Joseph McCarthy
The "Loss of China" helped give rise to a wave of anti-communistparanoia in the US, spearheaded by US Senator Joseph McCarthy. [75] [76] McCarthy gave speeches claiming that "Communists and queers" had infiltrated the State Department and sabotaged the US' attempts to aid Chiang Kai-shek. [77] :145 These conspiracy theories were further inflamed with the publication of The Shanghai Conspiracy by General Willoughby, [78] a book which claimed that a Soviet-aligned cabal was taking over the US government and had been responsible for Mao's victory. [79] :156
McCarthy infamously claimed to have a list of communist spies in the State Department, although he never showed this list to anyone and repeatedly changed his mind as to how many communists were actually on it. [80] The more support he got, the more insane McCarthy became. In 1951, he accused General George C. Marshall of being part of the communist plot. [80] McCarthy's reign of terror continued as he targeted Hollywood, leading to the rise of the Hollywood blacklist [81] [82] and bringing Ronald Reagan into the national spotlight as he snitched on fellow actors. [83]
In the end, McCarthy actually damaged US national security. His hysterics led many in the Truman and Eisenhower administrations to dismiss the threat of Soviet espionage when that threat was indeed real, though not in the way that McCarthy had characterized it. [80] That threat along with China's entry into the Korean War fueled a new wave of anti-Chinese sentiment. [84] Instead of doing good work, McCarthy simply chose to focus on wingnut grudges and chasing after innocent and easy targets .
Korean War[edit]

See the main article on this topic: Korean War
Probably the most significant example of the US commitment to containment policy was the Korean War. Kim Il Sung 's North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 after years of hostility, catching South Korea and the US by surprise. [85] :7-12 Although the invasion was successful for the North, the war quickly turned against them when the UN sent aid. [86] The Soviet Union had boycotted the vote as part of their effort to get a Security Council seat handed from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, and as a result, the Security Council had the required unanimous assent for intervention. [87] :16 Sixteen countries sent forces to South Korea, although about 40% of the ground troops were South Korean and 50% were American. [88] :118
The success of the intervention led the US to abandon containment policy. Instead, US forces pushed past the parallel and into North Korea, triggering a Chinese response. [89] With superior Chinese manpower facing the West's troops, the war settled into a brutal stalemate. It ended with an armistice under the watch of newly-elected US president Dwight Eisenhower. North Korea became a totalitarian dictatorship centered around the Kim dynasty [90] :10-11 and South Korea continued as a violent dictatorship under Syngman Rhee. [91] :61-70
During the war, in response to reports of Soviet "truth serums", the United States Navy attempted to find their own truth serums under Project CHATTER, investigating substances such as scopolamine and mescaline. Around the same time, and possibly continuing long afterwards, the CIA was conducting similar research into using hypnosis and sodium penthothal in interrogations as of part of Project ARTICHOKE. These experiments paved the way for the infamous MKULTRA.[92] :387-389
Eisenhower and Khrushchev[edit]
Khrushchev and Eisenhower with their First Ladies.
“ ” Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin.
—Nikita Khrushchev to Mao Zedong. [93] :71
The new US president Eisenhower moved to reduce the US budget by a third in order to reduce deficits and eventually balance the budget. [30] :194-197 He did this by reducing the US emphasis on ground troops and instead focusing on strategic deterrents like air power and nuclear weapons.
In the Soviet Union, the bellicose Khrushchev won out over rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov in the power struggle that followed Stalin's death in 1953. Khrushchev shocked the world by delivering a speech in which he exposed and denounced Stalin's crimes. [94] [note 3] Although a positive action, it was ultimately a self-serving effort to solidify his personal control over Soviet communism and further remove any remaining Stalin loyalists who would could have threatened him.
Khrushchev also sought to create his own military alliance in opposition to NATO. Curiously, though, this plan began with a Soviet government application to join the NATO alliance in 1954. The Soviets never expected to be accepted, and the proposal was simply meant to give urgency to the creation of a communist military bloc upon its rejection. [96] The NATO members actually considered allowing the Soviets to become an ally, but ultimately rejected the proposal since NATO didn't accept non-democratic nations. [97]
Immediately following NATO's answer, the Soviets declared the alliance illegitimate since it was obviously targeted against them and ideologically biased. In 1955, Khrushchev went ahead and created his communist military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, largely in response to the creation and rearmament of West Germany. [98]
Hungarian Revolution[edit]
Soviet tanks in war-torn Budapest
“ ” The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed.
—Milovan Đilas, Yugoslav politician. [99] :196
As part of his program of de-Stalinization, Khrushchev removed Mátyás Rákosi, the Stalinist [100] [101] leader of Hungary. [102] This encouraged liberals in Hungary to begin pushing for more civil rights and freedom.[103] Popular discontent against communism and the ongoing Russian occupation led to mass protests. In November of 1956, however, the Soviet Union rallied its forces and attacked its own ally, killing 3,000 Hungarian civilians in a rapid and brutal invasion. [104] Many thousands of Hungarians were kidnapped and taken to the Soviet Union, [105] about 200,000 Hungarians fled to Austria, [106] and Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and his allies were executed. [107] [108]
The brutal Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution had a catastrophic impact on the communist world. Many communist countries were disillusioned with their own cause, the West was infuriated, and communist parties abroad saw great declines in membership. [99] :196 In contrast, some communists actually defended the USSR's actions, and some still do now. These people are often referred to as "tankies ", after the tanks the Soviet Union sent to subjugate the Hungarians.
Soviet split with China and Albania[edit]
Although the Soviets faced criticism for being too brutal, they also ended up losing their most valuable ally for not being brutal enough. The split began when Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his policies, as Mao had been fond of Stalin and his methods. [93] :142 Mao turned around and denounced Khrushchev as having lost his revolutionary edge. China and the Soviet Union began competing against each other for influence over communist nations. [109] The conflict hit its worst point when the Soviets publicly supported the 1959 Tibet uprising and then Khrushchev and Mao had a screaming match during a diplomatic meeting in Romania. [110] The Soviets broke off relations with China and withdrew their technical advisors, leaving the process of Chinese modernization unaided. These events fractured the previously united communist bloc and had critical ramifications for the later American intervention in Vietnam .
The split from China also helped cause the Soviet Union to lose another ally in Albania. Enver Hoxha, the dictator of communist Albania, had adopted a policy of sucking up to Stalin by defending and promoting the ex-Soviet leader's brutal methods of leadership. As a result, the Stalin spent the last years of his life investing heavily in the impoverished Balkan nation, greatly improving its healthcare and education systems. [111] When Khrushchev came to power and began denouncing Stalinist dogmatism, Hoxha and the Albanian prime minister Mehmet Shehu both considered this to be a serious threat to their power. [111] By 1960, Albania was openly defying the Soviet line by refusing to denounce China, and Khrushchev's government retaliated by refusing Albania's emergency request for grain shipments to alleviate an ongoing food crisis. [112] Chinese leaders quickly stepped in to fill the gap by providing the needed grain and industrial assistance, thus turning Albania into their faraway proxy and a thorn in the Iron Curtain. [112] By 1961, the split was complete. The Soviets had severed trade, expelled Albanian students from its universities, and withdrew its military assets from Albania's territory. [112]
Beginning of the Space Race[edit]
In 1957, Laika became the first animal to orbit Earth.
“ ” Our movies and television programs in the fifties were full of the idea of going into space. What came as a surprise was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite.
—John Logsdon, Director, of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. [113]
The nuclear arms race continued to escalate throughout the late 1950s as both superpowers began to build weapons with the explicit purpose of reaching each other's territories. [114] In 1957, the Soviet Union built and tested the world's first Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, the R-7 Semyorka.[115] [116] In October of the same year, the Soviets launched the first human-made satellite into orbit, the Sputnik 1. [117]
This naturally scared the fuck out of the American government, not only because the Soviets were getting the edge on nuclear weapons delivery systems, leading to perception of a "missile gap" and "bomber gap", [68] :14-15 but also because the Soviets were apparently very good at educating scientists (despite ideological setbacks) while the US education system was still churning out a bunch of racist rubes. In fall of 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act, which provided about a billion dollars in funding for US education at all levels. [118] [119] This began the US commitment to improving STEM education and racing with the Soviets to develop space-faring technology.
Even then, it took a bit for the US to catch up. In 1957, Sputnik 2 launched Laika the space dog into orbit, where she became the first animal to orbit the planet. [120] [121] In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to reach space and to orbit the Earth. [122] Alan Shepard got there about a month later and became the first American in space. [123] Not as impressive a title. The Americans did at least manage to snag the title of first meal in space the next year when, during the flight of the Friendship 7,John Glenn dined on some sugar tablets with water and a tubeful of applesauce. [124] Yummy.

Escalation[edit]
Berlin is closed for business.
The Berlin Wall[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Berlin Wall
In November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized "free city" by delivering a six-month ultimatum to the western powers to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin or face a renewed Berlin blockade. [125] This effort failed, and it put more light on the ongoing West Berlin problem. Around 2.7 million people left the GDR and East Berlin between 1949 and 1961, many of whom were valuable working age people. [126] In 1961, East Germany closed its border with West Germany and West Berlin. The GDR's Council of Ministers announced that "in order to put a stop to the hostile activity of West Germany’s and West Berlin’s revanchist and militaristic forces, border controls of the kind generally found in every sovereign state will be set up at the border of the German Democratic Republic, including the border to the western sectors of Greater Berlin." [126] This heralded the construction of the Berlin Wall, an infamous symbol of communist tyranny.
US and Soviet relations soured further when the U-2 spy plane scandal broke out in 1960. The Soviets had shot down a US spy plane and then President Eisenhower was embarrassingly caught in a lie when the USSR disproved his denials by parading the captured pilot in front of international news cameras. [127] [128] The aftermath of this incident prompted the CIA to create a plane that could outrun the missiles that shot down the U-2, leading to the development of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird [129] The flight tests for the SR-71 took place at Area 51; it is thought that some of the UFOs supposedly spotted there were there were actually sightings of the SR-71 and other experimental aircraft. The incident also caused US nuclear strategy to shift from high-altitude bombers to low-flying craft that could ideally escape radar detection. [68] :13-14
Shenanigans in the Third World[edit]
Communism also became a major force in the Third World during the era of decolonization. This was only to be expected given communism's anti-colonial stance as well as the fact that France and the British Empire were US and capitalist-aligned allies. The US feared that the Soviets could effectively get most of Africa and Asia on a silver platter as the newly-freed nations turned to them for protection. This influenced Eisenhower's decision making in the Suez Crisis; he publicly sided with Egypt over the UK and France as a means of demonstrating that the US was an anti- colonialist nation as well. [130] This benevolence would not continue in future administrations, or even Ike's own.
Under Ike's watch, the US helped overthrow the democratically-elected government of Iran at the request of the British in retaliation for their nationalization of Iran's oil reserves. [131] :775 This doomed Iran to decades of despotism under an absolute monarch. In 1954, the CIA launched a coup against the democratically-elected government of Guatemala, beginning four decades of civil war, dictatorship, and genocide in that country. [132] [133]
President John F. Kennedy deepened US involvement in Indochina, which later had catastrophic results in the ever-expanding Vietnam War. The Johnson administration sponsored a 1964 military coup in Brazil.[134] In 1966, the US aided Indonesian dictator Suharto in mass murdering over 500,000 people.[135] The US also helped bring the brutal dictator Augusto Pinochet to power in Chile by sponsoring his coup against the legitimate government of Salvador Allende .
These events and others are a big part of why the US is not well-liked in the Third World today.
Bay of Pigs invasion[edit]
The invasion force in Cuba.
Communists led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara seized power in Cuba during the 1959 Cuban Revolution, having benefited from the fact that the Eisenhower administration had refused to lend aid to the unpopular and despotic Batista regime. [136] :23–24 While Ike might not have liked Batista, Ike didn't like Castro any better. The president refused to meet Castro in Washington DC, and he left Vice President Richard Nixon to do the unpleasant business in his place. [137] :142 This was the beginning of a long period of hostility between Cuba and the US, culminating in various assassination attempts on Castro, under the Kennedy administration. The United States also "encouraged terrorism in the hope of provoking indiscriminate violence and repression, in order to weaken government legitimacy and attract new converts to armed struggle" [138] :127 in Cuba, another reason why America's stance on "Freedom and Democracy" is all the more hypocritical .
At the very end of Eisenhower's presidency, he allowed the CIA to explore options for removing Castro from power and granted them a budget with which to achieve this aim. [139] Kennedy approved the plan in 1961 after becoming president. The CIA had organized an invasion force out of Cuban exiles and trained them in Guatemala; and then they sent the invasion force to launch a naval attack on Cuba. [140] Just about every part of the plan that could possibly have gone wrong went wrong, and Kennedy abandoned the cause and refused to provide the invasion force with promised air support. [141] The result was a humiliating loss for the US that turned Castro into a national hero and permanently poisoned US-Cuba relations.
Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]

The failed invasion also pushed Castro into allying formally with the Soviet Union, and the Soviets pledged themselves to Cuba's defense. [142] :95 To this end, the Soviet Union moved a bunch of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Cuba, the kind that could hit the US with a nuclear warhead within minutes, [143] telling the native Cubans that the soldiers sent to guard them were "agricultural specialists". [144] Kennedy was not thrilled with this idea.
In October of 1962, Kennedy met with his advisers and weighed three possible options: 1) do nothing, 2) blockade Cuba (an act of war), or 3) launch a military strike. [144] Kennedy thankfully ruled out the military option, since there was no guarantee that all missiles would be neutralized before the Soviets could retaliate. Instead, Kennedy went with the second option, but chose to call the blockade a "quarantine" in an attempt to avoid outright war. [144] He then ordered the US Strategic Air Command to DEFCON 2 (the step preceding nuclear war) and ensured that 66 B-52s carrying hydrogen bombs were constantly airborne and replaced with a fresh crew every 24 hours. [144]
Perhaps the most dangerous moment of the entire Cold War came on October 27 th, when the US navy fired warning shots at a Soviet submarine that had lost contact with Moscow and was thus unaware of the situation. The boat was convinced that the Americans had declared war and attacked them, and only the dissent of Second Captain Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov stopped them from launching a nuclear missile. [144] In the end, the conflict was resolved when Khrushchev sent a private letter to Kennedy offering a peaceful resolution. The two leaders agreed that the US would promise not to ever attack Cuba again and (secretly) withdraw its Jupiter ICBMs from Turkey (which were a similar proximity threat to Russia as Cuban missiles were to the US) in exchange for the Soviets pulling their missiles out of Cuba. [144]
The terror of the Cuban Missile Crisis convinced the US and the USSR to sign the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which banned the testing of nuclear weapons unless conducted belowground. [145] The crisis also triggered the political downfall of Nikita Khrushchev. [93] :119
Vietnam War[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Vietnam War
Among the US' mistakes in the Third World was a long series of fuckups that helped railroad it into the quagmire in Vietnam. Beginning with the Truman administration, the US backed France's attempts to reassert colonial rule in Indochina. [146] Why? So the goddamn communists wouldn't win, of course! This was despite the fact that Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had an undisguised admiration and friendliness towards the United States. [147] Ho had stressed to President Woodrow Wilson that he was a nationalist first and a communist second and would have been perfectly happy cooperating with the United States. [148]
The French loss in Indochina led to the 1954 Geneva Conference, which partitioned Vietnam and created new states in Indochina. Elections were supposed to be held in 1956 to peacefully reunite the country and end the violent struggle between Vietnamese communists and anti-communists. [149] The US did not allow this to happen. Instead, the US began a program of sabotage against Ho's North Vietnam while propping up a capitalist dictator in South Vietnam, [150] and goddamn does this story sound depressingly familiar.
The decisions made by the Eisenhower administration regarding Vietnam at this point were made against the advice of the American intelligence community, who viewed the effort to prop up South Vietnam indefinitely as wasteful and foolhardy. [150] Kennedy escalated US involvement by increasing the number of US troops ("advisors") in the region. [151]
It was President Johnson who finally declared a full war in the region by sending huge numbers of US troops there. The ensuing conflict was an ungodly quagmire that killed numerous people on both sides and spurred opposition at home. The US' losing war in Vietnam likely represented the lowest point of its involvement in the Cold War; national unity had never been lower and its prestige and finances took some serious blows.
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia[edit]
Czech resistance to the invasion.
“ ” It is a sad commentary on the communist mind that a sign of liberty in Czechoslovakia is deemed a fundamental threat to the security of the Soviet system.
—US president Lyndon Johnson.[152] Hypocritical? Yes. Also correct? Oh, yes.
In 1968, elections in communist Czechoslovakia brought communist politician Alexander Dubček to power. This marked the beginning of the "Prague Spring," a period that refers to the Dubček government's attempts to liberalize Czechoslovakia, reform its economy, and grant more liberties to its citizens. These reforms were outlined in the "Action Programme", and this document promised an end to arbitrary arrests, more freedom of speech, more equal representation for Slovakia, and increased freedom of action for Czechoslovakia's industries. The Soviet Union did not like this idea. [153]
In response to the developments in Czechoslovakia, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev launched a massive invasion of Czechoslovakia backed by his puppets in the Eastern Bloc. Just like with Hungary, the invasion was conducted with great speed and most civilians simply went along with it out of fear, despite having supported the liberalizing reforms. [154] Czechoslovakia's liberal politicians were jailed, including Alexander Dubček. The new Czechoslovak government purged liberals from its ranks and quickly rolled back Dubček's reforms. [155] :100-101
To justify the invasion, the Soviet Union subsequently adopted the "Brezhnev Doctrine," which stated the any threat to communism in an Eastern Bloc state was a threat to all communist nations. Therefore, the Soviet Union would reserve the right to violate the sovereignty of any communist country that attempted to replace communism with capitalism. [156] The Brezhnev Doctrine would later be invoked in the Soviet- Afghanistan war. The Brezhnev Doctrine was also illegal under Article 2, Chapter 4 of the United Nations Charter, not that the Soviets or any other significant country really gave a shit.
Détente[edit]
Apollo 11 moon landing[edit]

See the main article on this topic: Moon landing hoax
Although president Kennedy had framed the Space Race as a means of boldly going where no man has gone before, it was in reality conducted with coldly political objectives in mind on both sides. During the Sixties, as the Soviets and the Americans began to take seriously the idea of going to the Moon, and this ushered in the era of either blowing up dogs and monkeys or shooting them into the cold vacuum of space to die. Poor Laika. During the Sixties, it seemed like the Soviets were pulling ahead, as they managed to put the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova), and had a Soviet cosmonaut conduct the first-ever spacewalk (Alexei Leonov), and then had two Soviet cosmonauts conduct the first ever space rendezvous (Andrian Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich). [157] In 1967, tragedy struck for the Americans when the first Apollo crew died due to an accidental fire in their training capsule. [157] The Soviets also lost a cosmonaut in the same year when his spacecraft's parachute failed and slammed into the ground.
After closing down for about a year, NASA then reopened in 1968 and hurriedly tried to catch up to the Soviets. Soviet propaganda was convincing the world that they were on the verge of doing a moon landing, although this was in reality nowhere near true. [157] In the end, US astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man on the moon, landing there with Buzz Aldrin in 1969. [158] There were a number of reasons why the US finally managed to pull ahead. Soviet scientists worked under harsh conditions and constant fear of punishment, while NASA encouraged questions and candid reports. [157] Soviet resources were more limited than what the Americans had, and they then divided their resources into pursuing the competing aims of two rival scientists. [157] And finally, the US had far more sophisticated electronics and computers.[157]
It's debatable to what extent the moon landing actually influenced the Cold War. Roger Launius, NASA’s former chief historian, argued that the moon landing increased US prestige and helped them gain allies in the latter half of the Cold War. [159] Other historians argue that the Soviets took Ronald Reagan's much-ridiculed "Star Wars" program very seriously because of the US' previous moon landing success, leading them to spend huge amounts of money in an attempt to counter it and speeding their own downfall. [160]
Soviet stagnation[edit]
Economic troubles were not limited to the Soviet Union: these Poles are waiting in line to buy toilet paper.
The Brezhnev years are sometimes called the "Era of Stagnation" due to the fact that the 1970s and 1980s were a dismal time for the Soviet economy. This happened for a variety of reasons, and many are debatable. The first was that the numbers of working-age people in the Soviet economy started to decrease due to declining birthrates and increasing mortality rates. [161] Mounting economic problems also seem to have had a negative impact on worker enthusiasm and productivity across the Soviet Union. [162] :416 These problems were also likely heightened by Brezhnev's increases in political repression and the unresponsive nature of his government. The Brezhnev government also seemed to have struggled to manage the increasingly large and complex Soviet economy, but it still refused to engage in any significant liberalization. [161]
Later, the oil crisis of 1973 shocked the economies of communist Europe, and the economies took longer to recover than the US. [163] :44-45 Other contributing factors seem to have included Soviet resistance to economic globalization.[163] :28
Stagnation had a greatly negative impact on living standards in the Soviet Union. The economic slump combined with the Soviet Union's lack of concern for consumer goods meant shortages and long waiting periods for things that Americans took for granted like automobiles, televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines while simpler consumer items like clothing and footwear were derided for their low quality. [164] This later became a political liability as later US president Ronald Reagan would gleefully mock the poor economic conditions endured by Soviet citizens.
Although the causes are still unclear, it's undebatable that the Soviet era of stagnation contributed to its eventual downfall.
Nixon goes to China[edit]
Nixon and Zhou En-Lai speak in Beijing.
“ ” Only Nixon could go to China.
—Old Vulcan proverb. [165]
Tensions between the Soviets and China peaked in 1969, and the two nations even fought an undeclared war with each other in Manchuria that may have killed hundreds of people. [166] In 1971, US president Richard Nixon stunned the world by announcing that he had been holding secret talks with the Chinese government and was now ready to meet with Chinese leaders in Beijing. [167] Nixon's visit had two motivations. The first was the wise realization that "there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation". [167] The second was the realization that the US could potentially ask China to pressure its North Vietnamese allies into negotiating a way out of the still-ongoing Vietnam War for the US. [167]
All of this diplomacy culminated in Nixon's historic 1972 visit to Communist China in which he held a week-long summit with their leaders. This visit paved the way for full normalization of relations between the US and China, and it also cemented US policy towards Taiwan as "we technically don't recognize their independence." [168] The visit also helped convince the Soviets to accept a thawing of Cold War tensions.
Nixon goes to Moscow[edit]
Later in 1972, Nixon met with Soviet leaders in a historic visit to Moscow. It was the first time in history a US president had visited Moscow, and Nixon met with Brezhnev to discuss reapproachment and cooperation between the two superpowers. [169] This quest for common ground culminated in the important Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, a series of bilateral conferences that resulted in two nuclear arms control treaties. The two leaders also sought to increase economic ties between their nations, especially sought-after by Brezhnev, who needed to bolster the stagnating Soviet economy. [30] :194-197 East and West cooperated once more in signing the Helsinki Accords, a non-binding agreement to be a bit nicer to each other. [170]
Communist infighting in Asia[edit]
Skulls of Ba Chuc massacre victims.
After the wars in Indochina, Pol Pot, one of the evilest dictators in history, came to power in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge, which had previously been influenced by communist Vietnam, then rapidly began distancing themselves, and Vietnam later admitted to the Soviets that they had zero control over what was happening in Cambodia. [171] It was around this time that Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge committed the horrifying Cambodian genocide, murdering between 1.5 and 2 million people in their insane quest to transform Cambodia into a tranquil agrarian utopia.[172]
Tensions rose between Cambodia and Vietnam due to a combination of territorial disputes and disagreement over which country should be the primary leader of communism in Southeast Asia. This culminated with Cambodia's 1978 invasion of Vietnam, and Cambodian troops exterminating any Vietnamese civilians that they found. [173] Among these atrocities was the Ba Chuc massacre, where Khmer Rouge forces murdered about 3,000 civilians, with one survivor remembering, "They shot my children dead one by one. My youngest, a two-year-old girl, was beaten three times but did not die, so they slammed her against a wall until she was dead." [174] The war was conducted brutally, and an estimated 30,000 Vietnamese soldiers died. [175] Thankfully, the Vietnamese emerged victorious.
China, however, had been a supporter of Pol Pot's vile regime, and they launched a punitive invasion of northern Vietnam that killed tens of thousands of people and ended inconclusively. [176] This conflict ended up being a blow to Soviet prestige, as the Chinese conclusively demonstrated that the Russian superpower was unable to protect their Vietnamese allies. [177] :297
Iranian Revolution[edit]
The US and the Soviets also generally agreed that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was a bad thing. The revolution likely became inevitable due to the US' assistance in making the Shah an absolute monarch who despotically mismanaged Iran. Tension erupted into mass protests and insurrection, and Ayatollah Khomeini became a leading figure of the anti-Shah forces. He called for an Islamist state, and this emphasis on religious law naturally put him into conflict with the Soviets. In September of 1979, the Soviet Union officially denounced the Iranian Revolution, calling it a disaster for Iran that only brought economic chaos, political persecution and repression of minorities. [178] When Khomeni's regime started cracking down on Iranian communists and expelling Soviet diplomats, the Soviets became their enemy. [179] They would later join the US in aiding Iraq against Iran in the 1980 Iran-Iraq War .
The Revolution had a far-reaching ripple effect, and it likely helped end the period of détente. The turbulence it caused and the US' loss of a major regional ally emboldened the Soviets to invade Afghanistan.
Extreme tensions[edit]
Soviet-Afghanistan War[edit]
Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, 1984.
See the main article on this topic: Soviet-Afghanistan War
“ ” For us, the idea was not to get involved more than necessary in the fight against the Russians, which was the business of the Americans, but rather to show our solidarity with our Islamist brothers.
— Osama bin Laden on the war against the Soviets. [180]
The détente period decisively and immediately ended due to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.
In 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power in a coup [181] [182] and reestablished Afghanistan as a "Democratic" Republic. [183] Once in control, the party implemented socialist policies, most notably land reform. This greatly pissed off the Afghan people, since property was confiscated haphazardly, causing agricultural production to fall and the economy to go down the shitter. [184] :115-116 On the plus side, the communists granted legal equality to women and established the Afghan Women's Council to improve their lot. [185] :222-228 This progressive step turned hardcore Islamists against the government. Unfortunately, there were lots of those.
The situation unsurprisingly exploded into a guerrilla conflict later in 1978, with the Islamist mujaheddin receiving aid from Pakistan and China. [186] In September 1979, Afghan president Nur Muhammad Taraki was assassinated by his political rival Hafizullah Amin, who was then assassinated by the Soviet Union in retaliation. [187] :25-28 In the chaotic wake of the assassinations, the Soviets sent about 100,000 troops into Afghanistan to "stabilize" the region. [188] :40-41
Soviet interventionism was immediately condemned by Afghanistan's fellow Islamic-majority nations. US President Jimmy Carter retaliated by withdrawing from the arms limitation treaties and then boycotting the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics. [93] :211 The Carter administration and even more than the incoming Reagan administration made it a policy to financially and materially support the mujaheddin insurgency against the Soviets. [189] This decision if anything exacerbated the problem (9/11, Afghanistan War ). The mujaheddin managed to kill about 14,000 Soviet soldiers with US help, and the whole affair became a quagmire that sapped the Soviet Union's already stagnating economy. [190] For this reason, the war is often glibly referred to as "the Soviets' Vietnam." [30] :314
Reagan Doctrine[edit]
Reagan and Thatcher's governments meet in the White House.
“ ” My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic. It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?
—US President Ronald Reagan. [191]
“ ” In the Soviet Union the fear that the West was about to unleash a 'hot' war was growing. The installation of the Reagan regime and its inflammatory rhetoric had so concerned the Soviets that at a session of the KGB high command and senior staff, General Secretary Leonid Brezhnez and KGB chief Yuri Andropov stated that the United States was actively preparing for a nuclear attack on the USSR.
—John Clearwater, nuclear weapons historian. [192] :8
Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election, among other things promising to increase military spending and attempt to defeat communism worldwide. [93] :189 He was joined in this aim by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His war against the Soviet Union began quickly. In 1982, he blocked the construction of a gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Europe, hurting their economy but also annoying America's allies. [193] Along with supporting insurgents in Afghanistan, Reagan sent the CIA to increase support for radical Islamism in the Central Asian Soviet republics. [194] This policy also called for helping Pakistan to train and radicalize Muslims globally for the purpose of conducting a global jihad against the Soviet Union. And that policy caused no complications later on .
After the 1984 U.S. presidential election, Reagan formalized his so-called "Reagan Doctrine". It called for the US to support any and all anti-communist movements around the world — this was unsurprising since Reagan had supported McCarthyism in the 1950s. [83] For the first time, the US sought not to survive the Cold War, but instead to win it.
Polish Solidarity movement[edit]
Tanks roll through a Soviet satellite state. Again.
In 1980, disgruntled members of the Polish public founded the Independent Self-governing Labour Union "Solidarity" (Solidarność) to push for more worker's rights and political freedoms by using civil disobedience.[195] :127-143 [196] The movement received significant financial support from the United States. [197] :589
Poland had long been a troublesome satellite state for the Soviet Union due to its long history of conflict with Russia, tradition of personal freedom, and strongly religious culture. [198] As a result, the communists' rule in Poland was looser and more flexible. Polish political society began rising after Polish archbishop Karol Wojtyla was elected Pope, becoming Pope John Paul II.[198] His visit to Poland drew crowds of millions and reawakened Polish national identity. This impetus fueled Solidarity, and by 1980 it had about 10 million members. [198]
Fearing the political movement, Poland's communist authorities put the country under martial law for almost two years. Once again, a Soviet satellite had tanks rolling through its streets, although this time they weren't owned by the Red Army. There was a reason for this. The Soviet Union was afraid of invading Poland, as their economy had become fragile enough to make any potential sanctions imposed by the West a real threat to their nation's stability. [93] :219-222 The Polish crackdown led to thousands of arrests and killed 91 people. [199]
Renewed arms race[edit]
Pershing II test launch, 1983.
Part of Reagan's strategy involved an intensified arms race against the Soviet Union. One of his proposals was the Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed "Star Wars", which he claimed could protect the US from an intercontinental ballistic missile launch. Despite this failure, it successfully incited the Soviets into greater levels of spending to counter it, as the shock of losing the Space Race had convinced them to take America's batshit claims seriously. [200]
In his first term and beyond, Reagan increased the size of the US military. It was, in fact, the largest peacetime military buildup in United States history. [201] :6 In 1983, the US increased tensions even further by deploying 108 Pershing II ballistic missiles to West Germany, [202] [203] [204] [205] which sparked protests across Europe. [206] [207] [208] This almost resulted in nuclear war. The tense situation in Europe put the Soviets on a hair-trigger, and in 1983, an equipment malfunction almost convinced them that the US was launching missiles. [209] In November of that year, some extremely realistic military exercises by NATO fooled the Soviets into believing that eastern Europe was about to be invaded, and they responded by placing their nuclear forces on alert and readying their air forces in East Germany and Poland. [210] [202]
In terms of weakening the Soviet empire, however, the arms race was a success. By the 1980s, the Soviets were throwing about 25% of their GDP into the military, neglecting their domestic civilian economy as a result. [30] :332 Soviet spending on the arms race exacerbated their internal weaknesses and worsened their natural economic slump. This also coincided with the post-OPEC-crisis surplus in the global crude supply that both benefited the US economy and grievously harmed the Soviet economy, which had become dependent on oil exports.
Korean Air Lines Flight 007[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Korean Air Lines Flight 007
The high-stakes standoff between superpowers caused actual deaths in September 1983 when a passenger jet flying from New York City to Seoul apparently strayed into Soviet airspace and was shot down by paranoid Soviet defense forces. [211] The Soviets claimed that their jet tried to fire warning shots, but this was either untrue or else the jet was using non-tracer shots that would have been invisible at night. [212]
The event was especially jarring because one of the passengers was Representative Larry McDonald, a conservative Democrat and kook ([213] [214] from Georgia 's 7 th District, and the second president of the John Birch Society.[215] Soviet leader Yuri Andropov accused the US of deliberately placing the civilian plane in the line of fire, while conspiracy theories in the US circulated claiming that the Soviets had actually kidnapped McDonald and the other passengers. [216] The event, along with the two nuclear close-calls, helped make 1983 one of the worst years of the Cold War.
US invasion of Grenada[edit]
“ ” Why are we invading Spain?
—US staff officer upon receiving orders to head to Grenada. [note 4] [217]
The United States invaded the Caribbean island nation of Grenada in October 1983, and this was one of the few US foreign interventions that actually worked out. First, some context. Grenada gained independence from the UK in 1974, but the Marxist-Leninist New Jewel Movement took power in 1979 and turned the island into a dictatorship. [218] The US wasn't happy about having a communist island nation so close to their old enemy Cuba. In 1983, political unrest resulted in the murder and replacement of the island's communist dictator with a different communist dictator, and the US used this as a convenient excuse to invade. [219] The UK and Canada objected to the attack because they had actually invested in the construction of an airport in Grenada. The US invaded anyway.
On November 2 nd, 1983, the United Nations General Assembly, by a vote of 108 to 9, [220] declared the military action "a flagrant violation of international law." [221] The US didn't really give a shit, because why would they? Despite the international backlash, the invasion was a rapid success. This was a major political win for Reagan, as he was able to point to it as a sign that his "rollback" strategy against communism was working (never mind that the country's population was <100,000). [222] The US made Grenada into a democracy, and to this day the island nation celebrates the day of the invasion as Thanksgiving. [223]
Iran-Contra scandal[edit]
Oliver North's mugshot.
See the main article on this topic: Iran-Contra
Reagan's aggressively anti-communist foreign policy led to a very serious overstep of his presidential power.
In 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front overthrew the Somoza dictatorship and aligned themselves with the Soviet Union and Cuba, although they never adopted a Soviet-style command economy.[224] [225] This made Reagan angry. The Sandanistas immediately came into conflict with the counterrevolutionary Contras, and the CIA naturally started training and supplying Contra fighters. [226]
During their struggle against the Sandanista government, the Contras were responsible for some sickening atrocities. In 1985, Newsweek described how Contras would execute their victims, saying: "The victim dug his own grave, scooping the dirt out with his hands… He crossed himself. Then a contra executioner knelt and rammed a k-bar knife into his throat. A second enforcer stabbed at his jugular, then his abdomen. When the corpse was finally still, the contras threw dirt over the shallow grave — and walked away." [227] :268 Contra leader Edgar Chamorro was quite candid about the fact that the Contras would routinely murder civilians but attempted to justify it all by saying to a US reporter, "Sometimes terror is very productive. This is the policy, to keep putting pressure until the people cry 'uncle'". [228] :309 It's worth noting at this point that Reagan called the Contras, "the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers ." [229]
Fully aware of the atrocities being committed by the Contras, Congress twice forbade Reagan from sending aid to them, first in 1982 and then in 1984. [230] To circumvent the Congressional ban, US National Security Council member Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North secretly devised and implemented a plan by which the US would sell weapons to Iran in exchange for Iranian assistance in freeing US hostages held by Hezbollah, and then the Reagan administration would use the proceeds to covertly aid the Contras. [230] In other words, the Reagan administration armed one of the US' most intractable enemies so that they could arm some brutal death squads in Central America. The scandal was exposed when the Sandinistas shot down a plane full of CIA-bought guns. [231]
In the end, Oliver North was sentenced to prison time, but later had the sentence vacated by an appeals court. [230] Like any good loyal attack dog, North took the fall for his boss by illegally destroying White House documents in order to prevent anyone from knowing how involved Reagan really was in the affair. [230] North later got a nice cushy job as the president of the National Rifle Association, and later as board member.
Beginning of the end[edit]
Gorby addresses the Communist Party Congress, 1986.
Gorbachev reforms[edit]
See the main article on this topic: Mikhail Gorbachev
In 1985, the Politburo unanimously appointed the relatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, preferring him over yet another elderly leader. [232] :14 He inherited a country whose economy had been stagnant for more than a decade and whose foreign currency earnings had sharply fallen due to the oil glut of the 1980s. [30] :331–333 These issues convinced Gorbachev to reevaluate Soviet domestic policy.
Gorbachev's leadership style was entirely different from his predecessors. He discouraged any cults of personality, conversed with ordinary citizens, and encouraged honest and frank policy discussions in the Politburo. [233] :228 The West started to see him as more reasonable and potentially less threatening. In order to increase his own power and make way for liberal reforms in the future, Gorbachev forced many of the Politburo's older members into retirement and staffed the Soviet Union's executive bodies with yes-men. [234] :100
By 1987, Gorbachev had become convinced that deep structural changes were necessary to salvage the ailing Soviet state. Thus, Gorbachev proposed a new program of reform called perestroika, or "restructuring". The goal was to make the Soviet Union economically competitive again by decentralizing the command economy and encouraging state-run businesses to become partly self-financing. [235] Among the reforms that Gorbachev's Politburo passed were laws allowing enterprises to adjust their activities based on consumer demand, laws that shifted control of enterprises away from state ministries and to elected worker cooperatives, and, for the first time since Lenin's New Economic Policy, laws permitting private ownership of businesses. However, Gorbachev in no way intended to transition into a market economy. He wanted to strengthen socialism, not undermine it.
He also proposed glasnost ("openness and transparency"), a reform agenda that he hoped would make the Soviet government more transparent. In effect, it greatly improved the situation for freedom of speech in the Soviet Union, as public criticism of public officials was now permitted. Although Gorbachev hoped to benefit the Soviet Union, glasnost backfired when the Soviet people suddenly became aware of the myriad deficiencies present in their country and government. [236] This led to an increase in social unrest throughout the Soviet Union.
Environmentalism in the Soviet Union[edit]
Decontamination team at the Chernobyl site.
“ ” Decay and desolation scar the landscape of a remote corner of the Kazakh Steppe. Unnatural lakes formed by nuclear bomb explosions pockmark the once flat terrain, broken up only by empty shells of buildings. It appears uninhabitable. And yet, ghosts – living and dead – haunt the land, still burdened by the effects a nuclear testing program that stopped nearly 30 years ago.
—Alexandra Genova, writing for the National Geographic in 2017. [237]
Glastnost received an enormous boost in significance from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. The Kremlin initially tried to cover up the disaster, causing general disgust at the government's prioritization of politics over their citizens' lives. [238] The relaxed political atmosphere of the late 1980s allowed for a great number of environmentalist groups to start popping up in the Soviet Union, often led by women who were concerned by the impact these issues would have on their children.
Shrinking of the Aral Sea.
Environmentalism also fed increasing tides of ethnic nationalism in the Soviet Union. Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Ukrainians, Armenians, and others started to perceive the Kremlin's general disregard for environmental safety as an effort to destroy them. [238] The Soviet government buried many hundreds of thousands of tons of contaminants from chemical weapons production, dumped untold amounts of radioactive waste, and launched a decades-long spree of mining and coal -burning that leaves Russia still to this day as the country with the world's worst air pollution. [239] Kazakhstan perhaps suffered the worst. Starting in 1949, the Soviet government tested hundreds of nuclear bombs in Kazakhstan, leaving the country with thousands of birth defects, cases of cancer, and other diseases that still persist. [239] The Soviets also exposed 60 million people in Kazakhstan to what former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called "one of the planet’s worst environmental disasters" by completely destroying the Aral Sea. [240] The place is a desert now, with vast plains that were once used for WMD testing and as a dumping ground for pesticides, industrial waste, and fertilizers. Armenia's capital, Yerevan, still has lead-polluted water due to the decrepit Soviet-era water pipes. [239]
The revelation of the Soviet Union's many environmental disasters had a catastrophic impact on public opinion, as people saw this as a blatant disregard for human life. [238] The ideas that Soviet-style communism was more responsible than capitalism and that national minorities benefited from Moscow's rule were proven to be lies. This was a major contributing factor to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Diplomacy with the West[edit]
Gorbachev's leadership led to a friendlier relationship with the West. This began quickly with the 1985 Geneva summit between Reagan and Gorbachev. Both sides left optimistic, although the US refused to join the Soviet Union in abolishing underground nuclear tests and also refused to end Star Wars. [241] They met again a year later in Reykjavik, but talks collapsed again over the issue of Star Wars. [242] In 1987, the two nations finally agreed to jointly sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned almost all land-based nuclear missiles but exempted sea- and air-based ones. [243] 1987 also saw Reagan visit West Berlin and give the now-famous "Tear down this wall!" speech, although many of his aides argued that the speech could have ended the thaw between the superpowers. [244]
1989 was an important year for the Soviet Union and the Cold War as a whole. Soviet troops finally withdrew from Afghanistan, as Gorbachev recognized that the war was a severe drain on the Soviet economy. [93] :235-236 It also saw the Soviet Union adopt the unofficially-named "Sinatra Doctrine", by which the Soviet Union pledged to no longer violate the sovereignty of other members of the Eastern Bloc. [245] This was likely an attempt to reduce the Soviet Union's military expenditures by abandoning its satellite states. And in December of 1989, Gorbachev and newly-elected US president George H.W. Bush declared the Cold War officially over at the Malta Summit, [246] in what turned out to be a premature declaration .

Downfall of the Eastern Bloc[edit]
Protests in Poland, 1988.
By 1989, the communist governments of Europe were on the brink of collapse due to economic strife and internal opposition, and Gorbachev's refusal to intervene in their affairs meant that the collapse of the Eastern Bloc was only a matter of time. [93] :235-236
Polish Round Table Agreement[edit]
Facing strikes and the still-increasing power of the banned Solidarity movement, the Polish communist government finally agreed to negotiations with the trade union. The result was the historic Polish Round Table Agreement, where Solidarity was finally legalized and both parties agreed to hold legislative elections. [247] This functionally ended one-party communist rule in Poland, as executive power was transferred from the General Secretary of the Polish communist party to an actual elected president.
Solidarity dominated the subsequent elections. They won every freely-contested seat in the Sejm and won 99 out of the 100 seats in the newly-created Senate. [248] :51 Poland was the first Eastern Bloc country where democratically-elected representatives held real power. Solidarity's candidate also won the 1990 presidential election. [249] With non-communists in charge of the government, Poland began to peacefully transition away from communism. [250] :59
Hungarian Round Table Agreement[edit]
Hungary quickly followed Poland's lead. Reformers took control of the Hungarian Communist Party, and in 1989, they voted to allow independent parties and public demonstrations. [251] Later in the same year, Politburo member Imre Pozsgay declared that the Hungarian government now considered the 1956 revolution to be a popular uprising instead of a foreign-instigated coup attempt. [252] This was a reversal of three decades of policy.
Mass protests in favor of democratization convinced the communist regime to follow the Polish model and negotiate with their opposition. The similarly-named Hungarian Round Table Agreement resulted in the complete overhaul of Hungary's government, establishing a Constitutional Court, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, and a penal code preventing arbitrary justice. [253] :109 The Hungarian Communist Party then voted amongst its members to transform into a democratic socialist party. [254] Thus, unlike in Poland where opposition forces seized control of reform, Hungary had its own communist party join the effort. Hungary held free elections in 1990 that saw the conservative nationalist Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) become the largest party in parliament while the Hungarian Socialist Party suffered a great defeat at the polls and did not join the ruling coalition. [255]
German reunification[edit]
West and East Berliners meet at the Berlin Wall.
During the process of Hungary's transition away from communism, the government there dismantled their electric border fence with Austria. This punched a huge hole in the so-called Iron Curtain that East Germans immediately started to exploit. [256] The East German government, meanwhile, was very pissed off about this. While worried, the Soviets did not intervene.
This created a massive refugee crisis as hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled into their neighboring countries, either hoping to reach Austria or else reach a Western Bloc embassy. [257] :67 At the request of East Germany's leadership, Czechoslovakia closed its borders to East Germans in order to stop East Germans from reaching Hungary. [258] :122 East Germany also shut down its border with Poland.
Celebrating reunification
Erich Honecker, leader of East Germany and General Secretary of its communist party, had miscalculated. By imprisoning his country's population inside their borders, he made it clear that East Germany would not be following the Polish and Hungarian model of reform. This was intolerable for the people of East Germany. East Germans started staging a series of large protests called the Monday demonstrations that the government repeatedly tried and failed to suppress. [259] The government started to consider conducting a mass crackdown in the style of the then-recent Tiananmen Square Massacre, but decided against this due to East Germany's reliance on loans from the West as well as the lack of military support from the Soviet Union. [257] :75 Annoyed by Honecker's exacerbation of East Germany's political crisis, Gorbachev had him replaced with the more moderate Egon Krenz. [257] :82–83 As an act of appeasement, Krenz reopened the border with Czechoslovakia, but this only caused the refugee exodus to resume.
Günter Schabowski, a member of East Germany's communist party, changed the world with a gaffe. Handed a paper listing temporary regulations concerning travel to West Berlin, Schabowski gave a press conference and mistakenly answered a reporter's question by stating that the regulations were going into place immediately. [260] Seemingly the entire population of East Berlin and its surrounding areas shat a brick at the news. People mobbed the Berlin Wall security checkpoints, and none of the officials or soldiers were willing to take responsibility for acting on the spot. Thus, they had little choice but to start letting people through. [261] East German civilians held an impromptu celebration there. Once opened, the border with West Berlin could not be closed, and the guards did nothing while people started hammering away at the wall. [note 5] Events moved quickly from that point. Protesters stormed the Stasi headquarters. East Germany held free elections in March 1990, and the Christian Democratic Union won on a platform of speedy reunification with West Germany. [263] Germany reunified in October 1990. [264]
Velvet Revolution[edit]
With cataclysmic events shaking the communist countries of Europe, reform in Czechoslovakia seemed possible for the first time since the Prague Spring was suppressed by the Warsaw Pact. Events began in early November of 1989, when riot police attacked student demonstrators in Prague, angering the public and convincing half-a-million people to join the movement. [265] Daily demonstrations occurred in Prague and started spreading to the rest of the country. On November 28 th the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia knew they were beaten and agreed to surrender their monopoly on power. [265] Czechoslovakia peacefully transitioned to a democratic form of government.
Romanian Revolution[edit]
Street battle in Bucharest.
The only violent revolution in the Eastern Bloc happened in Romania, and it was fought against the brutal dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu. He imposed austerity measures on Romania in response to the country's economic malaise that were deeply unpopular. He kept power with a violent secret police and maintained a forced cult of personality. Uprisings against him were inevitable.
Protesters assembled against him in various Romanian cities and started chanting "We want bread", and they soon added "Down with Ceauşescu". [266] The dictator is said to have flown into a frenzied rage when he learned of this, apparently believing that Gorbachev was plotting with the West against him. [266] He ordered his troops to fire on the protesters, and he publicly denounced those who refused. [266] This only worsened the situation, and mass protests swept Romania. Ceauşescu tried to restore his own authority on December 21 st by staging a show of support for his government in Bucharest's main square. [266] But the ploy went hilariously wrong when the crowds interrupted his speech to mock him on live television. Members of the Romanian army and security apparatus turned against him amid bloody street battles. Crowds nabbed Ceauşescu and his wife, put them on show trial and shot them. [266]
Dissolution of the Soviet Union[edit]
Protests and riots in the Soviet Union[edit]
Lithuanians take part in the Baltic Way protests
The late 1980s saw a dramatic uptick in domestic unrest inside the Soviet Union, due to a wide variety of factors. This started to become highly noticeable to the world in 1987, when authorities in the Soviet Baltic republics allowed protesters to publicly mourn the anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in which Hitler agreed to let Stalin annex the Baltic states. [267] Upon realizing that the protests had a nationalist edge, Soviet authorities unsuccessfully tried to suppress them. [268] Unrest also became apparent in Armenia, where 3,000 people demonstrated in October 1987 against the continued operation of a chemical plant and a nuclear power station. [269]
Memorial to Georgians massacred by Soviet troops.
Estonian nationalists founded the Estonian Popular Front in 1988, which began a genuine democratic and national liberation movement. [270] Lithuania and Latvia created similar liberation movements. Meanwhile, ethnic tensions between Azeris and Armenians exploded in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is an Armenian-majority area inside of Azerbaijan. In February 1988, Azeri mobs massacred between 32 and 200 Armenians in the area. [271] In June 1988, the Armenian Supreme Soviet approved a measure calling for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Armenian Soviet Republic. [272] For the first time in the history of the Soviet Union, two Soviet constituent republics were opposing each other. Protests spread to other Soviet republics throughout the rest of 1988.
In August of 1989, 2 million citizens of the Baltic republics joined hands to form a human chain across the three states in order to call for independence. [273] Said Juris Kaža, a Latvian-American journalist who filmed the event, "You could literally see that half the country was out in the road and holding hands." [274] The protest became part of the wider Singing Revolution, in which many thousands of Baltic citizens revived their illegal national anthems and waved the banned flags of their nations. [275] Just months later, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to abolish the communist party's monopoly on power and was followed by its fellow Baltic republics. [276] In the same year, Soviet troops massacred 16 protesters, mostly young women, in the Georgian Soviet Republic.[277]
Black January[edit]
"The Tragedy of January 20 th ."
In early January of 1990, Azeri crowds tore down the Soviet Union's border fences with Iran in order to reunite with their fellow Shiite Muslims. [278] For the first time, the Soviet Union completely lost control over one of its own external borders. This, along with the ethnic civil war happening in Azerbaijan and Armenia, convinced Gorbachev to intervene. Soviet tanks and troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, killing between 130 and 300 people. [279] Soviet troops reportedly shot people at point-blank range, ran over cars with tanks, bombarded hospitals, prevented the medical personnel from helping the wounded, and literally bayoneted the survivors. Although the Soviet Union regained control of Baku, this action lost them all of Azerbaijan. Thousands of Communist Party members in Azerbaijan burned their membership cards in the streets. [280] :93
The event could not be covered up, and international outcry was immediate. Human Rights Watch said of the events: [281] :3
“ ” Indeed, the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 was so out of proportion to the resistance offered by Azerbaijanis as to constitute an exercise in collective punishment. Since Soviet officials have stated publicly that the purpose of the intervention of Soviet troops was to prevent the ouster of the Communist-dominated government of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the nationalist-minded, noncommmunist opposition, the punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in the other Republics of the Soviet Union.
Parade of sovereignties[edit]
The Russian SFSR declares sovereignty.
On February 7 th, 1990, the Central Committee of the CPSU accepted Gorbachev's recommendation that the party give up its monopoly on political power. [282] All of the Soviet republics then held elections for their national assemblies. The Communist Party lost elections in six of them: Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, Armenia, and Georgia. The politically-independent republics began a so-called "war of laws" with the communist central government, struggling for more autonomy. In March 1990, Lithuania's Supreme Council passed the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, which declared that pre-1940 Lithuania was in existence again and independent of the Soviet Union. [283] Latvia and Estonia followed.
Boris Yeltsin had previously been a political friend of Gorbachev, but he was eventually put out to pasture after he started criticizing the government's reforms for being too slow. [284] Despite this, Yeltsin wasn't done yet. His credentials as a radical reformer made him popular with Russian voters. He won a seat in the USSR Congress of People’s Deputies, [285] and then in May 1990, he was voted President of the Russian Soviet Republic against the wishes of Gorbachev. [286] [287] As the leader of Russia, Yeltsin posed an existential threat to the Soviet Union. He put the USSR's largest republic into conflict with the Kremlin government. In a dramatic move, Yeltsin then resigned from the Communist Party, followed by his fellow radical reformers. [288] This action split the Communist Party for the first time since the Bolshevik-Menshevik divide that put Lenin in power in 1903.
Soviet attacks on the Baltic republics[edit]
In January 1991, the Soviet government attacked Lithuania in retaliation for its declaration of independence. Soviet military action in the republic's major cities killed 13 people and wounded more than 140. [289] This event further weakened the Soviet Union's position internationally and domestically, and stiffened Lithuanian resistance.
Realizing what was coming for them, Latvians spent most of late January constructing improvised barricades around the republic's important locations. Soviet forces attacked, but were forced away by thousands of Latvian civilians. [290] This event is now remembered as "The Barricades."
Civilians in Estonia also successfully defended their capital Tallinn's TV tower from Soviet forces who were trying to shut down communications for the entire republic. [291]
The August Coup[edit]
Defenders of the Russian parliament building.
August 1991 brought with it the event that effectively put the last nail in the Soviet Union's coffin.
Although their relations were strained, Gorbachev and Yeltsin shared a distaste for the hardline communists who sought to obstruct the reforms sweeping the Soviet Union. The two men held a secret discussion over how they might depose and replace some of those hardliners, including Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, Internal Affairs Minister Boris Pugo, Premier (head of government) Valentin Pavlov, Vice-President Gennady Yanayev, and KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov. [292] :513–514 Kryuchkov, as the lead Soviet spymaster, was already a paranoid man, and he easily got wind of what the reformers were planning.
Gorbachev, meanwhile, was planning the greatest of his reforms. The New Union Treaty was his last and most desperate attempt to salvage the Soviet Union. It would have entirely replaced the USSR with a new entity called the Union of Sovereign States, which would have been a decentralized federation. [293] Before the plan was finalized, Gorbachev went on holiday to his dacha. That's when things went pear-shaped.
The New Union Treaty was the last straw for Kryuchkov and his fellow hardliners. They flew to Gorbachev's dacha and confined him there, then assembled KGB troops around Moscow and emptied the city's prison to prepare for resistance. [292] :513–514 Yanayev made himself president and assembled the State Committee on the State of Emergency to help him run the country during its time of crisis.
Acting immediately, citizens of Moscow heeded the call of Yeltsin to gather around and barricade Russia's parliament in defiance of the coup plotters' military strength. [294] Troops attacked the Russian parliament, killing three people. [295] According to Sergey Parkhomenko, a journalist and democracy campaigner who was in the crowd defending the White House, "Those deaths played a crucial role: Both sides were so horrified that it brought a halt to everything." [296] Facing public resistance and having been delegitimized due to their murder of three people, the coup quickly collapsed. Government troops arrested the coup leaders and regained control of Moscow. Gorbachev was reinstated as leader of the Soviet Union, but his power was severely weakened.
Rapid collapse[edit]
Leaders from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine officially dissolve the Soviet Union.
After the August Coup, the Soviet Union collapsed with stunning speed.
That Gorbachev's position was destroyed became obvious to all observers. He resigned as leader of the Communist Party but not as President of the Soviet Union, effectively divorcing Soviet leadership from party rule. [297] Yeltsin then banned the Communist Party inside Russia and allowed Ukraine and Belarus to secede. Gorbachev's influence as leader of the Soviet Union extended no further than Moscow itself, and even there he saw his government being swallowed up by Yeltsin.
The Bush administration treated this as a crisis, as they feared that any border disputes or misunderstandings could cause the Soviet nuclear arsenal to be put into use. [297] The US carefully sent the message that so long as those republics honored each other's self-determination and international law, they could expect support from the democratic West. On December 8 th, Yeltsin met with leaders from Belarus and Ukraine to sign the Belovezha Accords, officially dissolving the Soviet Union and establishing a supranational organization called the Commonwealth of Independent States that was meant to foster cooperation among the former Soviet republics. [298] [299] On December 21 st, under the Alma-Ata Protocol, the remaining Soviet republics also affirmed that the Union was dissolved and then joined the CIS. [300] :195-201 They also agreed that Yeltsin and the Russian Republic would inherit the Soviet Union's Security Council seat. [301] Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as leader of the Soviet Union on December 25 th.[297] President Bush officially recognized all 12 independent republics. [302]
Lasting impact[edit]
Where would Tom Clancy be without his Cold War thrillers?
On United States culture[edit]
“ ” Thus were two generations of Americans treated by their overlords until, in the end, at the word 'communism' there is an orgasmic Pavlovian reflex just as the brain goes dead.
— Gore Vidal [303]
The Cold War had a profound effect on the culture and attitudes of the United States, and the lingering effects of these changes are still present in the average American's worldview today. The Cold War spawned McCarthyism and the fear of communists everywhere, accompanied by a slew of anti-leftist propaganda. Though McCarthy and his compatriots were eventually dismissed as demagogues and fear-mongers, they did manage to significantly affect the American psyche, instilling a knee-jerk hysteria of socialism and communism into many Americans. These undertones can still be seen today in the actions of anti- Obama protestors, many of whom are most concerned about Barack Obama 's supposed "socialist" sympathies. [304] Donald Trump has both a direct connection to McCarthyism via McCarthy's chief counsel, Roy Cohn, and in his actions. [305] [306] [307]
The Cold War also influenced cinema and popular culture, and many of the films produced during this era are based upon the concepts of MAD (e.g., Dr. Strangelove ), the bipolar state of world politics, or the Cold War culture. [note 6]
On technology[edit]
Thanks to the Cold War, there have been tremendous advances in technology. [308] For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS), which helps people get to where they need to go and freaks out many a paranoiac conspiracy theorist, was developed as a joint venture between the US Department of Defense and US Air Force, with the intent of tracking ships, targeting weapons, and other military applications. [309] It combined technology from previous satellite navigation systems used by various branches of the United States Armed Forces, such as the Army’s SECOR and Navy's Transit. [310] Transit itself was created by ARPA and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory before being handed over to the Navy and it provided navigation for the United States' fleet of ballistic missile submarines, as well as other military and civilian vessels. [311]
There were also a number of major developments in computer programming during this era. For instance, Fortran was based on a programming system called Speedcoding, created to help develop programs for modeling trajectory of missiles. [312] Fortran in turn heavily influenced BASIC, which is where Microsoft got its start. [313] [314] The US Department of Defense's Kinetic Impact Debris Distribution Model currently uses Fortran (along with C and C++) to simulate debris from ballistic missile interception, [315] and parts of the Voyager probes still run on the language. [316] There have been calls to expand and revive Fortran, from none other than Los Alamos National Laboratory, [317] which uses it to process data from nuclear physics experiments. [318]
Meanwhile, on the hardware side, the Cold War also saw advances in computing. Two of the first modern digital computers, the Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator (MANIAC) and the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), were instrumental in the creation of the hydrogen bomb, and the latter was built to create tables of data for aiming artillery for the U.S. Army Ordinance Corps. [319]
In addition to supersonic craft such the previously-mentioned SR-71, there were also some forays into vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) systems. Conventional military thinking held that in event of a major war between the great powers, the enemy would attack the other side's airbases in a preemptive strike, so aircraft might have to take off from and land on damaged runways. As a result, both sides experimented with various different VTOL designs. From these came the Harrier family of attack craft (which featured in the film adaptation of L-Ron's Battlefield Earth) and the F-35 fighter-jet, [320] sometimes considered one of the finest examples of the excesses of the military-industrial complex .
One of the more interesting experiments was the VZ-9 Avrocar, an actual, honest-to-goodness flying saucer propelled via ground effect. The United States Army hoped it to use it for conducting reconnaissance and, of all things, transporting troops, while the US Air Force planned to basically make it a stealth craft that could evade radar. In the end, though, it proved to be quite uncontrollable during flight and never left the prototyping stage. [321]
Other cold wars[edit]
Test launch of Agni-V, an Indian ICBM, 2012.
"The First Cold War"[edit]
As noted above, the pre-WWII era is often seen as a prequel to the Truman-Stalin drama, particularly where Woodrow Wilson and Lenin are concerned. [322] [323] Indeed, 1918, much like 1950, was a year with more "hot" war than cold as US and Red Army troops shed blood on opposing sides in the Russian Civil War.
Cold War II[edit]
Used to refer to the renewed tensions between Russia and the West, with Russia once again trying to rebuild its former empire. Unlike Cold War I, which was between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, this time NATO seems to be mainly fighting just Russia. Like Cold War I, proxy wars are commonplace, such as in Syria.[324] However, at this point, it's pretty much been proven that neither Assad nor the Rebels have any chance of winning, Russia and the United States both respectively continue to back them instead of the only democratic side. How this will end is unknown.
Throughout the end of 2021, tensions between NATO and Russia rapidly rose as NATO fears Russia will invade Ukraine. [325]
Middle Eastern Cold War[edit]
In a continuation of the centuries-old Sunni-Shi'a conflict, the Middle Eastern Cold War is led by the conflict between the Sunni absolute monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Shi'a theodemocracy of Iran. Various smaller countries in the Middle East have joined both sides, to the degree that Yemen descended into a civil war over it, which obviously almost immediately become a proxy conflict. The US has intervened heavily on the side of the Saudis due to it having the most fossil fuels.[note 7]
Indian Cold War[edit]
The Indian Cold War is a decades-old conflict between India and Pakistan, with Bangladesh to a certain extent backing India. This mostly consists of border disputes over Kashmir Valley, a mostly Muslim region under Indian control, and has turned to actual warfare three times, [327] and fought a fourth war when helping Bangladesh gain independence. [328] As in the major Cold War, both sides have a shit-ton of nukes simply to deter each other. Both sides still feel resentment for the genocidal riots resulting from the Indian partition.

↑ Today, an alliance with Saudi Arabia to ensure the flow of oil becomes less necessary thanks to hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling, both of which have enabled drillers to exploit deposits previously inaccessible, and the renewable energy boom. Still, if Saudi Arabia's oil stopped flowing, it would have significant ramifications for countries like China and Japan as well as the world economy as a result, so having some level of control over it leads to having a lot of power. This is also why the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran isn't as one-sided as it may first appear. Iran has the potential to blockade the Persian Gulf giving it an extremely powerful piece of leverage over the entire world. [326]

According to the journalist Kathy Kadane, "As many as 5,000 names were furnished over a period of months to the Army there, and the Americans later checked off the names of those who had been killed or captured." Despite Martens later denials of any such intent, these actions almost certainly aided in the death or detention of many innocent people. They also sent a powerful message that the US government agreed with and supported the army's campaign against the PKI, even as that campaign took its terrible toll in human lives.

Historiography
The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, which began following World War II. Historians do not fully agree on its starting and ending points, but the period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine (12 March 1947) to the 1991 Dissolution of the Soviet Union (26 December 1991). [1] The term "cold" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945. [2] Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race.
The Western Bloc was led by the United States as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of the authoritarian states, most of which were their former colonies.[3] [upper-alpha 1] The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World. The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world, while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world. As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945–1960, they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War.
The first phase of the Cold War began shortly after the end of the Second World War in 1945. The United States created the NATO military alliance in 1949 in the apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed their global policy against Soviet influence containment. The Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955 in response to NATO. Major crises of this phase included the 1948–49 Berlin Blockade, the 1927–1949 Chinese Civil War, the 1950–1953 Korean War, the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The USA and the USSR competed for influence in Latin America, the Middle East, and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia. Communism Bad.
Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while France, a Western Bloc state, began to demand greater autonomy of action. The USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the 1968 Prague Spring, while the US experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War. In the 1960s–70s, an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world. Movements against nuclear arms testing and for nuclear disarmament took place, with large anti-war protests. By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of détente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the USSR. A number of self-proclaimed Marxist regimes were formed in the second half of the 1970s in the Third World, including Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Afghanistan and Nicaragua .
Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979. The early 1980s was another period of elevated tension. The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from economic stagnation. In the mid-1980s, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of glasnost ("openness", c. 1985) and perestroika ("reorganization", 1987) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer.
In 1989, the fall of the Iron Curtain after the Pan-European Picnic and a peaceful wave of revolutions (with the exception of Romania and Afghanistan) overthrew almost all communist governments of the Eastern Bloc. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of its constituent republics and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The United States was left as the world's only superpower.
The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to in popular culture, especially with themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare.

Origins of the term
At the end of World War II, English writer George Orwell used cold war, as a general term, in his essay "You and the Atomic Bomb", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper Tribune. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear warfare, Orwell looked at James Burnham 's predictions of a polarized world, writing:
Looking at the world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery....James Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications—that is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of "cold war" with its neighbours. [4]
In The Observer of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, "after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire." [5]
The first use of the term to describe the specific post-war geopolitical confrontation between the USSR and the United States came in a speech by Bernard Baruch, an influential advisor to Democratic presidents, [6] on 16 April 1947. The speech, written by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope,[7] proclaimed, "Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war." [8] Newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency with his book The Cold War; when asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, la guerre froide.[9]

Allied troops in Vladivostok, August 1918, during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War
While most historians trace the origins of the Cold War to the period immediately following World War II, some argue that it began with the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 when the Bolsheviks took power. In World War I, the British, French and Russian Empires had composed the major Allied Powers from the start, and the US joined them as a self-styled Associated Power in April 1917. The Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November 1917 and fulfilled their promise to withdraw from WWI, and German armies advanced rapidly across the borderlands. The Allies responded with an economic blockade against all of Russia. [10] In early March 1918, the Soviets followed through on the wave of popular disgust against the war and accepted harsh German peace terms with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany to win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front [11] and by
relinquishing much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe. [12] [13]
According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt, "The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention," and proceeded to step up their "economic warfare" against the Bolsheviks. [10] Some Bolsheviks saw Russia as only the first step, planning to incite revolutions against capitalism in every western country, but the need for peace with Germany led Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin away from this position. [upper-alpha 2]
In 1918, Britain provided money and troops to support the anti-Bolshevik "White" counter-revolutionaries. This policy was spearheaded by Minister of War Winston Churchill, a committed British imperialist and anti-communist. [14] France, Japan and the United States invaded Russia in an attempt to topple the new Soviet government. Despite the economic and military warfare launched against it by Western powers, the Bolshevik government succeeded in defeating all opposition and took full control of Russia, as well as breakaway provinces such as Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. [15]
Western powers also diplomatically isolated the Soviet government. Lenin stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement" and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided. [16] He set up an organization to promote sister revolutions worldwide, the Comintern. It failed everywhere; it failed badly when it tried to start revolutions in Germany, Bavaria, and Hungary.[17] The failures led to an inward turn by Moscow.
Britain and other Western powers—except the United States—did business and sometimes recognized the new Soviet Union. By 1933, old fears of Communist threats had faded, and the American business community, as well as newspaper editors, were calling for diplomatic recognition. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used presidential authority to normalize relations in November 1933. [18] However, there was no progress on the Tsarist debts Washington wanted Moscow to repay. Expectations of expanded trade proved unrealistic. Historians Justus D. Doenecke and Mark A. Stoler note that, "Both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord." [19] Roosevelt named William Bullitt as ambassador from 1933 to 1936. Bullitt arrived in Moscow with high hopes for Soviet–American relations, but his view of the Soviet leadership soured on closer inspection. By the end of his tenure, Bullitt was openly hostile to the Soviet government, and he remained an outspoken anti-communist for the rest of his life. [20]
Beginnings of World War II
In the late 1930s, Joseph Stalin had worked with Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov to promote popular fronts with capitalist parties and governments to oppose fascism. The Soviets were embittered when Western governments chose to practice appeasement with Nazi Germany instead. In March 1939 Britain and France—without consulting the USSR—granted Hitler control of much of Czechoslovakia at the Munich Agreement. Facing an aggressive Japan at Soviet borders as well, Stalin changed directions and replaced Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov, who negotiated closer relations with Germany. [21]
After signing the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and German–Soviet Frontier Treaty, the Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—to allow it to station Soviet troops in their countries.[22] Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939. The resulting Winter War ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions.[23] Britain and France, treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the Germans, responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR's expulsion from the League of Nations.[24]
In June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.[25] It also seized the Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region. But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and declared war on the United States in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers worked together to fight Germany. Britain signed a formal alliance, broadened to a military and political alliance in 1942, and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its Lend-Lease Program. [26] Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers. [27]
End of World War II (1945–1947)
Wartime conferences regarding post-war Europe
Further information: Tehran Conference , Yalta Conference , and List of Allied World War II conferences
The Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war. [28] Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security. [28] Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations.[29] Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals—military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, and the creation of a world peace organization—were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom. [30]
The "Big Three" at the Yalta Conference: Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin, 1945
The Soviet Union sought to dominate the internal affairs of countries in its border regions. [28] [31] During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control. Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties. [upper-alpha 3] Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth. [32]
In the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda. With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors.
The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the "Percentages agreement" to divide Europe into respective spheres of influence, including giving Stalin predominance over Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche over Greece. This proposal was accepted by Stalin. At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin regarding Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations. [30] Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement, [33] [34] but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe. [35]
Post-war Allied occupation zones in Germany
At the Second Quebec Conference, a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12–16 September 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany based on Henry Morgenthau Jr. 's original proposal. The memorandum drafted by Churchill provided for "eliminating the warmaking industries in the Ruhr and the Saar ... looking forward to converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character." However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states. [upper-alpha 4] On 10 May 1945, President Truman signed the US occupation directive JCS 1067, which was in effect for over two years and was enthusiastically supported by Stalin. It directed the US forces of occupation to "...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany". [36]
In April 1945, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Vice President Harry S. Truman, who distrusted Stalin and turned for advice to an elite group of foreign policy intellectuals. Both Churchill and Truman opposed, among other things, the Soviets' decision to prop up the Lublin government, the Soviet-controlled rival to the Polish government-in-exile in London, whose relations with the Soviets had been severed. [37]
Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets effectively occupied Central and Eastern Europe, [35] while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe. In Germany and Austria, France, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States established zones of occupation and a loose framework for parceled four-power control. [38]
The 1945 Allied conference in San Francisco established the multi-national United Nations (UN) for the maintenance of world peace, but the enforcement capacity of its Security Council was effectively paralyzed by the ability of individual members to exercise veto power.[39] Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune. [40]
Potsdam Conference and surrender of Japan

Clement Attlee, Harry S. Truman and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference, 1945
At the Potsdam Conference, which started in late July after Germany's surrender, serious differences emerged over the future development of Germany and the rest of Central and Eastern Europe. [41] The Soviets pressed their demand made at Yalta, for $20 billion of reparations to be taken from Germany occupation zones. The Americans and British refused to fix a dollar amount for reparations, but they permitted the Soviets to remove some industry from their zones. [42] Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions and to entrench their positions. [43] At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a powerful new weapon. [44]
The US had invited Britain into its atomic bomb project but kept it secret from the Soviet Union. Stalin was aware that the Americans were working on the atomic bomb, and he reacted to the news calmly. [44] One week after the end of the Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.[45] Stalin was also outraged by the actual dropping of the bombs, calling them a "superbarbarity" and claiming that "the balance has been destroyed...That cannot be." The Truman administration intended to use its ongoing nuclear weapons program to pressure the Soviet Union in international relations. [44]
Following the war, the United States and the United Kingdom used military forces in Greece and Korea to remove indigenous governments and forces seen as communist. Under the leadership of Lyuh Woon-hyung, working secretly during the Japanese occupation, committees throughout Korea were formed to coordinate the transition to Korean independence. Following the Japanese surrender, on August 28, 1945, these committees formed the temporary national government of Korea, naming it the People's Republic of Korea (PRK) a couple of weeks later. [46] [47] On September 8, 1945, the United States government landed forces in Korea and thereafter established the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) to govern Korea south of the 38th parallel north. The USAMGK outlawed the PRK government. The military governor Lieutenant-General John R. Hodge later said that "one of our missions was to break down this Communist government." [48] [49] Thereafter, starting with President Syngman Rhee, the U.S supported authoritarian South Korean governments, which reigned until the 1980s. [50] [51] [52]
Beginnings of the Eastern Bloc
Main article: Eastern Bloc
Further information: Post–World War II economic expansion
Post-war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc, the so-called "Iron Curtain"
During the opening stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the Eastern Bloc by invading and then annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics, by agreement with Germany in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. These included eastern Poland (incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR), [53] Latvia (which became the Latvian SSR ), [54] [55] Estonia (which became the Estonian SSR ), [54] [55] Lithuania (which became the Lithuanian SSR), [54] [55] part of eastern Finland (which became the Karelo-Finnish SSR) and eastern Romania (which became the Moldavian SSR ). [56]
Central and Eastern European territories that the Soviet army liberated from Germany were added to the Eastern Bloc, pursuant to the Percentages agreement between Churchill and Stalin. The Soviet Union converted the territories it occupied into satellite states,[57] such as:
People's Republic of Albania (11 January 1946) [58]
People's Republic of Bulgaria (15 September 1946)
Polish People's Republic (19 January 1947)
Romanian People's Republic (13 April 1948)
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (9 May 1948) [59]
Hungarian People's Republic (20 August 1949) [60]
German Democratic Republic (7 October 1949) [61]
The Soviet-style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet command economy, but also adopted the brutal methods employed by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet secret police in order to suppress both real and potential opposition. [62] In Asia, the Red Army had overrun Manchuria in the last month of the war, and it went on to occupy the large swathe of Korean territory located north of the 38th parallel. [63]
As part of consolidating Stalin's control over the Eastern Bloc, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beria, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc that were supposed to crush anti-communist resistance. [64] When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed. [65]
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was concerned that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe. [66] After World War II, US officials guided Western European leaders in establishing their own secret security force to prevent subversion in the Western bloc, which evolved into Operation Gladio.[67]

Remains of the "Iron Curtain" in the Czech Republic
In late February 1946, George F. Kennan 's "Long Telegram" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War. The telegram galvanized a policy debate that would eventually shape the Truman administration 's Soviet policy. [68] Washington's opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran. [69] Following the WWII Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south. [70] Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities. [70] However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the Azerbaijan People's Government and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad.[71] Shortly thereafter, on 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous "Iron Curtain" speech in Fulton, Missouri. [72] The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an "iron curtain" dividing Europe from "Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic". [57] [73]
A week later, on 13 March, Stalin responded vigorously to the speech, saying that Churchill could be compared to Hitler insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of English-speaking nations so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination, and that such a declaration was "a call for war on the USSR." The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere. He argued that there was nothing surprising in "the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, [was] trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries". [74] [75]
European military alliances
European economic alliances
Soviet demands to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles in the Turkish Straits crisis and Black Sea border disputes were also a major factor in increasing tensions. [76] [69] In September, the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and "co-authored" by Vyacheslav Molotov; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability "to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war". [77] On 6 September 1946, James F. Byrnes delivered a speech in Germany repudiating the Morgenthau Plan (a proposal to partition and de-industrialize post-war Germany) and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. [78] As Byrnes admitted a month later, "The nub of our program was to win the German people ... it was a battle between us and Russia over minds ..." [79] In December, the Soviets agreed to withdraw from Iran after persistent US pressure, an early success of containment policy.
By 1947, US president Harry S. Truman was outraged by the perceived resistance of the Soviet Union to American demands in Iran, Turkey, and Greece, as well as Soviet rejection of the Baruch Plan on nuclear weapons. [80] In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Kingdom of Greece in its civil war against Communist-led insurgents. [81] The US government responded to this announcement by adopting a policy of containment,[82] with the goal of stopping the spread of communism. Truman delivered a speech calling for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes. [82] American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence even though Stalin had told the Communist Party to cooperate with the British-backed government. [83] (The insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito 's Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against Stalin's wishes.) [84] [85]
Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. [86] Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, [87] while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, [88] adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-nuclear movement.[89]

Construction in West Berlin under Marshall Plan aid
In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. [90] In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. [90] Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program led to the creation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation .
The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections. [91] The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery. [92] One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US defense policy in the Cold War. [93]
Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. [94] Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. [94] The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ). [84] Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union. [95]
In early 1948, following reports of strengthening "reactionary elements", Soviet operatives executed a coup d'état in Czechoslovakia, the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures. [96] The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point, set in motion a brief scare that war would occur, and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress. [97]
The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war.[93] Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist–Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948.[98]
Espionage
Main articles: Cold War espionage, American espionage in the Soviet Union and Russian Federation, and Soviet espionage in the United States
All major powers engaged in espionage, using a great variety of spies, double agents, moles, and new technologies such as the tapping of telephone cables. [99] The most famous and active organizations were the American CIA,[100] the Soviet KGB (preceded by international operations of the Soviet NKVD, MGB, and GRU ), [101] and the British MI6. The East German Stasi was formally concerned with internal security, but its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance operated espionage activities around the world. [102] The CIA secretly subsidized and promoted anti-communist cultural activities and organizations. [103] The CIA was also involved in European politics, especially in Italy. [104] Espionage took place all over the world, but Berlin was the most important battleground for spying activity. [105] Although to an extent disinformation had always existed, the term itself was invented, and the strategy formalized by a black propaganda department of the Soviet KGB. [106] [107]
Based on the amount of top-secret Cold War archival information that has been released, historian Raymond L. Garthoff concludes there probably was parity in the quantity and quality of secret information obtained by each side. However, the Soviets probably had an advantage in terms of HUMINT (human intelligence or interpersonal espionage)  and "sometimes in its reach into high policy circles." In terms of decisive impact, however, he concludes: [108]
We also can now have high confidence in the judgment that there were no successful "moles" at the political decision-making level on either side. Similarly, there is no evidence, on either side, of any major political or military decision that was prematurely discovered through espionage and thwarted by the other side. There also is no evidence of any major political or military decision that was crucially influenced (much less generated) by an agent of the other side.
According to historian Robert Louis Benson, "Washington's forte was 'signals' intelligence --the procurement and analysis of coded foreign messages." leading to the Venona project or Venona intercepts, which monitored the communications of Soviet intelligence agents. [109] Moynihan wrote that the Venona project contained "overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds." [110] The Venona project was kept highly secret even from policymakers until the Moynihan Commission in 1995. [110] Despite this, the decryption project had already been betrayed to the USSR by Kim Philby and Bill Weisband in 1946, [110] [111] as was discovered by the US by 1950. [112] Nonetheless, the Soviets had to keep their discovery of the program secret, too, and continued leaking their own information, some of which was still useful to the American program. [111] According to Moynihan, even President Truman may not have been fully informed of Venona, which may have left him unaware of the extent of Soviet espionage. [113] [114]
Clandestine atomic spies from the Soviet Union, who infiltrated the Manhattan Project at various points during WWII, played a major role in increasing tensions that led to the Cold War. [109]
In addition to usual espionage, the Western agencies paid special attention to debriefing Eastern Bloc defectors.[115][citation not found]Edward Jay Epstein describes that the CIA understood that the KGB used "provocations", or fake defections, as a trick to embarrass Western intelligence and establish Soviet double agents. As a result, from 1959 to 1973, the CIA required that East Bloc defectors went through a counterintelligence investigation before being recruited as a source of intelligence. [116]
During the late 1970s and 1980s, the KGB perfected its use of espionage to sway and distort diplomacy. [117] Active measures were "clandestine operations designed to further Soviet foreign policy goals", consisting of disinformation, forgeries, leaks to foreign media, and the channeling of aid to militant groups. [118] Retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin, former head of Foreign Counter Intelligence for the KGB (1973–1979), described active measures as "the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence ". [119] During the Sino-Soviet split, "spy wars" also occurred between the USSR and PRC. [120]
Cominform and the Tito–Stalin Split
Main articles: Cominform and Tito–Stalin Split
In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform to impose orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the Eastern Bloc. [94] Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position and began accepting money from the United States. [121]
Besides Berlin, the status of the city of Trieste was at issue.  Until the break between Tito and Stalin, the Western powers and the Eastern bloc faced each other uncompromisingly. In addition to capitalism and communism, Italians and Slovenes, monarchists and republicans as well as war winners and losers often faced each other irreconcilably. The neutral buffer state Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the United Nations, was split up and dissolved in 1954 and 1975, also because of the détente between the West and Tito. [122] [123]
Berlin Blockade and Airlift
Main article: Berlin Blockade
C-47s unloading at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin during the Berlin Blockade
The United States and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into "Bizonia" (1 January 1947, later "Trizonia" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949). [124] As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system. [125] In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the west German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased. [126] The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower "in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements." [127]
Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin.[128] The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions. [129]
The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change. Once again the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the Berlin municipal elections (as they had done in the 1946 elections), [124] which were held on 5 December 1948 and produced a turnout of 86.3% and an overwhelming victory for the non-communist parties. [130] The results effectively divided the city into East and West, the latter comprising US, British and French sectors. 300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue, [131] and US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created "Operation Vittles ", which supplied candy to German children. [132] The Airlift was as much a logistical as a political and psychological success for the West; it firmly linked West Berlin to the United States. [133] In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade. [64] [134]
In 1952, Stalin repeatedly proposed a plan to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations, if the new Germany were to stay out of Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers. Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal. [135]
Beginnings of NATO and Radio Free Europe

President Truman signs the North Atlantic Treaty with guests in the Oval Office.
Britain, France, the United States, Canada and other eight western European countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty of April 1949, establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). [64] That August, the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR.[84] Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, [125] [136] the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949. [137] The Soviet Union proclaimed its zone of occupation in Germany the German Democratic Republic that October. [41]
Media in the Eastern Bloc was an organ of the state, completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party. Radio and television organizations were state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. [138] Soviet radio broadcasts used Marxist rhetoric to attack capitalism, emphasizing themes of labor exploitation, imperialism and war-mongering. [139]
Along with the broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, [140] a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful demise of the communist system in the Eastern Bloc. [141] Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press. [141] Radio Free Europe was a product of some of the most prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan. [142]
American policymakers, including Kennan and John Foster Dulles, acknowledged that the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas. [142] The United States, acting through the CIA, funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world. [143] The CIA also covertly sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called Crusade for Freedom.[144]
German rearmament
Main article: West German rearmament
The rearmament of West Germany was achieved in the early 1950s. The main promoter was Adenauer, with France the main opponent. Washington had the decisive voice. It was strongly supported by the Pentagon (the US military leadership), and weakly opposed by President Truman; the State Department was ambivalent. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 changed the calculations and Washington now gave full support. That also involved naming Dwight D. Eisenhower in charge of NATO forces, and sending more American troops to West Germany. There was a strong promise that West Germany would not develop nuclear weapons. [145]
Widespread fears of another rise of German militarism necessitated the new military to operate within an alliance framework, under NATO command. [146] In 1955, Washington secured full German membership of NATO. [41] In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO. [147] The events led to the establishment of the Bundeswehr, the West German military, in 1955. [148] [149]
Chinese Civil War, SEATO, and NSC-68
Main article: Cold War in Asia
Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in Moscow, December 1949
In 1949, Mao Zedong 's People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek 's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China. The KMT moved to Taiwan. The Kremlin promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. [150] According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism.[151]
Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its containment doctrine. [84] In NSC 68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council instituted a Machiavellian policy [152] while proposing to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense. [84] Truman, under the influence of advisor Paul Nitze, saw containment as implying complete rollback of Soviet influence in all its forms. [153]
United States officials moved to expand this version of containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere. [154] In this way, this US would exercise "preponderant power ," oppose neutrality, and establish global hegemony.[153] In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "Pactomania "), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases. [41]

In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, [upper-alpha 5] [155] [156] Kim Il-sung 's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel. Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion [upper-alpha 6] but ultimately sent advisers. [157] To Stalin's surprise, [84] the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan, not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council. [158] A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea, [159] although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States. [160]

The US initially seemed to follow containment when it first entered the war. This directed the US's action to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty while allowing North Korea's survival as a state. However, the success of the Inchon landing inspired the US/UN forces to pursue a rollback strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thereby allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices. [161] General Douglas MacArthur then advanced across the 38th Parallel into North Korea. The Chinese, fearful of a possible US invasion, sent in a large army and defeated the U.N. forces, pushing them back below the 38th parallel. Truman publicly hinted that he might use his "ace in the hole" of the atomic bomb, but Mao was unmoved. [162] The episode was used to support the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback. The Communists were later pushed to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Among other effects, the Korean War galvanised NATO to develop a military structure. [163] Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. [164]
After the Armistice was approved in July 1953, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship that accorded his family unlimited power while generating a pervasive cult of personality.[165] [166] In the South, the American-backed dictator Syngman Rhee ran a violently anti-communist and authoritarian regime. [167] While Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea continued to be ruled by a military government of former Japanese collaborators until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s. [168]
Crisis and escalation (1953–1962)
Main article: Cold War (1953–1962)
Khrushchev, Eisenhower and de-Stalinization
NATO and Warsaw Pact troop strengths in Europe in 1959
In 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War. [93] Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January. During the last 18 months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively. [84]
After the death of Joseph Stalin, Georgy Malenkov initially succeeded him as leader of the Soviet Union only to be quickly removed and replaced by Nikita Khrushchev. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes.[169] As part of a new campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past. [93]
From left to right: Soviet head of state Kliment Voroshilov, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and Finnish president Urho Kekkonen at Moscow in 1960.
On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western dignitaries at a reception in Moscow's Polish embassy, Khrushchev infamously declared, "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you ", shocking everyone present. [upper-alpha 7] He would later say he had not been referring to nuclear war, but the historically fated victory of communism over capitalism. [170] In 1961, Khrushchev boasted that, even if the Soviet Union was currently behind the West, its housing shortage would disappear within ten years, consumer goods would be made abundant, and the "construction of a communist society" would be completed "in the main" within no more than two decades. [171]
Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, initiated a "New Look" for the containment strategy, calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime. [93] Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of "massive retaliation ", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression. Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis.[84] US plans for nuclear war in the late 1950s included the "systematic destruction" of 1,200 major urban centers in the Eastern Bloc and China, including Moscow, East Berlin and Beijing, with their civilian populations among the primary targets. [172] [upper-alpha 8]
In spite of these threats, there were substantial hopes for detente when an upswing in diplomacy took place in 1959, including a two-week visit by Khrushchev to the US, and plans for a two-power summit for May 1960. The latter was disturbed by the U-2 spy plane scandal, however, in which Eisenhower was caught lying to the world about the intrusion of American surveillance aircraft into Soviet territory. [173] [174]
Warsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution

While Stalin 's death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions, the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. [175] The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955. It stood opposed to NATO. [41]
The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 occurred shortly after Khrushchev arranged the removal of Hungary's Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi.[176] In response to a popular uprising, [upper-alpha 9] the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Army invaded. [177] Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, [178] and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos. [179] Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials. [upper-alpha 10]
From 1957 through 1961, Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation. He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. According to John Lewis Gaddis, Khrushchev rejected Stalin's "belief in the inevitability of war," however. The new leader declared his ultimate goal was "peaceful coexistence ". [180] In Khrushchev's formulation, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own, [181] as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities, [182] which remained for decades until Gorbachev's later "new thinking" envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle. [183]
The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the communist parties of the world, particularly in Western Europe, with great decline in membership as many in both western and socialist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response. [184] The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership, a fact that was immediately recognized by some, such as the Yugoslavian politician Milovan Đilas who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that "The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed". [184]
Rapacki Plan and Berlin Crisis of 1958–1959
Further information: Rapacki Plan and Berlin Crisis of 1958–1959
In 1957 Polish foreign minister Adam Rapacki proposed the Rapacki Plan for a nuclear free zone in central Europe. Public opinion tended to be favourable in the  West, but it was rejected by leaders of West Germany, Britain, France and the United States. They feared it would leave the powerful conventional armies of the Warsaw Pact dominant over the weaker NATO armies. [185]
During November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized "free city". He gave the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Khrushchev earlier explained to Mao Zedong that "Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin." [186] NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question. [187]
American military buildup
Main article: Flexible response
John F. Kennedy 's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests. Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism. President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks on all of the Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money. Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts. Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war. [188]
To support his new strategy, Kennedy ordered a massive increase in defense spending. He sought, and Congress provided, a rapid build-up of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Union—he claimed in 1960 that Eisenhower had lost it because of excessive concern with budget deficits. In his inaugural address, Kennedy promised "to bear any burden" in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapons systems. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. He called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war. In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military–industrial complex, Kennedy focused on arms buildup. [189] [190]
Competition in the Third World
Main articles: Decolonization#After 1945, Wars of national liberation, 1953 Iranian coup d'état, 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, Congo Crisis, and 1954 Geneva Conference
Western colonial empires in Asia and Africa all collapsed in the years after 1945.
Nationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina, were often allied with communist groups or otherwise perceived to be unfriendly to Western interests. [93] In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s. [191] Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence. [192] The Kremlin saw continuing territorial losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. [193]
The United States used the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to undermine neutral or hostile Third World governments and to support allied ones. [194] In 1953, President Eisenhower implemented Operation Ajax, a covert coup operation to overthrow the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. The popularly elected Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951. Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was "increasingly turning towards Communist influence." [195] [196] [197] The pro-Western shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, assumed control as an autocratic monarch. [198] The shah's policies included banning the communist Tudeh Party of Iran, and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK, the shah's domestic security and intelligence agency.
In Guatemala, a banana republic, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz with material CIA support. [199] The post-Arbenz government—a military junta headed by Carlos Castillo Armas —repealed a progressive land reform law, returned nationalized property belonging to the United Fruit Company, set up a National Committee of Defense Against Communism, and decreed a Preventive Penal Law Against Communism at the request of the United States. [200]
The non-aligned Indonesian government of Sukarno was faced with a major threat to its legitimacy beginning in 1956 when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from Jakarta. After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders. In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia party. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds Padang and Manado. By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961. [201]
1961 Soviet stamp commemorating Patrice Lumumba, assassinated prime minister of the Republic of the Congo
In the Republic of the Congo, newly independent from Belgium since June 1960, the Congo Crisis erupted on July 5 leading to the secession of the regions Katanga and South Kasai. CIA-backed President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September over massacres by the armed forces during the invasion of South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country. [202] [203] Later the CIA-backed Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko quickly mobilized his forces to seize power through a military coup d'état, [203] and worked with Western intelligence agencies to imprison Lumumba and hand him over to Katangan authorities who executed him by firing squad. [204] [205]
In British Guiana, the leftist People's Progressive Party (PPP) candidate Cheddi Jagan won the position of chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953 but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution. [206] Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. [207] Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961, despite Britain's shift to a reconsideration of its view of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time. The United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office. [208]
Worn down by the communist guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Viet Minh rebels at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in Vietnam. In the Geneva Conference, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower's United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam's pro-Western regime against communist efforts to destabilize it. [84]
Many emerging nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the East–West competition. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War. [209] The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961. [93] Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America. [84]

Non-socialist states
After 1956, the Sino-Soviet alliance began to break down. Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge. [210] For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao's glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a "lunatic on a throne". [211]
After this, Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal. [210] The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war. [212] Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement. [213] Historian Lorenz M. Lüthi argues:
The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement. The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular. [214]
Space Race
Main article: Space Race
The United States reached the Moon in 1969.
On the nuclear weapons front, the United States and the USSR pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other. [41] In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), [215] and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1.[216] The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race. This led to the  Moon landings by the United States, which astronaut Frank Borman later described as "just a battle in the Cold War." [217] A major Cold War element of the Space Race was satellite reconnaissance, as well as signals intelligence to gauge which aspects of the space programs had military capabilities. [218] Later, however, the US and USSR pursued some cooperation in space as part of détente, such as Apollo–Soyuz.[219]
Cuban Revolution and the Bay of Pigs Invasion
Main articles: Cuban Revolution and Bay of Pigs Invasion
Che Guevara (left) and Fidel Castro (right) in 1961
In Cuba, the 26th of July Movement, led by young revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, seized power in the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, toppling President Fulgencio Batista, whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration. [220]
Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Castro during the latter's trip to Washington, D.C. in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. [221] Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960. [222] In March of that year Eisenhower gave approval to CIA plans and funding to overthrow Castro. [223]
In January 1961, just prior to leaving office, Eisenhower formally severed relations with the Cuban government. That April, the administration of newly elected American President John F. Kennedy mounted the unsuccessful CIA-organized ship-borne invasion of the island at Playa Girón and Playa Larga in Santa Clara Province —a failure that publicly humiliated the United States. [224] Castro responded by publicly embracing Marxism–Leninism, and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support.[224] In December, the US government began a campaign of terrorist attacks against the Cuban people and covert operations against the administration, in an attempt to bring down the Cuban government. [231]
Berlin Crisis of 1961

Soviet and American tanks face each other at Checkpoint Charlie during the Berlin Crisis of 1961.
The Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and post–World War II Germany. By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc. [232] However, hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually emigrated to West Germany through a "loophole" in the system that existed between East Berlin and West Berlin, where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement. [233]
The emigration resulted in a massive "brain drain" from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany's population had migrated to West Germany by 1961. [234] That June, the Soviet Union issued a new ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Allied forces from West Berlin. [235] The request was rebuffed, but the United States now limited its security guarantees to West Berlin. [236] On 13 August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole. [237]
Cuban Missile Crisis and Khrushchev's ousting
Main articles: Operation Mongoose and Cuban Missile Crisis
Aerial photograph of a Soviet missile site in Cuba, taken by a US spy aircraft, 1 November 1962
The Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs Invasion, experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilisation operations known as Operation Mongoose, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961. Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962, [238] and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response. [238]
Alarmed, Kennedy considered various reactions. He ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade, and he presented an ultimatum to the Soviets. Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for a public American pledge not to invade Cuba again as well as a covert deal to remove US missiles from Turkey. [239] Castro later admitted that "I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons. ... we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway, and that we were going to disappear." [240]
The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before. [241] The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations,[citation needed] although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961. [upper-alpha 11]
In 1964, Khrushchev's Kremlin colleagues managed to oust him, but allowed him a peaceful retirement. [242] Accused of rudeness and incompetence, John Lewis Gaddis argues that Khrushchev was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war [243] and that Khrushchev had become an 'international embarrassment' when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall. [243]
From confrontation to détente (1962–1979)
Main article: Cold War (1962–1979)
NATO and Warsaw Pact troop strengths in Europe in 1973
In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs. [93] From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated.[93] [244]
The Vietnam War descended into a quagmire for the United States, leading to a decline in international prestige and economic stability, derailing arms agreements, and provoking domestic unrest. America's withdrawal from the war led it to embrace a policy of détente with both China and the Soviet Union. [245]
In the 1973 oil crisis, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut their petroleum output. This raised oil prices and hurt Western economies, but helped the Soviet Union by generating a huge flow of money from its oil sales. [246]
As a result of the oil crisis, combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as OPEC and the Non-Aligned Movement, less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. [154] Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. [93] During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente. [93]
Vietnam War
Main articles: Vietnam War and Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War
US combat operations during the Battle of Ia Drang, South Vietnam, November 1965
Under President John F. Kennedy, US troop levels in Vietnam grew under the Military Assistance Advisory Group program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. [upper-alpha 12] [upper-alpha 13] South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's heavy-handed crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem.[247] The war escalated further in 1964 following the controversial Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a US destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authorization to increase US military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000. [248] Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev's policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position. The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces. [249] From this point, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), also known as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) engaged in more conventional warfare with US and South Vietnamese forces. [250]
The Tet Offensive of 1968 proved to be the turning point of the war. Despite years of American tutelage and aid the South Vietnamese forces were unable to withstand the communist offensive and the task fell to US forces instead. Tet showed that the end of US involvement was not in sight, increasing domestic skepticism of the war and giving rise to what was referred to as the Vietnam Syndrome, a public aversion to American overseas military involvements. Nonetheless, operations continued to cross international boundaries: bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were used by North Vietnam as supply routes, and were heavily bombed by US forces.[251]
At the same time, 1963–65, American domestic politics saw the triumph of liberalism. According to historian Joseph Crespino:
It has become a staple of twentieth-century historiography that Cold War concerns were at the root of a number of progressive political accomplishments in the postwar period: a high progressive marginal tax rate that helped fund the arms race and contributed to broad income equality; bipartisan support for far-reaching civil rights legislation that transformed politics and society in the American South, which had long given the lie to America’s egalitarian ethos; bipartisan support for overturning an explicitly racist immigration system that had been in place since the 1920s; and free health care for the elderly and the poor, a partial fulfillment of one of the unaccomplished goals of the New Deal era. The list could go on. [252]
French withdrawal from NATO military structures
Main article: Foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle#Partial withdrawal from NATO in 1966
The unity of NATO was breached early in its history, with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle 's presidency of France. De Gaulle protested at the strong role of the United States in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably French Algeria, where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance. [253] De Gaulle considered the response he received to be unsatisfactory and began the development of an independent French nuclear deterrent. In 1966 he withdrew France from NATO's military structures and expelled NATO troops from French soil. [254]
Finlandization
Main article: Finlandization
A manifestation of the Finlandization period: in April 1970, a Finnish stamp was issued in honor of the 100th anniversary of Vladimir Lenin 's birth and the Lenin Symposium held in Tampere. The stamp was the first Finnish stamp issued about a foreign person.
Officially claiming to be neutral, Finland lay in the grey zone between the Western countries and the Soviet Union. The YYA Treaty (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance)[255] gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics, which was later used as the term "Finlandization" by the West German press, meaning "to become like Finland". This meant, among other things, the Soviet adaptation spread to the editors of mass media, sparking strong forms of self-control, self-censorship (which included the banning of anti-Soviet books [256] [257]) and pro-Soviet attitudes. Most of the elite of media and politics shifted their attitudes to match the values that the Soviets were thought to favor and approve. Only after the ascent of Mikhail Gorbachev to Soviet leadership in 1985 did mass media in Finland gradually begin to criticise the Soviet Union more. When the Soviet Union allowed non-communist governments to take power in Eastern Europe, Gorbachev suggested they could look to Finland as an example to follow. [258]
For West German conservative politicians, especially the Bavarian Prime Minister Franz Josef Strauss, the case of Finlandization served as a warning, for example, about how a great power dictates its much smaller neighbor in its internal affairs and the neighbor's independence becomes formal. During the Cold War, Finlandization was seen not only in Bavaria but also in Western intelligence services as a threat that completely free states had to be warned about in advance. To combat Finlandization, propaganda books and newspaper articles were published through CIA -funded research institutes and media companies, which denigrated Finnish neutrality policy and President Urho Kekkonen;[259] this was one factor in making room for the East-West espionage on Finnish soil between the two great powers. [259] [260] [261] [262] [263] [264] [265]
However, Finland maintained capitalism unlike most other countries bordering the Soviet Union. Even though being a neighbor to the Soviet Union sometimes resulted in overcautious concern in foreign policy, Finland developed closer co-operation with the other Nordic countries and declared itself even more neutral in superpower politics, altrough in the later years, support for capitalism was even more widespread. [266]
Invasion of Czechoslovakia
Main articles: Prague Spring and Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
The invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union in 1968 was one of the biggest military operations on European soil since World War II.
In 1968, a period of political liberalization took place in Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring. An "Action Program" of reforms included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government, limitations on the power of the secret police, [upper-alpha 14] [267] and potential withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.

In answer to the Prague Spring, on 20 August 1968, the Soviet Army, together with most of their Warsaw Pact allies, invaded Czechoslovakia.[269] The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. [270] The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties. [271]
Brezhnev Doctrine
Main article: Brezhnev Doctrine
In September 1968, during a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party one month after the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Brezhnev outlined the Brezhnev Doctrine, in which he claimed the right to violate the sovereignty of any country attempting to replace Marxism–Leninism with capitalism. During the speech, Brezhnev stated: [268]
When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.
The doctrine found its origins in the failures of Marxism–Leninism in states like Poland, Hungary and East Germany, which were facing a declining standard of living contrasting with the prosperity of West Germany and the rest of Western Europe. [272]

Under the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, which gained power after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the US took a more hardline stance on Latin America—sometimes called the "Mann Doctrine ". [273] In 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew the government of president João Goulart with US backing. [274] In late April 1965, the US sent some 22,000 troops to the Dominican Republic in an intervention, codenamed Operation Power Pack, into the Dominican Civil War between supporters of deposed  president Juan Bosch and supporters of General Elías Wessin y Wessin, citing the threat of the emergence of a Cuban-style revolution in Latin America. The OAS also deployed soldiers to the conflict through the mostly Brazilian Inter-American Peace Force.[275] Héctor García-Godoy acted as provisional president, until conservative former president Joaquín Balaguer won the 1966 presidential election against non-campaigning Juan Bosch. [276] Activists for Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party were violently harassed by the Dominican police and armed forces. [276]
Suharto of Indonesia attending funeral of five generals slain in 30 September Movement, 2 October 1965
In Indonesia, the hardline anti-communist General Suharto wrested control of the state from his predecessor Sukarno in an attempt to establish a "New Order". From 1965 to 1966, with the aid of the United States and other Western governments, [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] the military led the mass killing of more than 500,000 members and sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party and other leftist organizations, and detained hundreds of thousands more in prison camps around the country under extremely inhumane conditions. [282] [283] A top-secret CIA report stated that the massacres "rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s." [283] These killings served US strategic interests and constitute a major turning point in the Cold War as the balance of power shifted in Southeast Asia. [284] [285]
Escalating the scale of American intervention in the ongoing conflict between Ngô Đình Diệm 's South Vietnamese government and the communist National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) insurgents opposing it, Johnson deployed some 575,000 troops in Southeast Asia to defeat the NLF and their North Vietnamese allies in the Vietnam War, but his costly policy weakened the US economy and, by 1975, it ultimately culminated in what most of the world saw as a humiliating defeat of the world's most powerful superpower at the hands of one of the world's poorest nations. [84]
Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat with Henry Kissinger in 1975
The Middle East remained a source of contention. Egypt, which received the bulk of its arms and economic assistance from the USSR, was a troublesome client, with a reluctant Soviet Union feeling obliged to assist in both the 1967 Six-Day War (with advisers and technicians) and the War of Attrition (with pilots and aircraft) against pro-Western Israel. [286] Despite the beginning of an Egyptian shift from a pro-Soviet to a pro-American orientation in 1972 (under Egypt's new leader Anwar Sadat ), [287] rumors of imminent Soviet intervention on the Egyptians' behalf during the 1973 Yom Kippur War brought about a massive American mobilization that threatened to wreck détente.[citation needed] Although pre-Sadat Egypt had been the largest recipient of Soviet aid in the Middle East, the Soviets were also successful in establishing close relations with communist South Yemen, as well as the nationalist governments of Algeria and Iraq. [287] Iraq signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1972. According to historian Charles R. H. Tripp, the treaty upset "the US-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East. It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad regime was a potential ally of the United States." [288] In response, the US covertly financed Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani during the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War; the Kurds were defeated in 1975, leading to the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish civilians. [288] Indirect Soviet assistance to the Palestinian side of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict included support for Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). [289]
In East Africa, a territorial dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia over the Ogaden region resulted in the Ogaden War. Around June 1977, Somali troops occupied the Ogaden and began advancing inland towards Ethiopian positions in the Ahmar Mountains. Both countries were client states of the Soviet Union; Somalia was led by self-proclaimed Marxist military leader Siad Barre, and Ethiopia was controlled by the Derg, a cabal of military generals loyal to the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who had declared the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia in 1975. [290] The Soviets initially attempted to exert a moderating influence on both states, but in November 1977 Barre broke off relations with Moscow and expelled his Soviet military advisers. [291] He then turned to the China and Safari Club —a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including those of Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia—for support and weapons. [292] [293] [upper-alpha 15] While declining to take a direct part in hostilities, the Soviet Union did provide the impetus for a successful Ethiopian counteroffensive to expel Somalia from the Ogaden. The counteroffensive was planned at the command level by Soviet advisers attached to the Ethiopian general staff, and bolstered by the delivery of millions of dollars' of sophisticated Soviet arms. [291] About 11,000 Cuban troops spearheaded the primary effort, after receiving a hasty training on some of the newly delivered Soviet weapons systems by East German instructors. [291]
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet shaking hands with Henry Kissinger in 1976
In Chile, the Socialist Party candidate Salvador Allende won the presidential election of 1970, thereby becoming the first democratically elected Marxist to become president of a country in the Americas. [294] The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet 's coup d'état on 11 September 1973. Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). The Socialist states—with the exception of China and Romania —broke off relations with Chile. [295] The Pinochet regime would go on to be one of the leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government. [296] [297] [298]
Cuban tank in the streets of Luanda, Angola, 1976
On 24 April 1974, the Carnation Revolution succeeded in ousting Marcello Caetano and Portugal's right-wing Estado Novo government, sounding the death knell for the Portuguese Empire. [299] Independence was hastily granted to a number of Portuguese colonies, including Angola, where the disintegration of colonial rule was followed by a violent civil war. [300] There were three rival militant factions competing for power in Angola, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). [301] While all three had socialist leanings, the MPLA was the only party with close ties to the Soviet Union. [301] Its adherence to the concept of a one-party state alienated it from the FNLA and UNITA, which began portraying themselves as anti-communist and pro-Western in orientation. [301] When the Soviets began supplying the MPLA with arms, the CIA and China offered substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA. [302] [303] [304] The MPLA eventually requested direct military support from Moscow in the form of ground troops, but the Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no combat personnel. [302] Cuba was more forthcoming and began amassing troops in Angola to assist the MPLA. [302] By November 1975 there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country. [302] The persistent buildup of Cuban troops and Soviet weapons allowed the MPLA to secure victory and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and South African troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA. [305]
During the Khmer Rouge regime led by Pol Pot, 1.5 to 2 million people died due to the policies of his four-year premiership.
During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam used border areas of Cambodia as military bases, which Cambodian head of state Norodom Sihanouk tolerated in an attempt to preserve Cambodia's neutrality. Following Sihanouk's March 1970 deposition by pro-American general Lon Nol, who ordered the North Vietnamese to leave Cambodia, North Vietnam attempted to overrun all of Cambodia following negotiations with Nuon Chea, the second-in-command of the Cambodian communists (dubbed the Khmer Rouge) fighting to overthrow the Cambodian government. [306] Sihanouk fled to China with the establishment of the GRUNK in Beijing. [307] American and South Vietnamese forces responded to these actions with a bombing campaign and a brief ground incursion, which contributed to the violence of the civil war that soon enveloped all of Cambodia. [308] US carpet bombing lasted until 1973, and while it prevented the Khmer Rouge from seizing the capital, it also accelerated the collapse of rural society, increased social polarization, [309] and killed tens of thousands of civilians. [310]
After taking power and distancing himself from the Vietnamese, [311] pro-China Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot killed 1.5 to 2 million Cambodians in the killing fields, roughly a quarter of the Cambodian population (an event commonly labelled the Cambodian genocide ). [312] [313] [314] [315] Martin Shaw described these atrocities as "the purest genocide of the Cold War era." [316] Backed by the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, an organization of Khmer pro-Soviet Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors led by Heng Samrin, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978. The invasion succeeded in deposing Pol Pot, but the new state would struggle to gain international recognition beyond the Soviet Bloc sphere. Despite the previous international outcry at the Pol Pot regime's gross human rights violations, representatives of the Khmer Rouge were allowed to be seated in the UN General Assembly, with strong support from China, Western powers, and the member countries of ASEAN. Cambodia would become bogged down in a guerrilla war led from refugee camps located on the border with Thailand. Following the destruction of the Khmer Rouge, the national reconstruction of Cambodia would be severely hampered, and Vietnam would suffer a punitive Chinese attack.[317]
Sino-American rapprochement
Main article: 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China
Mao Zedong and US President Richard Nixon, during his visit in China
As a result of the Sino-Soviet split, tensions along the Chinese–Soviet border reached their peak in 1969, and United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War. [318] The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain an advantage over the Soviets as well.
In February 1972, Nixon achieved a stunning rapprochement with China, [319] traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the Vietnam War both weakened America's influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe.[citation needed]
Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.[citation needed]

Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter sign the SALT II treaty, 18 June 1979, in Vienna
Following his visit to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, including Brezhnev in Moscow. [320] These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles. [93]
Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and established the groundbreaking new policy of détente (or cooperation) between the two superpowers. Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures. Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties, [84] including agreements for increased trade. As a result of their meetings, détente would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually. [321] These developments coincided with Bonn's "Ostpolitik" policy formulated by the West German Chancellor Willy Brandt,[271] an effort to normalize relations between West Germany and Eastern Europe. Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the Helsinki Accords signed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975. [322]
Iranian people protesting against the Pahlavi dynasty, during the Iranian Revolution
Kissinger and Nixon were "realists" who deemphasized idealistic goals like anti-communism or promotion of democracy worldwide because those goals were too expensive in terms of America's economic capabilities. [323][citation not found] Instead of a Cold War they wanted peace, trade and cultural exchanges. They realized that Americans were no longer willing to tax themselves for idealistic foreign policy goals, especially for containment policies that never seemed to produce positive results. Instead, Nixon and Kissinger sought to downsize America's global commitments in proportion to its reduced economic, moral and political power. They rejected "idealism" as impractical and too expensive, and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism. Kissinger's realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carter's moralism emphasizing human rights, and Reagan's rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism. [324][citation not found]
Late 1970s deterioration of relations
In the 1970s, the KGB, led by Yuri Andropov, continued to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms. [325] Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola. [326]
Although President Jimmy Carter tried to place another limit on the arms race with a SALT II agreement in 1979, [327] his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.

The term new Cold War refers to the period of intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant. [328] Diggins says, "Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world." [329] Cox says, "The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short." [330]

President Reagan publicizes his support by meeting with Afghan mujahideen leaders in the White House, 1983.
In April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the Saur Revolution. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide. [331] The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China, [332] [333] while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government. [331] Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen. [334] [335]
In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces during Operation Storm-333 in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan. [336]
Carter responded to the Soviet intervention by withdrawing the SALT II treaty from ratification, imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, and demanding a significant increase in military spending, and further announced that the United States would boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He described the Soviet incursion as "the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War". [337]
Reagan and Thatcher

The world map of military alliances in 1980
In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," he said. "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?" [338] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. [339] Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an "evil empire" and predicted that Communism would be left on the "ash heap of history ," while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as "bent on world dominance." [340] [341] In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue. Reagan retreated on this issue. [342] [343]
By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist position had developed into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrine —which, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. [344] Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. [345][citation not found] Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims from around the world to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union. [345][citation not found]
Polish Solidarity movement and martial law
Main articles: Solidarity (Polish trade union) and Martial law in Poland
Further information: Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981
Pope John Paul II provided a moral focus for anti-communism; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement that galvanized opposition and may have led to his attempted assassination two years later.[citation needed]In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law. Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response. [346] Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy. [346]
The US and USSR military and economic issues
Further information: Era of Stagnation , Strategic Defense Initiative , RSD-10 Pioneer , and MGM-31 Pershing
US and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945–2006
The Soviet Union had built up a military that consumed as much as 25 percent of its gross national product at the expense of consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. [347] Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, [348] which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.
Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. [349] The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base.[350] However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. [351] For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet Union's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72s as the US deployed M1s. [352]
Delta 183 launch vehicle lifts off, carrying the Strategic Defense Initiative sensor experiment "Delta Star".
By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, [353] the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history. [354]
Tensions continued to intensify as Reagan revived the B-1 Lancer program, which had been canceled by the Carter administration, produced LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles, [355] installed US cruise missiles in Europe, and announced the experimental Strategic Defense Initiative, dubbed "Star Wars" by the media, a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid-flight.[citation needed] The Soviets deployed RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, and NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany. [356] This deployment placed missiles just 10 minutes' striking distance from Moscow. [357]
After Reagan's military buildup, the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military, [358] because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. [359] At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, [360] even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. [upper-alpha 16] These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. [347] Issues with command economics,[361] oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.[citation needed]
After ten-year-old American Samantha Smith wrote a letter to Yuri Andropov expressing her fear of nuclear war, Andropov invited Smith to the Soviet Union.
On 1 September 1983, the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard, including sitting Congressman Larry McDonald, an action which Reagan characterized as a "massacre". The airliner had violated Soviet airspace just past the west coast of Sakhalin Island near Moneron Island, and the Soviets treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding US spy plane. The incident increased support for military deployment, overseen by Reagan, which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. [362] The Able Archer 83 exercise in November 1983, a realistic simulation of a coordinated NATO nuclear release, was perhaps the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis, as the Soviet leadership feared that a nuclear attack might be imminent. [363]
American domestic public concerns about intervening in foreign conflicts persisted from the end of the Vietnam War. [364] The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counterinsurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. [364] In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. [154] While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy.[365] The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial. [366]
Meanwhile, the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions. Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the Soviet war in Afghanistan would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, [333] waged a fierce resistance against the invasion. [367] The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war "the Soviets' Vietnam". [367] However, Moscow's quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system.
A senior US State Department official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a "domestic crisis within the Soviet system. ... It may be that the thermodynamic law of entropy has ... caught up with the Soviet system, which now seems to expend more energy on simply maintaining its equilibrium than on improving itself. We could be seeing a period of foreign movement at a time of internal decay". [368]

Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan sign the INF Treaty at the White House, 1987.
By the time the comparatively youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, [340] the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. [369] These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state. [369]
An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary, and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called perestroika, or restructuring. [370] Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector. [370]
Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. [371] Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. [372] Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee.[373] Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations. [374]
Thaw in relations
Further information: Reykjavík Summit , Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , START I , and Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany
The beginning of the 1990s brought a thaw in relations between the superpowers.
In response to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. [375] The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland.[375] At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50 percent. [376][citation not found] A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted to be eliminated. Reagan refused. [377] The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (300 to 3,400 miles) and their infrastructure. [378]
"Tear down this wall!" speech: Reagan speaking in front of the Brandenburg Gate, 12 June 1987
East–West tensions rapidly subsided through the mid-to-late 1980s, culminating with the final summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. [379] During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. [380] In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe. [381]
In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan,[382] and by 1990 Gorbachev consented to German reunification,[380] as the only alternative was a Tiananmen Square scenario. [383] When the Berlin Wall came down, Gorbachev's "Common European Home" concept began to take shape. [384]
On 3 December 1989, Gorbachev and Bush declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit.[385] A year later, the two former rivals were partners in the Gulf War against Iraq (August 1990 – February 1991). [386]

Erich Honecker lost control in August 1989.
By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the communist leaders of the Warsaw Pact states were losing power. [382] Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases.
The Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 in Hungary finally started a peaceful movement that the rulers in the Eastern Bloc could not stop. It was the largest movement of refugees from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and ultimately brought about the fall of the Iron Curtain. The patrons of the picnic, Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev's reaction. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary to a picnic near the border at Sopron. But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-interference of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Now tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer willing to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use armed force. On the one hand, this caused disagreement among the Eastern European states and, on the other hand, it was clear to the Eastern European population that the governments no longer had absolute power. [387] [388] [389] [390] [391] [392]
In 1989, the communist governments in Poland and Hungary became the first to negotiate the organization of competitive elections. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders. The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a violent uprising. Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State James Baker suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed. [393]
The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the Iron Curtain divide of Europe. The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style Marxist–Leninist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria; [394] Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state. [395]

In the USSR itself, glasnost weakened the ideological bonds that held the Soviet Union together, and by February 1990, with the dissolution of the USSR looming, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power. [396] At the same time the union's component republics declared their autonomy from Moscow, with the Baltic states withdrawing from the union entirely. [397]
Gorbachev used force to keep the Baltics from breaking away. The USSR was fatally weakened by a failed coup in August 1991. A growing number of Soviet republics, particularly Russia, threatened to secede from the USSR. The Commonwealth of Independent States, created on 21 December 1991, was a successor entity to the Soviet Union. [upper-alpha 17] The USSR was declared officially dissolved on 26 December 1991. [398]
US President George H. W. Bush expressed his emotions: "The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War." [399]
Aftermath
Main article: Effects of the Cold War

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia drastically cut military spending, and restructuring the economy left millions unemployed. [400] The capitalist reforms culminated in a recession in the early 1990s more severe than the Great Depression as experienced by the United States and Germany. [401]
The Cold War continues to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. [402] [403] [404] The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, [405] with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) [406] and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). [405] The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science.[407] These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War. [408]
Cumulative U.S. military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8 trillion. Further nearly 100,000 Americans lost their lives in the Korean and Vietnam Wars.[409] Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was much higher than that incurred by the United States. [410]
Changes in national boundaries after the end of the Cold War
In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. [411] Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years. [412] Left over from the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought to be used to broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.[citation needed]
The aftermath of Cold War conflict, however, is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.[413]
In popular culture
See also: Culture during the Cold War
During the Cold War itself, with the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence the hearts and minds of people around the world, especially using motion pictures. [414][page needed]
The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected extensively in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with numerous post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television, and other media. In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, The Americans, set in the early 1980s, was ranked #6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list and is in its second season. [415] At the same time, movies like Crimson Tide (1995) are shown in their entirety to educate college students about the Cold War. [416]
Historiography
Main article: Historiography of the Cold War
As soon as the term "Cold War" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists. [417] In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided. [418] Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides. [413]
Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: "orthodox" accounts, "revisionism", and "post-revisionism". [407]
"Orthodox" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe. [407] "Revisionist" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II. [407] "Post-revisionists" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War. [407] Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories. [419]

↑ "South Korea's President Rhee was obsessed with accomplishing early reunification through military means. The Truman administration's fear that Rhee would launch an invasion prompted it to limit South Korea's military capabilities, refusing to provide tanks, heavy artillery, and combat planes. This did not stop the South Koreans from initiating most of the border clashes with North Korean forces at the thirty-eighth parallel beginning in the summer of 1948 and reaching a high level of intensity and violence a year later. Historians now acknowledge that the two Koreas already were waging a civil conflict when North Korea's attack opened the conventional phase of the war." "Revisiting Korea". 15 August 2016.
↑ "Contradicting traditional assumptions, however, available declassified Soviet documents demonstrate that throughout 1949 Stalin consistently refused to approve Kim Il Sung's persistent requests to approve an invasion of South Korea. The Soviet leader believed that North Korea had not achieved either military superiority north of the parallel or political strength south of that line. His main concern was the threat South Korea posed to North Korea's survival, for example fearing an invasion northward following U.S. military withdrawal in June 1949."
