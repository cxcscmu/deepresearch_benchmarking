Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what makes people believe in conspiracies. This is kind of a tricky topic because it涉及到了人类的心理和行为。首先，我需要理解什么是 conspiracy theories，也就是阴谋论。阴谋论通常是指那些没有充分证据支持的理论，声称某些事件是由秘密组织或个人策划的。这些理论往往挑战主流观点，吸引那些对官方解释持怀疑态度的人。

我想，人们相信阴谋论可能有多种原因。也许有些人是因为对权威机构不信任，觉得官方的说法不可靠。还有可能是因为他们寻求对复杂问题的简单解释，而阴谋论提供了一种易于理解的框架。此外，社交媒体的普及也可能加剧了阴谋论的传播，因为在这个平台上，信息可以迅速扩散，而不必经过严格的事实核查。

不过，这些都是我的初步猜测。为了更准确地回答这个问题，我需要一些数据和研究来支撑我的观点。也许有一些心理学的研究探讨了这个问题。或者，社会学的角度也能提供一些见解，比如社会环境如何影响人们的信念。

让我想想，是否有什么具体的例子可以说明人们为什么相信阴谋论。比如说，关于疫苗接种的阴谋论，有些人认为疫苗会导致自闭症，尽管有大量的科学研究表明这不是真的。那这些人为什么还会坚持这种观点呢？可能是由于对医学权威的不信任，或者是受到了错误信息的影响。

另一个例子是9/11事件，有些阴谋论者声称是美国政府自己策划了这次袭击。这背后可能是因为对政府的不信任，或者是对事件真相的强烈好奇心。人们可能觉得官方的故事有漏洞，因此转向阴谋论来填补这些空白。

我觉得，情感因素也扮演了一定的角色。比如，恐惧、焦虑或者不满都可能促使人们接受阴谋论。当人们感到不安时，他们可能会寻找某种解释来帮助他们应对这些情绪，而阴谋论提供了一种将责任归咎于特定群体或个人的方式。

另外，认知偏差也可能导致人们倾向于相信阴谋论。例如，确认偏误（confirmation bias）让人们更愿意接受符合他们已有信念的信息，而忽视相反的证据。这也使得阴谋论一旦被接受，就很难通过理性讨论来改变。

我也听说过一些研究表示，教育水平和批判性思维能力与相信阴谋论之间存在关联。也许教育程度较低或者缺乏批判性思维技能的人更容易相信阴谋论。但这也可能是一种刻板印象，因为事实上，有些高学历的人也相信阴谋论。

也许，相信阴谋论是一种普遍的人类倾向，而不是某个特定群体的特征。可能在某些情况下，任何人都有可能被阴谋论所吸引，尤其是当他们面临不确定性和焦虑时。

我想，要更好地理解这个问题，我需要查找一些相关的研究论文或书籍。也许可以看看社会心理学或者传播学方面的文献。通过了解专业人士的研究，我可以获得更深入的洞察。

让我尝试进行一次搜索，看看能否找到一些有用的信息。

What You Can Do
Conspiracy theories are not a new phenomenon, but they seem to have risen to the forefront of consciousness in recent years. Some controversial examples of such theories include the belief that terrorist attacks and mass shootings were staged events orchestrated by the U.S. government.
Other examples include the belief that the pharmaceutical industry intentionally spreads diseases or that vaccines cause illness rather than prevent them. While it might seem like these beliefs are rare or even pathological, research has shown that they are surprisingly common. One study found that half of all Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory. 1
What Is a Conspiracy Theory?
A conspiracy theory can be defined as the belief that there are groups that meet in secret to plan and carry out malevolent goals.
What explains this common and often deep-rooted belief that powerful, sinister, and secretive groups are conspiring to deceive others—particularly in a day and age where we have more access to information and facts that might debunk these ideas? Researchers suspect that there are a number of psychological mechanisms, many the result of evolutionary processes, that contribute to these beliefs. 2 ﻿
In a world where you might feel powerless and alienated, it can be appealing to believe that there are forces plotting against you and your interests. Once these beliefs take root, cognitive biases and mental shortcuts reinforce and strengthen them. Many of the same factors that fuel other types of problematic thinking, such as a belief in the paranormal, also contribute to conspiracy theories.
And while such paranoid ideas are not new, the internet has helped transform the speed and manner in which they spread. In order to understand why people believe in these conspiracies, it is important to explore some of the psychological explanations and the potential effects these beliefs have.
10 Cognitive Biases That Distort Your Thinking
Examples
Some recent examples of conspiracy theories include:
The Pizzagate conspiracy theory suggests that politicians and Hollywood elite are engaged in a child sex trafficking ring. One report found that 9% of respondents believed in this conspiracy. 3
Another recent conspiracy stems from QAnon, a far-right conspiracy site claiming it has top-level knowledge of a secret "Deep State" working against President Donald Trump. 4
The belief that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States was found to be believed by 11% of those surveyed in a study. 5
Another conspiracy suggests that the billionaire George Soros is part of a secret plot to destabilize the U.S. government. Approximately 9% of respondents in one study indicated that they believe this to be true. 5
Explanations
Researchers suggest that there are a number of different reasons why people believe in conspiracy theories. Many of these explanations boil down to three key driving factors:
A need for understanding and consistency (epistemic) 6 ﻿
A need for control (existential)
A need to belong or feel special (social) 6 ﻿
Epistemic Reasons
Epistemic explanations refer to the desire to derive certainty and understanding. The world can often seem confusing, dangerous, and chaotic. At the same time, people want to understand what's happening and are driven to explain things that happen. Doing so helps them build up a consistent, stable, and clear understanding of how the world works.
Factors That Increase Conspiracy Belief
Situations involving large-scale events, where more mundane or small-scale explanations seem inadequate
Situations where people experience distress over uncertainty
When people encounter disparate information, it is only natural to look for explanations that connect the dots. Conspiracy theories offer explanations that provide this connection.
They also suggest that the underlying causes are hidden from public view. When confusing things happen, believers can then assume that it is because they are being intentionally deceived by outside forces. There is also a connection between conspiracy beliefs and educational levels. Lower educational status tends to be associated with higher levels of conspiracy belief.
Having lower analytical abilities and less tolerance for uncertainty also play a role. As a result, people turn to conspiracy theories to provide explanations for events that seem confusing or frightening.
The confirmation bias can also play a role in the development of conspiracy belief. People are naturally inclined to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs. 7 ﻿ So when they run across a theory that supports something that they already think is true, they are more likely to believe the information is also true.
How Your Brain Plays Tricks on You
Existential Reasons
There is also evidence that people turn to conspiracy theories as a way of feeling safer and more in control. 8 ﻿ When people feel threatened in some way, detecting sources of danger can be a way of coping with anxiety .
What The Research Suggests:
One study found that people who feel psychologically and sociopolitically disempowered are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. 8 ﻿
Another study found that people are also more likely to believe in conspiracies when they are experiencing anxiety.
While researchers understand these existential motivations, there is little evidence that believing in these theories actually helps people satisfy this need to feel control and autonomy. In fact, by believing in these theories, people may actually be less likely to engage in actions that would potentially boost their sense of control (such as voting or participating in political activity).
So while people may be drawn to conspiracy theories as a way of making sense of the world and feeling more in control of their own destiny, the long-term effects may actually leave people feeling more disempowered than ever before.
Social Reasons
People can also be motivated to believe in conspiracy due to social reasons. Some researchers have hypothesized that by believing in conspiracies that portray out-groups as the opposition, people are able to feel better about themselves and their own social group. 2 ﻿ Those who believe in the conspiracy feel that they are the “heroes” of the story, while those who are conspiring against them are “the enemy.”
Why People Believe In Conspiracies
They are on the “losing” side of a political issue.
They have a lower social status due to income or ethnicity.
They have experienced social ostracism.
They are prejudiced against “enemy” groups they perceive as powerful.
Such findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs might arise as a sort of defense mechanism. When people feel disadvantaged, they are motivated to find ways to boost their own self-perceptions. Blaming others by linking them to malevolent plots provides a scapegoat on which to lay blame, thus improving how conspiracy believers view themselves.
The belief in conspiracies is also rooted in what is referred to as collective narcissism. This is the belief that your own social group is better, yet less appreciated, by other people.
People who feel that they or their social group have been victimized are also less likely to believe in government institutions and more likely to believe in conspiracies.
The way in which people encounter and share these ideas should also be noted. It’s easy to dismiss a story shared by a random source that you don’t trust.
But when multiple people in your social circle who you do know and trust all seem to believe the same story, it starts to seem less like a silly conspiracy and more like a trusted fact. Sharing these kinds of stories within our networks gives social credence to such conspiratorial thinking.
How Your Decisions Are Biased by the First Thing You Hear
Effects
While researchers have some good theories about why people believe in conspiracies, it is less clear what the ultimate effects of these beliefs are.
What researchers have found is that while these beliefs are motivated by a desire to understand, exert control, and feel socially connected, these aren’t the effects people are deriving from their beliefs. 6 ﻿ Rather than fulfilling these needs, believing in conspiracies seems to reinforce feelings of confusion, isolation, disenfranchisement, and loneliness .
It is a destructive cycle—negative feelings contribute to the belief in conspiracies, yet the belief in conspiracies results in negative feelings. Believing in conspiracy theories erodes people’s trust in their government, their leaders, and their institutions.
It also diminishes trust in science and research itself. This distrust may discourage people from participating in their social worlds. It might also cause people to stop seeing themselves as valuable contributors to society.
Rather than helping people cope with their feelings of social alienation and political disenfranchisement, conspiracy beliefs seem to create a cycle of distrust that leads to even greater disempowerment.
Risks
Believing in things that are not true poses a number of dangers, which can have real effects that impact individual behavior and ultimately have a ripple impact on society as a whole. A resurgence in measles outbreaks in the U.S. has been largely attributed to a refusal by some individuals to vaccinate—a refusal that stems largely from the conspiratorial belief that vaccines cause autism and other health ailments. 9 ﻿
Failing to address dangerous misbeliefs presents a potential danger to public health and even the political process itself. Faulty beliefs lead can lead people to not vaccinate, not vote, or, in some rare cases, even engage in dangerous or violent behavior.
Types of Cognitive Biases That Distort How You Think
Overcoming Conspiracy Theory Beliefs
In the age of disinformation, finding ways to refute conspiracy beliefs seems more important than ever. Social platforms claim to be buckling down on those who peddle and profit off of conspiracies, but is it really possible to change such views once they’ve taken root? Some things to remember when trying to change someone's mind about a conspiracy theory.
Disputing a Belief May Lead to Resistance
One problem faced when trying to disprove conspiracy theories is that people who hold these beliefs also tend to suspect that there are factions engaged in covering up these activities. Those trying to debunk the mistaken beliefs are then viewed as simply being actors in the conspiracy itself.
While it might be tempting to simply mock conspiracy theories, especially the more ridiculous ones, this usually causes believers to dig in their heels and deepen their commitment to their belief.
Feeling In Control Reduces Conspiratorial Thinking
Many factors that contribute to conspiratorial beliefs, such as educational background and personality, are not easily or quickly changed. Researchers have found one tactic, however, that is effective — encouraging believers to pursue their goals. 10 ﻿
People tend to take one of two approaches in the pursuit of goals.
Those who are "promotion-focused" believe that they have the power and control to shape their future.
People who are "prevention-focused," on the other hand, are more focused on protecting what they already have rather than on achieving their goals.
So what does this have to do with conspiracy beliefs? Researchers found that promotion-focused people were more skeptical and less likely to buy into conspiracies﻿. 10 ﻿
Why? People who believe that the future hinges on their own actions have a great deal of personal agency and control. It is this sense of autonomy and agency that makes people less likely to believe in secret plots and nefarious plans.
What the researchers also discovered was that giving people a nudge in the direction of a more promotion-focused mindset could actually reduce belief in conspiracies. 10 ﻿ In practical terms, promoting messages that help people feel more in control can minimize conspiratorial thinking.
Write It Down
Researchers had study participants write down their aspirations, which helped them focus on their goals and what they could do to achieve them. This simple activity encourages people to take a more promotion-focused mindset and reduces conspiracy belief.
While researchers have been able to reduce conspiratorial thinking in the lab, how applicable is this in the real world? In workplace settings, managers might employ this strategy to help minimize water-cooler worries, office gossip, and interpersonal friction. Regular discussions that center on employee goals and strategies to achieve those goals can help keep workers feeling more in control and less subject to corporate whims.
In terms of public health, organizations might start by promoting messages focused on realistic things people can do to take control of their own health. Building this sort of action-oriented mindset may help discourage belief in health-related conspiracies and build greater trust between medical organizations and health consumers.
A Word From Verywell
Conspiratorial thinking can be problematic and dangerous (Pizzagate, anyone?), but this does not mean that skepticism of institutions, marketing, and media messaging is not warranted. After all, not all conspiracies are false (the Tuskegee experiments and Iran-Contra are just a couple of examples).
As you encounter information from various sources, it is important to be able to distinguish between false conspiracy theories and real threats to personal security. While it may be tempting to ridicule conspiracy believers, remember that these sort of beliefs are actually pretty common — you probably even believe in some of them.
In a world where people feel the very real effects of power imbalances and distrust in leadership, conspiracy theories will naturally flourish. This means discouraging this type of thinking is not always easy.

During elections, pandemics, and when important social and political events occur, people often turn to conspiracy theories to explain what is happening. Professor Karen Douglas from the University’s School of Psychology explains why conspiracy theories appeal to so many people. She said:
‘Almost immediately after the news started to emerge about Covid-19, so did the conspiracy theories. Some people claimed that the virus was deliberately leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. Others argued that 5G technology spread the virus. When vaccines became available, some people claimed that they contained tiny microchips designed to monitor the population. Conspiracy theories—explanations for significant events and circumstances that implicate secret and malevolent groups with sinister goals—are common in times of crisis and unrest. But why do people believe in them?
‘Research suggests that people are drawn to conspiracy theories when one or more psychological needs are frustrated. The first of these needs are epistemic, related to the need to know the truth and have clarity and certainty. The other needs are existential, which are related to the need to feel safe, secure, and to have some control over things that are happening around us, and social, which are related to the need to maintain high self-esteem and feel positive about the social groups that we belong to.
‘In times of crisis and uncertainty, these psychological needs are likely to be particularly frustrated. People feel uncertain, out of control, threatened, and are looking for ways to cope with difficult circumstances. Conspiracy theories might seem to offer some relief. For example, conspiracy theories might promise to reduce uncertainty because they provide a simple explanation for a complex event. They might promise to give back a feeling of control, or make people feel better about themselves because they know things that other people do not know.
‘However, there is little evidence that believing in conspiracy theories does make people feel better. If anything, conspiracy theories appear to make people feel worse. For example, after reading about conspiracy theories, people tend to feel less powerful and experience higher levels of uncertainty. Believing in and spending a lot of time reading about conspiracy theories may therefore not alleviate people’s feelings of frustration, and instead make them feel more frustrated.
‘Conspiracy theories can affect people’s attitudes, intentions and behaviours. Historically, they have been linked with prejudice, genocide, risky health behaviour, climate denial, and political violence.’
Professor Karen Douglas’s research focuses on the antecedents and consequences of conspiracy theories.

Conspiracy theories abound throughout history, especially in times of crisis, such as the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. Fear fuels the conception and spread of such thinking. A popular one: Covid was deliberately created in a lab. The truth—a virus that started in a bat that later crossed over to humans—is a lot less palatable. It's easier to blame an evil entity conspiring to harm and dominate the world’s common folk. Accepting the truth is not nearly as neat and tidy. Plus, people who believe these theories also have a sense of existential threat: a perceived danger to one’s own life or well-being. People then consume, believe, and share these theories as a way of making sense of that threat.
Whatever the belief, researchers find that people who believe in conspiracies distrust others, are more likely to be paranoid, and often have low- self-esteem.

Why We Believe
The Neuroscience of Conspiracy Thinking

The Plots We Fall For
Why We Believe
Why do people believe in outlandish plots? Researchers reported in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science that the reasons for believing in conspiracy theories include the need for certainty, the need for control over one’s life, the need for a positive self-image as well as the desire to feel unique.
Why is the need for certainty important in conspiracy thinking?
We seek explanations for events and want to know why things happen the way that they do. We then land on answers to these questions that are not necessarily true. However, what is more important than the truth? The answers must comfort us and fit into our worldview.
Why is the need for control important in conspiracy thinking?
Everyone wants to feel that they’re in control of their lives. Many people feel safer when they’re the driver of the car rather than the passenger. But even the best drivers can get into accidents for reasons beyond their control. Conspiracy theories give believers this sense of control and security.

Who is more likely to believe in these theories?
The Neuroscience of Conspiracy Thinking
Things that do not happen for a reason are unsettling and appear menacing. That may be one reason why about half of us believe in one conspiracy theory or another. And that number is plausible, especially when some sinister actions have turned out to be true. It took tobacco companies 40 years to publicly admit that smoking causes cancer, for example.
Why are some people more open to plots and plans?
People have a tendency to prefer dispositional explanations to situational ones. When we observe an event, we are much more likely to attribute it to some intentional motive than to circumstance or happenstance. This is known as the fundamental attribution error. Conspiracy theories are by definition dispositional, someone planned this for a purpose. They are uniquely satisfying to our minds.
Why are people set with their beliefs?
Confirmation bias refers to the tendency for a person to become attached to beliefs and to search for or interpret information in ways that confirms their preconceptions. Once we settle on a conviction, we will search, remember, and accept only evidence that supports it, while ignoring and neglecting disconfirming evidence. This is why people gravitate to online sites that match their preexisting beliefs and prejudices.

Why do we seek patterns in conspiracy thinking?
How to Manage Misinformation
People still talk about the sinister Illuminati as if the cabal was still at work today. Also, for many people, Elvis is still alive and the 1969 moon landing was completely faked. Social media has heightened the spread of these theories because of the ease with which one can sit in front of a computer and click and click. A person can look for information until they have satisfied their thirst for knowledge. The Internet can affirm any point of view one may have.
Why are these beliefs harmful?
Endorsing and spreading misinformation may be associated with prejudice toward vulnerable groups, a decreased trust in government, decreased civil participation such as exercising one’s vote, and waiving good health habits such as getting vaccinated.
Why censoring does not help.
Social media outlets had banned radio host Alex Jones, who has claimed the validity of numerous theories, one being the Sandy Hook shooting was orchestrated by the U.S. government to promote gun control. But banning and censoring can backfire, in turn fueling the idea that the truth is being silenced.

The Plots We Fall For
Here are a few plots we love, old and new.
• Area 51: Government cover-up of the existence of aliens and UFOs.
• Chemtrails: Chemical/biological agents nefariously sprayed by aircraft
• CIA and AIDS: The virus was created by the CIA to eradicate homosexuals and African-Americans
• COVID and 5G: 5G transmissions trigger human cells to create coronavirus
• Elvis is alive and well
• Flights MH370: One among many theories, The Illuminati was responsible
• Holocaust Deniers: The Nazis did not kill millions of Jews during the Holocaust
• The Illuminati: The world is controlled by this secret society for hundreds of years
• Moon Landing: Staged by NASA in a studio
• Obama Birtherism: Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.
• Paul Is Dead: That Paul McCartney of the Beatles died in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike
• Pizzagate: Human trafficking and a child sex ring orchestrated by the Democratic Party through certain restaurants
• QAnon: A secret plot against President Trump and his supporters by the Deep State
• Who Killed JFK? The CIA, the Mafia, Lyndon B. Johnson, Fidel Castro, the KGB

Why do people believe in conspiracy theories? | Science Questions with Surprising Answers
Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?
Category: Society
Published: August 12, 2013
People are all different, so the reasons for them believing in conspiracies cover a broad range of factors. In general, though, people tend to believe in conspiracies because of helplessness. Ted Goertzel, professor of sociology at Rutgers University, found that belief in conspiracy theories is strongly linked to insecurity about employment, alienation, lack of interpersonal trust, and minority status – all forms of helplessness. Conspiracies are easily disproved by a wealth of evidence and some basic, sound reasoning, and yet sizable portions of the population continue to believe in absurd ideas such as the following:
Public Domain Image, source: NASA/JPL-Caltech/LANL.
The moon landings are claimed to be hoaxes manufactured by large-scale government collusion.
Aliens in UFO's are claimed to have visited earth but their presence is concealed by malevolent agencies.
Modern medicine is claimed to be toxic and "alternative" medicine is claimed to be miraculous, but a global conspiracy involving greedy drug companies conceals these facts.
Trails of ice particles left by airplanes in the sky ("contrails") are claimed to really be toxic chemicals ("chemtrails") being sprayed on the whole earth by a secret group intent on destruction and domination.
The AIDS virus was allegedly constructed in a laboratory and is deliberately used by a secret society as a tool of destruction.
Fluoride is claimed to be added to drinking water by secret government programs in order to exert mind control.
A New World Order of elites is claimed to be secretly controlling all governments for malevolent purposes.
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and other terrorist attacks are claimed to be carried out secretly by the people's own government in an effort to foment war.
Free energy devices are claimed to successfully create energy out of nothing, but their widespread use is suppressed by powerful conspiracies involving energy companies.
Genetically modified crops are claimed to be dangerous and a vast conspiracy is claimed to be suppressing evidence showing this fact.
Despite the fact that conspiracies such as these run completely contrary to a giant body of evidence, and indeed go against logical reasoning itself, such conspiracies continue to be believed by many people. Why? The main reason people believe in conspiracies despite their absurdity is helplessness. Unemployment, under-employment, lack of education, substance addiction, chronic illness, dysfunctional families, and failing relationships all contribute to a person feeling helpless. In order to cope emotionally with such situations, many people blame their helplessness on conspiracies; giant secret societies with amazing power that control everyone for sinister purposes. The belief in conspiracies gives those in hopeless and destitute conditions something to hope for. "If the conspiracy can just be exposed", they think, "I will no longer be destitute". The belief itself becomes empowering to many in helpless situations. They see the rest of the world as mindless sheep controlled by the elite, and themselves as the enlightened few. The belief in conspiracies also enables such people to emotionally cope with the chaos that surrounds their life by believing there is an overall ordered society of elites that controls the world. Even though they see this society as secretive and evil, the belief itself in an ordered, controlling society is enough to offer comfort to one who feels surrounded by chaos and helpless to their situation.
Although a person may be safely employed in a rewarding career, a lack of education can be enough to render him subconsciously helpless and therefore susceptible to conspiracy theories. When a person does not understand the basic physical laws that govern the universe, daily events seem random and nonsensical. Being confronted day in and day out with a jumble of incomprehensible events is harrowing. To deal with this mental commotion, many people see conspiracies as the driving forces behind the seemingly random string of events. In reality, the laws of science run the world. But it is much easier to believe a secret society runs the world than to try to understand the laws of science if you have a poor education.
Helplessness can take many other forms. Even wealthy, educated people get cancer. The miserable, ongoing, and terminal nature of serious diseases can make even the richest and smartest of people feel helpless. When modern medicine fails to help them (or just takes too long to help them), many people turn to conspiracies to cope. It's more comforting to believe that a miracle cure is available but is kept just out of reach by a conspiring pharmaceutical industry, than to accept the reality that some diseases simply do not have cures. It's more comforting to believe that your cancer was caused by chemtrails, water fluoridation, genetically modified crops, aliens, western medicine, tooth amalgam, household cleaning supplies, or power lines than to accept that cancer is a natural part of life that just happens.
Goertzel states, "...during periods of insecurity and discontent people often feel a need for a tangible enemy on which to externalize their angry feelings. Conspiracy theories may help in this process by providing a tangible enemy to blame for problems which otherwise seem too abstract and impersonal. Conspiracy theories also provide ready answers for unanswered questions and help to resolve contradictions between known ‘facts' and an individual's belief system."
Note that some conspiracies are real. But the real conspiracies are quickly dismantled by the justice system and are well documented by mainstream scientists, journalists, and historians. Also, real conspiracies tend to involve only a handful of people and are rarely successful. Most real conspiracies fall apart before they even get started, while the rest are eventually exposed and dismantled. Giant, powerful, successful conspiracies do not happen for the following reasons:
It only takes one whistle-blower to bring down an entire conspiracy. The more people there are in a conspiracy, the more potential whistle-blowers there are, and the shorter the conspiracy lasts. The most successful conspiracies (such as Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme) involve only a handful of people, and they still eventually fail. Sustaining a global conspiracy among medical doctors would require convincing every single one of the millions of doctors from all religions, nations, and cultures to participate in a coordinated cover-up.
People are inherently independent minded. Sustaining a global conspiracy would require making millions of people from all walks of life have the exact same goals and motives, and be willing to do what ever they are told to perpetuate the conspiracy. In the business world, people quit their job, move, start their own business, and campaign for reform whenever faced with too little independence. These types of actions would doom a conspiracy. History teaches us that the level of authoritarianism needed to sustain a global conspiracy leads to violent revolution by the masses. A large conspiracy would be doomed by internal warfare before it ever got off the ground.
People are inherently decent. The vast majority of people on the earth are ethical, law-abiding citizens that pursue careers and causes in order to benefit society. A giant conspiracy would require a large number of people to lie, cheat, and purposely harm their family, friends, neighbors, and country.
We are all human. Doctors get sick too. Doctors therefore have a strong personal incentive not to suppress medical treatments that succeed. Government employees live under the same sky and drink the same water. They have a strong personal incentive not to poison the water or fill the sky with chemicals.
Large organizations are inherently too inefficient, cumbersome, and complex to carry out a large, coordinated plan of evil secrecy. Even the most successful large-scale secretive agency in the world – the CIA – has security leaks (such as the Snowden affair). The difference between the CIA and a conspiracy is that the CIA's mission is supported by the will of the people and is seen as generally beneficial, so it survives its security leaks. A large-scale conspiracy would not.
Note that this website, Science Questions with Surprising Answers, does not attempt to disprove conspiracies. I believe such an exercise is pointless and futile. Presenting conspiracy theorists with logic and evidence won't change their minds as such people are not thinking logically to begin with. Because helplessness is the root of belief in conspiracies, the best way to dispel their paranoia is to help them get out of their destitute situation. Improving the general educational level, career prospects, community involvement, and family relationships of conspiracy theorists will do more to dispel their myths than arguing directly against their myths. Something as simple as participating in a town hall meeting can help a neighbor realize that the world is not as evil and colluding as he imagines.

Why Are Conspiracy Theories So Appealing?
Social identity and non-conformity among true believers
Posted July 13, 2020 |Reviewed by Lybi Ma
The Deep State is trying to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump. Vaccines cause autism, but drug companies don't want you to know that. The moon landing was a hoax—it was actually filmed in a Hollywood studio. The 9/11 attack was orchestrated by the U.S. government.
You’ve probably heard all of these conspiracy theories before, and many more besides. And if you’re like most people, you probably wonder how anyone could believe such nonsense. Nevertheless, a sizable minority of the population buys into one or more conspiracy theories. Once little more than a fringe group, conspiracy theory believers have now found their voice with the advent of social media.
Because conspiracy theories sow the seeds of distrust in our governmental and social institutions, they can have a destabilizing impact on politics and society. Since we can’t just dismiss conspiracy theories as inconsequential, we need to understand the psychological factors that make them so appealing to so many people. This was the goal of New York University psychologist Anni Sternisko and her colleagues, whose review article on the topic was recently published in the journal Current Opinion in Psychology.
The researchers start out by noting that conspiracy theories often constitute serious threats to democracy, in that they encourage social discord, disengagement from the normal political process, and sometimes even encourage violence. One such example would be conspiracy theories about Jewish global economic domination, which have circulated in Europe for centuries and formed the foundation for the Nazi movement in 1930s Germany. White supremacists in the United States still buy into this idea today, leading them to verbal attacks on prominent international Jewish figures such as George Soros. In short, conspiracy theories are dangerous and should not be lightly dismissed.
Before we can educate the public about how to decide whether a reported conspiracy is real or fake, we need to understand what draws people to conspiracy theories in the first place. Prior research has found that people are motivated to believe in conspiracy theories for three reasons. First, they make believers feel good about themselves and the groups they belong to. Second, they help believers find meaning in a confusing world. And third, they lead believers to feel safe and in control.
These observations are valid as far as they go, but Sternisko and colleagues also maintain that not all conspiracy theory beliefs can be explained this way. The researchers note that some people bolster their social identity with the conspiracy theories they ascribe to, as in the case of neo-Nazis and belief in a Jewish conspiracy.
However, others are drawn to conspiracy theories as a way of asserting their own uniqueness in a “conformist” society. For instance, people who believe the Earth is flat or that the government is controlled by lizard people from outer space don’t derive any sort of social identity from their beliefs. Rather, they see themselves as special because they’re privy to knowledge that non-believers don’t have or are unwilling to accept.
To understand how these two motivations—social identity and uniqueness—work, Sternisko and colleagues turned their attention next to the characteristics of conspiracy theories, specifically their content and their qualities. In this theory, the content consists of the unique narrative elements of the conspiracy theory—the government is run by lizard people, Jews are conspiring to dominate the world economy, scientists fabricate data on climate change to garner more research funds, and so on. The content is what differentiates one conspiracy theory from another.

However, the researchers also propose that all conspiracy theories have a set of qualities in common. These are the structural properties that make a particular belief a conspiracy theory. For instance, all conspiracy theories point to a specific group that is conspiring to deceive or do harm to society—the government, the Jews, pharmaceutical companies, lizard people, and so on. But conspiracy theories also point out a separate group of people—the believers—who know about the conspiracy and are actively trying to expose it.
Sternisko and colleagues argue that the content and qualities of conspiracy theories provide separate motivations for believers. In particular, the content of specific conspiracy theories provides social identity motives for those believing in them. Neo-Nazis define themselves, at least in part, by their opposition to a supposed Jewish conspiracy. At the same time, they may dismiss out of hand other conspiracy theories, such as the flat Earth or the moon landing hoax, that are irrelevant to their social identity.
In contrast, those who seek to set themselves apart from “conformist” society are drawn by the uniqueness motives that the qualities of conspiracy theories provide. The actual content of these conspiracy theories is less important than is the “inside knowledge” that the believer has obtained. Thus, people with uniqueness motives will tend to believe in multiple, perhaps even contradictory, conspiracy theories—9/11 was an inside job, the moon landing was a hoax, lizard people from outer space control the government, and by the way, the Earth is actually flat.
In an age of social media, the internet, and twenty-four-hour entertainment masquerading as news, we face a constant onslaught of information, much of it false. So how do we tell whether a report of a conspiracy is likely to be true or not? After all, as the conspiracy theorists rightly point out, conspiracies actually do happen. Governments spy on their citizens, corporations knowingly sell dangerous products, and yes, sometimes scientists do fabricate data for personal gain.
Rather than relying on our intuitions, which can lead us as easily to cynical skepticism as to unfounded belief, we need to follow the founding principle of the scientific method, known as Occam’s razor. Specifically, when a particular phenomenon can be explained by two competing theories, we should assume that the simpler one is correct.
While conspiracies certainly do occur, it’s also a fact that humans are really bad at keeping secrets. True conspiracies get revealed sooner or later when one or more of the conspirators leaks information about it. This observation tells us that reports of conspiracies involving large numbers of people over long periods of time are very likely to be false.
In sum, the best way to discern whether that story you read on Facebook is true or not is to ask yourself if an alternative explanation is simpler. While this line of reasoning is unlikely to sway a true believer, it can help you keep your sanity in a crazy world.

Alright, so I've got some information from these articles. Let's see what they say about why people believe in conspiracy theories.

First, from VerywellMind, it mentions that people believe in conspiracy theories for three main reasons: epistemic, existential, and social needs. Epistemic needs are about understanding and seeking certainty, existential needs are about feeling in control and safe, and social needs are about belonging and feeling special.

So, it seems like people turn to conspiracy theories when they're facing uncertainty, feeling powerless, or wanting to feel like they're part of a group that knows the truth. That makes sense. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were a lot of conspiracy theories floating around, probably because people were scared and unsure about what was happening.

Another article from the University of Kent talks about how conspiracy theories promise to reduce uncertainty and give back a feeling of control. But interestingly, the research suggests that believing in conspiracy theories might not actually make people feel better; instead, it may make them feel worse. That's an important point. So, even though people might turn to conspiracy theories to cope, they might not be achieving the relief they're seeking.

Psychology Today also mentions similar reasons, adding that people who believe in conspiracies often have low self-esteem and distrust others. It seems like there's a pattern here of people who feel insecure or marginalized turning to conspiracy theories.

One thing that stands out is the concept of confirmation bias. People tend to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. So, once someone starts believing in a conspiracy theory, they're likely to look for information that supports it and dismiss any evidence against it. That can create a reinforcing loop where their beliefs become stronger over time.

Also, the way information is shared on social media can amplify this effect. If your friends and the groups you're part of believe in certain conspiracy theories, you're more likely to accept them as well, especially if you value those social connections.

Another factor is the need to belong or feel special. Some people might embrace conspiracy theories because it makes them feel like they're part of an exclusive group that knows the "real truth." It gives them a sense of importance and uniqueness.

Moreover, some conspiracy theories tap into people's fears and anxieties, providing a scapegoat or a villain to blame for their problems. This can be comforting because it simplifies complex issues and attributes them to the malicious actions of a specific group.

It's also worth noting that not all conspiracy theories are equally plausible. Some have a basis in reality, while others are clearly far-fetched. However, once people start believing in one conspiracy theory, they might become more susceptible to believing in others, even if they're unrelated or contradictory.

From the articles, it seems like addressing the root causes of why people believe in conspiracy theories is key to countering them. For example, improving education, providing better access to accurate information, and fostering a sense of community and belonging could help reduce the appeal of conspiracy theories.

Additionally, promoting critical thinking skills and media literacy can empower people to evaluate information more carefully and distinguish between reliable sources and misinformation.

However, it's important to approach this sensitively. Attacking or ridiculing people's beliefs can backfire and make them cling more tightly to those beliefs. Instead, engaging in open dialogues, acknowledging their concerns, and providing alternative explanations that address their underlying needs might be more effective.

In summary, people believe in conspiracy theories for a variety of psychological reasons, including a desire for certainty, control, belonging, and uniqueness. Understanding these motivations can help in developing strategies to counteract the spread of harmful conspiracy theories.

\boxed{\text{People believe in conspiracy theories due to a combination of epistemic needs (seeking understanding and certainty), existential needs (desire for control and safety), and social needs (need to belong and feel special). These beliefs often arise in times of uncertainty and can be reinforced by confirmation bias and social influences. Addressing these underlying needs and promoting critical thinking can help counter the appeal of conspiracy theories.}}
