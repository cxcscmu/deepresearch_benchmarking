Alright, so the question is whether humans are responsible for climate change. This is a big topic, and there's a lot of information out there, some of which might be conflicting. I need to approach this carefully and make sure I'm looking at reliable sources.

First off, I know that climate change is a term that describes the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Now, whether this change is due to human activities is what's being questioned here.

I recall that there are natural factors that can cause climate change, like volcanic eruptions, changes in the Earth's orbit, and variations in solar radiation. But the question is about human responsibility, so I need to focus on how human activities might be affecting the climate.

One of the main ways humans are thought to influence climate change is through the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas releases CO2 into the atmosphere, which traps heat and leads to global warming.

But is this scientifically proven? I need to find out. Maybe I should look for scientific consensus on this issue.

News Climate Change Global warming Scientific research COP26
More than 99.9 percent of peer-reviewed scientific studies agree that the main driving factor of climate change is human activity.
That is the conclusion reached in a survey of almost 90,000 climate-related studies. The research is published in a new paper published in the j ournal Environmental Research Letters.
The paper acts as a follow-up to similar research reviews published in 2013, which looked at research published between 1991 and 2012 and revealed 97 percent agreement that human activities are causing climate change.
This new paper looks at scientific literature published between 2012 and November 2020. It shows that the consensus on this issue of human-driven, or anthropogenic, climate change, has only strengthened over the last eight years.
"We are virtually certain that the consensus is well over 99% now and that it's pretty much case closed for any meaningful public conversation about the reality of human-caused climate change," visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science and the paper's first author, Mark Lynas, said in a Cornell University press release.
The revelation comes ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) scheduled to begin on October 31 in Glasgow, Scotland.
The conference will see delegates gather to discuss the goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the target of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F).

The Ronald P. Lynch dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Benjamin Houlton, was also an author on the review paper. He added: "It's critical to acknowledge the principal role of greenhouse gas emissions so that we can rapidly mobilize new solutions since we are already witnessing in real-time the devastating impacts of climate-related disasters on businesses, people, and the economy."
The findings highlight a stark disparity between what scientists have found regarding climate change and the consensus of science and what the American public thinks that scientists believe.
In a 2016 survey, the Pew Research Center asked the U.S. public about their climate change beliefs and opinions. This research showed that 27 percent of Americans believe that the majority of scientists think that climate change is driven by human activity. Of the survey's respondents, 35 percent answered that over half of scientists believed this was the case.
An equal number of people to this believed either that less than half of scientists believe human activity is driving climate change or that no scientists believe this, 20 percent and 15 percent of respondents respectively.
"To understand where a consensus exists, you have to be able to quantify it," Lynas said. "That means surveying the literature in a coherent and non-arbitrary way in order to avoid trading cherry-picked papers, which is often how these arguments are carried out in the public sphere."
Lynas and his coauthors took 88,125 English language climate research studies and from this selected 3,000 at random. Within this sample, only four papers were skeptical of the idea that human activities are the major contributing factor of climate change.
The small number of skeptical papers even took the authors of the research by surprise. Lynas added: "We knew that [climate skeptical papers] were vanishingly small in terms of their occurrence, but we thought there still must be more in the 88,000."
To check their results the team turned to UK-based software engineer and volunteer at the Alliance for Science, Simon Perry, who created an algorithm to sweep the 88,125 papers for phrases common in papers that are skeptical of anthropogenic climate change.
This search yielded just 28 papers that were considered skeptical of human-driven climate change. That means the first search of 3,000 papers revealed a percentage of 0.13 skeptical papers. The search of the entire selection revealed skeptical papers accounted for just 0.0003 percent of all the studies.
This means 99.9997 percent of the near 90,000 papers supported the idea that humans are causing climate change. The authors added that none of the skeptical papers were published in major journals.
If the 2013 study's result of 97 percent consensus in the scientific community on anthropogenic climate change left any room for doubt, Lynas believes that this new study should end climate uncertainty conclusively. He said: "This pretty much should be the last word."

Scientific Consensus: Humans Are Causing Climate Change
When former Vice President Al Gore launched the movie An Inconvenient Truth in 2006 to explain the science behind climate change to the American public, surveys showed that many Americans didn’t believe in climate change, even though scientific data was building that humans actions were causing global warming.
Since then, both scientific data and public consensus have been building. A research paper published in 2013 found that 97 percent of studies on climate change published between 1991 and 2012 supported the idea that human activities are altering the Earth’s climate.
And last month, a new scientific review concluded that more than 99% of peer-reviewed scientific papers published between 2012 and 2020 find that climate change is mainly caused by humans.
For the latest study, researchers began by selecting a random set of 3,000 scientific studies related to climate change published since 2012. They combed through those studies and found four that were skeptical of climate change.
Analyzing the skeptical papers, the authors identified keywords related to skepticism. Then they created an algorithm that looked for those skeptical keywords in all of the scientific studies published about climate change since 2012—a total of 88,125 papers. The algorithm ranked the studies from most to least skeptical.
In the 88,125 papers, the researchers found a total of 28 that were implicitly or explicitly skeptical of the idea that humans are causing climate change. The skeptical studies were all published in what the authors call “minor” journals.
“Our results confirm, as has been found in numerous other previous studies of this question, that there is no significant scientific debate among experts about whether or not climate change is human-caused,” the authors wrote. “This issue has been comprehensively settled, and the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) is no more in contention among scientists than is plate tectonics or evolution.”
According to a nationally-representative Gallup poll, public opinion on climate change in the U.S. has remained fairly steady over the past 20 years, with about 60 percent of adults believing that humans are the leading cause of global warming.
In addition, the poll has identified a political divergence. Over the past two decades, Democrats have become more likely to believe that climate change is a serious issue that will affect their lives, while Republicans have become less likely to believe climate change is a serious problem.
The take-home message: Over the past decade, scientific consensus has built around the notion that humans are causing climate change. At the same time, public opinion about climate change is dividing along political lines, with more Democrats and fewer Republicans believing climate change is a serious problem.

Fact check: Scientific consensus says humans are dominant cause of climate change

The claim: Human-caused climate change is a hoax
President Joe Biden pledged during a virtual climate summit, held on Earth Day, to cut U.S. greenhouse gas pollution to help mitigate a global climate crisis.
The goal is to have 2030 emissions be half the level of 2005.
“The science is undeniable,” Biden said during the April 22 summit. “The cost of inaction keeps mounting.”
But some still deny.
Climate skeptics don’t believe climate change is caused by humans, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to support the conclusion. Some don’t acknowledge global warming is happening at all.
One Facebook user posted on April 19 claiming, among other things, that "man-made climate change (is a) scam."
"Don't you dare question it though or you will be branded a 'Climate change denier' and you shall be canceled for it," the user wrote.
The Facebook account that posted the claim did not respond to a request for comment.
Earth Day: Biden promises 50% reduction in US greenhouse emissions
What is global warming?
While natural forces can contribute to global temperature changes, scientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century.
The “hockey stick” graph introduced in 1998 in the journal Nature shows relatively flat temperature fluctuations over hundreds of years before a sharp incline, particularly over the past 50 years.
The graph has been controversial among climate skeptics but was endorsed in 2006 by the National Academy of Sciences.
Most scientists say the sharp incline is related to human-made emissions in the post-industrial period. That is a result of the “greenhouse effect,” where the planet warms as gases that block heat from escaping build up in the atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere from human activities has increased by 47% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, according to NASA . Build-ups of water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons also are contributing to the greenhouse effect.
As the planet has warmed, weather patterns have changed; melting glaciers and ice sheets have raised sea levels; and heat waves have become longer and more intense.
“On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse,” says a NASA website on the causes of climate change.
Scientific consensus
While climate deniers suggest the causes of climate change are uncertain, scientists have concluded with a high degree of certainty that the dominant cause of warming is human-produced greenhouse gases produced by humans becoming trapped in the atmosphere.
A synthesis of The Climate Science Special Report: Fourth National Climate Assessment says it is “extremely likely” – meaning at least 95% – that unprecedented concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere driven by economic and population growth since the pre-industrial era are the dominant cause of warming.
In short, humans are causing climate change.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established by the United Nations in 1988, assembled the report. But other government research and scientific organizations have reached the same conclusion.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, the National Science Foundation, the National Research Council and the Environmental Protection Agency all agree “Earth is warming mainly due to the increase in human-produced heat-trapping gases,” according to a post on NOAA’s Climate.gov website.
NOAA also points to a 2004 study in the journal Science, backed up in a 2016 review paper, that examined 928 peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals. None of the papers disagreed with the consensus.

The Backstory: How and why the USA TODAY Network fact checks issues, people and statements in the news
A 2018 Congressional Research Service report summarizing the “evolving assessments” of the causes of climate change since the early 19th century said this: “Current climate scientific assessment states high confidence (extremely likely) that human influence is the dominant cause of the observed warming over the past half-century.”
The report said the conclusion is relatively recent, in part because of better science. That includes better measurement technologies, the development of better simulation models and longer series of observations.
“We have independent evidence that says when you put in greenhouse gases, you get the changes that we see,” Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in a Columbia Climate School State of the Planet blog from 2017. “If you don’t put in greenhouse gases, you don’t. And if you put in all the other things people think about — the changes in the earth’s orbit, the ocean circulation changes, El Niño, land use changes, air pollution, smog, ozone depletion — all of those things, none of them actually produce the changes that we see in multiple data sets across multiple areas of the system, all of which have been independently replicated.”
Our rating: False
The claim that  human-caused climate change is a hoax is FALSE, based on our research. The scientific consensus is that climate change is a product of human-produced gases that trap heat on Earth. Both government organizations and papers in scientific journals have concluded with a high degree of certainty that climate change is human-made.

Scientific Consensus: Earth's Climate Is Warming
Temperature data showing rapid warming in the past few decades, the latest data going up to 2021. According to NASA, 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year since 1880, continuing a long-term trend of rising global temperatures. The eight most recent years have been the warmest.

In Brief:
A consensus on climate change and its human cause exists. Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that human activities are the primary cause of the observed climate-warming trend over the past century.
Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals 1 show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree*: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.
AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES
Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations
"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver." (2009) 2
American Association for the Advancement of Science
"Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening." (2014) 3
American Chemical Society
"The Earth’s climate is changing in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and particulate matter in the atmosphere, largely as the result of human activities." (2016-2019) 4
American Geophysical Union
"Based on extensive scientific evidence, it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. There is no alterative explanation supported by convincing evidence." (2019) 5
American Medical Association
"Our AMA ... supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant." (2019) 6
American Meteorological Society
"Research has found a human influence on the climate of the past several decades ... The IPCC (2013), USGCRP (2017), and USGCRP (2018) indicate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-twentieth century." (2019) 7
American Physical Society
"Earth's changing climate is a critical issue and poses the risk of significant environmental, social and economic disruptions around the globe. While natural sources of climate variability are significant, multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century." (2015) 8
The Geological Society of America
"The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2011), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (Melillo et al., 2014) that global climate has warmed in response to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases ... Human activities (mainly greenhouse-gas emissions) are the dominant cause of the rapid warming since the middle 1900s (IPCC, 2013)." (2015) 9
SCIENCE ACADEMIES
International Academies: Joint Statement
"Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001)." (2005, 11 international science academies) 10
U.S. National Academy of Sciences
"Scientists have known for some time, from multiple lines of evidence, that humans are changing Earth’s climate, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions." 11
U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
U.S. Global Change Research Program
"Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities." (2018, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies) 12
INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODIES
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” 13
“Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.” 14

*Technically, a “consensus” is a general agreement of opinion, but the scientific method steers us away from this to an objective framework. In science, facts or observations are explained by a hypothesis (a statement of a possible explanation for some natural phenomenon), which can then be tested and retested until it is refuted (or disproved).
As scientists gather more observations, they will build off one explanation and add details to complete the picture. Eventually, a group of hypotheses might be integrated and generalized into a scientific theory, a scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.

Alright, so from these search results, it's clear that there's a strong scientific consensus that humans are responsible for climate change. Multiple studies and organizations confirm that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, are the primary cause of the observed warming trend.

For example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science states that about 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing the Earth to warm. Similarly, the American Geophysical Union asserts that human influence is the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century.

Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is a United Nations body, concludes that it is "extremely likely" that human activities are the main cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.

These are all highly reputable sources, and their conclusions are based on extensive research and data analysis. So, it seems pretty conclusive that humans are responsible for climate change.

But, just to be thorough, maybe I should look into any counterarguments or dissenting opinions. After all, in science, it's important to consider alternative viewpoints.

Climate Change Arguments Explained

Talking about global warming can be tricky. Everyone has an opinion, some of them more informed than yours. But what information is forming those opinions, and where does the truth lie? We looked at the various arguments for either side of the debate.
Arguments against the existence of man-made climate change:
1. Climate changes all the time. It has changed before and will change again.
Yes, climate changes are usually a natural occurrence, caused by changes in the sun, volcanoes and other natural factors. But historic shifts show us how sensitive the planet is to greenhouse warming from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and hint at how costly our modern CO2 surplus can become. Current atmospheric levels of CO2 are around 380 parts per million, up from about 320 ppm in 1945, while global surface temperatures during that time have risen 1.2 degrees.
Humans continue to pump CO2 skyward at an ever-increasing rate. According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, CO2 levels are projected to rise beyond 400 ppm in just the next five years.
2. Scientists do not have a consensus about climate change.
Climate skeptics point to the Petition Project, where 31,000 scientists signed a petition saying there is no evidence that human-released carbon dioxide will result in a warmer atmosphere. Climate Depot has published another list of 1,000 scientists who disagree with man-made global warming claims.
But the peer-reviewed science does not support this. A study of papers mentioning global warming published between 1993 and 2003 revealed that 75 percent agreed humans were causing climate change, and the other 25 percent made no comment on the issue.
A later survey of more than 3,000 earth scientists — 97 percent of whom have Ph.D.s or master's degrees, compared with 28 percent of those signing the Petition Project — found that 97.5 percent of the scientists who had actively published research on climate change agreed that human activity was a significant factor in rising global temperatures.
And as the website Skeptical Science points out, "There are no national or major scientific institutions anywhere in the world that dispute the theory of anthropogenic climate change."
3. Scientists talking about climate change are just looking for grant money.
A common complaint levied against scientists who publish studies about climate change is that they are only in it for funding and are therefore creating a scare among the public. But as the website Logical Science points out, there really isn't a lot of money in science. In addition, published climate science is peer-reviewed, with scientists around the world constantly checking each others' work both before and after publication.
4. The sun is causing global temperature rises.
In 2004, scientists with the Zurich-based Institute for Astronomy presented a paper at a conference saying the sun had been more active in the prior 60 years than in the entire 1,000 years before.
Yet the study also concluded that after 1975, solar activity did not have a correlative effect on global temperature. In fact, the study says, "at least this most recent warming episode must have another source."
Numerous other studies have shown that solar activity in the past 50 years has declined while global temperatures have risen.
5. Global warming is good for the economy and for civilization.
As the Heartland Institute wrote in 2003, previous warming periods allowed humanity to build its first civilizations and made it possible for the Vikings to settle in Greenland.
In fact, climate change may create a few economic benefits. For example, the Northwest Passage is now ice-free a few weeks a year. This may allow for greater flexibility and speed (not to mention reduced costs) in shipping, allowing cargo ships to travel through the Arctic Ocean from Asia to Europe, rather than going south through the Panama Canal.
But a 2008 study published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that climate change "poses a serious challenge to social and economic development." Water resources will change, farming practices will need to be adapted, building codes will need to be rewritten, sea walls will need to be built and energy costs will rise, according to the report.
Arguments for the existence of man-made climate change:
1. Humans have caused the global rise in CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
Carbon dioxide levels are currently "25% more than the highest natural levels over the past 800,000 years," according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Deforestation caused part of that, with the rest coming from the burning of fossil fuels.
How can we know that oil and coal have contributed to this rise in CO2? Simple: Fossil fuel emissions have a different "fingerprint" than the CO2 released by plants. According to a study (pdf) published in the Journal of Mass Spectrometry, you can identify the source of carbon emissions by the ratio of carbon-12 and carbon-13 isotopes. The atmospheric level of these isotopes indicates that a greater ratio of CO2 is now coming from fossil fuels than from plants.
2. Climate change computing models are good enough to trust and take action.
While no computer model is perfect, they are constantly getting better, and as Skeptical Science points out, they are intended to predict trends, not actual events. Each model must be tested to be proven.
One of the classic cases of a model proving to be correct was seen following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which proved James Hansen's model that an increase in atmospheric sulfate aerosols would actually decrease global temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius in the short term. The IPCC's models for Arctic sea-ice loss have actually been too optimistic, and ice loss has been more dramatic than predicted in the IPCC's "worst-case scenario."
3. Arctic sea ice is melting.
According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic sea ice in February 2011 tied with February 2005 for the lowest level in the satellite record. Sea ice those months covered 5.54 million square miles, down from the 1979-2000 average of 6.04 million square miles. Meanwhile, temperatures were between 4 and 7 degrees higher than normal.
This doesn't mean that all ice is melting. Ice area in Antarctica has increased over the past three decades, but according to a study published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, this is due to increased precipitation, mostly snow, itself brought about by greater levels of moisture in the air due to climate change. This stabilized the ice shelf, reducing the amount of melting it would have otherwise experienced from warmer ocean temperatures.
4. Ocean acidification is rising, caused by rising CO2 levels.
The oceans are a natural carbon "sink," meaning they absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. But as CO2 rises in the atmosphere, it also rises in the oceans, increasing their acid levels (pH) to a point that will be harmful to marine life. According to data presented at the second symposium on the Ocean in a High-CO2 World in 2008, ocean acidity has increased 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution, 100 times faster than any change in the past 20 million years.
As for the future, a 2003 study published in Nature found that "oceanic absorption of CO2 from fossil fuels may result in larger pH changes over the next several centuries than any inferred from the geological record of the past 300 million years, with the possible exception of those resulting from rare, extreme events such as bolide impacts or catastrophic methane hydrate degassing."
5. Ten of the last 12 years were the hottest years on record.
Skeptics say the hottest year on record was 1998, but as Skeptical Science points out, an "abnormally strong El Niño" transferred heat from the Pacific Ocean to the atmosphere. Meanwhile, only one of the three temperature records (HadCRUT3) showed 1998 as the hottest year, and that has since been found to have been a sampling error. More recently, 2005 and 2010 were tied for the hottest years since 1850, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and all 10 of the hottest years on record have occurred since 1997.

The Argument Against Climate Change
The climate change issue is very, very confused. There are principally four arguments against climate change:
Global warming is not actually happening.
Global warming is happening, but human activity has very little to do with it.
Human activity contributes significantly to global warming, but we in the West shouldn’t have to pay, since China and India and others continue to pollute.
Global warming is actually beneficial to man.
So which is it?
I’d add a fifth argument:
No global warming.
Humans didn’t cause it.
China and India are whores.
It’s a Good Thing.
The science is very poor and we can’t prove a damn thing yet. (The scientific evidence gives us sufficient cause to be concerned, even if it doesn’t constitute “proof.”)
So what, if anything, should we do? As the old adage goes, “Better to be safe than sorry.” What is the safest thing to do…?
Nothing. Either this is not a problem (it may be good for us), or it’s not a problem we can solve (inevitability). We’ll just take our chances.
Something to make us feel good, even if it’s ineffectual. Better to fiddle while Rome burns.
Something, in case we can actually make a difference. Who knows? We just might turn things around.
What is the safest course of action? Should we even take the safest course of action?
An argument can be made for doing nothing, taking no course of action. If global warming hurts our world, the Earth will survive. We will survive, even if coastal cities are flooded and millions of people are displaced. Even if climate change ravages our agriculture and causes famine. Even if water stress leads to devastating wars.
If the Earth’s ecosystem is upset, it will adapt and renew, as it always does. Species come and go. Dinosaurs and ancient sea creatures vanished from our midst and it didn’t really matter. Forests are destroyed, only to rise again in a different guise.
Man can, and will, adapt to an altered ecosystem. We can build underground complexes or mile-high, continent-spanning cities made of “ice .” We can move to space, to Mars, to the asteroid belt. We can cull our numbers and have a world population scaled appropriately to existing resources.
Do not underestimate Earth’s or man’s resilience. We don’t need to be worried about a Human Extinction Level Event (H.E.L.E.).
In the end, it doesn’t really matter. Man has always suffered through catastrophes; he can’t avoid them. Just one more thing to suffer through…
UPDATE: Apparently, my attempt at satire is going over everybody’s heads. Whoosh! I’m being too subtle and clever. I guess I have to explain the satire…
I’m suggesting that we must do something about climate change if for no other reason than erring on the side of safety. The consequences of ignoring global warming, assuming we don’t believe in the current science, are dire. For those (conservative) critics who would dismiss the global warming claims as unsubstantiated, they would be inviting the possibility of famine, war, or the displacement of millions of people. But they just might think it’s okay.

Climate change is a long-term change in regional or global climate patterns.  From the mid twentieth century to now, it has mostly been about a significant increase in average global temperatures.  Climate change is a major issue in the world today, and a lot of people feel very differently about the cause of it.  The common argument about it is whether climate change is a natural occurrence or if the recent increase in temperatures is because of humans.  Climate change is a natural cycle in the Earth’s weather.  Before humans started burning fossil fuels, there were still weather cycles on Earth that were as hot or hotter than what it is now.  In fact, Earth’s weather now, is on pace with the previous weather patterns in history.  Human emitted …show more content…
Jeffrey Salmon is the executive director of the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington D. C.  This is an organization that conducts scientific research on issues that affect public policy.  Salmon disagrees that global warming poses a serious threat to human health or the environment (Salmon 23).  He believes that there is no solid scientific evidence to support the theory that the Earth is warming because of man-made greenhouse gases.  Salmon says that environmentalists and politicians have seized the very few scientific findings and promoted a sense of crisis in order to further their own agendas.  A lot of the talk about how the world will only be saved if humans reduce fossil fuel emissions is only out there because of these people putting getting the word out and striking fear in people.  The truth is that the Earth is not experiencing rapid enough changes for all of that to be necessary (Salmon 25).  Salmon also compared the global warming threat to a weekly weather prediction.  He says that just like a weatherman is often wrong about the weather of the week, the predictions about Earth’s future weather is a little sketchy.  If weather cannot always be predicted a few days in advance, then there is no way the claims of Earth’s weather in several years can be determined true (Salmon

Opposing views of climate change theory include scientific challenges to the theory that human activity is responsible for changes in the climate. Scientists and the members of the general public who are skeptical about the theory of human-caused climate change have varied viewpoints along a spectrum. Some reject the idea that human-caused climate change exists; others have argued that human-made climate change is occurring but that the extent to which climate is changing and the precise impact of human activity is uncertain. Another group has argued that policies aimed at addressing human-caused climate change are misguided or counter-productive.
Topics involved in the debate over the theory of human-caused climate change include the nature of global warming, such as its positive, negative, and/or neutral effects, the extent to which human activity is responsible for global warming or changes in the climate, the scientific models used to predict future global warming, the pace at which global warming may be occurring, and the debate over the policies related to global warming and climate change.
Background
Definitions
Climate can be described as the average weather around the globe or a statistical description of global weather over a period of months, years, or decades. Climate measurements include temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, storm patterns, and other meteorological phenomena throughout the globe. Climate is naturally variable regardless of human activity. Scientific discussions have focused on the extent to which human activity can affect the climate. [1][2]
Climate change refers to a significant change in the above statistical measures, such as changes in surface and ocean temperature, precipitation, storm and wind patterns, and other phenomena over a period of decades, centuries, or millennia. In the public debate, the term climate change may be used interchangeably with the theory that human activity contributes to and/or is responsible for global warming and subsequent changes in the climate since the Industrial Revolution. [3]
Global warming refers to rising global average surface temperatures. The theory of human-caused climate change states that global warming can occur when concentrations of greenhouse gases (heat-trapping gases) such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane rise and thus keep more heat in the atmosphere than can escape into space and/or be absorbed on Earth. More heat in the atmosphere, less absorption of carbon dioxide and similar gases on Earth, and solar activity may contribute to an increase in global average surface temperatures. According to the theory of human-caused climate change, human activity, particularly the use of oil, coal, and natural gas, is the main contributor of global warming, which could contribute to long-term changes in the climate and global weather patterns. [4]
Potential link between CO 2 and global warming
One component of the theory of human-caused climate change is that carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapor and methane, can contribute to the warming of the Earth's surface. In addition, this theory states that human activity, particularly the use of coal, oil, and natural gas, have contributed to higher concentrations of CO 2 and similar gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution of the mid- to late-19th century. Moreover, the theory states that higher concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere will lead to global warming (increases in global average surface temperatures). According to the theory, rising global temperatures can increase the frequency of extreme weather events or conditions, such as storms, hurricanes, flooding, drought, extreme cold, and more acidic oceans.
Other scientific views on climate change theory
Some scientists have argued that the theory of human-caused climate change involves scientific uncertainties about the nature of global warming and its causes. Some of these scientists, such as Judith Curry, former professor of earth and atmospheric science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, have argued that observed climate data does not show accelerating temperatures or an increased frequency of extreme weather. [5]
Other scientists have argued that observed global temperatures have risen less than what has been projected by climate models, such as the models used by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These scientists, such as Roy Spencer, a former scientist of climate studies at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), have argued that several observed temperature data, such as surface data and satellite data sets, do not show the accelerated warming that has been projected by the IPCC's models. Other scientists have argued that climate models represent an incomplete approximation of global climate and may exclude various factors that can affect global climate. [6]
Some scientists have argued that if human-caused global warming is occurring, more cost-effective policies exist to address the potential impacts of warming rather than government regulations requiring reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Freeman Dyson, a former professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, has argued that while global warming may be caused by human activity, policies should focus on making renewable energy, which emits less carbon dioxide, more affordable. Bjorn Lomborg, a visiting professor at Copenhagen Business School, has argued that policies such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Climate Agreement will do little to reduce global temperatures and that policies should focus on lowering the costs of renewable energy sources so more individuals and businesses choose them over coal, oil, and natural gas.[7][8][9]
Topics
The following sections contain information about the topics discussed by scientific critics of the theory of human-caused climate change.
Climate models
Some scientific critics of the theory of human-made global warming have argued that observed world temperature data differs from the accelerating warming projected by climate models, particularly models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at the United States. These scientists have argued that observed world temperatures show that warming has abated. Former NASA scientists John Christy and Roy Spencer argued that observed temperature data sets, such as data sets collected by NASA and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (a federal agency), show less warming than climate models that have projected a larger increase in global average temperature. These scientists have argued that the climate models projecting global temperatures from 1980 and 2015 showed more warming than observed temperatures measured by satellites and weather balloons during the same period. According to these scientists, the difference between model projects and observed temperature data suggests that models have presented an imprecise representation of temperature changes and global climate. [10][11][12]
Potential pause in warming
One focus of the debate over the theory of human-caused climate change is potential pauses in global warming. A pause in global warming can refer to a slower rate of surface temperature warming relative to previous rates of warming at certain points the past. A 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) argued that the rate of surface warming from 1998 to 2013 was slower than the rate of warming calculated since 1951. An August 2014 study published in the Open Journal of Statistics argued that the rate of global warming slowed from 1998 to 2013 based on surface temperature records and global satellite data of the lower atmosphere. [13][14]
Some scientists have argued that some global temperature data sets show that the rate of warming has slowed since 1998. In December 2015, Judith Curry, former professor of atmospheric science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, argued that "the observed rate of warming in the early 21st century was slower than climate model predictions, relative to the rapid rate of warming in the last quarter of the 20th century." Curry further stated that the slower rate of warming since 1998 occurred alongside a rise in human-caused carbon dioxide emissions, arguing that "the growing discrepancy between climate model predictions and the observations has raised serious questions about the climate models that are being used as the basis for national and international energy and climate policies." [15]
Policy topics
Critics of the theory of human-caused climate change hold varied policy views. While some have supported policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, others have not. Some critics have opposed government regulations, such as federal regulations aimed at reducing CO 2 and similar emissions from energy use. These critics have argued carbon dioxide regulations would reduce jobs and income without having a substantial impact on global temperatures in the present or in the future. [16]
Clean Power Plan
See also: Clean Power Plan
Th EPA's regulatory action on carbon dioxide and similar gas emissions is the Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan is an administrative rule issued by the EPA. The EPA argued that the plan is justified by the agency's interpretation of the Clean Air Act and the Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency. The plan's goal is to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from coal- and oil -fired power plants (known as fossil fuel-fired) and natural gas -fired power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2030. The plan would require each state to reduce its emissions to meet a specific target. This emissions target is based on the number of fossil fuel- and natural gas-fired plants in that state. [17][18][19]
Critics of the plan have argued that it would reduce jobs and household income without having a substantial impact on global temperatures. Some critics, including proponents of increased coal production, have called the plan a war on coal, arguing that coal mining operations and employment at coal -fired power plants would be negatively affected by the plan's CO 2 reductions. A 2014 study commissioned by energy industry representatives—including the National Mining Association, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, and others—argued that the Clean Power Plan would raise residential electricity prices by 13 percent and increase residential electricity bills by 8 percent. [20]
Other critics have argued that the plan would have no substantial impact on reducing future global warming and reducing global temperatures. Using the EPA's climate modeling methodology, Patrick J. Michaels and Paul Knappenberger of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy organization, argued that the complete elimination of CO 2 emissions in the United States would reduce future warming by 0.137 degree Celsius by the year 2100. In addition, Michaels and Knappenberger argued that adopting the Clean Power Plan would reduce a rise in global temperatures by 0.018 degrees Celsius (0.032 degrees Fahrenheit). Michaels and Knappenberger argued, "The number is so small as to be undetectable." [21]
Other policies
Some policymakers have proposed policies aimed at creating market-based incentives for the production of technology that releases less carbon dioxide. Proponents of the policies have argued that creating incentives for renewable energy would lead to more renewable energy production and lower energy costs. Other policies proposed by market-oriented policymakers include the following: [22]
The federal government should encourage technology inducement prizes in lieu of direct federal spending on renewable energy technology. A technology inducement prize is a competition that awards a cash prize for technological innovation. According to this view, competitive prizes are more likely to produce innovative technology than grants or subsidies.
Federal and state governments can issue revised permitting and regulatory processes aimed at increasing private investment in low-carbon technologies.
The federal government could institute a carbon tax as an incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The tax could be rebated to taxpayers on a per capita basis to avoid applying the tax to low-income citizens. Some critics of this proposal have argued that carbon taxes would reduce employment and income in the same way as the Clean Power Plan's regulations.
Criticism
Proponents of the theory of human-caused climate change have argued that critics of the theory ignore certain evidence supporting the theory.
Climate models
Proponents of the theory of human-caused climate change have argued that climate models have been accurate in reproducing past predictions and in making predictions later confirmed by observed data. John Cook, the Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, argued that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's (IPCC) 2001 model showing a rise in human-caused CO 2 levels from 1850 to 2000 corresponded most accurately to observed surface temperature data compared to models that did not contain a rise in human-caused CO 2. Cook argued that the model confirmed that human-caused CO 2 was the primary cause of global warming since the model without human-caused CO 2 could not explain the observed data. [23][24]

Debate: For and against climate change

Have scientists been responsible for exaggerating the extent to which human activity is affecting the global climate?
For: There is a conclusive body of evidence to support the existence of manmade climate change
By Peter Landon
Speaking as a palaeoclimatologist, reconstructing past climates, one of the key lines of evidence for human impact on climate change is that over the past few millennia we have never seen such a rate or magnitude of warming that we see now. Past climate tells us about trends and variations prior to human impact and when analysing these we never see a trajectory in temperature increases as we are seeing today.What the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says is this: we have measured temperatures over a recent period, the past 150 years or so, on land, at sea and in particular the sea surface, which covers a large part of the planet.
Temperatures are rising and in the past few decades there has been unprecedented acceleration. We know that our production and burning of fossil fuels is rising. We can measure the chemical signature of the gases in the atmosphere, and they are not all natural. This is due to what we have burned and put into the atmosphere.
You can do a simple correlation to say that increased temperature and the presence of greenhouse gases are related. But obviously we have to deliver better science than that. One thing we can do is to look at the global climate computer models - and there are a lot of them - that represent our current understanding of how the climate works. If we run these models with what we call natural ‘ forcings ’ of climate - such as fluctuations in the strength of solar radiation over time - and compare them with what we have observed, then the two don’t fit. This is consistent across all the main global climate models.
There is more affecting the climate than natural forcings. This includes anthropogenic (i.e. human-induced) gases. The second thing you can do is to run the effect of these global-warming gases against what we have observed. And they don’t fit either. But, when you run the natural forcings and the anthropogenic gases together, they fit. The conclusion - and the IPCC says that this is extremely likely - is that the warming, especially in the past half-century, can’t be explained without the anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
This finding is one of the most amazing things we’ve done as scientists. We have gathered from all the major countries in the world people who are interested in understanding how climate change works and actually got them working together under the auspices of the IPCC. I can’t think of many other programmes where you have such a community of serious scientists collaborating on a global project pulling together. The majority of their data and modelling scenarios are in the public domain and it is all saying the same thing. To go against this with no evidence seems to lack an understanding of what science is for.
What’s next? As a scientist you typically collect the evidence and present it to policy makers. That is one of the tricky bridges that needs to be built. You need better dialogue with and influence over policy makers. But it seems to me that when the scientific evidence is so compelling to not do anything is very odd.
Even looking at the more moderate long-term projections of climate change you would have thought that curbing fossil fuel consumption has to be the way to go. But you could argue that economic power is the greatest power, and so unless you can cross the short-term economic argument things will get difficult.
The most important thing is that America and China come on board. If the greatest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases do not buy into the scientific findings then the future looks pretty grim. In 100 years’ time we will look back and think: “what on earth were we doing burning all that stuff, when the evidence was so overwhelming and when we had the opportunity to do something?” Ultimately, we’ll be judged by history and today we are simply not in a position to be judged favorably.
Against: There is no conclusive body of evidence to support the existence of manmade climate change
By Johnny Ball
When the climate-change furore began around 1988, I was alarmed and took a stance against it, earning the title ‘denier’. Now, 24 years later, everything I advocated then has been proven to be true. The damage done to the image of science, engineering and technology in terms of warping the minds of future generations of engineers and scientists, politicians and the general public will take years to repair. So on what did I base my opposition, with complete disregard to the danger to my reputation? Was the planet warming? Yes, it was, and by 1998 it had warmed 0.7°C in 100 years. But it had reached that peak in the 1930s and had been so much cooler in the 1960s as to suggest an oncoming ice age. There was, and still is, nothing alarming about the trend at all.
But the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) consistently claimed that catastrophic changes were taking place. We now know that all those claims were exaggerations and their leader Rajenda Pachauri has said: “There must be no more exaggeration!” In truth, there has been no sea-level rise, glacier depletion, ocean acidification or polar ice loss. All have fluctuated in line with normal expectations.
Burn anything, including food, and hydrocarbons split with oxygen to produce CO2 and water with usually two molecules of water for every one of CO2. Now the water is a greenhouse gas. Cloud traps heat and keeps things mild, while the absence of cloud lets heat disappear and we have morning frost. In fact, water is more than 85 per cent of the cause of local climate-change. But the IPCC never introduced water to the computer models that pointed the finger at CO2.
The major thrust of climate-change claims is that man is destroying the planet. There is much evidence to show that we are the greatest burden that Earth has to bear. To simply rape the earth of all its fossil-fuels would be gross folly.
But there is a conceit that mankind is so important. Less than 4 per cent of all CO2 produced is manmade. Every tree and creature grows, dies, rots and ferments, giving back its CO2. The oceans covering 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface contain 80 per cent of all plant and animal life. Man, compared to that, is far less significant. Only one-quarter of the 30 per cent of the planet that is land can support man unaided - just 7.5 per cent of the entire surface. Add volcanoes and natural phenomena, and man is quite puny. But we are a burden to the Earth and reducing that burden is our responsibility. The answer is engineering greater efficiency.
But look at our record in that. The Clean Air Act of the late 1950s means that today a building stays the same colour as when new. The catalytic converter means that vehicles are cleaner than even thought possible 25 years ago. It prevents sulphurs entering the atmosphere and turns unburnt or half-burnt carbons into CO2. Why? Because CO2 is harmless. More CO2 provides more plant food and is, in effect, greening the planet.
New cars require only half the engine size to produce the same power and twice the mileage. Electric generators that 25 years ago were around 30 per cent efficient are now around 70 per cent efficient. Yet the ‘greens’ would have us adopt wind generation, solar power or electric cars, none of which can ever approach the efficiency of boiling water to achieve a 600 times expansion and thus power the world as economically as is possible to date. Green policies cause more damage.
Whatever our future problems, including unburdening the planet, engineering is our only salvation, and improvements are huge in every aspect. Recent miracles will be dwarfed by those we will achieve in the future. But only if we put our faith in leading-edge engineers finding the best and safest way forward.
The day of the extreme, irrational, badly schooled yet powerful environmental lobbyists must come to a close, for all our sakes.

So, I've looked into the counterarguments against human-caused climate change. Some of the main points raised are that climate changes naturally, that there's no consensus among scientists, that scientists are just seeking grant money, that the sun is causing the temperature rises, and that global warming is actually beneficial.

But looking back at the first set of search results, it's clear that these counterarguments don't hold up against the overwhelming scientific evidence. For instance, while climate does change naturally, the current rate of warming is unprecedented in the historical record, and the fingerprint of human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, is evident in the atmospheric composition.

Also, the consensus among scientists is overwhelmingly in favor of the human cause of climate change, as shown by multiple studies and statements from prestigious scientific organizations. The idea that scientists are just seeking grant money is a red herring; scientific research is driven by curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge, and peer review ensures that findings are rigorously checked.

As for the sun being the cause, studies have shown that solar activity has been declining in recent decades while temperatures have been rising, indicating that solar influences cannot account for the current warming trend.

Lastly, the argument that global warming is beneficial is shortsighted. While there may be some localized benefits, such as longer growing seasons in certain regions, the overall impacts are overwhelmingly negative, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruption to ecosystems and economies worldwide.

In summary, the scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that humans are responsible for the current climate change through our activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. The counterarguments do not hold up to scrutiny and are outweighed by the vast body of research supporting anthropogenic climate change.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, humans are responsible for climate change.}} \]

, I'd like to confirm this with another search to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Climate Research Nearly Unanimous on Humans’ Role, Survey Finds
HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS : Climate Change, Environment

A new analysis of scientists’ articles on global warming and climate change has found almost unanimous agreement that humans are the main cause.
The comprehensive examination of peer-reviewed articles on the topic showed an overwhelming consensus among scientists that much recent warming is anthropogenic — the result of human activities.
The study, the most comprehensive so far, identified 4,000 article summaries, or abstracts, from papers published in the past 21 years which stated a position on the cause of recent global warming.
Its finding that 97 percent of them echoed the consensus view — that anthropogenic global warming (AGW) is responsible for the rise in global average temperatures — is remarkably similar to the conclusion of a smaller study completed in 2004.
The latest study, “Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature”, which was led by John Cook of the University of Queensland, Australia, is published in IOP Publishing’s journal Environmental Research Letters.
It did not stop at analysing the abstracts, but went further, asking each author to rate their entire paper using the same criteria. Over 2,000 papers were rated, and among those that discussed the cause of recent warming, 97 percent supported the argument that much of it is caused by humans.
[quote  quote=”Our findings prove that there is a strong scientific agreement about the cause of climate change, despite public perceptions to the contrary.”  author=”Study lead John Cook”  type=”text” ]
The findings contrast sharply with the position on global warming of many Americans. A 2012 poll revealed that more than half of them either reject the evidence that scientists overwhelmingly agree that the Earth is warming because of human activity, or else are not aware of it.
More recently the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication has found evidence showing that this mindset persists widely in the US.
“Our findings prove that there is a strong scientific agreement about the cause of climate change, despite public perceptions to the contrary,” said Cook.
“There is a gaping chasm between the actual consensus and the public perception. It’s staggering, given the evidence for consensus, that less than half of the general public think scientists agree that humans are causing global warming.
“This is significant because, when people understand that scientists agree on global warming, they’re more likely to support policies that take action on it.”
In March 2012, the researchers used the Web of Science database to search for peer-reviewed academic articles published between 1991 and 2011 using two topic searches: “global warming” and “global climate change”.
After limiting the selection to peer-reviewed climate science, the study considered 11,994 papers written by 29,083 authors in 1,980 different scientific journals.
The abstracts from these papers were randomly distributed among 24 volunteers recruited through the Skeptical Science website (the motto of which is “Getting skeptical about global warming skepticism”).
They used set criteria to determine how far the abstracts endorsed the idea that humans are the primary cause of global warming. Each abstract was analyzed by two independent, anonymous raters.
From the 11,994 papers, 32.6 percent endorsed the AGW argument, 66.4 percent stated no position on it, 0.7 percent rejected it and in 0.3 percent of the papers the authors said the cause of global warming was uncertain.
In her 2004 study the American historian of science Naomi Oreskes surveyed all peer-reviewed abstracts on “global climate change” published between 1993 and 2003. She too surveyed the Web of Science database, looking only at peer-reviewed scientific articles.
Her survey failed to find a single paper that rejected the consensus position that global warming over the past 50 years is predominantly anthropogenic. Of the papers surveyed 75 percent agreed with the consensus position, while 25 percent made no comment either way.
[quote  quote=”The study authors say there are ‘campaigns designed to confuse the public about the level of agreement among climate scientists’.”  type=”text” ]
The authors of this recent study write of a “consensus gap” between the fact of scientific agreement over AGW and the widespread perception that there is deep division among scientists.
They say there are “campaigns designed to confuse the public about the level of agreement among climate scientists. In 1991, Western Fuels Association conducted a $510,000 campaign whose primary goal was to ‘reposition global warming as theory (not fact)’…
“The situation is exacerbated by media treatment of the climate issue, where the normative practice of providing opposing sides with equal attention has allowed a vocal minority to have their views amplified…”
Critics who compare those who argue that there is no scientific consensus on climate change with those who insist that smoking is not harmful recall the words of an unnamed US tobacco executive in 1969: “Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the minds of the general public.”
The funds needed to make the study accessible to the public were raised by visitors to the Skeptical Science website.

FULL STORY
More than 99.9% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that climate change is mainly caused by humans, according to a new survey of 88,125 climate-related studies.
The research updates a similar 2013 paper revealing that 97% of studies published between 1991 and 2012 supported the idea that human activities are altering Earth's climate. The current survey examines the literature published from 2012 to November 2020 to explore whether the consensus has changed.
"We are virtually certain that the consensus is well over 99% now and that it's pretty much case closed for any meaningful public conversation about the reality of human-caused climate change," said Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science at Cornell University and the paper's first author.
"It's critical to acknowledge the principal role of greenhouse gas emissions so that we can rapidly mobilize new solutions, since we are already witnessing in real time the devastating impacts of climate related disasters on businesses, people and the economy," said Benjamin Houlton, Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell and a co-author of the study, "Greater than 99% Consensus on Human Caused Climate Change in the Peer-Reviewed Scientific Literature," which published Oct. 19 in the journal Environmental Research Letters.
In spite of such results, public opinion polls as well as opinions of politicians and public representatives point to false beliefs and claims that a significant debate still exists among scientists over the true cause of climate change. In 2016, the Pew Research Center found that only 27% of U.S. adults believe that "almost all" scientists agreed that climate change is due to human activity, according to the paper. A 2021 Gallup poll pointed to a deepening partisan divide in American politics on whether Earth's rising observed temperatures since the Industrial Revolution were primarily caused by humans.
"To understand where a consensus exists, you have to be able to quantify it," Lynas said. "That means surveying the literature in a coherent and non-arbitrary way in order to avoid trading cherry-picked papers, which is often how these arguments are carried out in the public sphere."
In the study, the researchers began by examining a random sample of 3,000 studies from the dataset of 88,125 English-language climate papers published between 2012 and 2020. They found only four out of the 3,000 papers were skeptical of human-caused climate change. "We knew that [climate skeptical papers] were vanishingly small in terms of their occurrence, but we thought there still must be more in the 88,000," Lynas said.
Co-author Simon Perry, a United Kingdom-based software engineer and volunteer at the Alliance for Science, created an algorithm that searched out keywords from papers the team knew were skeptical, such as "solar," "cosmic rays" and "natural cycles." The algorithm was applied to all 88,000-plus papers, and the program ordered them so the skeptical ones came higher in the order. They found many of these dissenting papers near the top, as expected, with diminishing returns further down the list. Overall, the search yielded 28 papers that were implicitly or explicitly skeptical, all published in minor journals.
If the 97% result from the 2013 study still left some doubt on scientific consensus on the human influence on climate, the current findings go even further to allay any uncertainty, Lynas said. "This pretty much should be the last word," he said.

Humans have caused almost 100% of global warming, says new IPCC report
Climate science has evolved since the last IPCC report released in 2013, and scientists are now confident that human influence has caused climate change as we know it
NEXT NEWS ❯
By Avantika Goswami
Published: Tuesday 10 August 2021
The new climate science report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released August 9, 2021 differs from its predecessor on one main account: Scientists are now more confident that human activity has caused climate change than they have been before.
The report, the first instalment of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), has a simple message:
“It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change, making extreme climate events including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts more frequent and severe.”
There is almost no doubt that most of the observed warming of the planet since the late-1800s is caused by humans.
The report’s technical summary highlights how this confidence has increased with each successive IPCC report: “The evidence for human influence on recent climate change has strengthened progressively from the IPCC second assessment report [in 1995] to the AR5 [in 2013-14] and is even stronger in this assessment, including for regional scales and for extremes.”
This has been possible through advances in climate science and improvements in models and analytical tools. The report outlines some of these advances, saying:
“Progress in our understanding of human influence is gained from longer observational datasets, improved palaeo-climate information, stronger warming signal since AR5 (the fifth assessment report) and improvements in climate models, physical understanding and attribution techniques. Since AR5, the attribution to human influence has become possible across a wider range of climate variables and climatic impact-drivers. New techniques and analyses drawing on several lines of evidence have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in regional weather and climate extremes to human influence (high confidence).”
Human activities have warmed the planet at a rate never seen before in the planet’s long history in the past 2,000 years in particular. The IPCC report found that Earth’s global surface temperature warmed by 1.09 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900.
While natural changes to the Earth’s climate do occur, 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities. Thus, almost 100 per cent of global warming has been caused by humans.
Human influence is the main driver of hot weather extremes (which have become more frequent and intense since 1950s), and without which these extremes would have been unlikely. The AR6 is virtually certain that human-driven emissions are the main driver of the changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale, and of ocean warming and acidification.
Additionally, the AR6 acknowledges the ability of scientists to now pinpoint how much worse an extreme weather event was made by climate change.
Previously, they could not link a specific event to warmer temperatures caused by human activity. But this is no longer a challenge, as weather attribution studies can now be rapidly produced, as was done by the World Weather Attribution initiative for the North American heatwave in July 2021. It had concluded that the heatwave would be “virtually impossible” without human-driven climate change.

Human Health and Climate Change Research
Climate change is having direct and indirect impacts on the health of people. More extreme weather events, heat waves, spread of infectious diseases and detrimental impacts on air and water quality are having impacts on our health.
Research is underway to assess those most susceptible to the health impacts related to a changing climate and identify ways to reduce those impacts.
Researchers are working to:
Identify and characterize communities and people at greatest risk to the impacts of climate change and air pollution.
Assess the individual and synergistic impacts of climate change and air quality on human health.
Develop approaches to assess the likelihood and effects of extreme events, including wildfires, floods, and heat waves, on human health.
Identify potential societal and behavioral responses to human health risks from climate change.
National Climate Assessment -- EPA participates in the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s Sustained Assessment Working Group and contributes to the program’s  development of the National Climate Assessment. The fourth National Climate Assessment was published in November 2018 and includes a chapter on the impacts of climate change on human health.

Clean Cookstove Research -- The majority of cookstoves used in developing countries emit black carbon, an air pollutant that contributes to warming of the atmosphere.
Wildland Fire Science Research -- EPA is using its expertise in air quality research to fill the gaps in scientific information and to develop tools to prevent and reduce the impact of smoke from wildfires and controlled or prescribed burns.
Global Change Explorer (GCX) -- A collection of web tools that visualize, compare, and provide access to spatial data that describe potential future environmental change. These data can serve as a starting point when assessing the vulnerability of air, water, ecosystems, and human health to climate change, land use change, and other large-scale environmental stressors. The data and tools in the Global Change Explorer are relevant across multiple scientific disciplines and environmental media, providing a foundation for integrated assessments of global change.

Climate Change Is Happening Faster Than Expected, and It’s More Extreme
New research suggests human-caused emissions will lead to bigger impacts on heat and extreme weather, and sooner than the IPCC warned just three years ago.

In the past year, the scientific consensus shifted toward a grimmer and less uncertain picture of the risks posed by climate change.
When the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its 5th Climate Assessment in 2014, it formally declared that observed warming was “extremely likely” to be mostly caused by human activity.
This year, a major scientific update from the United States Global Change Research Program put it more bluntly: “There is no convincing alternative explanation.”
Other scientific authorities have issued similar assessments:
The Royal Society published a compendium of how the science has advanced, warning that it seems likelier that we’ve been underestimating the risks of warming than overestimating them.
The American Meteorological Society issued its annual study of extreme weather events and said that many of those it studied this year would not have been possible without the influence of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said recent melting of the Arctic was not moderating and was more intense than at any time in recorded history.
While 2017 may not have hit a global temperature record, it is running in second or third place, and on the heels of records set in 2015 and 2016. Talk of some kind of “hiatus” seems as old as disco music.
‘A Deadly Tragedy in the Making’
Some of the strongest warnings in the Royal Society update came from health researchers, who said there hasn’t been nearly enough done to protect millions of vulnerable people worldwide from the expected increase in heat waves.
“It’s a deadly tragedy in the making, all the worse because the same experts are saying such heat waves are eminently survivable with adequate resources to protect people,” said climate researcher Eric Wolff, lead author of the Royal Society update.
Atmospheric scientist Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said climate science has progressed in all directions since the IPCC report was published in 2014. He works with a group of scientists trying to update the IPCC reporting process to make it more fluid and meaningful in real time.
“The need to build resilience is clear and missing in action,” Trenberth said. “The result is we suffer the consequences at costs of hundreds of billions of dollars.”
One of the starkest conclusions of the Royal Society update is that up to 350 million people in places like Karachi, Kolkota, Lagos and Shanghai are likely to face deadly heat waves every year by 2050—even if nations are able to rein in greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep the average global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as per the Paris climate agreement.
There’s also an increasing chance global warming will affect a key North Atlantic current that carries ocean heat from the tropics toward western Europe, according to a 2016 study. It shows the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current weakening by 37 percent by 2100, which could have big effects on European climate and food production.
Melting Ice and Risks to Oceans and Ecosystems
The Royal Society report also notes:
An increasing risk that ocean acidification will rapidly and significantly alter many ecosystems and food webs;
A concern that crops grown in high-CO2 conditions could be less nutritious, leading to mineral deficiencies;
That the commonly accepted wet-areas-wetter and dry-areas-drier scenario has regional nuances with important implications for local water management and food production planning; and,
That scientists are finding more links between melting Arctic sea ice and weather extremes like heat waves, droughts and blizzards.
The U.S. Global Change Research Program, an interagency group whose work went through exhaustive peer review and emerged from the Trump administration’s political review mostly unscathed, also cited several emerging conclusions that are much clearer today than five years ago.
Among them are changes in ocean ecosystems that go far beyond rising sea levels. Ocean acidification is increasing, as is oxygen loss, and scientists are more acutely aware than before of the severity of their impacts. In some U.S. coastal waters, these trends are “raising the risk of serious ecological and economic consequences,” the report noted.
The most ominous of its chapters addressed the risks of surprises like “tipping points” or “compound extremes”—sucker punches, combination punches, and even knockout punches. “The more the climate changes, the greater the potential for these,” it said.
“Uncertainty is not our friend here,” said Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann. “We are seeing increases in extreme weather events that go well beyond what has been predicted or projected in the past. We’re learning that there are factors we were not previously aware of that may be magnifying the impacts of human-caused climate change.” Among those are “subtle mechanisms involving the behavior of the jet stream that may be involved in explaining the dramatic increase we’ve seen in floods, droughts, heat waves and wildfires,” he said.
“Increasingly, the science suggests that many of the impacts are occurring earlier and with greater amplitude than was predicted,” Mann said, after considering new research since the milestone of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment, which served as the scientific basis for the Paris Agreement.
“We have literally, in the space of a year, doubled our assessment of the potential sea level rise we could see by the end of this century. That is simply remarkable. And it is sobering,” he said.
In general, there should be more monitoring of global warming impacts, but all those programs are threatened under the current administration, Mann said. “Continued funding to support research is critical,” he said, “and here, again, we encounter a very unfavorable political environment where fossil fuel-beholden politicians that run the White House and Congress are doing everything they can to defund and suppress research on climate change science and impact assessments.”

Alright, so I've got more evidence here that human activities are causing climate change. The latest research shows that over 99.9% of scientific studies agree that humans are the main cause of climate change. This is based on a survey of over 88,000 climate-related studies published between 2012 and 2020, where only a tiny fraction expressed skepticism about human-caused climate change.

Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated that it is "indisputable" that human activities are causing climate change, leading to more frequent and severe extreme weather events. The IPCC report emphasizes that almost 100% of global warming is due to human activities, with natural factors playing a negligible role in the current warming trend.

The EPA also confirms that climate change is having direct and indirect impacts on human health, including more extreme weather events, heatwaves, spread of infectious diseases, and deteriorating air and water quality. Research is ongoing to identify the populations most at risk and to develop strategies to mitigate these health impacts.

So, in conclusion, the scientific consensus is clear: human activities are the primary cause of climate change, and the evidence is becoming stronger and more compelling with each new study.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, humans are responsible for climate change.}} \]
