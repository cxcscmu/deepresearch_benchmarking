So I have this question: "How do fugitives survive on the run?" Hmm, interesting topic. I don't know much about this, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down and maybe doing some research.

First off, who are fugitives? Fugitives are people who are running away from the law, right? They might have committed a crime or be accused of one, and they're hiding to avoid arrest or prosecution. So, their main goal is to stay hidden and avoid being caught.

Surviving on the run must be really tough. They can't just go about their daily lives like normal people. They have to be careful all the time, always looking over their shoulders, never trusting anyone too much. It's got to be stressful.

Let me think about what they need to survive. Basic needs are food, shelter, and safety. So, how do they get these without getting caught?

Starting with food, they probably need to find ways to eat without drawing attention to themselves. Maybe they carry some non-perishable food items with them, like energy bars or canned goods. Or perhaps they scavenge for food in abandoned areas or even steal from stores or restaurants secretly.

For shelter, it's a bigger challenge. They can't check into hotels under their real names because that would leave a trail. So, they might stay in cheap motels using fake IDs, stay with sympathizers or people who don't know their true identity, or live outdoors in forests, caves, or other remote locations.

Safety is paramount. They need to avoid law enforcement and anyone who might recognize them. That means changing their appearance frequently, using aliases, and possibly even undergoing plastic surgery in extreme cases.

Communication is another issue. They can't use their own phones or email accounts because those can be tracked. So, they might rely on public payphones, burners (disposable phones), or computers in public places, being careful not to leave any digital footprint.

Money is probably a big concern. How do they fund their life on the run? Some might have saved up funds before going on the run, others might have supporters who help financially, and unfortunately, some might turn to criminal activities to get money.

I wonder if there are any books or documentaries that explain this in more detail. Maybe I can look that up.

Question: How does a fugitive survive without a proper job?
What exactly is a “proper job”, questioner?
By definition, most fugitives are criminals. That means that they have a history and a willingness to break the law if or when they need to. That also means that if they go on the run, they could easily continue the crimes that got them into trouble in the first place. Or they could commit new crimes if they need money to survive.
However, forgetting that fact, it’s not as having a “proper job” is necessary for many people questioner. Their other options include:

What should a fugitive keep while on the run to avoid capture?
It’s absolutely vital that a fugitive obtain a cell phone in their own name. It must be a model of phone that has GPS. This is a high tech jamming system which prevents authorities from finding you. Make sure the phone stays turned on at all times, so the protection is always working.

What are the most common mistakes that fugitives on the run make that lead to their capture?
Mistakes?
They make no provisions for doing their laundry - Unless they are planning to wear new clothes all of the time, they have to do laundry. Unless they move into a location with a washing machine, they have to go to a laundromat. Bounty hunters and fugitive trackers stake out laundromats looking for fugitives.
They try to hide in rural areas where they have no roots - If you move to a small town or a rural area you'll be the topic of discussion for months, perhaps even years. This is because few people move to those areas, and most of those who do have lived there before or they have root

Question: Why are so many fugitives on the run if the FBI is so good?
Outside observations:
The FBI rarely tracks fugitives. The US Marshal Service is the main entity which performs fugitive recovery. - The Marshals are understaffed and overwhelmed by the sheer number of fugitives. They could hunt for two dozen fugitives A DAY every single day of the year and they would still be behind. There are just that many fugitives and that few marshals.

How do you hide from the police if you are on the run?
First I will assume that I’m hunting you for something serious like a homicide.
Forget about everyone you know including relatives. As a police officer, I start with your home, then your parent's home, your girlfriend's home, and all your friend's homes. Each person I visit will give me new ideas as to where you would go.
Forget about visiting any places you have been to before. If you go to Atlantic City to gamble from time to time, the police will know this and alert the local PD to be looking for you.

Originally Answered: How would you evade capture as a fugitive being pursued in a high profile manhunt?
First things first: In any developed country (and most which are not) nobody wants you "dead." That often defeats the purpose of searching for you.
Some things:
Assuming that you haven't escaped from prison or jail, it is going to take the police hours to several days to seriously begin looking for you. If you are in the United States,unless you are in a rural area, there aren't going to be the roadblocks and checkpoints that you see on television or in films as that would delay traffic and cause a great deal of complaints.

Which police and where, questioner?
In the United States the “easiest ways” to hide from the police includes:
Keeping a low profile — The police usually have their hands full, and so they don't notice people who aren't trying to be noticed. Wear clothes that allow you to blend into your surroundings and that are appropriate. Avoid large amounts of jewelry. Buy and drive a nondescript vehicle. Keep your music at a reasonable level. Avoid loud public confrontations.

Southern California would definitely be my choice to hide out as a fugitive. It’s warm, food is inexpensive, and California is an administrative mess.
The farmers out there are used to paying people under the table, so I would join a group of migrating agricultural workers. It would be a simple life, but it would be far better than going to prison.

James “Whitey” Bulger escaped capture for nearly 17 years. He traveled around the country, bought firearms and traveled to Mexico at least once while on the run to buy prescriptions. He had partially assumed the identity of at least one homeless person and he could have easily done the same until his death had he not been reported and captured.

“Normally”?
There aren’t any “normal” ways as the events surrounding their apprehension vary from person to person.
Some examples:
The fugitive remains in contact with family members, friends, or acquaintances - Either the relationship between the fugitive and those people sour; or the other party becomes careless in their speech or their actions and they allow details of the fugitive’s location to be discovered.

You can flee
Flee to hide in lonely desperation!
To change your identity!

To search for a one-armed man you saw leave the scene of the crime!
To run before the relentless pursuit of the police lieutenant obsessed with your capture! (Except in the movie, in which you’ll run from the relentless pursuit of the deputy US marshal obsessed with your capture.)
And, after you prove your innocence, you’ll work as a US Treasury agent and open up a private eye agency in San Diego.

After 2010, American citizens are required to have a passport to return from overseas travel destinations, so the traditional means of leaving the country (airports, cruise lines, border crossings, etc) will often require that someone show a valid US passport before you are allowed to board and depart. Unless you have a passport (which most Americans do not) you are unlikely to leave by those routes.

What happens when a fugitive doesn’t get caught? Will the police stop looking for them after a long period of time?
They’ll stop actively looking for them quite quickly. If there are no real leads, it would be a waste of time and money to randomly roam the streets looking for one person.
However, criminals do crime, and they quite often get caught again doing stupid things like speeding, drunk driving or getting into bar fights.
OTOH, if the fugitive never comes to the attention of the police again, then the fugitive has already done what prison is meant to do - reform people into not committing crime again.

Can a fugitive stay on the run forever?
No. At some point, everyone dies.
But to take your question more seriously, the length of time a fugitive may stay not the run is directly related to the length of time they stay below the radar of a police officer. For example, a fugitive that has been fingerprinted (as opposed to identified by name) is toast if he is arrested for a minor crime and gets fingerprinted. Once the ID is made, he’ll be either returned to custody (if an escapee) or extradited to the jurisdiction where he is wanted.

On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City by Alice Goffman
An Excerpt from
On the Run
Fugitive Life in an American City
by Alice Goffman
The Art of Running
A young man concerned that the police will take him into custody comes to see danger and risk in the mundane doings of everyday life. To survive outside prison, he learns to hesitate when others walk casually forward, to see what others fail to notice, to fear what others trust or take for granted.
One of the first things that such a man develops is a heightened awareness of police officers—what they look like, how they move, where and when they are likely to appear. He learns the models of their undercover cars, the ways they hold their bodies and the cut of their hair, the timing and location of their typical routes. His awareness of the police never seems to leave him; he sees them sitting in plain clothes at the mall food court with their children; he spots them in his rearview mirror coming up behind him on the highway, from ten cars and three lanes away. Sometimes he finds that his body anticipates their arrival with sweat and a quickened heartbeat before his mind consciously registers any sign of their appearance.
When I first met Mike, I thought his awareness of the police was a special gift, unique to him. Then I realized Chuck also seemed to know when the police were coming. So did Alex. When they sensed the police were near, they did what other young men in the neighborhood did: they ran and hid.
Chuck put the strategy concisely to his 12-year-old brother, Tim:
If you hear the law coming, you merk on [run away from] them niggas. You don’t be having time to think okay, what do I got on me, what they going to want from me. No, you hear them coming, that’s it, you gone. Period. ’Cause whoever they looking for, even if it’s not you, nine times out of ten they’ll probably book you.
Tim was still learning how to run from the police, and his beginner missteps furnished a good deal of amusement for his older brothers and their friends.
Late one night, a white friend of mine from school dropped off Reggie and a friend of his at my apartment. Chuck and Mike phoned me to announce that Tim, who was 11 at the time, had spotted my friend’s car and taken off down the street, yelling, “It’s a undercover! It’s a undercover!”
“Nigga, that’s Alice’s girlfriend.” Mike laughed. “She was drinking with us last night.”
If a successful escape means learning how to identify the police, it also requires learning how to run. Chuck, Mike, and their friends spent many evenings honing this skill by running after each other and chasing each other in cars. The stated reason would be that one had taken something from the other: a CD, a five-dollar bill from a pocket, a small bag of weed. Reggie and his friends also ran away from their girlfriends on foot or by car.
One night, I was standing outside Ronny’s house with Reggie and Reggie’s friend, an 18-year-old young man who lived across the street. In the middle of the conversation, Reggie’s friend jumped in his car and took off. Reggie explained that he was on the run from his girlfriend, who we then saw getting into another car after him. Reggie explained that she wanted him to be in the house with her, but that he was refusing, wanting instead to go out to the bar. This pursuit lasted the entire evening, with the man’s girlfriend enlisting her friends and relatives to provide information about his whereabouts, and the man doing the same. Around one in the morning, I heard that she’d caught him going into the beer store and dragged him back home.
It wasn’t always clear to me whether these chases were games or more serious pursuits, and some appeared more serious than others. Regardless of the meaning that people ascribed to them at the time or afterward, these chases improved young men’s skill and speed at getting away. In running from each other, from their girlfriends, and in a few cases their mothers, Reggie and his friends learned how to navigate the alleyways, weave through traffic, and identify local residents willing to hide them for a little while.
During the first year and a half I spent on 6th Street, I watched young men running and hiding from the police on 111 occasions, an average of more than once every five days.
Those who interact rarely with the police may assume that running away after a police stop is futile. Worse, it could lead to increased charges or to violence. While the second part is true, the first is not. In my first 18 months on 6th Street, I observed a young man running after he had been stopped on 41 different occasions. Of these, eight involved men fleeing their houses during raids; 23 involved men running after being stopped while on foot (including running after the police had approached a group of people of whom the man was a part); six involved car chases; and two involved a combination of car and foot chases, where the chase began by car and continued with the man getting out and running.
In 24 of these cases, the man got away. In 17 of the 24, the police didn’t appear to know who the man was and couldn’t bring any charges against him after he had fled. Even in cases where the police subsequently charged him with fleeing or other crimes, the successful getaway allowed the man to stay out of jail longer than he might have if he’d simply permitted the police to cuff him and take him in.
A successful escape can be a solitary act, but oftentimes it is a collective accomplishment. A young man relies on his friends, relatives, and neighbors to alert him when they see the police coming, and to pass along information about where the police have been or where and when they might appear next. When the police make inquiries, these friends and neighbors feign ignorance or feed the police misinformation. They may also help to conceal incriminating objects and provide safe houses where a young man can hide. From field notes taken in September 2006:
Around 11 AM, I walked up the alleyway to the back of Chuck’s house. Before I reached the porch, Chuck came running down the iron stairs, shouting something to a neighbor. Reggie followed him, also shouting. Their mother, Miss Linda, came to the top of the second-floor balcony and told me the law was on the way, and to make sure that Reggie in particular did not come back until she gave the green light. I recalled that Reggie had a warrant out for failure to pay court fees, and would doubtless be taken in if the cops ran his name.
I watched Chuck and Reggie proceed up the alleyway, and then Chuck turned and yelled at me to come on. We ran for about three blocks, going through two backyards and over a small divider. Dogs barked as we went by. I was half a block behind and lost sight of Chuck and Reggie. Panting, I slowed to a walk, looking back to see if the police were coming. Then I heard “psst” and looked up to see Chuck leaning out the second-floor window of a two-story house. A woman in her 50s, who I immediately guessed to be a churchgoer, opened the door for me as I approached, saying only, “Upstairs.”
Chuck and Reggie were in her dressing room. This quite conservative- looking woman had converted what is usually the spare upstairs bedroom into a giant walk-in closet, with shoes, purses, and clothing arranged by color on the kind of white metal shelves that you buy and install yourself.
Our getaway had produced a mild euphoria. Reggie brushed past Chuck to examine the shoe collection, and Chuck wiped his arm off dramatically, teasing his younger brother about how sweaty he was.
“Look at yourself, nigga! You don’t run for shit now with that little bit of shell in your shoulder,” Reggie responded, referring to the partial bullet that had lodged just below the back of Chuck’s neck when he was shot the month before.
Chuck laughed. “I’m in the best shape of my life.” He explained that his shoulder hurt only when he played basketball.
Reggie sat on a small leopard-print stool and said, “Name a fat motherfucker who runs faster than me. Not just in the ’hood but anywhere in Philly.”
“Oh, here you go,” Chuck complained.
Chuck joked about the extensive shoe collection, saying you’d never know Miss Toya was like that. Reggie pulled out a pair of suede high heels and attempted to get one onto his foot, asking me to do up the straps. He got on her computer and started browsing pit bull websites, then YouTube videos of street fights. Chuck cringed and exclaimed loudly as Kimbo, a well-known street fighter, hit his opponent repeatedly in the eye, revealing bloody and battered tissue that Chuck called “spaghetti and meatballs.”
I asked Chuck why he made me run, and consequently dirty my sneakers, when I’m not even wanted.
“It’s good practice.”
Reggie grinned and said, “You be taking your fucking time, A.”
“You’re no track star,” I replied.
“What!? I was haul-assing.”
Chuck got on the phone with his mother and then a neighbor to find out how many police were on his block and for whom they had come. Apparently they were looking for a man who had fled on foot after being stopped on an off-road motorbike. They didn’t find this man, but did take two others from the house next door: One had a bench warrant for failure to appear, and the other had a small amount of crack in his pocket. Into the phone Chuck was saying, “Damn. They got Jay-Jay? Damn.”
About an hour later, his mother called to tell Chuck that the police had gone. We waited another ten minutes, then left for Pappi’s, the corner store. Chuck ordered Miss Toya a turkey hoagie and BBQ chips and brought them to her as thanks. We then walked back to the block with Dutch cigars and sodas.
Running wasn’t always the smartest thing to do when the cops came, but the urge to run was so ingrained that sometimes it was hard to stand still.
When the police came for Reggie, they blocked off the alleyway on both ends simultaneously, using at least five cars that I could count from where I was standing, and then ran into Reggie’s mother’s house. Chuck, Anthony, and two other guys were outside, trapped. Chuck and these two young men were clean, but Anthony had the warrant for failure to appear. As the police dragged Reggie out of his house, laid him on the ground, and searched him, one guy whispered to Anthony to be calm and stay still. Anthony kept quiet as Reggie was cuffed and placed in the squad car, but then he started whispering that he thought Reggie was looking at him funny, and might say something to the police.
Anthony started sweating and twitching his hands; the two young men and I whispered again to him to chill. One said, “Be easy. He’s not looking at you.”
We stood there, and time dragged on. When the police started searching the ground for whatever Reggie may have tossed before getting into the squad car, Anthony couldn’t seem to take it anymore. He started mumbling his concerns, and then he took off up the alley. One of the officers went after him, causing the other young man standing next to him to shake his head in frustrated disappointment.
Anthony’s running caused the other officer to put the two young men still standing there up against the car, search them, and run their names; luckily, they came back clean. Then two more cop cars came up the alley, sirens on. About five minutes after they finished searching the young men, one of the guys got a text from a friend up the street. He silently handed me the phone so I could read it:
Anthony just got booked. They beat the shit out of him.
At the time of this incident, Chuck had recently begun allowing Anthony to sleep in the basement of his mother’s house, on the floor next to his bed. So it was Chuck’s house that Anthony phoned first from the police station. Miss Linda picked up and began yelling at him immediately.
“You fucking stupid, Anthony! Nobody bothering you, nobody looking at you. What the fuck did you run for? You a nut. You a fucking nut. You deserve to get locked up. Dumb-ass nigga. Call your sister, don’t call my phone. And when you come home, you can find somewhere else to stay.”
When the techniques young men deploy to avoid the police fail, and they find themselves cuffed against a wall or cornered in an alleyway, all is not lost: Once caught, sometimes they practice concerted silence, create a distraction, advocate for their rights, or threaten to sue the police or go to the newspapers. I occasionally saw each of these measures dissuade the police from continuing to search a man or question a man on the street. When young men are taken in, they sometimes use the grate in the holding cell at the police station to scrape their fingertips down past the first few layers of skin, so that the police can’t obtain the prints necessary to identify them and attach them to their already pending legal matters. On four separate occasions I saw men from 6th Street released with bloody fingertips.
Avoiding the Police and Courts When Settling Disputes
It’s not enough to run and hide when the police approach. A man intent on staying out of jail cannot call the police when harmed, or make use of the courts to settle disputes. He must forego the use of the police and the courts when he is threatened or in danger and find alternative ways to protect himself. When Mike returned from a year upstate, he was rusty in these sensibilities, having been living most recently as an inmate rather than as a fugitive. His friends wasted no time in reacquainting him with the precariousness of life on the outside.
Mike had been released on parole to a halfway house, which he had to return to every day before curfew. When his mother went on vacation, he invited a man he had befriended in prison to her house to play video games. The next day, Mike, Chuck, and I went back to the house and found Mike’s mother’s stereo, DVD player, and two TVs gone. Later, a neighbor told Mike that he had seen the man taking these things from the house in the early morning.
Once the neighbor identified the thief, Mike debated whether to call the police. He didn’t want to let the robbery go, but he also didn’t want to take matters into his own hands and risk violating his parole. Finally, he called the police and gave them a description of the man. When we returned to the block, Reggie and another friend admonished Mike about the risks he had taken:
REGGIE: And you on parole! You done got home like a day ago! Why the fuck you calling the law for? You lucky they ain’t just grab [arrest] both of you.
FRIEND: Put it this way: They ain’t come grab you like you ain’t violate shit, they ain’t find no other jawns [warrants] in the computer. Dude ain’t pop no fly shit [accused Mike of some crime in an attempt to reduce his own charges], but simple fact is you filed a statement, you know what I’m saying, gave them niggas your government [real name]. Now they got your mom’s address in the file as your last known [address]. The next time they come looking for you, they not just going to your uncle’s, they definitely going to be through there [his mother’s house].
In this case, their counsel proved correct. Mike returned to the halfway house a few days later and discovered that the guards there were conducting alcohol tests. He left before they could test him, assuming he would test positive and spend another year upstate for the violation. He planned to live on the run for some time, but three days later the police found him at his mother’s house and took him into custody. We had been playing video games, and he had gone across the street to change his clothes at the Laundromat. Two unmarked cars pulled up, and three officers got out and started chasing him. He ran for two blocks before they threw him down on the pavement. Later, he mentioned that their knowledge of his mother’s new address must have come from the time he reported the robbery, and he bemoaned his thoughtlessness in calling them.
Young men also learn to see the courts as dangerous. A year after Chuck came home from the assault case, he enrolled in a job training program for young men who have not completed high school, hoping to earn his high school diploma and gain a certificate in construction. He proudly graduated at 22 and found a job apprenticing on a construction crew. Around this time he had been arguing with his baby-mom, and she stopped allowing him to see their two daughters, ages one and a half and six months. After considerable hesitation, Chuck took her to family court to file for partial custody. He said it tore at him to let a white man into his family affairs, but what could he do? He needed to see his kids. At the time, Chuck was also sending $35 per month to the city toward payment on tickets he had received for driving without a license or registration; he hoped to get into good standing and become qualified to apply for a driver’s license. The judge said that if Chuck did not meet his payments on time every month, he would issue a bench warrant for his arrest. Then Chuck could work off the traffic tickets he owed in county jail (fines and fees can be deducted for every day spent in custody).
Five months into his case for partial custody in family court, Chuck lost his construction job and stopped making the payments to the city for the traffic tickets. He said he wasn’t sure if he had actually been issued a warrant, and unsuccessfully attempted to discover this. He went to court for the child custody case anyway the next month, and when his baby-mom mentioned that he was a drug dealer and unfit to get partial custody of their children, the judge immediately ran his name in the database to see if any warrants came up. They did not. As we walked out of the courthouse, Chuck said to me and to his mother:
I wanted to run [when the clerk ran his name], but it was no way I was getting out of there—it was too many cops and guards. But my shit came back clean, so I guess if they’re going to give me a warrant for the tickets, they ain’t get around to it yet.
The judge ruled in Chuck’s favor and granted him visitation on Sundays at a court-supervised day-care site. These visits, Chuck said, made him anxious: “Every time I walk in the door I wonder, like, is it today? Are they going to come grab me, like, right out of the day care? I can just see [my daughter’s] face, like, ‘Daddy, where you going?’”
After a month, the conditions of his custody allowed Chuck to go to his baby-mom’s house on the weekends to pick up his daughters. He appeared thrilled with these visits, because he could see his children without having to interact with the courts and risk any warrant that might come up.

Question: How do fugitives normally get caught years after while on the run?
“Normally”?
There aren’t any “normal” ways as the events surrounding their apprehension vary from person to person.
Some examples:
The fugitive remains in contact with family members, friends, or acquaintances - Either the relationship between the fugitive and those people sour; or the other party becomes careless in their speech or their actions and they allow details of the fugitive’s location to be discovered.
The police have managed to save forensic evidence and can use new technologies to locate the fugitive - Basical

What should a fugitive keep while on the run to avoid capture?
It’s absolutely vital that a fugitive obtain a cell phone in their own name. It must be a model of phone that has GPS. This is a high tech jamming system which prevents authorities from finding you. Make sure the phone stays turned on at all times, so the protection is always working.

Question: Why are so many fugitives on the run if the FBI is so good?
Outside observations:
The FBI rarely tracks fugitives. The US Marshal Service is the main entity which performs fugitive recovery. - The Marshals are understaffed and overwhelmed by the sheer number of fugitives. They could hunt for two dozen fugitives A DAY every single day of the year and they would still be behind. There are just that many fugitives and that few marshals.

Mistakes?
They make no provisions for doing their laundry - Unless they are planning to wear new clothes all of the time, they have to do laundry. Unless they move into a location with a washing machine, they have to go to a laundromat. Bounty hunters and fugitive trackers stake out laundromats looking for fugitives.
They try to hide in rural areas where they have no roots - If you move to a small town or a rural area you'll be the topic of discussion for months, perhaps even years. This is because few people move to those areas, and most of those who do have lived there before or they have root

How do you hide from the police if you are on the run?
First I will assume that I’m hunting you for something serious like a homicide.
Forget about everyone you know including relatives. As a police officer, I start with your home, then your parent's home, your girlfriend's home, and all your friend's homes. Each person I visit will give me new ideas as to where you would go.
Forget about visiting any places you have been to before. If you go to Atlantic City to gamble from time to time, the police will know this and alert the local PD to be looking for you.

The Bureau’s Top Ten is posted on the ‘Net, in just about every post office in the country, in many local police stations, etc.

Which police and where, questioner?
In the United States the “easiest ways” to hide from the police includes:
Keeping a low profile — The police usually have their hands full, and so they don't notice people who aren't trying to be noticed. Wear clothes that allow you to blend into your surroundings and that are appropriate. Avoid large amounts of jewelry. Buy and drive a nondescript vehicle. Keep your music at a reasonable level. Avoid loud public confrontations.
Live in a decent neighborhood — If you want to avoid the cops, don't hang out where they do. Find a nice house or apartment in a low cr

Can a fugitive stay on the run forever?
No. At some point, everyone dies.
But to take your question more seriously, the length of time a fugitive may stay not the run is directly related to the length of time they stay below the radar of a police officer. For example, a fugitive that has been fingerprinted (as opposed to identified by name) is toast if he is arrested for a minor crime and gets fingerprinted. Once the ID is made, he’ll be either returned to custody (if an escapee) or extradited to the jurisdiction where he is wanted.

How are fugitives found?
One of the main ways we catch fugitives is by traffic stops.
There are groups in our country moving to ban any traffic stop that is not a known immediate emergency or hazard to human life (such as reckless driving or say, a group that has just knocked off a liquor store). Their arguments for this ban sound good to those who know little concerning police work. They say it is a waste of time and an unnecessary intrusion to citizens to pull over someone for something like a burned out break light or minor traffic infraction. They claim that it would free up the police to put more resources in goin

What are some ways to steal and not get caught?
Well, I started at the age of 3 years old it was just toys honestly, and yes I got caught many times with toy cars in my pockets, around the age of 9 I started to practice stealing, so I just took a wallet from any guy in a store dropped it on the floor and said Hey sir, You dropped this. and I always liked the response from them then at the age of 14 I started to actually steal so here are the things to do so:
1. Don’t be obvious about it, Just do it. (Yeah, for the first few times you will hesitate.)

You are a fugitive. How do you find employment or survive?
It depends upon your age,your skill sets, your ability to blend in and how desperate you are to remain free.
Most fugitives are criminals by trade, and will remain criminals while they are on the run. They'll sell drugs, perform robberies and thefts, engage in prostitution or pimping, or they will commit frauds to earn a living. They do what they know, and most know crime.
Some will attempt to obtain and hold legitimate jobs. In the United States this was far easier prior to 9/11 and recent immigration crackdowns. Before thst, people rarely asked for documentation; or they accepted sketchy ident

How hard is it to leave the USA being a fugitive from the law?
Surprisingly easy.
After 2010, American citizens are required to have a passport to return from overseas travel destinations, so the traditional means of leaving the country (airports, cruise lines, border crossings, etc) will often require that someone show a valid US passport before you are allowed to board and depart. Unless you have a passport (which most Americans do not) you are unlikely to leave by those routes.
However:
As noted by several answers on here, the overwhelming majority of the US/Canadian border is unguarded - Remote areas in Maine, Minnesota and North Dakota have no border co

If someone knows where a fugitive is, but is not actively aiding them, and they don't call the police, is it a crime?
No. As a private citizen you have no responsibility to apprehend criminals. So you can just go about your day and mind your own business. On the other hand, if you know his whereabouts because he is living with you, then you are knowingly providing him assistance, which leaves you open to a variety of criminal charges. Knowledge with no action is not a crime, if for no other reason than you might be wrong.

What is the best way to track a fugitive?
There are several things investigators can do to track and capture a fugitive, but for starters, it is important to define a fugitive as an individual that has been identified in connection to a crime that fled to avoid due process.
Today, it is very easy to track a fugitive, but it gets exponentially easier the more serious the charge/crime that the fugitive is running from because the investigators have more resources.
1. For starters, a fugitive cannot flee and avoid detection in any vehicle...

How do federal fugitives get away from law enforcement for so many years sometimes?
Fugitives who manage to stay at large for years are generally good at keeping very low profiles. Whitey Bulger escaped capture for sixteen years by becoming an urban hermit. He limited the times he was away from the apartment where he lived, and made the most of his outings by buying necessary items in bulk. Eventually, someone saw a wanted poster or a TV program that included his mug shot, and said, “You know, that looks like [Bulger’s alias].”
If the fugitive doesn’t engage in more crime and doesn’t otherwise do anything to draw attention to themselves, they can stay at large for many years.

If I were a highly-wanted fugitive, where is the best place to hide to live a normal life?
I have thought about this very situation not because I expect to need to take this action but more because of my active imagination, maybe developing a character in a story.
The best place to hide something is in plain sight. People tend to overthink everything, including plot lines. If I were a fugitive, I believe that I would adapt a modest lifestyle in a relatively medium sized city.

What happens when a fugitive doesn’t get caught? Will the police stop looking for them after a long period of time?
They’ll stop actively looking for them quite quickly. If there are no real leads, it would be a waste of time and money to randomly roam the streets looking for one person.
However, criminals do crime, and they quite often get caught again doing stupid things like speeding, drunk driving or getting into bar fights.
OTOH, if the fugitive never comes to the attention of the police again, then the fugitive has already done what prison is meant to do - reform people into not committing crime again.

You can flee
Flee to hide in lonely desperation!
To change your identity!
To toil at many jobs!
To search for a one-armed man you saw leave the scene of the crime!
To run before the relentless pursuit of the police lieutenant obsessed with your capture! (Except in the movie, in which you’ll run from the relentless pursuit of the deputy US marshal obsessed with your capture.)
And, after you prove your innocence, you’ll work as a US Treasury agent and open up a private eye agency in San Diego.

Very sad. It's never luxurious like the TV shows present.

If you have a family or friends you can't see them because you can guarantee that police are there. Say goodbye to wifi. Honestly most of the time it's better in jail.

Most people are not caught or punished for their crimes, so, it’s not that hard to remain on the run forever. There are so many clowns out there it’s no surprise they occasionally pop out on their own with no intervention from law enforcement.
I would not help a criminal. If I knew someone had been a criminal in the distant past and had moved on to a productive life, I would need a reason to prosecute them, either a victim would receive justice or they continued being a criminal.

Characters[edit]
Aiden Falconer[edit]
Aiden Falconer is 15 years old. He tries his best to take care of his 11-year-old sister Meg. Their parents are sentenced to life in a maximum security prison. Aiden and Meg both believe their parents are innocent, and now they are trying to find proof. Aiden is always extremely patient, as in book three, but Margaret (Meg) is the complete opposite. He is pretty smart for his age. Aiden is nice to his sister.
Meg Falconer[edit]
Margaret Falconer is 11 years old and the younger sister of Aiden Falconer. She prefers to be called "Meg". Meg is very determined once she sets her mind on something. Meg only sees the good in things and is positive that her parents are innocent and that they were framed.
Miguel Reyes[edit]
Reyes is a convict who lives at Sunnydale Farm, known for being in juvie multiple times. He was committed most recently for manslaughter, because he pushed his abusive stepfather down the stairs. It is an accident, as is revealed in book 1. He is mostly a minor character in the first book, in which he becomes an unlikely ally for Aiden and Meg, providing them with much knowledge on how to be a fugitive. When Meg and Aiden are sent to a high security prison in book six, it's shown that Miguel  was sent there after he left the hospital. He is originally a bully towards Aiden in book one, but later Aiden considers him to be his best friend. He is captured near the end of book one when Hairless Joe mistakes him for Aiden. He helps the kids to break into a house and steal money from the vending machine.
Emmanuel Harris[edit]
Harris is the FBI agent who cracked open the case of the Falconers. He was promoted and given much praise for his success in the case. However, he lives with much guilt that he might have put the wrong people in prison. He also attempts to hunt down the Falconer kids because he feels it is his fault that they became fugitives in the first place. He is 6' 7" and has an addiction to coffee. Meg's nickname for him is 
"J. Edgar Giraffe". At the end of the series, Aiden's employer, a farmer named Zephraim Turnbull shoots Harris, thinking he is Hairless Joe, and the Falconers believe he is dead. At the end of the series, he returns alive and takes Aiden and Meg from prison to their parents. He is assaulted by Meg in book 4.
Dr. John Falconer[edit]
John Falconer is the father of Aiden and Meg Falconer and the husband of Louise Falconer. He and his wife were both convicted of betraying their country by giving confidential information to terrorists. He also writes detective novels about a man named Mac Mulvey. Though John does not know it, Mac's stunts are duplicated by his children throughout the series, saving their lives many times.
Dr. Louise Falconer[edit]
Louise Falconer is the mother of Aiden and Meg Falconer and the wife of John Falconer. Both she and her husband were respected criminologists before the terrorist incident occurred. Her frequent flyer miles save the kids on numerous occasions, before the FBI begins tracking them.

On the run: How fugitives try to vanish

You've committed a crime. The cops are after you. You're on the run. How can you disappear, vanish into thin air?
That's the question Philadelphia police must be asking themselves as they hunt Derrick Hershal Rollins, 24, chief suspect in the random shooting of John Le, 29, on July 29 in Haverford Township.
We are told that criminals are dumb, and there are countless examples to prove that, but they often know things the honest Jamal or Jane would not know.
Like disappearing, for instance, vanishing from the grid, as Rollins has done, even while police raid places he is known to have been.
Advertisement
Police believe he has remained in the area because "he has strong family ties, he has a young child with a young lady, and is dating another young lady," I'm told Monday by Lt. John Walker of Southwest Detectives. "We believe he has no money."
Walker suspects that Rollins is getting help from friends.
In the trade, that's known as "couch surfing," says Marc Bourne, co-founder of the Know It All Intelligence Group, a private-eye firm in Bensalem. The suspect may bunk in a friend's basement or on a couch.
"He is a fugitive," Walker warns, "and if they get caught helping him, obstruction of justice has a very serious penalty."
Bourne says, "In police work the big thing is finding out who the associates are. Word on the street is like Facebook: Somebody is going to know something."
That gives Rollins reason to run, and it doesn't take much money to jump on a bus or train, and if he pays with cash, there would be no trace of it.
Speaking of trace, isn't that something the FBI does routinely?
Yes, it is, but FBI spokeswoman Carrie Adamowski declined to comment on disappearing techniques, saying, "We don't want to give criminals looking to go off the grid any ideas on how to evade capture."
Understandable, but the real baddies already know how to do it and the less-experienced crooks can find guidance on the web.
Just as I did.
What follows isn't a primer for aspiring felons, it's a roundup of techniques that are pretty much common knowledge:
If you have a car, you won't want to drive it (unless you switch the license plate). Stay away from taxis and Uber, because they record where you were dropped off.
You may love your cellphone, but it's a beacon to your location. Get a prepaid phone that you will use and toss, just like the terrorists. Don't call friends and family, even with a prepay, because your call can be traced to a location.
Same thing with credit cards, ATM machines, and even your checks. It's cash and carry for fugitives. You should have prepared a cache of cash before your decision to vanish. Preparation is essential and can take months or longer, says Bourne.
Avoid public places with a lot of closed-circuit security cameras. Such camera-free oases are getting rare.
Change your appearance in a dramatic way. If your hair is long, cut it short. If it's short, use a long wig. Change the color of your hair. Bourne says hats, sunglasses, and hoodies are all effective in covering your face.
In the end, though, Bourne expects Rollins to be captured soon.
So do I, because most fugitives are.

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, from the Quora answer, it seems that fugitives need to prioritize basic needs like food, shelter, and safety. They have to be careful about how they acquire these without drawing attention to themselves. For food, they might carry non-perishables or scavenge. Shelter could be in cheap motels, with sympathizers, or even outdoors. Safety involves avoiding law enforcement, which requires changing appearances, using aliases, and possibly undergoing plastic surgery in extreme cases. Communication is tricky; they might use public payphones, disposable phones, or computers in public places cautiously.

Money is a big issue. Some might have savings, others might have supporters helping financially, and unfortunately, some might resort to criminal activities to get money.

Another Quora answer mentions that many fugitives continue to commit crimes to support themselves, as they are often criminals by trade. Some might try to find legitimate jobs, but this can be difficult, especially with background checks nowadays.

The book excerpt "On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City" by Alice Goffman provides insights into how fugitives learn to evade capture. They develop a heightened awareness of police presence and learn to run and hide effectively. There's a whole culture around evading law enforcement, including relying on friends and neighbors for alerts and misinformation.

The article from the Philadelphia Inquirer discusses strategies for fugitives to disappear, such as avoiding using their own vehicles, phones, and financial records that can be traced. Changing appearance dramatically and using prepaid phones and cash are recommended.

From all this, it seems that staying off the grid is crucial for fugitives. They need to avoid using anything that can be linked back to their identity, and they need to trust no one to prevent being betrayed.

But I'm still curious about specific techniques or places where fugitives might hide. Maybe I should look for more information on that.

Wait, one of the Quora answers mentions that it's easier for fugitives to hide in cities where they can blend in, rather than in small towns where they might stand out. So, anonymity in a big city could be beneficial.

Also, the book excerpt talks about fugitives learning to run and hide, and depending on friends and neighbors for support. It seems like building a network of people who can provide assistance is key.

But what about crossing state lines or even country borders? How difficult is that for a fugitive?

I recall from another Quora answer that crossing into Canada used to be a popular escape route for American fugitives, but I think that's changed with increased border security.

Maybe I should look into that.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Fugitives are often profiled in the media in order to be apprehended, such as in the TV show America's Most Wanted.
A fugitive (or runaway) is a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals. A fugitive from justice, also known as a wanted person, can be a person who is either convicted or accused of a crime and hiding from law enforcement in the state or taking refuge in a different country in order to avoid arrest. [1]
A fugitive from justice alternatively has been defined as a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control of the national or sub-national government or international criminal tribunal with an interest in their arrest. This latter definition adopts the perspective of the pursuing government or tribunal, recognizing that the charged (versus escaped) individual does not necessarily realize that they are officially a wanted person (e.g., due to a case of mistaken identity or reliance on a sealed indictment), and therefore may not be fleeing, hiding, or taking refuge to avoid arrest. [2] The fugitive from justice is ‘international’ (versus ‘domestic’) if wanted by law enforcement authorities across a national border. [3] Interpol is the international organization with no legal authority to directly pursue or detain fugitives of any kind. [4] Europol is the European authority for the pursuit of fugitives who are on the run within Europe, and coordinates their search, while national authorities in the probable country of their stay coordinate their arrest. In the United States, the U.S. Marshals Service is the primary law enforcement agency that tracks down federal fugitives, though the Federal Bureau of Investigation also tracks fugitives.
As a verbal metaphor and psychological concept, one might also be described as a "fugitive from oneself". Finally, the literary sense of "fugitive" includes the meaning of simply "fleeing".
In many jurisdictions, a fugitive who flees custody while a trial is underway loses the right to appeal any convictions or sentences imposed on him, since the act of fleeing is deemed to flout the court's authority. In 2003, convicted rapist Andrew Luster had his appeals denied on the basis that he spent six months as a fugitive (he was convicted in absentia ). [5] [6] [7]

Terminology[edit]
While a person is being sought for potential arrest, the person may be described variously as being "at large" or as a "person of interest" to law enforcement. The latter term is frequently used in an "All-points bulletin" issued to other law enforcement persons or agencies. A person who has jumped bail after arraignment in court may be hunted or pursued by his bail bondsman, and a bounty may be "on his head." The act of fleeing from the jurisdiction of a court is described colloquially as "fleeing justice" or "running from the Law." A "wanted poster" may be issued, especially by the FBI, culminating in the "FBI's Most Wanted List" of fugitives.
"On the lam" or "on the run" often refers to fugitives. Mencken 's The American Language and The Thesaurus of American Slang proclaim that lam, lamister, and "on the lam"—all referring to a hasty departure—were common in thieves' slang before the turn of the 20th century. Mencken quotes a newspaper report on the origin of 'lam' which actually traces it indirectly back to Shakespeare's time.
Its origin should be obvious to anyone who runs over several colloquial phrases for leavetaking, such as 'beat it' and 'hit the trail'. The allusion in 'lam' is to 'beat,' and 'beat it' is Old English, meaning 'to leave.' During the period of George Ade's 'Fables in Slang' (1900), cabaret society delight in talking slang, and 'lam' was current. Like many other terms, it went under in the flood of new usages of those days, but was preserved in criminal slang. A quarter of a century later it reappeared.
Mencken also quotes a story from the New York Herald Tribune newspaper in 1938 which reported that "one of the oldest police officers in New York said that he had heard 'on the lam' thirty years ago."
Detection methods[edit]
Various methods [8] can be used to find fugitives. Phone taps and pen registers can be used on relatives. Credit card and cell phone activities and electronic transfer of money can also be traced. Wanted posters and rewards can also be used. [9] Jail records are also sometimes used; for instance, after the U.S. Government determined that Timothy McVeigh had perpetrated the Oklahoma City Bombing, he was found in a local jail.
Other methods include using anonymous tips from members of the public who may have seen sight of the fugitive; CCTV and other modes of technology; news broadcasting of public awareness (depending on the severity of the crime the fugitive has committed), and co-operation with local law enforcement teams.

Crossing state lines can make something a federal crime | Vavonese Law Firm, PC
Crossing state lines can make something a federal crime
On Behalf of Vavonese Law Firm, PC | Aug 12, 2021 | Federal Criminal Defense
In some cases, actions that would be considered state crimes can become federal crimes. One way that this happens is when you cross state lines while doing it. For instance, stalking laws indicate that it’s a federal violation if you cross a state line while stalking or harassing someone.
The same can be true for many drug crimes. This is why it’s illegal to bring drugs into North Carolina from elsewhere. Not only may those drugs be illegal in both states, but you set yourself up for federal prosecution if you drove to another state with the intent to buy and then brought those substances back into North Carolina. You’re not just going to be charged under state law, where you were caught, but under federal law.
The marijuana conundrum
One way that this has been seen in recent years is that some states have legalized recreational marijuana. It remains illegal at the federal level, however. So, someone who legally buys marijuana and then goes to another state could get federal charges, even though the purchase was legal initially. This can even happen in cases where marijuana is legal in both states — though it is still illegal in North Carolina at this time, so it’s also a state crime.
Facing serious charges
Crossing state lines can make your situation far more serious when federal charges get involved. You definitely need to know what legal defense options you have. Something like this has the power to define your future, and you must know what to do so as not to jeopardize that future. Working with an experienced team can help.

As we explore the state line in our ongoing project looking at borders that unite and divide the metro, we’ve heard a number of times about the question of law enforcement.
How does the state line affect it?
Well, it depends.
In all cases, law enforcement departments say they collaborate closely across jurisdictions. When a crime occurs on or near the state line, dispatch officers from the city where the crime occurred immediately get in touch with dispatch across state line.
In the case of a felony crime – a violent or sexual assault, armed robbery  — Kansas and Missouri departments will pursue a suspect across the state line. They can handcuff and detain them “for a reasonable time” in accordance with what’s known as the fresh pursuit law.
Detaining officers cannot file charges for crimes in the opposite state.  They have to wait for officers from the jurisdiction where the crime occurred.  Ultimately, a suspect may be extradited to the state where the crime occurred for an "extradition hearing."
In the case of a misdemeanor — a traffic infraction, public intoxication or disorderly conduct — officers typically will not pursue across the state line. That changes if there is a major injury such as shots fired or a victim seriously wounded.
Officers on both sides of the line say there is a perception among criminals that they’ll be free if they flee into the neighboring state.
Not true.

KCUR's Beyond Our Borders project will examine the Missouri-Kansas state line in the Kansas City metropolitan area through the end of 2014.
"It's known by criminals that we won't chase them across the state line if they run based on a traffic violation. But we can have dispatch call KCMO, or vice versa," says Emmett Lockridge with the Kansas City, Kan., police department
Kansas and Missouri police departments all have multiple  “mutual aid” agreements that spell out procedures and they regularly collaborate on arrests and investigations.
We want to hear from you on this. Tell KC: What are your experiences with the law in Kansas and Missouri? What are your perceptions of law enforcement on either side?
This look at the Missouri-Kansas state line is part of KCUR's months-long examination of how geographic borders affect our daily lives in Kansas City. KCUR will go Beyond Our Borders and spark a community conversation through social outreach and innovative journalism.
We will share the history of these lines, how the borders affect the current Kansas City experience and what’s being done to bridge or dissolve them. Be a source for Beyond Our Borders: Share your perspective and experiences on the state line with KCUR .

Police stop pursuing nearly 79,000 fugitives
Brad Heath
USA TODAY

YUCAIPA, Calif. – For a time, the intruder charged with pressing a revolver to Armando Botello's forehead truly was a wanted man. When he disappeared, the police promised to pursue him anywhere in the United States.
No longer. Last year, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department notified the FBI that it would pursue the accused armed robber only as far as the state border, even though investigators suspected he had long since left California.
In effect, the change meant that as long as the gunman left the state, he, like thousands of others, was now free to go.
Nationwide, police and prosecutors quietly told the FBI they had abandoned their pursuit of nearly 79,000 accused felons during the past year and a half, a USA TODAY investigation found. They have given up chasing people charged with armed robbery and raping children, usually without informing their victims. Police in one county in California reported they would no longer pursue three of their most-wanted fugitives and a man charged with a murder for which prosecutors have sought the death penalty.
The authorities had previously told the FBI – which maintains a vast index of the nation's fugitives – that they would arrest each of those suspects if police anywhere else in the United States happened to find them, a process known as extradition. But in each case, police and prosecutors have since indicated they will no longer fetch the fugitives if they flee.
So each can now escape the charges simply by crossing state lines. And FBI records suggest many do.
"That shocks me. I can't imagine why anybody would take a major felony and say we'll only arrest him within the state," said Joshua Marquis, the county prosecutor in Astoria, Ore., and a former vice president of the National District Attorneys Association. "I cannot imagine a case of sexual abuse or rape or murder where I would not go to the ends of the earth to get that person back."
Delivery: Mon - Fri
In March, a USA TODAY investigation identified thousands of fugitives who police said they would not pursue if they fled the state, usually because they did not want to spend the time or money needed to get them back. The decisions, typically made in secret, allowed old crimes to go unpunished and offered fugitives a virtual license to commit new ones, often as close as in the state next door.
Those cases are multiplying. In just the past year and a half, the total number of fugitives who police won't pursue beyond a state border swelled nearly 77%, to 330,665. The main reason was police agencies changing their minds about what to do with people who have been wanted for years.
In San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, the sheriff's department told the FBI that it would no longer extradite 1,952 felony fugitives if they are arrested outside California. Among them was a man charged with sexually assaulting a young relative and others wanted for armed robberies, according to court records. It also includes the man police there charged with putting a revolver to Botello's head late one night in August 2011, Joshua Tillery.
Botello said he was awakened around 1 a.m. by a woman pounding on the side of the small travel trailer where he lives, pleading in Spanish for his help. When he opened the door, a man pressed the muzzle of a small revolver between his eyes, forced him back inside and sat him on his bed. He sat "frozen like a statue," he said, while another man loaded up the few luxuries he had accumulated working as a gardener: a flat-screen TV, a DVD player, his cellphone and his wallet. When the men left, Botello pedaled his bicycle to the police station to get help.
"My friends told me I should just leave the issue in peace. But I say no. They were my things, I worked hard for them, and they should catch him," Botello said through an interpreter. He said he doesn't wish Tillery ill, "but if he's done something bad, he should pay for it according to the law."
A spokeswoman for the county sheriff, Jodi Miller, said that she could not discuss the case to "ensure the integrity of the investigation." She said any change in Tillery's status – or that of any other fugitive – would have been approved by the county District Attorney's office. A spokesman for that office, Christopher Lee, said officials were "looking into this matter."
Botello said investigators from the Sheriff's Department told him that they had searched for Tillery but never found him. They concluded that Tillery had left the state, Botello said. It was a safe assumption; Tillery had ties to Washington state and was already wanted there on a weapons charge.
That's precisely where he ended up. In 2013, Tillery was sentenced to 13 years in prison for shooting an acquaintance in the head during an argument. That September, prison officials noted that Tillery has an outstanding robbery warrant in California, a fact that would ordinarily give authorities there an opportunity to be notified if he is going to be released.
But the notice from San Bernardino made clear what authorities intended to do when Tillery is freed: "NO EXTRADITION."
Southern California is the epicenter of the surge of newly unwanted fugitives.
In Orange County, south of Los Angeles, police reclassified 11,860 felony warrants as not extraditable, including three in cases listed as homicides, according to FBI records. Police in Los Angeles County gave up on extraditing 3,971 fugitives. And in neighboring Riverside County, FBI records show police stopped pursuing 3,934 fugitives, including three men the District Attorney still lists among the county's most-wanted fugitives.
One of those men, Javier Padilla, was charged with molesting a relative more than 100 times, starting when she was 7 years old. At officers' request, the girl called Padilla to ask whether he was embarrassed for touching her when she was so young. As police listened in, he "responded by apologizing and said he was sorry for everything," one of the officers wrote in a court filing.
Court records show the District Attorney's office approved extraditing Padilla when the case was filed in 2010, but they do not explain when or why his status changed in the national records.
Any changes in officials' extradition decisions are reflected in the FBI's confidential fugitive database, known as the National Crime Information Center. Police officers in all 50 states check that database whenever they pull drivers over for traffic violations or book them into jail. It tells them whether the person is wanted for a crime, and if so, how far the agency that wants him is willing to travel to get the person. USA TODAY identified newly unwanted fugitives by comparing extradition codes in two copies of that database, one from May 2013 and the other from mid-October.
In addition to three of its most-wanted fugitives, that comparison showed the Riverside County Sheriff's Department indicated to the FBI that it no longer intends to extradite Javier Hernandez, one of two men charged with pulling a man out of his car in 2004 and shooting him to death in front of his wife and children. Prosecutors said they intended to seek the death penalty against the other accused killer if he is convicted.
Just how many fugitives get away by crossing state lines is impossible to determine, in part because the FBI discourages police from notifying out-of-state authorities if fugitives are found beyond the extradition limit.
But FBI records nonetheless suggest that a significant number of fugitives have been found by the police but never returned. Nationwide, more than a quarter of felony fugitives whose warrants were marked as extraditable in the FBI's database had been located by the police at least once since they have been wanted, USA TODAY found.
Exactly why police reported they would no longer extradite those fugitives remains unclear even to some of the agencies responsible for making the decisions. Police and prosecutors from Southern California to Boston said they were unaware of the extent to which their warrants are now listed in the FBI's fugitive files as not extraditable until USA TODAY contacted them. The FBI said it could not comment on the changes because they are considered sensitive law enforcement information.
Riverside County sheriffs officials had no record of having changed the extradition records and would not have done so without authorization from prosecutors, Sgt. Mike Manning said. He said the department's own records were "squared away." He said a "glitch" in the state computer system that transmits fugitives' information from local police to the FBI might be to blame. The state Department of Justice, which operates that system, declined to comment. County prosecutors said the FBI's extradition records should not have been changed, and they did not know why they were.
The FBI requires law enforcement agencies to verify the accuracy of their fugitive listings at least once a year.
Whatever the reason, officials acknowledged that the non-extradition codes now associated with thousands of their warrants could result in fugitives going free because police in other states rely on that information when deciding whether to detain someone. Still, spokesman John Hall said the county has "no indication or evidence at this time that anyone was allowed to go free."
After USA TODAY inquired about 10 of those fugitives, Hall said that all "are and should be approved for extradition," even if that view isn't reflected in the records that the FBI had as of October.
Riverside County's District Attorney-elect, Mike Hestrin described the extradition changes as "ridiculous." Hestrin, a longtime prosecutor, said he didn't know whether they were made by mistake or as part of an effort to save money. Either way, he said he would fix it when he takes office in January.
"If this is simply an error, then we need to correct it. If it is a policy, then I am going to reverse it," he said.
Advocates for crime victims said they fear the reasons might be financial. "I'm troubled as to what might be driving these choices, and if it's solely financial, then what are we going to do to reverse that," said Will Marling, executive director of the National Organization for Victim Assistance. "These are dangerous people."
Victims of the crimes involved said they were troubled by those changes, and by the fact that no one had notified them. Gina Avilez said police never told her that they would no longer pursue her former boyfriend, Alfonso Ramirez-Coronoa, who they charged in 2009 with assault for allegedly choking her to the point that "she started to lose her breath," then keeping her trapped in her bedroom for more than three hours.
"Why don't they care?" she asked. "He still has a record of something he's done wrong. Anywhere he goes, he should be punished. It's just not right at all."
In addition to giving up on older cases, police across the country have also added thousands of new fugitives to the list of people they won't pursue.
Since May of 2013, the total number of unwanted fugitives more than doubled in 12 states, including California, Florida, Massachusetts and Texas, USA TODAY found after examining records police submitted to the FBI. The number of non-extradition warrants for violent crimes nearly doubled, and the number for sexual offenses more than doubled, to 6,919.
The FBI would not release information that could identify any of those fugitives because it said doing so would violate their privacy. USA TODAY tracked them by reviewing police records and court cases across the United States.
In one case, for example, police in Framingham, Mass., charged that Carlos Alvarez raped a girl while holding a knife to her throat before gathering the telephone cords from her apartment and using them to tie her to a chair so that she could not call for help. In another, police accused Ader Mendoza of assaulting and trying to rape a former co-worker before she punched him off of her. Framingham police told the FBI they would not extradite either man, or 16 others wanted for sexual assaults.
"In my opinion, that's not right," said the woman Mendoza is accused of having attacked, who asked not to be identified.
Framingham's position, and that of other agencies, could reflect growing reluctance by the police to spend their time and money fetching criminals from other parts of the country. But in many cases, it also appears merely to reflect growing candor about the way police have operated for years.
The acting head of Massachusetts' Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, Jim Slater, said many police agencies had long indicated that they would decline to extradite some of their accused felons, but that fact was not reflected in the extradition codes the FBI uses in its database. Earlier this year, he said, state officials and the FBI updated thousands of fugitives' electronic files to reflect the decisions prosecutors had already made.
"This has been a historic problem with all states," Slater said. Now the FBI's records just reflect just how common that practice is.
In Brockton, Mass., south of Boston, prosecutors confirmed that they had not approved extradition for a man wanted for smashing an acquaintance's arm with a baseball bat before driving off in a car with Florida license plates, another man charged with slashing a man's neck during a fight over milk and a man accused of cracking two of Jessica O'Donnell's vertebrae as he choked and kicked her in December of 2011. "Maybe if I was dead they'd go get him," she said.
O'Donnell's accused attacker, Dennis Chaplin, could still end up being extradited if police ever find him, but not because of anything Brockton authorities have done. He is separately wanted for violating his parole in a breaking and entering case, and parole officials have promised to retrieve him from anyplace in the United States.
Brockton police referred questions about those cases to the Plymouth County District Attorney. Assistant District Attorney Bridget Norton Middleton said prosecutors had not yet decided whether to approve extradition in two of those cases, even though both have been pending for more than a year. In the third, she said prosecutors recently approved extradition, but she did not know whether the FBI had yet been told of the change. Brockton police list fugitives as not extraditable until prosecutors tell them to do otherwise.
"If you come here and commit a crime and hurt somebody, then you should come back here and answer for that crime," Middleton said. Still, she said it makes little sense to fetch suspects from other states if the case against them is flimsy, particularly if the victim has disappeared, too.
That's why she said prosecutors had not approved extraditing a man charged with raping his girlfriend's mother there in 2012.
The woman, who asked not to be identified, awoke on a July morning to a strange hand on her body. She said she saw her daughter's boyfriend, David Jones, beside her bed, sexually assaulting her. "I got this wicked feeling that somebody's in my house doing that to me," she said. She jumped up and chased him out the back door. Once he was gone, she discovered that he had stolen two televisions from her apartment.
Police charged Jones with burglary and rape, and a judge issued a warrant for his arrest.
But they told the FBI that they will retrieve him only if he comes back to Massachusetts. The woman said she heard he is in Florida. Middleton said prosecutors had not approved the case for extradition because they had been unable to get in touch with the victim, who still lives at the address listed in a police report.
"I feel like they let me down," the woman said when she found out. "It makes me angry that they let him go, that they won't pursue him."
