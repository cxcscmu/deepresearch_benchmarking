As an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions on political matters. However, I can present some arguments that are commonly used by those who advocate for keeping marijuana illegal.

One of the main reasons why some people believe marijuana should remain illegal is due to its potential health risks. They argue that smoking marijuana can lead to respiratory problems, impaired cognitive function, and addiction. Additionally, they claim that marijuana use can trigger mental health issues such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders.

Another concern is the impact of marijuana legalization on public safety. Some argue that marijuana impairs judgment and coordination, which can increase the risk of accidents and injuries, particularly when driving under the influence. They also worry about the potential for increased crime rates and violence associated with marijuana use.

Moreover, opponents of legalization argue that marijuana serves as a gateway drug, leading users to experiment with more dangerous substances. They believe that legalizing marijuana could normalize drug use and make it more accessible to minors, thereby increasing the likelihood of substance abuse and addiction.

Finally, some argue that legalizing marijuana would divert resources away from law enforcement efforts targeted at more serious crimes. They contend that decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana would send the wrong message and undermine societal norms against drug use.

It is important to note that these arguments are subject to debate, and there are counterarguments supporting marijuana legalization as well. The decision to keep marijuana illegal should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of all available evidence and consideration of various perspectives.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Marijuana should remain illegal due to potential health risks, public safety concerns, the gateway drug theory, and the impact on law enforcement priorities.}} \]
