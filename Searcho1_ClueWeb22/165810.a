So I've come across this question about dream catchers and whether using them is considered cultural appropriation. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what cultural appropriation means, but I think it has something to do with one culture taking elements from another culture without understanding or respecting its original meaning. So, in this case, dream catchers are probably significant to a particular culture, and maybe using them without knowing their importance could be seen as inappropriate.

First, I need to understand what dream catchers are and where they originate from. I think they're Native American, but I'm not sure which specific tribe created them. I recall seeing them in movies and at craft fairs, and people seem to use them as decorations, especially in bedrooms. I've heard that they're supposed to protect sleeping children from bad dreams, but I don't know much more than that.

I feel like this is important because cultural sensitivity is key in respecting different traditions and heritages. I don't want to dismiss someone's culture or turn sacred symbols into mere decorations without understanding their significance. So, maybe I should look into the history of dream catchers and see how they were traditionally used.

Let me try to search for some information. Maybe I can find out more about their origin and meaning.

Dream Catcher Origin
Origin of the Dream Catcher
There was a time in Anishnabe history when the people were being tormented by nightmares. The elders and “medicine people” all tried to solve this problem on their own, but not a one made progress against the dreams; so a council or all the people was called. During this council one elder had a vision of a spider’s web in a hoop with a feather and bead attached that would catch the bad dreams while letting good dreams pass through. The elders went to work fashioning dream catchers in the manner prescribed by the vision and when the people started using them, the bad dreams went away. …Anishnabe as remembered by WayaGola
Application and Purpose of the Dream Catcher
The dream catcher is hung above a sleeping area in a place where the morning light can hit it. The nature of the Dream Catcher will attract all sorts of dreams to its webs. When bad dreams come, they do not know the way through the web and get caught in the webbing where the first light of day causes them to melt away and perish. The good dreams knowing the way go through the center of the web and slide down the feather to the sleeper below. …Anishnabe as remembered by WayaGola
I have also been taught that the web catches bad/unimportant dreams and allows the good/important dreams to come through the middle and slide down the feather into the sleeper’s head. Bad dreams are malicious in intent, or simply unimportant fleeting images. Bad dreams may be very disturbing, but still have a very important message for the dreamer, so that the dream catcher doesn’t necessarily get rid of bad dreams in the sense of nightmares, but bad dreams in the sense of distracting dreams that have no significance or meaning to the dreamer. I have also been told that they were always hung on cradleboards. …Cary Miller
I have often seen many people driving down the Highway with a dream catcher attached to the rearview mirror. Although the dream catcher is very pretty, the place for it is in a bedroom or over a bed, not a moving vehicle (unless a baby carriage). Please stay alert when you drive!! …Charles P. Whitecoyote
Structure of the Dream Catcher
The dream catcher is fashioned from a hoop of red willow with a webbing of animal sinue which takes the form of a web (like a spider’s web). Attached at the bottom of the loop are a bead (usually seed or carved wood) and a feather. …Anishnabe as remembered by WayaGola
They must be made with all natural materials – the hoop should be made with willow, preferably red willow. The web should have at least seven points for the seven grandfathers, and may have other numbers with various meanings – 13 for the moons, 28 for the lunar month. …Cary Miller
Also, the traditional Dream Catchers are only 3 to 5 inches across. Webs that are 2 to 6 feet (I actually saw a 6 footer at a truck stop!) are beyond the scope of tradition. …Charles P. Whitecoyote

A dream catcher is pretty self-explanatory, right? Yep, you’d be correct in thinking that dream catchers are made to snatch away bad dreams… but there’s so much more to them than that.
These beautiful Native American talismans have a rich history, steeped in tradition. They’re not just eye-catching displays in cheap gift stores!
Anyone who has a dream catcher or wants to buy one should read this article first. You need to know the true meaning of dream catchers to respect and admire the culture behind them.
What is a Dream Catcher?
Terry Cralle, RN, MS, CPHQ
Just in case you’re really clueless, a dream catcher is a small round talisman that’s hung by your bed to capture bad dreams and/or deliver good dreams and thoughts while you sleep.
Traditional, authentic dream catchers were made from wooden hoops, with thread webbing, handmade beads, leather, and feathers. Organic, natural materials are essential. They would be a few inches wide at most, and certainly wouldn’t be the bright, colorful and over-the-top dream catchers you find in cheap holiday gift shops.
The huge, plastic dream catchers with vividly bright faux feathers are a commercialized version of the original Native American dream catcher – more on why you shouldn’t buy these below.
How the traditional dreamcatcher works varies slightly from one legend to another, but the meaning is always similar: to catch harmful thoughts or bad dreams and keep you safe with good dreams and positive thoughts while you sleep. Dream catchers were originally made for very small children and babies, so they could be hung just above their cribs.
Over the decades, dream catchers have taken on new meanings – some with respect for the traditions, others without – and become symbols for various movements, such as the non-violent Pan-Indianism Movement.
The Beautiful Legends Behind Dream Catchers
Terry Cralle, RN, MS, CPHQ
Various Native American cultures have dream catchers, or a version of them, woven into their traditions. But it is the Ojibwe culture (indigenous people originally from northern midwestern USA and Canada) that the majority of historians agree the dream catcher originated from.
The legend focuses on Asibikaashi, the spider woman. She was the spiritual protector of the Ojibwe people, protecting the children from harm.
As their people spread further across the land, Asibikaashi found it harder to protect everyone from far away. So, the dream catcher was created.
The web within the willow hoop, like a spider’s web, would catch any bad thoughts or spirits lingering around – not specifically for bad dreams.
From here, the legend branches out with different meanings and stories depending on who’s telling the history of dream catchers.
Many believe that the dreamcatcher will catch bad dreams in the web, while good dreams filter through the hole, gem or bead in the center. When the first rays of the sun touch the dreamcatcher in the morning, those trapped bad dreams are destroyed.
Lakota Legends
Terry Cralle, RN, MS, CPHQ
Similarly to Ojibwe, the Lakota legends about dreamcatchers begin with a spiritual being associated with spiders. Iktomi created the dreamcatcher to catch good ideas on the web so they won’t be lost, but let bad ideas filter through the central hole and simply pass by their people unharmed.
The dreamcatcher itself is also a symbol – the perfectly round hoop is a symbol of the circle of life, the sun, and the moon. The soft, downy feathers (often owl feathers) are the ladders that good dreams float down into your mind.
Furthermore, the number of points where the webbed thread touches the inside of the hoop is symbolic. 13 points represent the phases of the moon, 8 for the spider woman’s legs, 7 for the prophesies, 6 for the eagle, and 5 for a star.
Sacred beads and tokens can also be added amongst the feathers.
Finally, the gems or stones in the dreamcatcher can represent good dreams or, if there’s a single stone, represent the creator of the world.
Why Understanding the Symbolism and History of Dream Catchers is Important
Terry Cralle, RN, MS, CPHQ
Dreamcatchers are closely tied to heart-warming and noble legends of Native Americans – so is it right for people around the world to buy dreamcatchers on a whim or simply because they’re “pretty”?
The dreamcatcher should be a symbol of unity among Native American communities, not an over-commercialized and misused plastic decoration, made in China, and eventually forgotten in a landfill site.
This is where cultural appropriation comes in. It is controversial, and frankly offensive in our opinion, to adopt a piece of tradition from one culture without even trying to understand and respect the origins and meaning behind it.
Cultural appreciation, on the other hand, should be commended. Owning a dreamcatcher, understanding and respecting the meaning behind it, and supporting the Native American people is to be commended.
That’s why we recommend you buy dreamcatchers from traditional Native American craftspeople – you’ll find them for sale in Indian territory across the US and Canada, just look for tribal giftshops or attend Native Indian events to learn more about the culture as well.
For online resources to buy authentic dreamcatchers from, check out this list from Native Languages.
Gifting dreamcatchers to newly born babies and young children is a beautiful way to honor the original dream catcher meaning and respect the legends behind them by passing down the story from one generation to the next.
Summary – Dream Catcher Meaning
If you’ve been looking for a scientific explanation of how dreamcatchers work, you’re going to be disappointed. Dream catchers are stunning talismans with a beautiful history and meaning behind them.
The simple act of respecting and honoring the tradition of your dreamcatcher as you hang it above your bed is sure to leave you with a smile on your face and good dreams in your mind!
Just remember to:
Learn about the dreamcatcher you’re buying, and the symbolism behind it.
Respect and appreciate the culture that brought you the dream catcher.
Buy traditional, hand-crafted dreamcatchers from Native American craftspeople.

The DreamCatcher Legend and Dream Catcher History
The Legend Of the Dream Catcher
The Ojibwa (Chippewa)  believe that night is full of both good and bad dreams. When a dream catcher is hung above the place where you sleep it moves freely in the night air and catches the dreams as they drift by. The good dreams, knowing their way, pass through the opening in the center of the webbing while the bad dreams, not knowing the way, are caught in the webbing and destroyed at the first light of the morning sun.
There are many variants to the dream catcher legend, some which say both the good and bad dreams are captured and some which say the good dreams slide down the feather to those sleeping below. Although the Ojibwa are credited as the first people to use Dream Catchers many other Tribes and Native peoples have adopted Dream Catchers into their culture. Even though the designs and legends of Dream Catchers differ slightly,  the underlying meaning and symbolism is universal and is carried across cultures and language barriers.
Everybody dreams.

The History, Legend & Origins of the Dream Catcher
The dream catcher is most commonly associated with Native American culture. Originating from the Ojibwe people, who lived primarily in the northern USA and Canada, the dream catcher shares a story that bends the the seams between dreams and reality.
Nowadays often seen in souvenir and gift shops or hanging off a bedroom wall, these handcrafted trinkets typically consist of a round, woven net of various fiber or red willow, and adorned with feathers, leather, beads, or various other materials differentiating from tribe to tribe.
The Ojibwe Dream Catcher Legend
The Ojibwe word for a dream catcher is ‘ asabikeshiinh’. This term is the inanimate word for ‘spider’. According to American ethnographer ‘ Frances Densmore ‘, the origin of the dream catcher lies in a folktale of the Asibikaashi. The Asibikaashi were believed to be a type of human and spider hybrid, who along with Wanabozhoo, brought the sun to the people of the land.
After this, they became caretakers of the children, the tribe, and the land. The story goes on to say that as the Ojibwe tribe began to occupy more territory it became more taxing for the Asibikaashi to tend to all the land. This led to the tribal women spinning web shaped ornaments out of willow, sinew or cord to give to children and infants as protective charms. It was thought that these charms would catch any evil, or bad dreams that might be in the air, similar to how a spider web catches whatever flies into it.
The Lakota Dream Catcher Legend
Long ago, when the world was young, an old Lakota spiritual leader was on a high mountain. On the mountain, he had a vision. In his vision, Iktomi – the great trickster and teacher of wisdom – appeared in the form of a spider.
Iktomi spoke to him in a sacred language. Only spiritual leaders of the Lakota could understand. As Iktomi spoke, he took the elder’s willow hoop – which had feathers, horse hair, beads and offerings on it – and began to spin a web.
He spoke to the elder about the cycles of life and how we begin our lives as infants. We then move on to childhood and in to adulthood. Finally, we go to old age where we must be taken care of as infants, thus, completing the cycle.
“But,” Iktomi said as he continued to spin his web, “in each time of life there are many forces – some good and some bad. If you listen to the good forces, they will steer you in the right direction. But, if you listen to the bad forces, they will hurt you and steer you in the wrong direction.”
He continued, “There are many forces and different directions that can help or interfere with the harmony of nature and also with the Great Spirit and all of his wonderful teachings.”
All while the spider spoke, he continued to weave his web … starting from the outside and working toward the center. When Iktomi finished speaking, he gave the Lakota elder the web and said, “See, the web is a perfect circle, but there is a hole in the center of the circle.”
“Use the web to help yourself and your people … to reach your goals and make use of your people’s ideas, dreams and visions. If you believe in the Great Spirit, the web will catch your good ideas, and the bad ones will go through the hole.” (Note: Some bands believe the bad ideas are caught in the web and the good ideas pass through to the individual. Either account is acceptable.)
The Lakota elder passed his vision on to his people. Now, the Sioux use the dream catchers as the web of their life. Traditionally, it is hung above their beds or in their homes to sift their dreams and visions. Good dreams are captured in the web of life and carried with them … but the evil dreams escape through the center’s hole and are no longer part of them. (Note: Some bands believe the bad ideas are caught in the web and the good ideas pass through to the individual. Either account is acceptable.)
Lakota believe the dreamcatcher holds the destiny of their future.

I was interested to know how you center yourself and clear your mind
prior to writing. I’ve had a difficult time clearing my mind in getting my
ideas out there. I do take pleasure in writing but it just seems
like the first 10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or tips?
Kudos!

What Are Dreamcatchers? Brief Origin and History
Dream catchers started as a symbolic decoration with purpose for our Native Americans, but today they’re more or less a decoration and symbolism for peace and blissful sleep. Created from a variety of materials, no two dreamcatchers are alike. What are they and what purpose did they serve?
History, Lore and Legend
Native Americans are big on folk lore and legends, the dreamcatcher proves to be no exception. Ever open minded, Native Americans believe that dreams not only present messages to the dreamer, but they can be “filtered” if you will. The dream catcher is used to filter good dreams from the bad ones. It was common belief that a good dream knew how to navigate the complex web of the dream catcher while the nightmares or negative dreams would get caught up in the web.
When the negative dreams had been captured in the web of the dreamcatcher, they would vanish or evaporate upon the rising of the sun. Whether they work or not is up for speculation and depends on your beliefs, regardless, they’re gorgeous to look at.
Dreamcatcher Step by Step Tutorial
If one was to build his own dream catcher the process would be extraordinarily simple, it can be all broken down into three simple steps and be scaled as needed.
The graphic illustration below showcases the exact steps that one should follow for this spectacular craft.
Photo Courtesy to Homesthetics Magazine
Follow the procedure above to realize one miniature dream catcher project and once you`ve mastered it you can proceed to personalize this craft to great extent; you can use multiple loops or thinner string for a more complex web. Get creative and tailor a dream catcher like no other.
Dreamcatchers Design Examples
Vivid Colors
While Native Americans didn’t have access to as many crafts and materials like we did today, they made use of natural dyes which could be obtained from plants. To obtain a vivid red of this color, they might smash some red berries and soak the materials in the resulting mush till the desired color was obtained.
Leather
Native Americans were “recyclers” way before the term became popular; ever keen to make use of every part of a killed animal, no animal was wasted. Leather was easily sourced, although complex and time consuming to make.
Beads
Beads could be made from bones and stones of soft materials. It wasn’t uncommon to find beads or bones made from turquoise or even animal tusks and teeth. While some people would be repulsed by the use of these items, the Native Americans often seen these items in a symbolic manner. In fact, certain powers could be obtained upon the use of these items.
Feathers
Feathers were readily available and common in not just dreamcatchers, but headdresses too.
Antlers and Bones
While the hoop of the dream catcher is held in high regard for its “filtering” abilities, a perfect circle isn’t essential for a dream catcher to work.
Owl Dreamcatcher
This dreamcatcher is actually a collection of three dreamcatchers united by yarn like material. The owl was commonly seen as wise by the Native Americans, so it seems fitting to be used here.
Modern Dreamcatchers
The modern dreamcatcher is popular but very few people actually remember the purpose or lore surrounding the dreamcatcher.
Flexible In Design
A dreamcatcher is easy to make and can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it. Dream-catchers are interesting to say the least and the crafting of such an item with your little one would surely create a wonderful bounding moment between parent and child; colorful, positive and filled with memory, meaning, the dreamcatcher is surely worth your attention as a craft and do it yourself project.

Alright, so from what I've read, dream catchers originate from the Ojibwe people, who are native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. The term "asabikeshiinh" in Ojibwe means "spider," which is significant because the dream catcher is associated with the spider woman, Asibikaashi, who was a protector of the people, especially the children.

According to the legend, as the Ojibwe people expanded their territory, it became harder for Asibikaashi to protect everyone, so the dream catchers were created to serve as a symbolic protection. These were made by the tribal women using willow hoops, sinew, and other natural materials like feathers and beads. The idea is that the dream catcher would hang above the sleeping area, catching bad dreams in its web while allowing good dreams to pass through and gently glide down to the sleeper via the feather.

Another version of the legend comes from the Lakota tribe, where Iktomi, a trickster figure, teaches the value of listening to good ideas and filtering out bad ones, using a spider's web as a metaphor. This aligns with the concept of dream catchers filtering dreams.

It's interesting to note that the physical structure of the dream catcher is symbolic. The circular shape represents the cycle of life, and the web within the hoop is reminiscent of a spider's web, which traps unwanted elements. The number of points where the web connects to the hoop can have different meanings, such as representing the phases of the moon or the legs of the spider woman.

Now, regarding cultural appropriation, it seems that dream catchers have become popular beyond Native American cultures, often appearing in commercial settings and being mass-produced without regard for their original significance. This raises concerns about cultural sensitivity and respect.

Cultural appropriation occurs when elements of one culture are adopted by another culture in a way that is disrespectful or exploitative, often without understanding or acknowledging the original culture's beliefs and practices. In the case of dream catchers, using them purely as decorative items without recognizing their spiritual and protective meanings could be seen as appropriation.

On the other hand, cultural appreciation involves learning about and respecting another culture's practices and symbols. If someone learns about the history and significance of dream catchers and uses them in a way that honors the original culture, it can be seen as appreciation rather than appropriation.

Given this, it's important to approach the use of dream catchers with awareness and respect. Buying authentic dream catchers made by Native American artisans and understanding their symbolic meaning would be a way to appreciate the culture. Conversely, purchasing mass-produced, cheap versions without any knowledge or regard for their origin could be considered appropriative.

In conclusion, whether using dream catchers is cultural appropriation depends on the intent and understanding behind their use. If one takes the time to learn about and respect the culture from which they originate, it can be a positive way to connect with and honor that culture.

\boxed{\text{Using dream catchers can be cultural appropriation if not done with understanding and respect, but can be cultural appreciation when approached thoughtfully.}}
