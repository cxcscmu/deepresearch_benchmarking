Alright, so I've got this question: "Which action contributed to the Southern belief that their economy was threatened?" Now, I'm not entirely sure about the historical context here, but I think it has something to do with the United States around the time of the Civil War. I remember that the North and the South had different economic systems, with the South being more agricultural and reliant on slavery, and the North being more industrialized.

I need to figure out what specific action made the Southerners feel like their economy was in danger. Maybe it was something to do with trade regulations, or perhaps it was related to taxes on imported goods. Wait, I think I recall something about tariffs. Yeah, tariffs might be it.

Let me think about tariffs. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, right? So, if the federal government imposed higher tariffs, that could affect the Southern economy because they relied on importing things like manufactured goods from Europe, especially Britain, since they didn't have as much industry themselves.

I think there was a specific tariff that the South objected to. Was it the Tariff of Abominations? I think that was in 1828, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to the belief about their economy being threatened leading up to the Civil War.

Maybe I should look into what events happened in the years leading up to the Civil War that could have made the South feel economically threatened. One thing that comes to mind is the abolitionist movement gaining strength in the North. Slavery was a big part of the Southern economy, so any threats to slavery would threaten their economy.

But the question is asking about a specific action. Was it the passage of the Missouri Compromise? No, that was in 1820. Too early, perhaps.

Let's see, another thing was the Fugitive Slave Act. Was that something that threatened their economy? Well, it required people in free states to help capture runaway slaves, but I'm not sure if that directly threatened their economy.

Maybe it was the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. He was from the Republican Party, which had a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories. The South might have seen this as a threat because if slavery couldn't expand, their economic system might stagnate.

But was that the only action? It seems like there were a series of events that led to the South feeling threatened. Perhaps it was the一系列的 actions by the North to limit the expansion of slavery.

Wait, maybe it was the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. That allowed settlers in those territories to decide for themselves whether to allow slavery, which went against the earlier agreement in the Missouri Compromise.

But actually, that might have been seen as favorable to the South because it had the potential to expand slavery into those territories. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it was the Dred Scott decision in 1857, where the Supreme Court ruled that Congress couldn't ban slavery in the territories. That might have been seen as protecting slavery, not threatening it.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe it wasn't a specific action but a series of actions by the North that made the South feel their economy was threatened.

For example, the North was becoming more industrialized and less dependent on slavery. They might have pushed for policies that would make the South's economy less competitive. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps it was the attempts to restrict or eliminate slavery altogether. Since slavery was such a integral part of the Southern economy, any threat to slavery was a threat to their economy.

But I need to pinpoint a specific action. Maybe it was the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. Wait, that was during the Civil War, so probably not the answer they're looking for.

Let me try searching for this.

Let's look at why the third one is true and the others are false. Cotton grows in warm climates and, even today, most of the world's cotton is grown in the United States. As stated at cotton.org (cited below), "The major cotton-producing states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, Florida, Kansas and Virginia." The first one is false because the Northern banking industry was heavily reliant on cotton and because the New England textile mills wove cotton into cloth that was sold throughout Europe. The second one is false because the invention of the cotton gin actually offered Southern plantation owners an incentive to expand their plantations, which, in turn, meant an even greater need for slaves. Finally, the fourth one is false because a federal law was passed in 1807 that prohibited new slaves from being imported and sold in America.

1) Southerners complained that their economy was crippled by the E mbargo Acts Tariff of 1828. The “Tariff Act of 1828”, also called the “Tariff of Abominations” by Southern states since they saw this act as a menace to their economy. With the passing of this act, the south had to pay higher prices for the goods they did not manufacture and at the same time they had problems to sell their good (cotton) to their main buyer, Great Britain.
2) The South Carolina politician that became known as the “Father of Nullification” was “ John C. Calhoun ”. John C. Calhoun was a Southern politician that strongly disagreed with the tariff act of 1828 and advocated for its nullification. At the time of the passing of the act John C. Calhoun was the US vice president.
3) The Nullification Crisis ended when the “ Congress ” passed a bill to “ reduce ” the tariff. In 1833 the congress passed the “Compromise Tariff of 1833” and this ended the Nullification Crisis as South Carolina accepted the act.

CIVIL WAR, ECONOMIC IMPACT OF (ISSUE)
The economic consequences of the American Civil War (1861 – 1865) are largely due to Northern control of the federal government during and for several decades after the War. During the sectional debates over the tariff and the expansion of slavery that characterized the thirty years before the War, the North had been forced to forgo or compromise several of its national economic policy objectives because of Southern opposition and the strong position the Southern states held in the Senate. As soon as the Southern states seceded and the legislators resigned their seats in Congress, the legislators from the North and West began enacting this delayed agenda, while simultaneously prosecuting the War. Northern victory in the War insured their continuing control of the federal government and implementation of their economic policies.
There were four pieces of legislation that passed during the Civil War which were critical to Northern economic development during the decades after the War. The Morrill Tariff of 1861 raised rates to 20 percent on average, ending more than thirty years of declining rates. Funding for three transcontinental railroads was enacted in the Transcontinental Railroad Act. The Morrill Land Grant Act (1862) established agricultural and mechanical colleges by allotting each state that remained in the Union 30,000 Acres of land for each member of Congress. The National Bank Act of 1863 created a set of standards for the banking system. Finally, the Homestead Act (1862) provided 160 Acres (a quarter section) in western territories free to anyone who settled on it for five years and declared their intention to become a citizen. Each of these
policies profoundly shaped the development of the American economy for the rest of the century.
Another Civil War development with powerful implications for the nation's economy was the wartime devastation visited on the South. The war had been mostly fought in the South and much of its wealth had been destroyed. In South Carolina before the war, for instance, there were 965,000 hogs. After the surrender of the Confederate Army in 1865 at Appomatox, the hog population in South Carolina had dropped to 150,000. Confederate bonds and currency were now worthless, depriving the region of a great proportion of its wealth. Emancipation of the slaves also destroyed a large part of the South's capital, as well as creating the need for a new labor system. (The slaves accounted for the lion's share of capital investment in the South, more expensive than the very land.) The war had destroyed virtually all the banks in the South. There was little capital available to finance reconstruction.
By 1877, when Reconstruction ended with the withdrawal of the Union Army, native white rule returned in every former Confederate state. The South, however, remained largely agricultural, producing staple crops for northern factories or for export. Economic recovery in the South was slow. Cotton did not reach its 1859 level of production until 1879. As cotton production increased, however, the price fell. Tobacco, the other major cash crop in the South, followed a similar pattern. The sharecropping system that replaced slavery had few incentives for soil conservation innovation or the cultivation of new crops. The region remained capital poor and grew slowly in population. In 1860 the population of the slave slates was 1l,133,361 compared to 12,288,020 in 1870, an increase of only about 10 percent, compared with a 29 percent increase for the rest of the country.
The South failed to attract many immigrants after the War because of limited economic opportunities. Its reliance on staple crop agriculture and slowly growing population did not create demand for expanded infrastructure, one of the factors driving the rapid expansion of the national economy outside the former Confederate states. For at least two generations after the Civil War the South remained predominantly agricultural and largely outside the industrial expansion of the national economy.
The Compromise of 1877 which ended Reconstruction solidified Northern control of Congress. This control led to ever higher tariffs, reaching an average of 57 percent with the Dingle Tariff of 1897, and a continuation of government subsidies for railroad expansion. Behind the protective wall of these tariffs U.S. industry grew and agriculture expanded ever westward to feed the growing populations of the industrial cities. Northern and Midwestern populations grew much faster than that of the South and the expansion of the nation's railroad system tied the two regions ever more closely together. A large part of the industrial expansion of the immediate post Civil War years was based on connecting the industrial northeast with the farm and grazing area of the Midwest and plains states and completing the transcontinental railroads. Railroad mileage in the U.S. doubled between 1865 and 1873 and increased by an additional 50 percent between 1873 and 1881. Freight carried increased from 2.16 billion ton/miles in 1865 to 7.48 in 1873 and 16.06 in 1881. The iron and steel industry was one direct beneficiary of the expansion of the railroad system. Steel production increased from 19,643 long tons in 1867 to 198,796 in 1873 and 1,588,314 in 1881. The expansion of steel led to comparable increases in mining and other basic industries.
The North and Midwest attracted growing numbers of immigrants, drawn by the promise of economic opportunity and inexpensive land. The growing population spurred construction of housing and infrastructure, which in turn attracted more immigrants in a circular process that continued until the Panic of 1893, which slowed the economy. The economy after the Civil War was initially driven by the construction of railroads connecting the industrial communities of the northeast and the agricultural regions of the Midwest and plains. In 1886, the railroads standardized the gauge (width) of the track, bringing the South into a national railway system. As it matured the industrial area expanded to include communities in the Midwest with an expansion of agricultural regions further west. The economy that developed after the Civil War was still sharply divided regionally along the same lines as the antebellum economy had been.

What Happened to the Southern Economy After the Civil War?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 26, 2020
MPI/Archive Photos/Getty Images
The Southern economy remained mostly agricultural after the Civil War, but it struggled greatly with the labor transition from slave to paid labor. Additionally, many men had left for a number of years to fight for the Confederacy, and many plantations and farms were in poor shape, unable to yield much in the way of crops. Additionally, the war had damaged much of the South’s vital infrastructure, which only increased its economic burden.
Former slaves were now able to make more decisions for themselves, and although many were obligated to remain on a plantation to earn a living, many others decided to work elsewhere, which caused a shortage of cheap labor. Black women sometimes decided to focus more on domestic duties and raising a family, while black children now had the option of going to school rather than working.
White yeoman were hit very hard during the economic downturn after the Civil War. Many sold what they could of their land and started working for larger plantations. Shops in town started selling goods on lines of credit to such workers, resulting in a debt cycle that overwhelmed many every year. These problems were only aggravated by widespread cotton crop failures in the years following the war.
During the war, the Confederacy had printed nearly $800 million in its currency, and the resulting massive inflation depleted the savings of many Southern families.

Alright, so I've got some information here from my searches. Let's try to piece this together.

First, I have a question: "Which action contributed to the Southern belief that their economy was threatened?" Now, from what I understand, the South was heavily dependent on agriculture, particularly cotton, and they used slave labor for this. So, anything that threatened slavery or their agricultural economy would be a concern for them.

Looking at the search results, one of the documents mentions the Tariff of 1828, also known as the "Tariff of Abominations," which the South strongly opposed because they believed it hurt their economy by increasing the cost of imported goods. So, maybe that's one action.

But then, there's also the issue of slavery. Any moves to限制 or abolish slavery would threaten the South's economy because slavery was integral to their agricultural system. So, actions like the Missouri Compromise, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Dred Scott decision, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, who was against the expansion of slavery, all could have contributed to the South's belief that their economy was threatened.

Additionally, there was the Nullification Crisis in the early 1830s, which was a direct response to high tariffs that the South deemed unfavorable to their economy. So, that's another instance where the South felt their economic interests were being threatened.

From the encyclopedia entry, it talks about how the North controlled the federal government after the Civil War and enacted policies like the Morrill Tariff, the Transcontinental Railroad Act, the Morrill Land Grant Act, the National Bank Act, and the Homestead Act. These policies favored the North and West more than the South, which may have further marginalized the Southern economy in the long run.

But the question is about actions that contributed to the Southern belief that their economy was threatened before the Civil War, I think. Because after the war, the South was already defeated and under Reconstruction.

So, focusing on pre-Civil War actions, I'd say the Tariff of 1828, the Nullification Crisis, and policies or political movements against slavery would be key factors.

Looking back at the multiple-choice options from one of the search results:

a. The founding of the Republican party

b. The finalization of the Missouri Compromise

c. The support of popular sovereignty in territories

d. The approval of protective tariffs on manufactured goods

I need to think about which of these would most directly threaten the Southern economy.

The founding of the Republican Party: The Republicans were against the expansion of slavery into new territories, which could threaten the South's economic power if slavery couldn't spread.

The Missouri Compromise: This was an agreement that allowed Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state and Maine as a free state, maintaining a balance in Congress. It might not directly threaten their economy unless they saw it as a precedent limiting slavery's expansion.

Popular sovereignty: This allowed residents of territories to decide for themselves whether to allow slavery. The South might see this as a threat because it wasn't guaranteed that slavery would be allowed.

Protective tariffs on manufactured goods: This would benefit Northern industries but potentially harm the South by increasing the cost of imported goods.

So, all of these could be seen as threats by the South, but I need to pick one that most directly contributed to their belief that their economy was threatened.

Given that, I think the approval of protective tariffs on manufactured goods would be the most direct threat, as it increases the cost of goods the South relies on, potentially reducing their purchasing power and harming their economy.

But wait, the Tariff of 1828 was a specific instance of this, and it led to the Nullification Crisis, where South Carolina threatened to secede over the issue of tariffs.

However, in the context of the question, which seems to be from a test or homework, the answer might be the approval of protective tariffs on manufactured goods.

But to be thorough, I should consider that actions against slavery were also major threats to the Southern economy.

For example, the Republican Party's platform against the expansion of slavery could be seen as a threat because it limits the potential growth of the Southern economy.

Similarly, popular sovereignty could be seen as a threat because it doesn't guarantee the extension of slavery into new territories.

But protective tariffs are more directly economic, affecting the cost of goods.

Perhaps the best answer is d. The approval of protective tariffs on manufactured goods.

But I should check if there's more information to support this.

In another search result, it mentions that Southerners complained that their economy was crippled by the Embargo Acts, the Tariff of 1828, the Tariff of 1832, and the Alien & Sedition Acts.

Wait, the Alien & Sedition Acts were from 1798, so that seems out of place here.

This suggests that tariffs were a persistent issue for the South.

Another document discusses the Nullification Crisis and how it was resolved by reducing the tariff.

So, clearly, tariffs were a significant point of contention for the South.

Moreover, the encyclopedia entry mentions that after the Civil War, the North enacted higher tariffs, which may have further impacted the South's economy, but the question seems to be about pre-Civil War actions.

Given all this, I think the approval of protective tariffs on manufactured goods is the most direct action that contributed to the Southern belief that their economy was threatened.

Therefore, my final answer is \boxed{d}

**Final Answer**

\boxed{d}
