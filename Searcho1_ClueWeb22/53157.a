Alright, so I've got this question: "How long has gender inequality existed?" Hmm, that's a big one. Gender inequality—it's something that's been talked about a lot lately, but I'm not sure exactly how far back it goes. I mean, is it something that has been around for as long as humans have existed, or is it a more recent development? I need to think about this carefully.

First off, what even is gender inequality? It's when different genders are not treated equally, right? That could mean in opportunities, rights, pay—all sorts of things. So, it's not just about one aspect of life but across many domains. And it's not just about men and women; nowadays, we recognize a spectrum of genders, but I guess historically, it's mostly been about men and women.

Now, to figure out how long it's been around, I probably need to look back at human history. Let's see, human history goes way back, right? Like, millions of years. But I don't think gender inequality has been around for that entire time. I mean, in prehistoric times, before societies were formed, were there gender inequalities? I'm not sure.

Maybe I should start by thinking about early human societies. I recall something about hunter-gatherer societies being more egalitarian. That means men and women had more equal roles and statuses. In those societies, women gathered plants and cared for children, while men hunted. But both roles were valuable, and there wasn't a power imbalance. At least, that's what I think I remember from an anthropology class.

But then, as societies evolved into agrarian societies, things might have changed. When people started farming and settling down, property ownership became important. Maybe that's when inequalities started to emerge. I seem to recall something about patriarchy arising in agrarian societies, where men held more power and owned land.

Wait, maybe I should look up some information about the history of gender roles. Maybe that will help me understand when inequality started.

Since the beginning of human history there has been inequality between the sexes. Even though scientifically there is no assigned roles in both genders, humans have created the expectations of a perfect male and female. Throughout American history we have been able to conquer the boundaries of science, and mess with the balance of nature. You’d think that a country that thrives in science, would acknowledge the fact that your gender doesn’t determine who you should be, but we do. Most of the social
Gender inequality, from its very name, implies an uneven treatment based on ones gender. Essentially, gender inequality is theprejudice that one gender, usually the female, is secondary and subordinate to the more capable and hence superior male gender.Many societies practice gender inequality, with the men reinforcing it and the women passively receiving it, because it is consideredpart of an enduring patriarchal culture. Deviating from this norm means that one runs the risk of being branded a weak
Gender inequality is a grave issue throughout the history of time. However, black women have gotten the shorter end of the stick, and Marita Bonner addresses this issue in her essay, “On Being Young – a Woman – and Colored.” Bonner believes that time will heal the disjunction between men and women, and more specifically the ignorance of black women’s presence in society. This essay proves that Bonner’s solution – allow time to heal – is pragmatic and history proves that it worked.

Gender inequality is not only the matter of a special country or place instead it has always been a global issue for people. Men and women are almost equal in the total universe but still women are not given equal status with men and this unequal gender role in nationalization process operates in every country. Since the beginning women have faced disrespect, domestic cruelty, sense of deficiency, are subjugate to behave like a servant etc. Time is passing but in all the ages women are assumed to face some issues because it has become the universal notion that they are supposed to serve men. Though our religious beliefs make women a goddess but we fail to distinguish her as a human being first, we worship goddesses but we exploit girls. Ideally it is being said that they achieve equal position like men in our society but it is sad to say that still they are facing though several types of differentiation in domestic and professional lives. Like men-folk, women must have equal roles to perform for the development of the society.
History of Gender Inequality
Gender inequality is a situation in which women and men are not equal. Gender inequality refers to health, education, economic and political inequalities between men and women in India. Gender inequalities, and its social causes, affect the sex ratio of India, life of women’s health and including also their educational avail and economic status. Gender inequality in India is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike. Although the constitution of India has granted men and women equal rights, but gender distinction still remains. There is specific research on gender differentiation mostly in favour of men over women. The gender inequality and status of women in India has been going through many changes in the past few millenniums. Gender Inequality has been seen in India from the very beginning. There were women of most affected in India and many changes were seen in their status. It is also very difficult to know exactly the status or position of women in different period of times but researchers and grammarians, like katayana and patanjali, have thrown some lights on it from the old scriptures and from other sources. The gender inequalities and status of women and their activities can be divided into three main historical period, the ancient, the medieval and the modern.
In Ancient Period
During the Vedic period and according to the Hindu scriptures, in the ancient time women were given a reputable position. They were considered half part of men or it can be said that men were recognized to be incomplete without them. Men were couldn’t punish their wives and they were called as “Ardhangini”(Half Body) of men. In the early Vedic periods there was no gender differentiation. There is sufficient proof that in the society the women had equal rights with men during the ‘Rig-Vedic’ periods (1500-1000 BC). The Rig Vedic women in India enjoyed high status in society. Their condition was good. There were many women Rishis during this period. Through monogamy was mostly common, the richer section of the society were satisfied in polygamy. There were no Sati system or early marriage. In the “Rig Vedic” verses we also find that women married at the mature age and could choice their husbands. Both boys and girls had “initiation” (Upnayana). Very few girls continued their studies because of hard lives and different penance had to be taken at different stages of their student-lives. Some women argued their hard life and considered themselves worthy of living at home. They activated themselves in cultivating arts and craft and became good housewives. They were known as “Sadyovadhus”.
But among the girls who were studying “God-realization” seriously, some of them were very good in learning methods. They were known as “Brahmavadinis”. In the Vedic literature 27 such “Brahmavadinis” were mentioned, e.g. Gargi, Maitreyi, Visvanara, Lopamudra, Apala, Saswati, etc. women started being discriminated against since the Later Vedic period in education and other rights and facilities. Child marriage, widow burning, the veil system and polygamy further worsened the women’s position.
In Medieval Period
During the medieval period, gender inequality was on high level and woman was given a position subordinate to man. Law and religion did not recognize the equality and equal rights of man and woman. The women’s place was largely presumed as being in the home. In short, the role of women was considered to be one of subservience to her husband, the master and ruler of her family. Child marriage, practices of sati, prohibition of widow marriage were considered in a ritualistic way among the Hindus. The situation of Muslim women among the Muslims was not good either. tradition of veil system among the women started at this period. Among the Rajput women in Rajasthan the “Jauhar’ was practiced to save the respect of women. Among the Hindus polygamy was a part of the lives and among the Muslims polygamy was accepted in the name of religion. In some parts of the country the system of “Devdashi” or “Temple Women” was operated and both the rich people and the “Temple Priests” sexually exploited them. This continued for many decades till the rise of the “Vakti Cult” movement. One of the women leaders of “Vakti Cult” movement was “Mirabai” she was a saint, a poet and a singer. At that time women felt some heave of relief in the orthodox society. In this time “Guru Nanak” tried to spread the messages of equality among men and women of the society. This had a very effective influence on the societies in some parts of India.

Causes and Effects of Gender Inequality Throughout history, countless acts of gender inequality can be identified; the causes of these discriminating accounts can be traced back to different causes. The general morality of the inequity relies on a belief that men are superior to women; because of this idea, women have spent generations suffering under their counterparts. Also, a common expectation is that men tend to be more assertive and absolute because of their biological hormones or instinctive intellect. Another huge origin is sexual discrimination; even in the world today, many women are viewed by men as just sex objects rather than a real human being with standards and morals; due to carnal ideas, some men can also suffer from a gender stereotype. However it may occur, the main causes of gender differences can be traced back to a belief in male dominance, the biological hormones and intelligence of men and women, and sexual themes.  The presumption of male dominance has existed for a lengthy time; in ancient Greece, men ruled the cities while the women had to support the home. Medieval society, much like Greece, was completely dominated by men; according to Sally Smith’s “Women and Power in the Late Medieval English Village: a reconsideration”, “Women carried out the majority of tasks that took place in the medieval house, such as cooking, cleaning and activities associated with child rearing.” During this era, men set a list of laws that prohibited women from marrying without their parent’s consent, owning businesses, owning property unless they were widows, and having part in politics. On the other hand, men had all of these privileges. Women have slowly been able to obtain their rights. In the first half of the twentieth century, there have been few incidents where women got to assume the same roles as men; for example, during World War I, the men of the world went off to war

Alright, so I've got some information here from these documents. Let's see what they say about when gender inequality started.

From Doc 1, it mentions that gender inequality has been a focus for many centuries, and that even in the 19th century, there were efforts to remove female employment in industries. It also talks about the gender pay gap and how it's been a debated issue for many years.

Doc 2 has a direct question: "When did gender inequality start?" and it says, "1900s." But that seems too recent. I think gender inequality goes back further than that.

Wait, Doc 2 also mentions that historically, gender roles have been attributed to biological differences between men and women, and that this idea has been constructed through history. It points out that the concept of gender roles is based on certain stereotypes that have been constructed over time.

Doc 3 talks about the history of gender inequality in India, dividing it into ancient, medieval, and modern periods. It says that in ancient times, during the Vedic period, women had a respectable position, but in the later Vedic period, they started facing discrimination.

So, in ancient India, women had a higher status, but over time, their position deteriorated. That suggests that gender inequality developed over time in that society.

Doc 4 discusses causes of gender inequality, mentioning beliefs in male dominance, biological differences, and sexual discrimination. It also references historical periods like ancient Greece and medieval times, where men held more power and women had restricted rights.

Doc 5 seems to be a student essay about gender roles and inequality, but it doesn't provide much historical context.

So, from these documents, it seems that gender inequality has been present for a long time, at least since ancient civilizations like Greece and India. But I'm still not sure exactly how far back it goes.

Maybe I need to look into prehistoric times to get a better understanding. Were there gender inequalities in hunter-gatherer societies?

I recall that in hunter-gatherer societies, there was a division of labor based on gender—men hunting and women gathering. But according to some anthropologists, both roles were valued equally, and there wasn't a power imbalance.

Perhaps gender inequality developed with the advent of agriculture and the rise of private property. When societies became more settled and resources were owned by individuals or families, maybe that's when men started to hold more power.

I think I should look for more information on how gender roles evolved with the development of human societies.

Let me try another search.

This essay will examine whether or not in this modern day society their still remain gender inequalities through the use of relevant theories this essay is determined to establish whether these inequalities still exist in employment by exploring social, biological and cultural explanations and differences between men and women. Why women are more likely to be discriminated and oppressed and how I can use this awareness to challenge and address gender inequalities in employment.

Since the beginning of human history there has been inequality between the sexes. Even though scientifically there is no assigned roles in both genders, humans have created the expectations of a perfect male and female. Throughout American history we have been able to conquer the boundaries of science, and mess with the balance of nature. You’d think that a country that thrives in science, would acknowledge the fact that your gender doesn’t determine who you should be, but we do. Most of the social
Gender inequality, from its very name, implies an uneven treatment based on ones gender. Essentially, gender inequality is theprejudice that one gender, usually the female, is secondary and subordinate to the more capable and hence superior male gender.Many societies practice gender inequality, with the men reinforcing it and the women passively receiving it, because it is consideredpart of an enduring patriarchal culture. Deviating from this norm means that one runs the risk of being branded a weak
Gender inequality is a grave issue throughout the history of time. However, black women have gotten the shorter end of the stick, and Marita Bonner addresses this issue in her essay, “On Being Young – a Woman – and Colored.” Bonner believes that time will heal the disjunction between men and women, and more specifically the ignorance of black women’s presence in society. This essay proves that Bonner’s solution – allow time to heal – is pragmatic and history proves that it worked.

Gender Equality : Awareness To Gender Inequality
awareness to gender inequality is a very paramount issue, especially on the topic of jobs. Back then, a woman would do the same job and put as much work into it as a man, but they would still earn less money. Additionally, until many people realized the issue of gender inequality, nothing has changed. When analyzing the evidence of how starting to bring awareness to social inequities and raise awareness at a local level can turn global and change the world, one can realize the history of the discrimination
Example Of Irreversible Inequality
Irreversible Inequality
	In this paper I will be explaining why social inequality is irreversible. A large part of this is due to social structure (forces outside our control), agency (our choices), and structuration (the way the previous two work together to shape our lives). This aspect of social inequality will be dove into deeper in the next paragraph, discussing how it shapes our views of societal norms. Next, I will discuss social inequality specifically in race and gender and how it will not

Gender inequality remains a major barrier between humans. Women have made major strides in promoting equality as a whole, but have a long way to go. Gender roles are a set of societal norms dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their actual or perceived sex or sexuality. The concept of gender roles is based on certain male and female stereotypes, which has been constructed through history. In American society, the

Gender inequality began far back in history.  Even for the cave men, duties were often divided by gender.  Orginally, this idea was likely because the woman needed to produce children and to care for those children.  Eventually, this led to the idea that women were not as capable of other jobs or duties.  Women were treated as fragile beings that needed protection.  At one point in time, women could not work.  There was no job considered suitable for a respectable woman other than being a wife and mother.  Eventually, societal ideals would change and women would begin to seek equality.  Some religions do support the ideal of gender inequality.  Some religions do not believe that a woman should be a church leader.  Other religions believe that a woman should remain covered or wear special clothing.  Obviously, the dominant religion of a society will effects its culture.  It is difficult to say if religion or society at large is more responsible for gender inequality.  While there are biological differences that support some of these ideas, many societies now believe that women are just as capable as men.

The Origins of Gender Inequality
February 2, 2021 admin 5 Comments
Photo by Tim Mossholder on Unsplash
One of the first things I remember learning when I began my studies in English literature was the difference between sex and gender – two concepts that are often intertwined. Sex is purely biological – the two sexes are separated primarily by their physiology and evolutionary functions (no one sex is greater than the other, they are simply different). Gender, on the other hand, is a purely social construct – it is the association of certain character traits with each sex. While the female (sex) differs from the male in terms of biology, women (gender) and men are perceived to be completely different in personality, lifestyle, tastes, codes of conduct, interests, etc. – essentially every aspect of civilised society.
So where did gender come from? And how did it evolve into the distinct, internalised, gender-based inequalities we see today?
There are several theories aimed at understanding sex-based gender roles and the power dynamics that have developed with them. Although the origin of gender itself is still debated, an early theory of evolutionary psychology attributed the evolution of gender (and gender inequality) to sex-related behaviours and psychological dispositions. Since early human males had to compete for a female, they evolved to become more aggressive and dominant – females favoured more protective males, and this allowed them to become more dependent and risk-averse. These traits were passed down genetically and thus resulted in the (generally) polarised character traits between men and women, and the power structures that developed from there.
This theory was widely discredited, as it clearly serves to legitimise gender inequality (the ‘weaker’ sex and other such nonsense). Furthermore, it does not take into account other important factors such as varied environments, sex ratios, pathogen pressure, resource availability and cultural contexts that played a pivotal role in shaping the power dynamics between the two sexes.
The biosocial model, on the other hand, explains gender as a product of sex-based division of labour. As humans became more and more civilised, sex-based limitations played a large part in the division of labour between males and females. Females are naturally more involved during the early stages of child rearing (from pregnancy to breastfeeding, child care, etc.). Because of this, females taking care of children were unable to take on labour that involved being away from their progeny. The more children a female had, the less time she had for tasks that did not involve them.
This meant that males became more proficient in skills that involved venturing out of the domestic circle. However, this division of labour does not outwardly appear to be the root cause of gender inequality – here, the roles each sex plays are different, but both are equally important. The work in itself does not justify the dominance of one gender over the other. In fact, there is evidence of several hunter-gatherer societies that possessed relatively egalitarian gender dynamics while following such sex-based division of labour.
So what was it that planted the seed of inequality that would grow to become the normalised social framework we conform to today?
The answer: money.
Domestic tasks have no monetary value in a civilised world, whereas venturing out of the home presents many opportunities for the same. And since men were the ones who were moving outwards, they ended up making money. With money came power, status and most importantly, control.
A new paradigm was created – one that would withstand thousands of years of human history.
Now, this dynamic has percolated so deeply into our society that gender is indoctrinated right from a child’s birth (all those gender reveal parties we keep seeing on social media are a strong example of this). Clothes also play an important role in reinforcing gender – women’s clothes favour appearance over practicality, while menswear leans towards utility. (This is why the women of the first wave of feminism discarded their ‘feminine’ garb for a more ‘masculine’ appearance – they were using clothes to empower them to have more opportunity.)
However, it is important to note that gender dynamics are by nature, dynamic. While patriarchy has been the norm around most of the world for thousands of years, the framework of this power structure has in fact been evolving. A study conducted a few decades ago showed that men on an average valued a woman’s physical appearance above anything else, while women valued financial status, with appearance being secondary – as a result, women were groomed to focus only on their appearance while men focused on financial and social gain. However, a study conducted more recently in USA, China and Brazil all revealed financial prospects to be the most important thing for both sexes – men no longer attached as much value to domestic skills or virginity.
When it comes to gender inequality, we seem to be in a rare situation wherein the problem is also the solution – money created an imbalance, and money can restore it. With women possessing the same opportunities and earning the same income as men, they immediately gain more status, which leads to more power, which gives women the agency to possess freedom of choice – choice of lifestyle, preferences, careers, interests, and everything else. If women are capable of existing completely independently, the need to conform to gendered roles shatters – and we experience a paradigm shift.
You can see why the Patriarchy is doing everything within its power to stop this from happening.
In patriarchal propaganda, women are seen as an antithesis to men; if women are empowered that means men must become subordinates (the mere suggestion is enough to incite violence). The Patriarchy will have us believe in an ‘us or them’ world – one sex must dominate the other. That is not true. Gender equality is not a threat to men – it simply allows women to have the same basic rights and opportunities as men. The only thing it threatens is a system designed to oppress half of its population.
When gender equality becomes a reality, it will be the end of the Patriarchy – and I can only hope that I live to see that day.

Sherry Ortner argues that women are second class citizens in every society. Now some of her ways to explain exactly how are problematic, but I assume this is what you are getting at. We should also qualify this discussion with the point that some societies have third genders so it isn't always just men and women. But in general it is fair to say that in every society we know of men tend to have more power, access, and voice than other genders. This doesn't mean there aren't cases where there are powerful women such as queens - just that they aren't the norm nor are average women as powerful as average men.
Ortner's argument is that through shared experiences women in all societies have become associated with aspects of nature and biology that aren't controlled while men became associated with aspects of culture, which controls nature. It sounds odd at first, but it does make some sense. Basically, there is the biological reality that females give birth. This is dangerous, takes a ton of resources, and then the woman is burdened with caring for the child until it is old enough to out on its own. While pregnant and while breastfeeding she is not only vulnerable but the baby is vulnerable. This means she needs to be protected and therefore is less likely to go out hunting or engaging in other dangerous activities. In small scale societies they cannot afford for some women to forgo pregnancy so all women are expected to reproduce and are valuable to the community's survival for the reproductive capabilities. But this means they become bound to the homestead so while we do have a few examples of hunter-gatherers where women engage in hunting (such as the Aka) it is rare and usually less dangerous. Men, then, were free to not only hunt but engage in war, negotiate with nearby communities, go exploring, develop dangerous technologies like metal smithing, politics, and other cultural achievements.
So Ortner argues that men became associated with the ability to control and overcome nature (culture) while women were still directly linked to reproduction (nature.) I kind of don't buy that last part, but if you've ever read any feminist pieces hopefully you've read Simone de Beauvoir who also argues that the danger, vulnerability, and later burden of babies put women into a category of needing to be protected rather than as protectors. Men were free to engage in dangerous activities that did allow them to gain social and political power while women had a much harder time doing this. Later, when societies were big and complex enough to allow some women the freedom to not reproduce we do see some female warriors, politicians, and celibate women appear. But because there were so many generations of that not being the case they were still the minorities.
Ortner also argues that control of sexuality for women plays into this development of society. She argues that the concern over female virginity comes from the development of property and inheritance. If all kinds of important issues about politics, power, and resources hinge on inheritance then it becomes important to ensure the right person inherits. When that is linked to lineages and kinship, it becomes important to make sure that the child is truly that of the parents. Because of aforementioned arguments, she says that men are the ones in power so societies become patrilineal. Prior to the invention of DNA testing, the only way to know for sure who was the father was to control the sexuality of the mother. So women get locked away, limited in their abilities to enter the public sphere, and socially controlled in a variety of ways. This monitoring is done by society and self in order to ensure that her only partner could be her husband and therefore their child is the correct heir.
Ortner's arguments certainly have flaws. But they are compelling. If you want to read more I suggest:

I think it is interesting to note that there is a severe upswing in gender inequality with a transition from hunter-gathering to sedentary life.
Women in hunter-gathering groups are not bound to the necessity of high reproductive productivity (the ladies don't need to make a lot of babies). This is because child rearing is more intensive given the resources available to mothers, so most mothers space out births by a few years, and only have a few offspring. Adoption is also quite common.
Compounding this, a majority of food comes from women's gathering. Hunting supplies vital nutrition for long term health, but makes up a smaller portion of the diet than gathered foods. Especially with trade, kinship ties, etc, it becomes (although perhaps not as comfortable) entirely possible for a woman to live on her own if need be. The lack of a clear "bread winner" means that in the event of abuse or some other malady, a woman has the option to get out of her marriage.
A number of the issues firedrops mentions are really only prevalent among sedentary peoples. For example, inheritance of great amounts of power, wealth, etc. is nonexistant in tribal society, as most leadership is temporary or informal. Or, for the same reason, men can't be successful politicians because there is no need for them.
In summary, while it could maybe be argued that men have a little more control over women among hunter-gatherers, it's proportionally much smaller because women have more reproductive and economic freedom.
TL;DR: The origin of farming is heavily correlated to the roots of inequality.

Why do we need a more complicated theory than testosterone? Higher T levels = more desire to dominate. Even in a purely male group the higher T ones end up dominating the others, because they desire so and have the drive to.

I know that with our earliest ancestors (primates, australiopithetcus, neanderthals, homo etc.) all females share one common trait: their mammory glands worked.
Seriously. The fact is that to grow a population, you must have children. Humans have children underdeveloped to make birthing easier. The birthing is easier but there is a negative side effect: One has to take care of that child for much longer than other species.
Men's boobs don't work. They do not produce milk and therefore cannot provide any nourishment for the children. This means that women across the board were the ones that had to stay at home and feed the children with the exception of being able to leave for a small amount of time to gather flora and water. They could not leave for days to hunt, or trade, or fight. Men had to do these jobs because (due, again, to their lack of working mammory glands) they could leave and not come back for an extended amount of time. These responsibilities eventually led to politics. Trading and war agreements went to those who hunted and fought. There are some exceptions, but not many.
Women were very important in many societies, however the gender that was granted what we would consider 'power' today was the one who was not physically attached to the hut.

I like this definition of power because it draws to mind the notion of something attainable outside of family and how interesting that power is only attainable to men seeing as po not real.  Really, what is outside 'home' anyway?  A net of ideas?  A maze of ventures filled with hidden contracts?  Another home?  World power, I suppose.  A shame it will never feed kids.

Hopefully my post can be viewed as complementary to the nice viewpoint provided by firedrops. I don't think anything I say is mutually exclusive and firedrops' post is useful in looking at how we got where we are. My post will address why we may have problems getting out of this rut.
I think men and women tend to be good at different, complementary things. Both of these sets are important in assuring high-quality human existence, big picture or small picture. If we simplify this EXTREMELY by boiling down to two traits so it's manageable, we'll call those enriched traits assertiveness (men) and empathy (women). So we'll assume that everyone is equal but men tend to be a bit more assertive & women tend to be a a bit more empathetic. When the scales of population and time are massive, these minor differences can be amplified as manifested in culture, our non-DNA heritable element. This amplification relates to the anti-woman effects of agriculture & heritability as seen in other posts here.
The nature of reality is that one of these traits trumps the other: the opportunism inherent to cause/effect dictates that assertiveness will overcome empathy in almost every case. Even if one can appreciate this, what can be done about it? The shoulder-padded powersuit feminism of the '80s pushed women to become as assertive as men tend to be, which is sad and costly in that it is actually a concession and/or surrender in the "can't beat 'em join 'em" fashion and comes at the cost of empathy.
I am not sure that modern feminism is really pushing in a more sensible direction based on the framework I've proposed. But that's the crux: pushing necessarily demands assertiveness. The whole idea of empowering women is ultimately silly to me because this goal is framed from the same power system that favors men. It's not unexpected that we think in terms of that power system: essentially, it is derived directly from the natural world and the mechanics of evolution. But in an enlightened state brought about by culture, we can start to appreciate our ability to transcend our heritage under ruthless "natural law". So instead of "empowering women" I think it could be "de-oppressing women" or perhaps even "empathizing men".
This brings me back to my hilarious realization years ago that the masculism movement that I expected to work in a way complementary to feminism turned out instead to be near synonymous with the idiotic "men's rights" sob story of the privileged. The work to solve the problem of discrimination against and oppression of women is not to be done by women, as has become the sadly presumed message of today's (and history's?) feminism - the work is for everyone. The solution is to reshape society so that the qualities that women bring to the table are valued instead of being disregarded while men keep being just as male as possible and women act more like assholes (i.e. less empathetic & more assertive) simply to keep up. Unfortunately, such a movement is handicapped to a point of hopelessness since it is handily written off as hippie nonsense when confronted by the "might makes right" attitudes it is trying to ameliorate, especially since those attitudes are rewarded in so many present scenarios.

I will say that feminist anthropology theory would probably agree with the idea that empowering women through the same hegemonic systems that created gender inequality in the first place is counter productive. Women should not have to behave like men in order to be valued. That sends the message that being less than male in behavior/dress/comportment is negative as well as tightly constructing everyone's gender roles into a very narrow way of being. Men should be able to be just as free to choose ways of being as women. In other words, we should lessen the constraints of gender roles - not lump everyone into an even more tightly bound unified one!
In this sense, when "empowering women" is used the idea is to give them tools like education and financial independence that allow them to pave their own paths. It recognizes that a single NGO isn't going to change the system from the top down. But we do have evidence that educated women with the ability to access resources to provide financially for themselves can often lead to better conditions for women and greater respect for them as well. For example, we think education and access to financial opportunities make a big difference reducing so called bride burnings in India. The hope is that over generations by giving minority groups of all kinds the tools they need to access those realms of power they can then shape them from within. In other words, instead of taking the view that we can go into a society, tear down their system, and rebuild one successfully (which almost never works out well) the approach has been to provide the tools and suggest pathways for an internal cultural revolution. (Edit: I should add that there is of course, as you say, a need to change the system. A bottom up approach is not always effective and can take a very long period of time before change occurs. Larger structural changes need to occur so that mobility is possible and gender is eliminated as a way of evaluating whether someone is well suited to a particular social role. The end goal should be a society where a female CEO or a stay at home father are evaluated only on whether they are a good CEO or parent - not whether they are a good man or woman by taking on that role.)
The masculism movement you point out also led to some pretty counter productive things for men aside from the men's rights stuff. The idealization of nearly impossible body types, contradictory behaviors, and promised but not necessarily attainable social positions have limited rather than empowered men. And led to anger, frustration, and dissatisfaction. You might find the documentary Tough Guise interesting for that point.

Leonard Schlain argues that gender inequality originates in the evolution of written language and consequent religious, social, and economic enterprises.
The decline of feminine values and nature worship are directly linked to the advent of male dominated cultural institutes and technologies.  This is to say that gender inequality is not a vestigial tail, but an acquisition of culture.

The simplest possible answer: testosterone is the hormone that makes you want to dominate others. Men have more of it.

why is there no evidence of civilizations prior to about 12,000 years ago?
If modern humans have existed for approximately 200,000 years then wouldn't they have the same kind of brain as humans today? Couldn't they do calculations and notice patterns just like humans today? I know there was an ice age for much of that period but there were still habitable areas with arable land on Earth that could have been used to farm and build cities. Why do you think it took so long for humans develop cities and civilizations despite being genetically similar to modern humans today?

"If authoritarianism depends on spectacle and stagecraft, democracy is, by contrast, often a boring affair."
From an interesting article on Sapiens: https://www.sapiens.org/culture/anarchism-democracy/
Does anyone have any suggestions what to read if I'm interested in this topic? Particularly on the statement that "authoritarianism depends on spectacle and stagecraft." Considering Nazi Party, it almost feels like a common sense, but I'd love to read a more detailed analyses on it.
Ethnographies and anthropological theories would be fantastic (since this is an anthro sub).

How well does Nietszche's Genealogy of Morals hold up to the past 100 years of Anthropology
Nietzsche made some stunning observations at the time of writing, such as that a Noble/Warrior caste originally imposed itself on the world, creating values of 'good and bad' i.e. from strength. A little later a 'priestly' caste which eventually flowers into scholars, philosophers etc create a new value system which upends the previous one. The Priestly values invert all previous values and turn the desire to dominate and impose inward into inward discipline, self torture and 'ressentiment'. But this movement also leads to trickery, guile, memory, culture, complexity and subtlety. This move also recruits the mass of ordinary people as a bulwark against the warriors.
My question is whether any of this holds up when you look at the past 100 years of what we have discovered about different societies be they hunter gatherers, pastoralists, mobile horse cultures and so on? OR is the priestly caste there from the get go? Are there societies where the warrior caste are always hobbled or where configurations do not match well to the model? Or is Nietszches model found to be basically accurate. I am aware, of course, that it was a specific genealogy of The West.

What are the evolutionary advantages to have epicanthic folds?
I ask because both San peoples (formerly known as Bushmen), and Eastern Eurasians (formerly known as Mongoloids) (that include Amerindians, Siberians, Manchus, Mongols, Japanese people, Koreans, Chinese people, and South-East Asians) have epicanthic folds.
There are even North-West Europeans, East Europeans, and Central Asians that have epicanthic folds (like most Uzbeks and Kazakhs, some Finnish people and Scandinavians, and occasionally Celts and Slavs), but, their close relatives, South Europeans, South-West Asians, North-Africans, and South Asians (like Italians, Greeks, Albanians, Berbers, Egyptians, Arabs, Jews, Syrians, Lebanese people, and Pakistanis) do not tend to have this facial feature.

Do we know if the Neanderthals who successfully interbred with Homo sapiens shared any genetics or traits that weren’t shared by Neanderthals as a whole?
I’ve read that the evidence points to all surviving Neanderthal DNA in Homo sapiens coming from Neanderthal men, and I was wondering if there are any other conclusions we can draw about the Neanderthals that interbred with Homo Sapiens.
Another way of phrasing what I’m asking - are there any genetic traits that seem to be correlated with a Neanderthal producing viable offspring with a Homo sapiens?

Theory of everything
This may sound dumb, but I'm wondering if there were attempts at creating a "theory of everything" in humanities. Like, a theory that would have an ambition to explain human behaviour, social evolution, culture, politics, history using a single framework. Something more or less recent and grounded in research and/or scientific approach and/or logic that is (as opposed to religion and spirituality). Maybe this question is suited more for philosophy subreddits, but it's really hard to tell, given the nature of the question lol. If you have suggestions where to look, it would be good too.

How Are the Terms Under-developed, Developing, and Developed Not Problematic
I know there is or was a paradigm shift away from 1st, 2nd, 3rd World to under-developed, developing, and developed but these terms still seem problematic. These words still seemed packed with value judgements. Are there any newer paradigms that are cropping up or are these still accepted?

Can we obtain objectivity in archaeology as explained in Kosso's "Knowing the Past"
For you Relativist anthropologists and anthropological archaeologists, what are your opinions concerning Peter Kosso's claim that objectivity is indeed obtainable in understanding the past?
In his book Knowing the Past: Philosophical issues of History and Archaeology Peter Kosso states that we can obtain objectivity in accounts of the past through a coherence model dependent on a web of weighted epistemic independent theories and evidence justified through accounting claims (which are often middle-range theories). Kosso provides a fascinating take not only on accounting of how we justify claims of what we observe in archaeology but in empirical sciences as well. Kosso's work appears tightly reasoned and convincing but still leaves something to be desired. I can't put my finger on it, its like a metallic taste on my tongue after a good meal, I wonder where it came from. It may be in part that he disregarded relativism at a certain point that I felt wasn't expanded upon and that he glossed over the concept of inter-subjectivity, both only mentioned once. I wanted to know what relativists thought of this work and if his conception of objectivity since I can't find too much critical literature.
Tl;Dr: Kosso's work is an epistemic dissection of justification through  philosophical instruments in the discipline of archaeology. But I want anthropological perspective on the work, because it think may lack one  (not to say it doesn't align with certain anthropological theories).

How "massive" were the people of the Srubnaya/Timber Grave Culture?
I've seen a few different sources all mention that the physical remains of Srubnaya people show that they were of a "massive build". I can't seem to find any information beyond that, however.
Does anyone know just how massive they were? And in what regard? Height? Bulk? All of the above?
Thank you!

Anthropologists, how do you professionally feel about the loss of cultural and individual survival knowledge and bushcraft as most of the world modernizes and moves away from hunter gatherer mode of living? Inevitable? Tragic?

Do the Hadza tribe in Tanzania live long lives?
I have been reading up on them, but haven't seen any information on their life span. They are known to have unique gut microbiome, and seem to have an ideal diet for preventing cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune diseases. If they do not die from any of the aforementioned health problems, then what do they die from and how long do they live for?

Osteologists or forensic anthro professionals, may I get some help with literature recommendations on rib fracture patterns?
For context, I'm analyzing the skeletal remains of an individual to make a forensic report on them. As far as I can tell, this individual suffered from some sort of accident that resulted in multiple bilateral complete rib fractures (right ribs 1-4 and left ribs 2-4) on the sternal 1/3 end of the ribs. This accident also caused brain bleeding (surgical evidence of a craniotomy) but the individual likely passed away due to their injuries, as the craniotomy is completely unhealed.
From what I was able to find, rib fractures in the upper zone typically result from high velocity trauma, but I was curious if there was any literature that suggests the exact cause of rib fracture patterns? Like if there are rib breakage patterns due to airbag deployment or CPR or something like that? If you guys know of any, would you mind linking it? Many thanks in advance!

Recommended readings on “digital fieldwork” methodology?
(Let me know if this post is not allowed!)
I’m currently planning my MA thesis (in Social Justice but I’ve studied Anthropology in the past) and part of my data collection involves analysis of posts and interactions within specific social media communities. I don’t just want to frame this as “discourse analysis” because I want my work to reflect something more like participant observation, but transformed for digital/online spaces. I haven’t learned about this kind of methodological approach in my courses, but I’m sure there must be some good resources out there. Any recommendations for good books/authors to start with?

Were ranged weapons used in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic?
According to Wikipedia, the earliest remains of bow and arrow in Europe, as well as of spear-thrower, date to around 17,500 years ago. Is there any evidence these were used at an earlier date, whether it's 20, 30, or 40,000 years ago? If not, would it at least be reasonable to assume they were? Or did Europeans hunt at relatively close range for most of the Upper Paleolithic? You would think large animals, such as woolly mammoths, were too dangerous to approach, while small animals, such as birds and hares, were easily scared off.

Did Homo sapiens outnumber Neanderthals,or was it the other way
Since I've read estimates of a population size of around 7500 Neanderthals at any given time and 5000 Homo sapiens in Europe at any given time,but another estimate said that Neanderthals were outnumbered 10 to 1. Which one is correct?

What Language(s) Should I take as an Archaeology major?
I'm currently a second-semester sophomore (so Fall 2022 I'll be a first-sem junior), and in Fall 2022 I'll have taken 3 semester's worth of Japanese classes. Now, I didn't really know if I was interested in archaeology until now, so I didn't think about what region I'd like to specialize in, let alone what language I should take for said region.
I think I'd like to focus on either Egyptian, Indian (South Asian), or broadly Mediterranean archaeology. What languages should I take? I've heard from people that French and German are good to learn since a lot of works are written in these languages, but I'm not 100% on that or anything else.

Okay, so I've got some more information from these additional documents. Let's see what they say about the origins of gender inequality.

From Doc 1, it seems to suggest that gender inequality has been around for many centuries, and it's been a focus of attention for a long time. It mentions that in the 19th century, there were efforts to restrict female employment, which indicates that even back then, there was a push to limit women's roles in society.

Doc 2 provides a specific timeframe, saying that gender inequality started in the 1900s, but that seems too recent compared to what I've read elsewhere. It also mentions that gender roles have been attributed to biological differences between men and women, and that these ideas have been constructed through history.

Doc 3 discusses the history of gender inequality in India, dividing it into ancient, medieval, and modern periods. It notes that in ancient times, women had a respected position, but over time, their status declined. This suggests that gender inequality developed over time in Indian society.

Doc 4 is a Reddit discussion where users are sharing their thoughts on why gender inequality exists and where it came from. One user mentions Sherry Ortner's theory that men are associated with culture and control, while women are associated with nature and biology. Another user points out that with the transition from hunter-gathering to sedentary life, gender inequality increased because of changes in reproductive roles and economic activities.

Doc 5 is a question from a Reddit user asking about the origins of gender inequality, and the top answer discusses how gender inequality may have arisen due to biological differences in reproduction and the need for women to care for children, leading to restrictions on their activities and roles in society.

So, from these documents, it seems that gender inequality has deep historical roots and is linked to biological differences between men and women, particularly in terms of reproduction and child-rearing. It also seems that the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural societies exacerbated gender inequalities.

I recall that in hunter-gatherer societies, there was more equality between men and women because both contributed equally to the group's survival. Men hunted, and women gathered plants and sometimes small game. Since both activities were crucial, there wasn't a significant power imbalance.

However, with the advent of agriculture, societies became more sedentary, and men began to control land and resources. This may have led to the subordination of women, as they became tied to domestic duties and child-rearing, while men controlled the means of production.

Moreover, the invention of writing and the rise of complex societies may have further entrenched gender inequalities, as seen in ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece, where women had limited rights and opportunities.

It's also interesting to note that in some indigenous societies, gender roles were more fluid, and there were recognized third genders or gender variance. For example, in many Native American cultures, there were Two-Spirit people who embodied both male and female genders.

So, gender inequality isn't universal, but it's been a prevalent feature in many societies throughout history.

I think it's also important to consider that gender inequalities are maintained and perpetuated through socialization, cultural norms, and institutional structures. For instance, from a young age, children are socialized into gender roles that reinforce traditional expectations about masculinity and femininity.

Media and popular culture also play a role in perpetuating gender stereotypes and inequalities. For example, women are often objectified and sexualized in advertising and entertainment, which can contribute to sexism and gender-based violence.

Additionally, institutions like education, politics, and the economy often favor men and maintain gender disparities in power and resources.

So, while biological differences may have initially shaped gender roles, the persistence of gender inequality is largely due to social and cultural factors.

I should also consider that gender inequality isn't just about men oppressing women; it can also harm men by enforcing rigid gender norms that limit their emotional expression and personal fulfillment.

Furthermore, gender inequality intersects with other forms of oppression like racism, classism, and homophobia, creating compounded disadvantages for marginalized groups.

In conclusion, gender inequality has a long history rooted in biological differences and the social structures that emerged with the development of human societies. However, it's important to recognize that gender inequalities are not inevitable and can be challenged and changed through social and cultural transformations.

So, to answer the question "How long has gender inequality existed?" It's safe to say that gender inequality has existed for millennia, dating back to the earliest human societies, and it continues to be a pervasive issue in contemporary times.
