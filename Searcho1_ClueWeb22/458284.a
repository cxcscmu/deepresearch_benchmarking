Alright, so I need to figure out how clutter affects health. Hmm, this seems like a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down. First off, what exactly is clutter? Clutter is basically just an accumulation of stuff—things that are unnecessary or disorganized. It can be in your home, office, or even in digital spaces like your computer desktop.

Now, how does this affect health? I guess there are probably both physical and mental health aspects to consider. Let me start with the physical effects.

Physical health impacts:

1. **Accidents and Injuries:** One obvious issue is that clutter can lead to tripping hazards. If there are things lying around on the floor, people can trip over them and hurt themselves. This could range from minor bruises to more serious injuries like fractures.

2. **Allergies and Asthma:** Cluttered spaces can collect dust and allergens, which can trigger allergies and asthma symptoms. Dust mites, mold, and pet dander can all accumulate in cluttered areas.

3. **Pests:** Clutter can also attract pests like rodents and insects. These pests not only carry diseases but can also cause allergic reactions and other health problems.

4. **Cleanliness:** It's harder to keep a cluttered space clean. Dirty environments can harbor bacteria and viruses, increasing the risk of infections.

Mental health impacts:

1. **Stress and Anxiety:** A messy, cluttered environment can increase stress levels and anxiety. Seeing unfinished tasks or a disorganized space can weigh on your mind and make it harder to relax.

2. **Decreased Productivity:** Clutter can distract you and make it difficult to focus on tasks. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased frustration.

3. **Poor Sleep:** If your living space is cluttered, it can affect the quality of your sleep. A messy bedroom can make it harder to wind down and get restful sleep.

4. **Low Mood:** Some studies suggest that living in a cluttered environment can lead to feelings of depression and low mood.

Okay, so those are some of the ways clutter can affect health. But I should probably look into this a bit more to see if there's any scientific research backing up these claims. Maybe I can find some studies or articles that delve deeper into the relationship between clutter and health.

Let me think about how to approach this. I could start by searching for academic papers on the subject, but that might be a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for reputable health websites that have articles on this topic. Maybe the Mayo Clinic or WebMD has something to say about clutter and its health impacts.

Wait, maybe I should just do a general web search to see what comes up. Let's try that.

6 harmful effects of living in a cluttered house
If your health is failing, de-clutter your house.
Written by Sandhya Raghavan | Published : December 8, 2017 6:43 AM IST
Does your house look like a hurricane passed through it? Are you having trouble locating your stuff? Can't remember the last time you cleaned out your house? That's bad news. Some people get used to living with clutter, oblivious to damage it could do to their health. Science says that a dirty, disorganised house could be draining you in more ways than you can imagine. If you are feeling stressed, irritated, tired and unhappy, it's time you did some spring cleaning. Here are some of the ways a dirty, cluttered house can affect you.
1 Clutter promotes confusion
Your surroundings can influence your mental state. A cluttered space reflects a cluttered mind and vice versa. So if you want to gain any semblance of control and discipline, clean out your house. Stack your books, fold your sheets and wash those dishes in the sink.

2 Clutter causes stress
What happens when you are confused? You get stressed out. Coming back to a clean house and a well-made bed to lie on is what everyone dreams of. Instead, when you are  welcomed by the dirty clothes on the sofa, littered newspaper on the floor and spilled coffee on the table, you get super stressed. Read how clutter causes stress.
3 Clutter can cause accidents
It's not rocket science, but a cluttered house increases your chances of tripping and falling over littered things. Imagine finding your lost glasses when you actually sat on them.
4 Clutter makes you eat more
A 2017 study jointly conducted by US and Australia showed that people tend to overeat or binge eat when they live in a cluttered surrounding. According to the research, subjects ended up eating more cookies when they were offered the treats in a cluttered kitchen than when they were given them in an organised one.
5 Clutter ruins your mental health
Living or working in cluttered, disorganised surroundings makes you feel drained and unhappy. A 2017 study on workplaces revealed that chaotic surroundings affect your mental hygiene.
6 Clutter makes communication difficult
A Cornell University study of 2016 showed that people who live among clutter find it difficult to reach each other's feelings. When the background is highly cluttered, people get distracted by the random stimuli from the surroundings and struggle with interpreting the expressions and emotions of people around them.

The Negative Effects Of Clutter: It Makes You Sick, Sad, and Broke!
If’ you’ve got clutter you may think of it as merely an inconvenient mess. Those piles and items that have no home make your home look a bit messy, but they aren’t really a big deal.
Or are they?
Clutter is more than just an eyesore. Over time it takes a toll on your physical, mental, and financial health. Here are some of the negative effects of too much clutter and why you might want to start tackling yours today.
This post may contain affiliate links. Please see my full disclosure policy for details.
NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CLUTTER ON YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
Clutter makes it harder to clean your house with so much stuff to move
You know you should clean house more often, but it’s such a chore! Even simple tasks like dusting the furniture require that you move piles of stuff just so you can get to the surface underneath. Besides, since the surface is covered up no one can see it anyway, right?
This attitude, while understandable, does nothing to help you keep your house clean. While you’re putting it off and putting it off, your house just gets dirtier and dirtier. Just because you can’t see the dirt doesn’t mean it’s not there.

BOY DO I NEED THIS!
Therefore you’re more likely to have dirt, dust, danger, and vermin when you have lots of clutter
It’s gross, but junk and clutter makes the perfect home for pests of all kinds. The problem is that you likely won’t notice them until you start cleaning. But if they’ve moved in and taken up residence then they’re not going anywhere until you evict them and get rid of their habitat.
When you have those issues with the cleanliness of your home people are more likely to be sick or suffer from chronic conditions
Allergies, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses are made worse by living in a dirty home. If you’re not vacuuming your rugs and sweeping your floors regularly, then all the dirt (and who knows what else!) that’s tracked in by pets and shoes is just there….waiting to make you sick.
Clutter increases your blood pressure
Yep, it’s true. Researchers have found that clutter raises your blood pressure which, of course,  over time isn’t good for your heart.
The more stuff there is in a home the more likely someone is to suffer a fall or accident
When there’s too much stuff in the floor…people are more likely to trip and fall. When there’s too much junk out on the kitchen counters….you’re less likely to put down a proper cutting board before you start chopping veggies. Have you ever watched someone attempt to slice an onion or tomato while holding it in their hand? The risk of a major cut is extremely high – all because there’s not space to to the job at hand.
Children are more likely to be injured when contents of overloaded shelves or bins fall on them when they’re trying to find what they’re looking for
We all know kids are curious….and that they climb. You may think that something is up out of their reach (and out of their line of vision) and that they’ll never try to retrieve it.
You could very well be wrong.
If you’ve ever seen a video of something large and heavy tipping over and crushing a child you know that it will literally take your breath away. We can’t control the curiosity of kids, but we can reduce the enticement of climbing because they want something that’s out of their reach.
People who live in cluttered homes are more likely to overeat which causes a variety of health problems.
One study found that having a cluttered kitchen caused people to overeat. It makes sense when you think about it. Too much clutter is often a symptom that things are our of control and that a person has a hard time with moderation. Why wouldn’t the cues that “too much” is acceptable carry over to food consumption as well?
Too much clutter is a fire hazard
Piles of newspapers, magazines, boxes, or junk are a fire hazard waiting to happen. While any fire can spread much quicker than you realize, living in a tinder box increases the risk of a fire and the associated injuries and/or death.
The next time you get ready to light up the fireplace or turn on that space heater you might want to take a look at all of the paper clutter in the vicinity.
NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CLUTTER ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH:
Clutter makes people tense
Sometimes people get tense because of the clutter. However, sometimes people are tense because they’re constantly defending their clutter to others. Too much clutter is often a source of conflict in a home: someone likes the clutter while others don’t. It’s a recipe for tension and tempers.
People are frustrated when they can’t find what they need
It’s annoying any time you can’t find something you’re looking for. But when you add layers of extra clutter that annoyance is magnified. If you’ve ever lost something only to find that it was technically in plain sight (but so surrounded by junk that you couldn’t see it) then you know what I mean.
Family members may be embarrassed about how the house looks or smells
Even if you can’t smell it, a house with too much clutter takes on an odor. And an extremely cluttered house is more likely to have food or other items that are decomposing in the refrigerator or in trash cans. No amount of air freshener will ever beat the smell of a house that’s truly clean.
Family members may be reluctant to have friends visit the house which can lead to anger and resentment
You’ve probably read accounts from people who grew up in homes they were ashamed of. These people talk about the lengths they went to to make up stories why people couldn’t come in the house. They also recall with shame and embarrassment the excuses they came up with to always go to friend’s homes and the guilt they felt when they never reciprocated the invitations. They talk about  how miserable they were having to constantly cover up the fact that they were mortified that someone would find out what conditions they were living in.
Even if your house doesn’t resemble an episode of Hoarders, just the fact that it’s constantly messy or dirty can be a source of embarrassment to your family.
Clutter makes it harder to focus and concentrate on tasks
Too much clutter is distracting! They say that our attention spans have been slowly shortening over the years anyway. How much worse is it when we are visually distracted by so much competing for that attention?
I recently read that 25% of Americans admit to losing or misplacing things at least twice each week and that 50% of Americans admit having missed appointments because they lack focus and systems to keep themselves organized.
Clutter affects your mood increasing your level of anxiety, sadness, depression
Have you ever gotten to the point where there’s so much mess that you just can’t stand it any more? That’s usually when mom goes on a tear and announces to the family that it’s time to clean the house up “or else!” We do get to the point where the mess has taken it’s toll and we’re anxious and stressed out.
Clutter makes you feel claustrophobic
If you’ve ever watched an episode of Hoarders, you’ve probably wondered how people can live in such surroundings. You’ve probably wondered if those people feel like the walls are closing in on them. Too much stuff can definitely make you feel like you’re suffocating or drowning in junk.
Clutter diminishes your satisfaction with your home and surroundings
It’s hard to feel pride in a home that doesn’t look nice. And in a world of 24-hour HGTV, our dissatisfaction can be magnified when we start comparing our homes to the staged homes we’re seeing. Even when we realize that our home won’t look like a television set, it’s hard to feel good about your home when it’s a cluttered mess.
Physical clutter contributes to mental clutter and less efficient and productive thinking
Have you ever tried to get a difficult project done at a desk that’s a total wreck? It’s hard to find what you need, supplies and materials get buried, and you end up wasting lot of time and mental energy that should be going into your work.
Clutter contributes to feeling overwhelmed and out of control
It’s virtually impossible to feel calm and in control when you live in an environment that looks like a disaster zone.
Too much clutter makes you feel like a failure when you can’t get control of your own surroundings.
When things are out of control you feel judged. You assume people are looking at you and wondering why you can’t do something as simple as take care of your home. 63% of people even admit that they put the blame on other
Admitting you’ve bought things you don’t need (or even like) leads to remorse and self-blame.
We’ve all done it…given in to an impulse at the store and bought something on a whim. And then at some point we realize it was a total waste of money and now it’s clutter we need to get rid of. No one wants to admit that they wasted money because it feels like admitting that you have no self-control.
But the money is gone at this point anyway. Your only question becomes whether or not you’re going to hold on to the clutter and enjoy feeling recrimination every time you look at the item.
You may feel taken advantage of if a lot of the clutter came from or belongs to other people
Sometimes the stuff that’s taking up room in our homes doesn’t even belong to us! We’re holding on to it for adult children, friends who need temporary storage, or because our parents have downsized. Whatever the reason, if you’re looking at clutter that’s not even yours it’s hard not to be angry at other people. They’ve dumped a mess on you but you’re the one suffering from it – and it’s not fair.
NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CLUTTER ON YOUR FINANCES
Money is spent replacing things you can’t find…$2.7 billion dollars annually if you want to get specific about it.
You’re more likely to go out to eat when it’s hard to utilize your kitchen to cook at home
Shopping may become a way that family members make themselves feel better when they’re suffering from mood problems caused by the clutter. This creates a vicious cycle.
Storage of excess stuff costs money if you’re renting a storage facility. It’s a good time to own one of these companies since about 10% of Americans have an off-site storage unit they pay rent on every month.
The effects of clutter on your mood, focus, concentration, etc. may affect your job performance which may limit your opportunities for advancement and raises.
You may incur late fees because you couldn’t find a bill in order to pay it on time. In fact, it’s estimated that 23% of people in the U.S. pay their bills late because they can’t find them or aren’t organized enough to have a scheduled time to take care of this task.
So while we may think our clutter is not big deal, the fact is that when clutter gets out of control it can have major effects on all aspects of your life. But any time you get some clutter and mess out of your house you’ve made progress. Keep chipping away at the clutter and you’ll find all areas of your life beginning to improve as you gain control and confidence.

4 Health Hazards Caused By A Cluttered Home

4 Health Hazards Caused By A Cluttered Home
by BloggerOne July 9, 2013 Leave a reply 70
Stress, fatigue, and sickness may not always be the result of a hectic lifestyle. It can also be due to the kind of environment you are living in. Most people do not understand how clutter affects their health. A messy, disorganized home can result to health hazards if it is not properly sorted out and stored.
With that said, a cluttered home environment is not only unsightly, but it is also unhealthy. There are various dangers associated with having a disorganized, messy house. For one, a messy home holds mass amounts of pet dander, dust, and dust mites. These things can result to poor quality air which will then lead to asthma problems. Other health hazards caused by clutter are listed below.
Slip And Fall Accidents
Did you know that the leading cause of home injury death in the country are slip and fall accidents? This type of home injury is very common in cluttered homes. A disorganized house increases the risk of this type of accident because various items are strewn around. Thankfully, this type of accident is preventable. All you have to do is organize your clutter and keep unnecessary items off the floor.
Fatigue And Lethargy
People who live in cluttered homes constantly feel tired. For instance, if you are living in a house where things pile up and other items are scattered across the floor, you might feel like you lack the energy to begin cleaning the space. The stagnant energy that stacks up around the mess causes fatigue and lethargy. You have to understand that cleaning up the mess will free up the energy in your home; thus making your body healthier and improving your vitality.
Respiratory Problems
One of the main problems of an extremely cluttered home is when you can’t reach certain items and you can’t clean the items or dust them. With that said, dust will continue to accumulate, making the household more dangerous for everyone living in it, especially toddlers with a history of asthma.
Since clutter can accumulate dust and allergens, it can aggravate or make the symptoms worse of various respiratory health problems, such as asthma. Based on the studies conducted by the Alliance for Healthy Homes, people who live in messy homes are at a higher risk of respiratory complications. The best way to address this problem is to de-clutter and organize your things at home and thoroughly clean the house. As a rule of thumb, the lesser the stuff you have at home, the fewer things that can collect dust.
Depression And Anxiety
Excessive clutter and disorganization can lead to depression and anxiety. If a person lives in filth and clutter, her relatives and friends may stop coming over. That person may feel shut off; thus, she might withdraw from socialization, leading to depression and anxiety. On the other hand, clutter and disorganization may also be symptoms of mental health problems, such as depression. This means that an unhealthy and unsanitary home can result to mental distress, and mental distress will lead to more clutter. This is a vicious cycle which must be stopped.
If you notice that your home has become unhealthy due to the extreme disorganization, it is time to seek help. You can ask your family, relatives, and friends to help in sorting things in your house. If you find it hard to let go of certain items due to their sentimental value, you can consider storing them someplace else. For instance, you can store them in self storage so that you can keep the items while avoiding clutter at home.
Addressing chronic clutter and disorganization will help prevent health hazards from developing. With the list of health hazards brought about by an untidy home, you will understand the importance of organization and proper storage.

Clutter is bad for your health. Clutter increases creativity. Clutter ruins productivity. Clutter damages your relationship.
You’ve heard a lot about clutter. It can get confusing. Now it’s time to get the hard facts on how clutter affects your life.
We analyzed various studies on clutter and hoarding. We spoke to psychotherapists, physicians, and professional organizers to learn more about the psychological reasons for clutter and its negative effects. We then created a clutter infographic. All so you can finally decide if you have a healthy or unhealthy amount of stuff in your home.
Here’s how clutter affects your physical and mental health, relationships, career, and finances:

Your apartment isn’t the only thing affected by over-accumulation of stuff. Clutter also has proven, tangible effects on your mental and physical well-being.
1. Clutter increases your stress.
According to a study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, people with cluttered homes full of unfinished projects were more depressed, fatigued, and had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol than those who described their homes as “restful” and “restorative.”
The study also mentions that cortisol’s failure to decline normally over the course of the day has “been associated with greater chronic stress, disease progression, and even mortality risk.”
2. Clutter wrecks your diet.
A study in Psychological Science found that participants in an orderly environment chose healthier snacks than those in a cluttered environment.
“Clutter is stressful for the brain, so you’re more likely to resort to coping mechanisms such as choosing comfort foods or overeating than if you spend time in neater surroundings,” explains Dr. Eva Shalhoub.
3. Clutter triggers respiratory issues.
According to the Alliance for Healthy Homes, cluttered homes often contain more dust, which can cause or amplify breathing problems.
As more things pile up, more dust is generated. This creates the ideal living environment for pests like dust mites.
The harder it gets to access different areas of the home to clean, the more serious these respiratory issues become.
4. Clutter threatens your safety.
The Mental Health Association of San Francisco warns that excessive amounts of clutter — especially cardboard boxes, paper, and clothing — can block doorways and windows, creating a serious fire hazard.
If you share your home with others, excessive clutter is no longer just a “you” problem. Clutter in your home can also negatively impact the lives of your significant other and kid(s).
5. Clutter jeopardizes your love life.
People with hoarding disorder persistently have difficulty getting rid of things because of a perceived need to save them. They also feel distressed at the thought of parting with their belongings. This can take a toll on one’s marriage, as studies have shown that compulsive hoarders have higher rates of divorce.
Clutter’s negative impact on marriage is not limited to hoarders. “Spouses of a cluttered person who are bothered by the condition of the environment express their discomfort in judgment, negative comments, name calling, anger and irritability,” writes Debbie Bowie, a Certified Professional Organizer based in Richmond, Virginia.
6. Clutter upsets your kids.
If you have kids, they too can feel the negative effects of a cluttered home. The National Institute of Mental Health found that kids living in a severely cluttered environment often have elevated levels of distress, experiencing less happiness and more difficulty making friends.
7. Clutter isolates you.
The cleanliness of your home can affect your desire to invite anyone into it. In a Rubbermaid survey conducted by Russell Research, nearly half of surveyed homeowners said they won’t invite friends over if their home is cluttered.
Try not to go too far in the opposite direction, though, as living in an overly tidy and controlled environment can also cause stress. According to Kellie Rice, Psy.D., CGP, that level of anxiety makes it hard for someone to leave the house because he/she is so preoccupied with whether or not it’s neat enough.
“If a person doesn’t have control over their home environment, they use work as an escape,” says Connor McClenahan, Psy.D. People with messy tendencies rarely confine their disorganization to just their homes. Meaning that chaos can seep into your professional life, too.
8. Clutter prevents you from getting promoted.
A chaotic desk, an untidy briefcase or purse, and an undefined filing system (or no filing system at all) can all have a major impact on your job performance. A CareerBuilder study found that 28% of employers are less likely to promote someone with a messy workspace.
9. Clutter makes you miss work.
Researchers from the National Institute of Mental Health discovered compulsive hoarding was associated with an average of seven work impairment days per month — more than those reported by participants with other anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders.
10. Clutter decreases productivity.
When your environment is cluttered, the chaos inhibits your ability to focus. A study by the Princeton University Neuroscience Institute observed that “multiple stimuli present in the visual field at the same time compete for neural representation.”
In other words, a desk strewn with papers, snacks, photos, and pens will probably beat out any kind of productivity you had planned for the day. The research also shows that a clean work environment will help you be more productive, less moody, and better able to process information.
A messy home can negatively affect how you manage your finances, leading to poor money management and severe debt. While there are solutions to these issues, being able to find your electric bill is a good place to start.
11. Clutter encourages bad spending habits.
When your home is cluttered, it’s easy to misplace things. If you can’t find an item, like your yoga mat or your dog’s favorite toy, you might buy a duplicate. This habit, combined with spending a lot of money to hoard items, can get you into debt.
Beat debt with a money management service like YNAB.
12. Clutter keeps you in debt.
A cluttered home can also make it difficult to locate credit card bills and bank statements. Another lost bill leads to another late payment. Suddenly, you’re dealing with additional fees, higher interest rates, or even collection agencies.
Set up automatic bill pay or create calendar reminders in your phone to ensure you pay your bills on time.

How Clutter Can Affect Your Health
Medically Reviewed by Nayana  Ambardekar, MD on March 07, 2021
Too Much Stuff
1 / 12
If your closets are bursting or your desk is topped with piles of disorganized papers, you may want to take some steps toward a neater home or workspace. While a bit of chaos might have some upsides -- at least one study suggests that a messy room spurs creativity -- it has many more downsides. It can even be damaging for your physical and mental health.
Mess Equals Stress
2 / 12
When everything is in order, you know exactly where you put your glasses and keys so you can grab them and go on with your day. That saves time and a whole lot of hassle. In one study, women who saw their homes as cluttered had high levels of the stress hormone cortisol throughout the day, while those who described their abode as a well-organized, restful space had lower levels.
It Doesn’t Get Easier
3 / 12
If you're a bit scatterbrained because your space is scattered, don't wait to neaten up. Research has shown that adults in their 50s who have too many piles of stuff are more likely than younger folks to put off making decisions about what to get rid of. The study also found that those piles can make you less satisfied with your life.
Your Mind Wanders
4 / 12
It's hard to focus on important tasks when several things compete for your attention. Researchers have found that being around disorganization makes it harder for your brain to focus. It can be especially tough for people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). If you have ADHD, a professional organizer or coach may be the best way to restore some order to your space.
Pass the Tissues
5 / 12
There's a reason people often call knickknacks "dust collectors." Too much stuff makes it harder to keep your space clean. If you're allergic to things like dust mites or pet dander, decluttering should make it easier to dust and vacuum and get symptoms like sneezing, wheezing, and itchy eyes under control.
Embarrassment and Isolation
6 / 12
A neat, tidy house feels inviting, both for the people who live there as well as guests. A cluttered home may feel the opposite. But shutting people out can take a toll on relationships and make you feel sad and lonely. That could be one reason a hoarding disorder tends to overlap with depression and anxiety disorders.
Slips and Falls
7 / 12
Living with lots of clutter puts you at risk of getting injured. When your floor is covered with boxes, heaps of clothing, or even too much furniture, it's that much easier to trip. Shelves stuffed to the brim with books and knickknacks can also be a hazard if something falls off or a piece of overloaded furniture topples over.
Neatness and Generosity
8 / 12
A more organized environment may make you more caring toward others. In one study, volunteers who filled out surveys in a neat room were more likely to say they wanted to donate to a charity compared with those who were questioned in a messy room.
Memory Issues
9 / 12
Some people who live in cluttered homes have a poorer "working memory," according to research. Your brain is wired to be able to keep track of only a few details at once for a short period, so it can get overloaded when there’s too much going on.
Safety First
10 / 12
If you've gone overboard on papers and other flammable items, your home can be a fire hazard. Even if a fire starts in the most common of ways (cooking oil goes up in flames or a burner catches the edge of your dish towel), clutter makes it harder to get help. Not only will you have more trouble getting out in time if your pathways and exits are blocked, but firefighters will also have a harder time putting out the blaze.
Linked to Weight Gain
11 / 12
People who fill their homes with so much stuff that they may have a hoarding disorder also appear to be more likely to overeat and become obese. One study found that as hoarding got worse, so did body mass index (BMI) and binge-eating symptoms (eating large amounts of food in a short time).
Up All Night
12 / 12
People who have a hoarding disorder also seem more likely to have insomnia. The link between the two isn’t totally clear, but sleep is important for clear thinking and decision-making. If you're sleep-deprived, you might be more likely to make questionable decisions, including ones that involve getting more stuff you really don't need.

Alright, so I've got some information from these articles. Let's see what they're saying.

First, Doc 1 from TheHealthSite.com lists six harmful effects of living in a cluttered house. They mention that clutter can promote confusion, cause stress, lead to accidents, make you eat more, ruin your mental health, and make communication difficult. It seems like clutter has both physical and mental health impacts.

Doc 2 from TamingFrenzy.com goes into more detail about the negative effects of clutter on physical, mental, and financial health. Physically, clutter makes cleaning harder, attracts pests, and can lead to accidents and injuries. Mentally, it causes tension, frustration, embarrassment, and affects mood and focus. Financially, it can lead to spending more money on replacing lost items or paying late fees.

Doc 3 from MedusaMagazine.com highlights four health hazards caused by a cluttered home: slip and fall accidents, fatigue and lethargy, respiratory problems, and depression and anxiety. They emphasize that clutter can lead to respiratory issues due to dust accumulation and that it can contribute to mental health problems.

Doc 4 is an infographic from HuffPost that outlines 12 surprising ways clutter ruins your life, including increasing stress, wrecking your diet, triggering respiratory issues, threatening safety, jeopardizing your love life, upsetting your kids, isolating you, preventing you from getting promoted, making you miss work, decreasing productivity, encouraging bad spending habits, and keeping you in debt.

Lastly, Doc 5 from WebMD provides a slideshow on how clutter negatively affects your health. They mention that clutter equals stress, can make your mind wander, exacerbate allergies, lead to embarrassment and isolation, cause slips and falls, link neatness with generosity, impair memory, pose safety risks, be linked to weight gain, and disrupt sleep.

So, overall, it seems that clutter has a wide range of negative impacts on health, from physical injuries and respiratory problems to mental health issues like stress, anxiety, and depression. It also affects relationships and financial well-being.

I think the key points are:

1. Physical health risks: accidents, injuries, respiratory issues, allergies, and even obesity.

2. Mental health impacts: stress, anxiety, depression, difficulty focusing, and poor sleep.

3. Relationship strains: affecting relationships with partners and children, leading to isolation.

4. Financial consequences: overspending, debt, and missed opportunities due to disorganization.

It's interesting to see that clutter isn't just an aesthetic issue but has profound effects on various aspects of life. I wonder why clutter has such a significant impact. Is it because it creates a constant source of stress and distraction, or is there more to it?

Maybe I should look into the psychological aspects of clutter. Why do people accumulate clutter, and what are the underlying reasons? Perhaps understanding that could help in finding solutions to reduce clutter and improve health.

Let me consider doing another search to explore the psychological reasons behind clutter and hoarding behaviors.

6 Reasons Why People Become Hoarders - Hoarding Cleanup
6 Reasons Why People Become Hoarders
March 10, 2017
Cleaning services are often called upon for their expertise in extreme hoarding cases. The hoarding condition in recent years is being recognised and researched by many authorities. Studies have identified numerous factors that contribute to the development of hoarding behaviour in different people, including personality types and past traumatic experiences. Why do people become compulsive hoarders?
To start with, compulsive hoarding is defined as a mental disorder where someone acquires a lot of possessions, but fail to discard any of them. Sometimes these possessions can be useless, of limited value or even useful, but never used. Hoarding makes your living space notably cluttered leaving no room for your daily activities. Here are reasons why people become hoarders.
Emotional Irregularity
When a person suffers from depression and anxiety, they might start hoarding as a coping mechanism. Continuously acquiring unneeded items while at the same time not discarding any of their current possession is a behaviour demonstrated by people trying to overcome depression.
Perfectionism
Hoarders fear making the mistake of throwing away items they think might be valuable. This appears strange when you see a house full of clutter and rubbish. A hoarder’s perfectionist tendency tells them they need the clutter.
Emotional Attachment
When a person becomes too attached emotionally to his/her possessions, they try to hold on to them even when they don’t need them or after acquiring new ones. Compulsive hoarders become too attached emotionally to their belongings to let them go.
Difficulty Processing Information
Compulsive hoarders have difficulty or the inability to categorise items into valuable and non-valuable. So everything to them has the same significant value, meaning they can’t recognise items that should be disposed of.
A Personal Trauma
Experts believe that there is a link between experiencing personal trauma and the onset of compulsive hoarding. Emotional distress might stretch back to childhood, but hoarding normally starts at the age of 13 years old.
Dread of Waste
Hoarders feel they have the responsibility of holding on and keeping items that might become useful one day. They think that discarding items now might lead to them needing new ones in the future for the same purpose, so they keep them even though these items are usually never used.
Hoarding is a unique mental disorder that does have links to emotional trauma, depression and/or anxiety. That is why compulsive hoarders need treatments for the disorder. Hoarding also creates health and safety risks, as well environmental concerns, that have to be resolved upon identifying you are a hoarder.
The good news is that hoarders can make changes within their lives and begin to live life clutter-free. There are specialized therapists who work with hoarders to help them to feel comfortable giving things away and living clutter-free. 1 st Hoarding Clean Up has been working with British Columbia’s hoarders for years, compassionately helping to declutter and clean any type of hoarding situation.

The Psychology Behind Hoarding
It's estimated that 1 in 50 people struggles with hoarding. This may be why.
Posted September 5, 2014 |Reviewed by Kaja Perina
Recently, the phenomenon known as hoarding has come into greater public awareness, propelled by graphic scenes on television showing homes crammed floor-to-ceiling with an astonishing amount of stuff. A&E’s Hoarders has shown not only that hoarding is a relatively widespread affliction—the International OCD Foundation estimates that one in every 50 people struggles with severe hoarding—but also that the public is fascinated by it.
Programs such as Hoarders and TLC’s Hoarding: Buried Alive have featured shocking scenes of safety personnel in hazmat suits scoping out all manner of refuse and garbage, while a distraught hoarder pleads that every last bit of it is necessary. At times, a home is filled with so many pets that they have become unclean, uncared for, and ill. Their compulsion causes the hoarders' mental, emotional, physical, and financial health to suffer. Most tragically, their relationships unravel as families and friends struggle to cope with their condition.
Hoarding is a type of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); it’s estimated that about one in four people with OCD are also compulsive hoarders. But this categorization is being reevaluated, and it is possible that hoarding will eventually be considered its own diagnostic category. In the meantime, it’s very real, and more and more people are opening up about the difficulty hoarding presents in their lives.
Without exception, hoarding is accompanied by varying levels of anxiety and, often, depression as well. Neuroimaging studies have revealed peculiar commonalities among hoarders including severe emotional attachment to inanimate objects and extreme anxiety when making decisions.
Hoarding both relieves anxiety and generates it. The more hoarders accumulate, the more insulated they feel from the world and its dangers. But of course, the more they accumulate, the more isolated they become from the outside world, including family and friends. Even the thought of discarding or cleaning out hoarded items produces extreme feelings of panic and discomfort.
It can be difficult to determine whether someone is a hoarder or just a pack rat, someone who just likes to hang on to things. The main determinant of whether a behavior is just a personal preference or a disorder usually has to do with whether, and how much, that behavior has begun to negatively impact daily functioning.
According to DSM-5, the following symptoms are diagnostic of hoarding disorder:
There is persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their value or lack thereof.
The difficulty in discarding possessions is due to distress associated with getting rid of them.
The difficulty in discarding possessions leads to clutter of living spaces and compromises the use of living spaces.
The hoarding creates clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning, including the ability to maintain a safe space.
What causes someone to become a hoarder? That's not entirely clear, although there are known risk factors such as experiencing a traumatic event; persistent difficulty making decisions; and having a family member who is a hoarder.
There are, however, some commonalities among hoarders. While severe hoarding is most common in middle-age, hoarding tendencies often emerge in adolescence. Many hoarders are also socially withdrawn or isolated, and may begin to hoard as a way to find comfort.
Researchers continue to search for effective treatments for hoarding, while Americans continue to be captivated by extreme accumulation on TV. In a culture awash in anxiety, worry, and fear, if accumulating things becomes a way to deflect and manage those feelings, the stack is likely to get bigger and bigger.

Why People Become Compulsive Hoarders
Why Do People Hoard?
According to Dr. David Tolin, director of the Anxiety Disorders Center at the Institute of Living at Hartford Hospital, some people hoard because of perfectionism. "They don't necessarily color-code their closets, but they have that perfectionistic streak that bites them when it gets too bad," he says. "They have the mentality that, 'If I can't make this decision perfectly, I won't do it at all.' And that's where the hoarding comes in. They become so frightened that they will make a mistake, that they become paralyzed and just allow the clutter to build up."
Other people hoard because they are afraid that they will accidentally throw away something that is useful. "People with hoarding problems will often think of all kinds of ways that they could use something, or they think of people that might want that object, so they keep it," Dr. Tolin says. "The irony, however, is that in most cases, they never actually use the object in the way they thought of. They don't actually give the object to the person they thought of. So these reasons for keeping things don't turn out to be good reasons after all."
Still other people save things because they feel a sense of emotional attachment to the objects in their home. "All of us get attached to things some of the time," Dr. Tolin says. "We have things that remind us of people we love, or they remind us of happy times. But for people with hoarding problems, the attachment to objects becomes very intense—sometimes more intense than the attachment to actual people. And instead of feeling attached to one thing, like a scrapbook or a favorite sweater, they can become attached to hundreds, even thousands, of things. Some people have told me that all of the things in their homes feel like their friends or family members, so they can't bear to throw them out."

Hoarding as a Reaction to Trauma
Filling the emotional hole with "stuff."
Posted June 7, 2013 |Reviewed by Jessica Schrader
It is estimated that 1 to 2 million people in North America are living in so much clutter that they can barely walk through their homes, or find a place to sit or a surface to rest a plate. Although it is not classified as a separate disorder in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), compulsive hoarding is a debilitating condition that can destroy relationships and tear families apart. Statistics show that 15-30% of individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) also exhibit hoarding tendencies. Recently, studies have also shown that individuals who have both OCD and exhibit hoarding symptoms were more likely to have experienced at least one traumatic life event in comparison to those with OCD alone, suggesting that the act of compulsive shopping and the obsessive need to collect and keep material objects may serve as a coping mechanism for grief, loss or posttraumatic stress.
Jessica Grisham of the University of New South Wales has found that the link between hoarding behaviour and traumatic events, such as losing a spouse or child is especially important to consider in individuals exhibiting a late onset of hoarding symptoms, especially if those symptoms first appeared at the time of the event or shortly thereafter. Accumulating “stuff” fills the emotional hole left by the trauma and allows individuals to avoid dealing with the pain. Later removal of these items can trigger high levels of anxiety, especially if someone else gets rid of these items without the hoarder’s permission. When discussing their behaviours, many hoarders describe the “rush” they experience when purchasing new items, especially if the item is free or on sale, and they go to great lengths to justify purchases when questioned by friends or family members.
Hoarding often results in unhealthy attachments and an inability to form meaningful relationships with others. The attachment that hoarders assign to their possessions often takes on greater value than the attachment assigned to people. When given an ultimatum, hoarders will often choose possessions over friends and family. Some hoarders describe the intense emotion experienced when throwing out possessions as comparable to the emotion experienced when a loved one is lost. Jamie Feusner at UCLA’s School of Medicine has stated that most hoarders are single, either because their behaviour has driven away those around them or has prevented them from forming meaningful relationships.
Treating a hoarding problem is far more complicated than simply cleaning the individual’s house and throwing the offending possessions away. If the underlying issue is not properly treated, the hoarder will simply begin accumulating new possessions and quickly refilling the cleared space. In cases where the hoarding behaviour is linked to a traumatic event, therapies such as cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) can be quite effective. CBT teaches the person to cope with emotions related to the triggering traumatic event and to manage the grief in a healthy and functional way. It can also be helpful to have hoarders practice going to stores and resisting the need to purchase triggering items while being supervised by a mental health professional who can provide coaching and support.
Television and other popular media have brought hoarding into view, hopefully sparking further research into the underlying causes of the behaviour. Hoarding literally creates a mess so visible to others, that the disorder is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to disguise. Such disarray leads to very serious health and safety hazards, causing hoarding to carry a great deal of stigma. Without proper education, it is easy for people to assume that hoarders are merely “dirty” or “lazy.” In fact, these individuals may be suffering from trauma-related psychological pain and may require treatment by a mental health professional. Fortunately, there are a growing number of practitioners who now specialize in treating the condition and helping to reduce its stigma. Common signs of hoarding include acquiring more than can be used, keeping useless items such as newspapers, old containers, and trash; and then restricting others from using, touching or borrowing those items. Symptoms may be paired with procrastination, a lack of organization, and poor decision making that may result in the impairment of typical functioning, for example, frequent absence from work.

Overview of the Causes of Hoarding Disorder
Like many individuals across the United States, you may have some understanding of hoarding, but have many questions about the condition all the same. One of the key questions that you might have is what are the causes of hoarding disorder in the first instance? This article is presented to provide you with essential information about hoarding disorder and its root causes.
What Is Hoarding Disorder
The Mayo Clinic has developed a succinct, widely utilized definition of hoarding disorder:
“Hoarding disorder is a persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions because of a perceived need to save them. A person with hoarding disorder experiences distresses at the thought of getting rid of the items. Excessive accumulation of items, regardless of actual value, occurs.”
Signs of Hoarding Disorder
Before diving into a discussion of the causes of hoarding, a presentation of some of the telltale signs that the disorder exists is helpful. Bear in mind that in many cases hoarding may be ongoing for an extended period of time before evidence of the disorder is apparent to others. Those with hoarding disorder are nearly always secretive about their situations.
The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has developed a comprehensive list of the signs of hoarding disorder:
Inability to throw away items, including objects of no value
Severe stress or anxiety when attempting to discard items or even thinking about taking such a step
Great difficulty organizing items
Indecision about what to keep or where to put things
Distress and feeling overwhelmed or embarrassed by the accumulation of items and living situation
Suspicion of other people in regard to items, objects, and possessions that have been hoarded
Obsessive thoughts and actions
Functional impairments including loss of living space, social isolation, family or marital discord, financial difficulties, health hazards
Functional impairments associated with hoarding include:
Loss of living space
Social isolation
Family discord
Marital discord
Financial issues
Health hazards
Traumatic Life Events as Precursors to Hoarding
Traumatic events in a person’s life can provide a trigger for compulsive hoarding. Examples of traumatic events that can cause a person to begin hoarding include:
Divorce
Death of a spouse or other loved one
Fire
Robbery
Divorce appears to be a hoarding trigger event, particularly for middle-aged women. Divorce doesn’t appear to be a root cause of hoarding among men to nearly the same extent that it is for women.
The death of a spouse also represents a trigger for hoarding in a good percentage of cases. As is the case with divorce underlying hoarding, when it comes to the death of a spouse, it typically is a woman pushed to hoard as the result of this type of life event.
Fire is yet another traumatic life event that underpins hoarding in some cases. The theory is that the profound loss that oftentimes is associated with fire causes some people to become compulsive about holding onto and protecting objects they accumulate.
In a similar vein, a robbery also serves as the trigger point to hoard for some people. The motivation is akin to that associated with a fire. The loss of personal belongings causes a person to become compulsive about amassing and protecting objects and items.
Other Mental Health Conditions That Lead to Hoarding
Research suggests that there are other mental health conditions or disorders that lead to or contribute to hoarding. These include:
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
Depression
Anxiety
PTSD
Historically, hoarding was considered to be a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In recent years, hoarding disorder was set apart as a separate and distinct mental health condition. Nonetheless, there are people with OCD who do end up suffering from hoarding disorder as well. The compulsive tendencies underlying OCD contributes to the start of hoarding conduct.
Depression is also known as a contributing factor to hoarding. This occurs for a number of reasons, including a depressed individual’s growing inability to tend to personal affairs and maintain order in his or her home.
Anxiety and PTSD can also be precursors or root causes of hoarding. By hoarding, a person with an anxiety disorder or PTSD can feel that he or she has gained at least some semblance of control over his or her life. This sense of control exists even as his or her home becomes more and more out of control due to hoarding conduct.
Hoarding and Professional Assistance
In most cases, a person laboring under hoarding disorder necessitates the assistance of different types of professionals, as well as other individuals, in order to regain a semblance of control over his or her life. Examples of professionals and others that likely need to be involved in the process of supporting and assisting a person with hoarding disorder include:
Family members
Mental health specialists
Organizational experts
Hoarding cleanup professionals
It is important to note that absent a comprehensive approach to assisting a person with hoarding disorder, merely cleaning up a residence likely is not enough to get a person on a lasting, healthy pathway. The fact is that absent mental health assistance and other support, a person with hoarding disorder who has his or her residence cleaned up is likely to return to hoarding. Indeed, in such situations, over 90 percent of people with hoarding disorder will hoard again.

From these articles, it seems that hoarding and clutter can stem from various psychological factors. Let's summarize what I've learned.

First, hoarding is often linked to underlying mental health issues such as OCD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It can also be triggered by traumatic life events like divorce, the death of a loved one, or experiencing a fire or robbery.

People who hoard may have emotional attachments to their possessions, seeing them as sources of comfort or security. They might also have perfectionistic tendencies, fearing that discarding items could lead to regret or loss of something valuable.

It's interesting to note that hoarding can be a way for some people to cope with emotional pain or trauma. By accumulating possessions, they may be trying to fill an emotional void or find a sense of control in their lives.

Moreover, hoarding can be a symptom of a larger issue, and treating it effectively requires addressing the root causes. This often involves therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps individuals manage their emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

I think understanding these psychological aspects can help in approaching clutter and hoarding issues with empathy and patience. It's not just about tidying up; it's about addressing deeper emotional needs and providing appropriate support.

Now, considering all this information, I can see that clutter and hoarding have significant impacts on physical and mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life. It's crucial to recognize the signs and seek help when needed.

In conclusion, clutter affects health in numerous ways, from increasing stress and anxiety to causing physical injuries and exacerbating respiratory issues. Moreover, it can strain relationships and lead to financial problems.

Therefore, maintaining an organized and clean living space is essential for overall well-being. If someone is struggling with clutter or hoarding, it's important to encourage them to seek professional help to address the underlying issues and improve their quality of life.
