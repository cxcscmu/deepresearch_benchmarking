Alright, so I need to think about how the pandemic has changed us. That's a pretty broad topic, isn't it? It affects so many different aspects of our lives—personal, social, economic, you name it. I guess I should start by breaking it down into smaller parts.

First off, let's consider the personal level. For most people, the pandemic has forced us to stay at home more often due to lockdowns and social distancing measures. This has probably had a big impact on our daily routines and habits. Maybe people have had to adapt to working from home, which can be quite a shift from going into an office every day. There must be plenty of research on how this has affected productivity and work-life balance.

Also, social interactions have been limited. People haven't been able to see their friends and family as much, which could lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. I've heard that mental health issues have risen during the pandemic, so that's probably related.

On the positive side, some people might have found new hobbies or spent more time on existing ones because they had extra free time at home. Maybe there's been an increase in baking, painting, or learning new skills online.

Moving on to the social level, the pandemic has highlighted inequalities in society. Not everyone has been able to work from home; essential workers have had to continue going to their jobs, putting themselves at risk. This includes healthcare workers, grocery store employees, public transportation staff, and others. It's made us more aware of who really keeps society running.

Additionally, the way we consume information has changed. With more people staying at home, there's been an increase in online news consumption and social media usage. This can have both positive and negative effects on how we perceive the world and make decisions.

Economically, the pandemic has had a massive impact. Many businesses have closed down, leading to job losses and financial struggles for individuals and families. On the other hand, some industries have boomed, like technology and e-commerce. It's interesting to see how different sectors have been affected in various ways.

Education has also been profoundly affected. Schools and universities have had to switch to online learning, which presents its own set of challenges. Students may not have access to the same resources at home as they do in school, and the quality of education might suffer as a result.

Moreover, the pandemic has accelerated existing trends, such as digital transformation and remote work. Companies that were slow to adopt technology have had to quickly adapt to keep up. This could have long-lasting effects on how business is conducted in the future.

I should probably look up some statistics to support these points. Maybe see what studies have been done on the psychological impact of the pandemic, or how economic indicators have changed compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Wait, maybe I should perform a search to get more concrete information. Let me try that.

Lessons that should be taken from Coronavirus for individual as well as national level:
We are more interconnected than ever before and there is no going back. We have no choice but to act in ways that ensure our whole planetary organism is healthy. Any sickness ripples through the whole.
The quality of political governance and leadership make all the difference. It determines whether a society is going forwards or backwards.
A healthy society requires universal civic engagement on everyone’s part in order to foster the trust needed between citizen, government, media, institutions of knowledge and business.
We can no longer ignore that basic minimums for all need to be met; a social safety net that includes healthcare, access to services and a stake in the economy. This is both to give a chance to flourish and protect them.
As much as we think, we humans are masters, nature rules.
Policy advice following two aspects of political science:
Political economy:
The spread of the Corona infection was the most genuine worldwide emergency undermining the planet. In the event that turmoil is the trait of universal relations that have been engraved by the pragmatist hypothesis as per the speculations of Hobbes, Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and Mearsheimer , which were titles of exemplary authenticity, auxiliary authenticity, hostile authenticity, and new great authenticity, all of which stressed that contention as opposed to collaboration is the thing that describes global relations. Just as the reactions coordinated at neolibralism for overlooking human and good law based measurements and human needs in favor the private part.. The worldwide reliance and significance of group and multilateral methodologies has been accentuated. In the event that the pre-pandemic world won’t exist, pandemic will reshape the world less competition, progressively universal co-activity ,the human help will play as increasingly viable delicate force instrument in international strategy. The fact of the matter is the world will never be equivalent to after coronavirus.
China has become the world’s medication bureau , carrying fundamentally required types of gear to battling countries, for example, Italy and France in wartime style. This crisis is not bound by its effects and ways of confronting it within the national borders, but rather in the global space. It is a global war on pandemic on the one hand,and test of humanity on the other. The solidarity at national and global levels is essential. Betting on placing blame, charges against, on the party that caused the pandemic will not solve the tragedy, but rather complicate it,and what is required is knowing the whole truth to avoid the occurrence in the future. The globalization has suffered a setback specially in economic globalization, however , great.
The world faces a common enemy, so the redefinition of the local interest should be reoriented in a vision that the interests of countries today cannot be achieved in isolation from the interest of the others since all countries of the world participate in countering the threats resulting from cross- border, such as epidemics and the climate change. Although this disease is socialized in its global invasion , it is not acceptable to deal with it in romance through political make -up in the face of the duality of life and death. The serum of realism provides solutions to all countries and peoples, far from the theatrical concept of politics, while the problem of utopian political ideas remains that the do not start from the tangible reality on the ground , but rather searches for should be.
International relationship:
The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced worldwide relations and caused strategic strains. The political relations have been influenced because of the strains around exchange and transport of drugs, indicative tests and clinic hardware for coronavirus sickness 2019. Leaders of certain nations have blamed different nations for not containing the illness viably and bringing about the uncontrolled spread of the virus. Developing countries in Latin America and Africa can’t discover enough materials for testing for coronavirus malady, halfway in light of the fact that different nations in Europe and the United States and outspending the resources. However, I think that the combination of the concepts is necessary to get out of the crisis

Life experiences, outlook influence how people are harmed—or helped—by pandemic stress
December 8, 2021
Life experiences, outlook influence how people are harmed—or helped—by pandemic stress
by Laura Williamson
When the COVID-19 pandemic shut down New York City in March 2020, Jose Montanez, like millions of others in the service industry, lost his source of income. A hair stylist who also ran karaoke drag shows, he made his money closely interacting with people. Even his third business—wedding planning—had to close shop. And then his husband, David Tingle, got laid off from his decades-long job as a retail architect.
These could have been enormously stress -inducing events for both of them. But the couple shared something else that made a difference: experience adapting to challenges and a positive outlook toward change.
"You have two choices: Give up, or go on and see what the next chapter is," said Tingle, who quickly decided to pursue a degree in mortuary science, much of which could be done online while he sheltered in place.
It's been a rollercoaster since the pandemic upended life for millions of people around the globe. While vaccines have allowed economies to slowly reopen, new variants coupled with vaccine hesitancy have led to a series of new COVID surges. Daily living continues to feel stressful for many, with children at home or at school, especially if people also had to deal with financial strain or family members lost to the virus that to date has taken nearly 800,000 lives in the U.S., according to federal data.
Living with chronic stress can have lasting consequences on physical and mental health. But nearly two years into this global crisis, those who study the impacts of stress are seeing evidence of something else suggested by prior research. How people perceive stress plays a major role in its impact.
"There's a mindset that stress is going to kill us," said Sonia Lupien, a psychiatry professor and founder and director of the Centre for Studies on Human Stress at the University of Montreal, Canada. "But if you measure stress hormones in people with a negative mindset and people with a positive mindset, you see those with a negative mindset produce more. If you can change your mindset, you can lower the impact on your body."
An American Heart Association scientific statement earlier this year summarized evidence of a strong mind-heart-body connection, emphasizing that psychological health contributes to physical health in both positive and negative ways. Trauma and prolonged stress have been shown to harm the body in numerous ways, including raising the risk for heart disease. Conversely, optimism, a sense of purpose and a positive attitude have been linked to better heart health and lower cardiovascular risk factors.
For some, new life stressors can reactivate negative feelings from old ones. Studies have shown people who experienced trauma, especially as children, may react more strongly to new stressors and be more vulnerable to mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
And people living under already stressful conditions—such as poverty, racism or abuse—also may have a stronger negative reaction to a life stressor as outsized as a global pandemic, said Joy Gabrielli, an assistant professor in the department of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Researchers refer to this as "acute-on-chronic" stress.
"Stress related to COVID-19 is particularly impactful, because it disproportionately impacts higher-risk, vulnerable populations, including those with chronic medical conditions or those with disabilities," she said.
Gabrielli authored a 2020 paper in Pediatric Research highlighting the ways in which the acute stress of the pandemic could exacerbate chronic stress in children dealing with poverty, disabilities or abuse. She recommended health care professionals prioritize high-risk families and look for ways to connect them to additional resources and support during times of crisis.
A person's perception of stress also can be changed, research shows.
In a study of students preparing for the GRE, the standardized test used in graduate school admissions, researchers reported in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology that they could influence the students' perception of test anxiety—and with it their performance on the test. Half the students were told not to worry about feeling anxious during the test because anxiety could help them perform better. The other half were told only that researchers were measuring how test anxiety would affect their scores. Those told that test anxiety would help them scored higher.
For people like Montanez and Tingle, prior life experiences taught them to regard the monkey wrenches life throws as challenges rather than setbacks.
"It comes from us having to fend for ourselves at an early age," said Montanez, who, like his husband, began living on his own during his teenage years. Montanez spent his time in lockdown learning new skills, such as sewing and microblading, that would help grow his previously shuttered businesses when pandemic restrictions lifted. "My mindset is so used to taking a negative and turning it into a positive."
Lupien emphasized that events like the COVID-19 pandemic, and other major life stressors, were unavoidable but not insurmountable.
"Stress exists to ensure survival of the species because it pushes humans to adapt," she said. "We are not as fragile as you think."

In Their Own Words, Americans Describe the Struggles and Silver Linings of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak has dramatically changed Americans’ lives and relationships over the past year. We asked people to tell us about their experiences – good and bad – in living through this moment in history.
By Patrick van Kessel, Chris Baronavski, Alissa Scheller and Aaron Smith
March 5, 2021
Pew Research Center has been asking survey questions over the past year about Americans’ views and reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August, we gave the public a chance to tell us in their own words how the pandemic has affected them in their personal lives. We wanted to let them tell us how their lives have become more difficult or challenging, and we also asked about any unexpectedly positive events that might have happened during that time.
The vast majority of Americans (89%) mentioned at least one negative change in their own lives, while a smaller share (though still a 73% majority) mentioned at least one unexpected upside. Most have experienced these negative impacts and silver linings simultaneously: Two-thirds (67%) of Americans mentioned at least one negative and at least one positive change since the pandemic began.
How we did this
In many ways, the negatives clearly outweigh the positives – an unsurprising reaction to a pandemic that had killed more than 180,000 Americans at the time the survey was conducted. Across every major aspect of life mentioned in these responses, a larger share mentioned a negative impact than mentioned an unexpected upside. Americans also described the negative aspects of the pandemic in greater detail: On average, negative responses were longer than positive ones (27 vs. 19 words). But for all the difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, a majority of Americans were able to think of at least one silver lining.
Both the negative and positive impacts described in these responses cover many aspects of life, none of which were mentioned by a majority of Americans. Instead, the responses reveal a pandemic that has affected Americans’ lives in a variety of ways, of which there is no “typical” experience. Indeed, not all groups seem to have experienced the pandemic equally. For instance, younger and more educated Americans were more likely to mention silver linings, while women were more likely than men to mention challenges or difficulties.
Here are some direct quotes that reveal how Americans are processing the new reality that has upended life across the country.
“ Even for an introvert, there’s such a thing as too much isolation. ”
“ Life has slowed down and brought family and friends closer. ”
Impact on relationships: Isolation for some, stronger bonds for others
More than any other issue, Americans responded by bringing up how the pandemic has altered their ability to engage with friends and family. The single-most common category of comments (mentioned by 41% of those who answered the question) centered around missing family and friends and worrying about losing touch with people they used to see in person. Many described feelings of isolation – while others described newly crowded living situations, strained relationships or the loss of loved ones.
At the same time, a third (33%) of Americans mentioned positive impacts to their relationships, including being able to spend more time with spouses, children or other family members who no longer have to spend their days at work or school. Others pointed to ways in which regular video chats have helped them connect more with distant family than they had in pre-pandemic times. Some also described enjoying a lack of social obligations. Younger Americans were more likely to mention positive relationship developments than were older Americans: 40% of adults under 50 did so, while just a quarter (25%) of those 50 and older described improvements to their relationships.
“ The destruction of our routines has been disorienting. ”
“ Mandatory relaxation, i.e., reading, needlework, crosswords, long outdoor walks. NO commitments on my calendar to worry about. ”
Impact on activities: Disrupted routines and new hobbies
Nearly a third (32%) of Americans mentioned ways that the pandemic has limited what activities they can engage in or how they otherwise use their free time. These responses often focused on being stuck at home or being unable to travel, and were especially common among older adults. Some 45% of those 65 and older said the pandemic has forced them to remain isolated at home or otherwise unable to enjoy their normal routines in their older years – while just 27% of those under 50 described similar difficulties.
At the same time, roughly a quarter of Americans (26%) used the question as an opportunity to talk about ways their daily lives have improved, in many cases describing a slower pace of life, new hobbies, more time to get things done around the house or the freedom to simply relax in ways that were not possible in the pre-pandemic era.
“ The isolation has been difficult. I’ve also gained weight and become very sedentary. ”
“ I am eating healthier because I’m eating out less. ”
Impact on health: Loss of loved ones, depression and declining physical health balanced by relatively few positives
A relatively small share of Americans (14%) mentioned ways in which their own physical or mental health – or the health of people they know – has improved during the pandemic. In some cases they described positive lifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet or exercising more often – while others reported feeling less stressed in their day-to-day lives or having a renewed appreciation for the things that matter to them.
By contrast, twice as many Americans (28%) described how the physical or mental health of themselves or the people they care about has degraded as the pandemic has dragged on. Many mourned the loss of loved ones to COVID-19, or detailed their own struggles with the virus. Others described more indirect health impacts of the pandemic, including stress and depression, weight gain or a lack of exercise. Women were especially likely to mention physical or mental health difficulties: One-in-three women did so (33%), compared with one-in-five men (21%).
“ Politicians are fighting as fiercely and as polarized as ever. This is how the republic of the United States ends. We are at the end of the republic. What comes next is uncertain: autocracy, fascism, civil war, chaos? ”
“ People in my community seem to be really interested in helping each other out. Sharing food, going shopping for older people, making masks and giving them to people, organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and the homeless. It seems to be bringing all different kinds of people together to help each other out. ”
Impact on society and politics: Almost entirely negative
Roughly one-quarter (26%) of these responses pointed to the ways in which our government, political culture or society in general has seemingly degraded over the course of the pandemic. Some expressed frustration with the government’s lackluster response to the spread of the disease, while others were baffled over financially ruinous lockdowns in response to what they view as an overhyped danger. Some expressed annoyance over mask-wearing requirements that they viewed as infringing on their personal freedom, while others were dismayed that their fellow Americans refused to respect their safety by wearing a facemask in public places. Such responses spanned the political spectrum, although Republicans were somewhat more likely than Democrats to mention these changes (31% vs. 21%).
Some Americans did see the world through a more positive lens. A handful of responses described ways that the pandemic has brought out the best in society – expressing an appreciation for the government’s response to the pandemic, remarking on the kindness of strangers, or acknowledging the reduction in traffic or pollution. However, these kinds of responses were so rare that researchers were unable to reliably measure them.
“ I am a teacher, and have worked myself to the bone to deliver education remotely. It’s completely exhausting. ”
“ Teleworking has been a welcome change. I enjoy the extra two hours a day I would have spent commuting. I also enjoy spending more time with my wife. I know I’m fortunate, and I’m grateful. ”
Impact on work: Work-life balance improves for some, disappears for others
Around one-in-five Americans (23%) described how the pandemic has negatively impacted their job or career or those of people they know – with experiences that ranged from losing their job or having their work reduced, to being more stressed at work or frustrated about working from home. Many wrote about their difficulties in great detail, especially educators, health care and other essential workers.
By contrast, just 13% mentioned positive changes to their work situation, typically in the context of being able to work from home. These responses tended to describe a variety of benefits to remote work, including greater productivity, the lack of a commute and a better work-life balance. But these silver linings were especially divided along income and educational attainment lines. College-educated workers were more than twice as likely as those with a high school diploma or less (21% vs. 8%) to say that their work situation has actually taken a turn for the better during the pandemic. Americans with higher income levels were also more likely to mention positive work changes.
“ Our water is being turned off tomorrow because my husband’s hours were cut, but he somehow still makes too much to get any assistance. In a few days our electric will be off and soon after our gas. We have had barely enough to cover rent and put a little bit of food in the house. ”
“ Spending less money because there is nowhere to go and nothing to do. ”
Impact on finances: Some save money, but many feel financial strain
Despite it being the least commonly mentioned type of negative experience, more than one-in-five Americans (22%) mentioned economic difficulties resulting from the pandemic – either challenges they have faced themselves, or that others faced more generally. (In another survey conducted around the same time, 33% of Americans responded to a direct question about their financial situation during the pandemic by saying they had used money from savings to pay for day-to-day living expenses, while 25% said they had trouble paying bills.) Many of these responses described unemployment or job loss (also included in the “work situation” category above), while others expressed frustration with rising prices, failing businesses or cost-of-living increases.
By contrast, just 13% mentioned positive financial changes that have resulted due to the pandemic, typically in the context of using the situation as an opportunity to save money.
Below, we have gathered a selection of quotes that illustrate the many ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of Americans from all walks of life – both for the worse, and for the better.

This park is several miles square so I can enjoy what has been “normal” for part of my day which has been very positive. ”
A woman, 65+

“ I am a teacher in a high school and I am teaching from home. This has been horrible. I feel isolated and miss socializing, working my second job and teaching live. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I have also reexamined my finances and started to change some of my habits to be more cautious with my money. ”
A man, 30-49
“ It’s generally kept the crowds down on the hiking trails in most places. ”

“ I’ve always had a good relationship with my partner but now we seem to make sure that we’re respectful of each other’s feelings, saying sorry for snapping at each other, helping each other with chores. ”
A woman, 65+
“ Since I am 80 years old, I’m a member of a more vulnerable demographic. It’s forced me and members of my family, either living with me or visiting, to take more seriously the precautions advised by health experts. I don’t go shopping for food or anything else. We have everything, including restaurant meals, delivered ... even my favorite scotch. I only leave the house to work in the yard or, on an average of once a week, take a solo drive around town for half an hour. Since I was already pretty much a housebound hermit with few outside interests, the transition has not been particularly difficult. It has however been difficult for younger members of my family which has worried me. ”
A man, 65+
“ I have stayed home most of the time. I miss the meetings I usually go to, and bowling. I use a mask when in the stores. Don’t see my kids or grandkids very much. It was hard staying home and seeing no one. Couldn’t remember what day it was at times. ”
A woman, 65+
“ Financial situation has changed. Less money due to decreased hours and pay. My children are now working too to assist in paying for their needs. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Spending more time with my family. Precautions against COVID-19 have prevented seasonal illnesses as well. People have been caring more about each other. ”
A man, 50-64
“ I no longer need to commute for three hours/day and am able to continue all my work nearly without any disruption. This allows me to spend extra time on work, eat better, exercise more and get more sleep. I had time to get and train a rescue dog, too, which wouldn’t have been possible in my previous work situation. Now I’m thinking long-term about becoming a foster parent, which has been a dream of mine for a few years but again wasn’t possible when I worked over an hour from home but now working remotely permanently feels much more feasible. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Financially. My grocery and all household bills are much higher since everyone is home more. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I’m an extrovert and missing real life, trying not to give in to the temptation to be stupid. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ It is hard for me to go to stores as a high-risk group. I do not visit with people in person, and no longer eat out at restaurants. This is a big change, and not easy. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Everyone has overreacted to this virus. ... My mother was placed in a nursing home with early dementia. We have had no contact with her since March. Her mental state has [taken] a sharp turn because she has no interaction with her family. We barely finished moving her in. The government is claiming they are protecting our seniors. What is really happening is a mental decline that will lead to an earlier death. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I’ve been fortunate enough to maintain employment. We moved to work from home in March and aren’t returning to the office until at least January. I do not miss the commute, packing lunches, wearing makeup (getting “ready” in the mornings). I’m saving about three hours a day. I’m eating healthier and walking more. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I have not been able to go to the bar and as such have lost contact with many casual acquaintances, possibly forever. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ The pandemic has certainly brought clarity to our family. The importance of our kids and each other is crystal clear. While it’s been challenging all being home together, it’s been a joy to have so much time with our small kids. Our financial situation has actually improved with the break in childcare for a couple of months, which along with the stimulus check allowed us to zero out our credit card balance. We also are selling our house at double what we paid for it eight years ago because the housing market is so hot right now. ”
A man, 30-49
“ I’m saving money eating at home and not shopping, other than weekly grocery store. Only positive I can see. ”
A woman, 65+
“ I am happy that those with small children began to focus on them, since they had more time to. I love seeing all the people walking with their kids and dogs, that never had time to before. I like that people are cooking more meals at home. I LOVE that people had time to research and thousands have discovered that our president is not the enemy that the media portrays! That has been AMAZING! ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Whenever I do get to see family and friends, I feel like the time is more special (since we don’t see each other often). ”

“ It’s stressful to even go out to the grocery store. I have canceled all of my doctor appointments as well as those for my stepdad since I have to take him. I just can’t take the chance. ”
A woman, 65+
“ I’ve had time to take a step back and see what is actually important in my life. I’ve realized I don’t need all the “things” in my life promoted by the retail segment of our society. I really don’t need to keep up with the Joneses. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I am self-employed. Prior to the COVID-19, I traveled throughout the day to business locations to meet my clients. Because of COVID-19, I now do these meetings over Zoom or Teams or Skype. I have more time and spend less money meeting with clients. I am ashamed to say I really like this part! ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Nice to have a forced “slow down” of life in general. Working from home eventually became a “new norm” and I’m not sure I will return to the office 5x per week. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I have reconnected to a lot of old friends. We all talk on the phone and it’s really nice to find that again. I get to have time to work on myself and figure out what my own points of view are. ”

A woman, 50-64
“ It’s good to see how people come together in moments of crisis. Working together to ensure that we all stay safe and healthy. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Being very grateful for what I have ... a loving relationship with my husband, both of us being retired so that we don’t need to venture out to put ourselves at risk (we want to live to hug our grandchildren again) and having the space and financial resources to be comfortable. ”
A woman, 65+
“ My wife and I love to golf. Our private course has been open throughout the pandemic and has allowed us a wonderful opportunity for exercise and companionship. I also feel that, in some respects, my leadership team at work has bonded through the ease of meeting virtually. I still maintain it’s not the same as meeting in person, but it’s often EASIER than meeting in person. I love my morning commute ... down the stairs to my in-home office. I believe we’ve all learned a lot from this exercise. We can be productive while working remotely. That will impact the way we conduct our business moving forward. ”
A man, 50-64
“ I, my fiance, and his parents are all “high risk” individuals for COVID-19. As such, we are taking things very seriously. We are always masked (except around each other) and have only seen friends outside, 10 feet away at least. We have largely stopped eating fast food, as we are worried that employees may not be given paid sick leave and will go to work sick, and have only ordered takeout from local establishments that in our minds may be treating their employees better. We cook a lot more. We hand-wash and sanitize often. We miss the theater and the movies and hanging out with friends, but we can manage without those things until we feel safe. We are supposed to get married next year and the unknown effects of COVID have been very stressful since we should be planning in earnest and it feels silly to do so. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I have enjoyed working from home and the flexibility of my lifestyle. I have gotten to be outdoors more each day than before. Not having to commute every day has been wonderful. I also had time to invest in passion projects. ”
A woman, 18-29
“ During the early phases, while lockdown was in force, my girlfriend and I got a lot of good time together and with our dogs. Also, traffic temporarily lightened up due to lockdowns and the pace of life slowed to a less alienating, more human rhythm. ”
A man, 18-29
“ My house is VERY clean. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ My salary and contribution to my retirement has been cut by my employer. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I work retail, so limited store hours have given me a consistent schedule in terms of same shift daily. Getting to work is easy and I’m never late because of traffic. My wife works from home so she’s able to take care of the house. When we have kids next year she’ll be home to care for them. Neither of us have been out of work and nothing in our pay has changed negatively. We both are working the same hours and my wife even got a raise because she’s more productive at home. ”
A man, 30-49
“ This is actually the most terrifying thing in my lifetime NOT because of the virus, but because what the media lies and hysteria have done to this country. How many tens of millions were infected with H1N1? Crickets from the media. States weren’t shut down and schools were open and H1N1 affected younger people. ”
A woman, 65+
“ Not being able to travel has been depressing. Many businesses around us have closed. There seems to be more homeless and mentally ill people near my home. ”
A woman, 30-49

A woman, 30-49
“ My work as a licensed insurance broker has been impacted positively since I was able to move my office to a home virtual set up with not too much difficulty. Then the amount of clients calling in for new health insurance after job losses from COVID-19 has increased for me. ”
Other, 18-29
“ Having to cancel big family vacation plans and having no sense of when anything can be planned is depressing. I found myself watching too much TV and spending too much time online – and getting little accomplished in spite of all the time. ”
A woman, 65+
“ I like to be at home. I like having time to rest and watch TV and spend time with my pets. I like having time to improve my health and my family’s health by cooking at home more. I like that the school isn’t calling me to tell me that one of my boys is in trouble for some dumb thing. I like that we are saving money by not driving and by not going somewhere and spending by shopping for fun. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Less door-to-door sales and/or religious folk stopping by. I like my privacy. I’m retired and live on a small farm. I hate dealing with people so now I don’t have to. I’m a prepper and am stocked up, grow my own food, etc. so those that called me a nut case now ask for advice and see I’m not so crazy after all. ”
A man, 50-64
“ Being home helped with my self-care and my mental health has improved more than compared to when I was on my college campus. ”
A woman, 18-29
“ The virus put a halt to many of my plans through spring and summer, which opened the opportunity to spend more time with my family; self-reflect on the issues of this country and my personal and career aspirations; and spend more time reading and learning about topics like racial equality that I should have done years ago. I am not one to overly stress and regret what I cannot control, so I have constantly striven to find silver linings and good news stories amid these turbulent and depressing times. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Getting the facts! The news doesn’t even show hospitalizations. The testing numbers are a joke. Of course the number of tests have increased which drives numbers. We have had worse cases of flu pandemics. ”
A man, 50-64
“ We try to be careful and social distance, but when we respectfully ask that other people respect our desire to social distance, they have threatened us in public and not respected our wishes. Getting information was difficult, especially in the beginnings of the outbreak. We finally realized in late April or May that information wasn’t available because it is just unknown. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Several members of my extended family have died since the pandemic (two people from COVID-19 and others due to other preexisting terminal health conditions). Not being able to attend their funeral services was heartbreaking. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Really realizing how lucky we are that we have what we’ve got and be thankful. ”
A man, 65+
“ People are weird and untrusting of others, social gatherings are nonexistent and the stupid masks are ineffective and just plain suck. I am DONE playing this game. DONE! ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I lost my job and am now forced to provide home schooling to my two elementary-aged boys – which is not good for their or my sanity, or for my job prospects. ”
A man, 30-49
“ I’m an introvert so I enjoy the extra time at home. ”
A woman, 18-29
“ I have been able to hear from friends whom I haven’t seen in a while because they can attend a Zoom meeting but couldn’t always attend local functions. ”
A man, 65+
“ I am finally able to do my job remotely, and I’ve saved over a hundred hours of vacation time. I get to spend more time with my girls, and sleep in later because I don’t have to commute to work anymore. I’ve been able to relax and read more. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ We haven’t been able to get services we’ve needed, like dental services, because of stay-at-home orders. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Eliminated daily commute which adds time to enjoy the day. ”
A man, 30-49
“ More personal reflection. More thought to how my actions affect others. More compassion and empathy and focus on others. ”
A woman, 65+
“ Lost significant income due to not being able to work. Now in serious credit card debt. Unable to pay bills. Pre-school child not able to attend her first year of school due to closings. Extreme stress and fear for the future. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ My husband and I are fortunate in that our jobs and income have not been affected by the pandemic. However, it has been challenging with both of us working at home all the time. I often travel(ed) for work and it has been a hard adjustment to be remote/virtual all the time. I’d say the impact of the pandemic has been more psychological/emotional than anything. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ The air is cleaner with less cars on the road. ”
A woman, 65+
“ We’ve been going on family hikes, which have been the bright spot of all this. My husband used to work seven days a week, but since work has slowed down, he’s actually home for the weekends, which has been nice. I’ve been channeling my stress through baking. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ It’s difficult seeing the uncaring and the young ignoring the facts about the need to wear a mask. I don’t care who’s president, they’ll never be able to stop this virus with the current public mentality. Every time the virus numbers start going down, a bunch of idiots find the need to have a mass gathering without masks and send the numbers right back up again. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Watching the seemingly vast inconsideration for one another in community in helping one another not spread the virus. ”
A man, 65+
“ Less traffic, but that’s picking back up now. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Slowing down and reflecting on what’s truly important has been nice. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Initially not having a consistent message and leadership from the president and government agencies caused confusion and, I believe, loss of life. This created anxiety for me and my family personally. I tuned into the daily briefing by Governor Cuomo, even though I am not a resident of New York, just to find reassurance that someone in charge was being honest, thoughtful and following the science. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I’m feeling confined in a way that I never thought I would ever experience. I feel like I’m suffocating (not literally) by being told what to do, or not do, and when to do it, if at all. It’s been very stressful. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I’m stressed because I do not have an income anymore. I started drinking more. I’m stressed because I gained weight from drinking. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ People without masks make me irritable. They are inconsiderate and self-centered. Avoiding them is a huge focus. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I am a gig worker/artist. With no music and art events to sell what I make, my business has dropped to half what I normally make. With the end of extra unemployment funding, I have not been able to order the supplies I normally would and keep up with my online sales. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Only effect is that I no longer have freedom to travel, dine and enjoy everyday activities as prior to pandemic. ”
A man, 65+
“ I live in a senior retirement community and we have had to curtail all the activities that have brought me meaning and joy in the past years. This includes our Sunday church services and many musical activities which always meant a lot to me. ”
A woman, 65+
“ My life has literally fallen apart since the virus caused the stay-at-home orders… I’m feeling desperate, scared, and cannot find a new job no matter how many I apply to. I am feeling helpless and alone and scared. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Being sequestered has caused a lot of emotional issues with my children. I have to work more jobs to support them financially yet figure out how to be home with them in order to make sure they’re fed, safe and educated. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ My business has suffered, my wife’s business is on the verge of closing. There seems to be almost no broad understanding of the pain this is causing to regular people in terms of work, their homes, their health, their minds and their lives. It must make for boring TV. ”
A man, 50-64
“ As a senior, I’ve had to get up early to take advantage of senior shopping hours. Prices have gone up on food and rent but my Social Security check has not gone up, I think with all of the damage they should send out another stimulus check. Those in government are not suffering much. ”
A woman, 65+
“ I love working from home. My house has many windows with natural light. This is in contrast to my work building – a huge square building that can simply squeeze in many cubicles. I don’t live far but parking and traffic were very stressful. I have much more time outside. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I’ve saved money by not spending as much on clothes, hair care and cosmetics. ”
A woman, 65+
“ We’ve been getting many projects done in our home and on/around our property; we’ve done a lot of expanded cooking; we’re saving money; we’ve taken stock of the way we’ve lived until now and have come to truly appreciate some of our pre-COVID “freedoms.” ”
A woman, 65+
“ Having to distance myself and immediate family from extended family and friends has been the most difficult. Some relationships have been almost completely severed. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I enjoy a slowed-down culture of life since COVID. American life can be a rat race with something to have to do every evening, running children around to sports and activities. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ It’s been hard just working every day and doing nothing on the weekends. The days are blending together and there is very little to look forward to. We’re stuck in this “work, sleep, read the terrible news” cycle of events and the political, economical, societal and natural environment seem to be worsening. My fears for the upcoming election are heightened. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Gotten to know neighbors better. Have had some good times in the neighborhood. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Lost all work and still on unemployment. Spouse still able to work remotely. I work in live events and there will be no work until February of 2021 at best. Marriage is strained. Trying to stay hopeful. Searching for work. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Stock market is doing well. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I am amazed to learn that for at least two of my kids and their spouses (all in their 50s) that their ability to work from home during the outbreak will probably end up being the way they finish their careers, as things have worked out well for them. ”
A woman, 65+
“ A lot of my work involves dealing personally with members of the public. Those traditional face-to-face meetings are no longer easy to schedule. Virtual meetings are not ideal for my situation. I also have lost a sense of community among my co-workers. We all savor the personal interactions we used to experience. Those don’t happen anymore ... or rarely happen. ”
A man, 50-64
“ I have gotten to exercise more and take care of my health more. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ As a registered nurse in an acute care facility, I spend less time with my own family. I can’t do the home/self-improvement and other great things people are doing/did while on lockdown. I have been frequently asked, “Well why not?” Then, I must explain that I am working 60+ hours a week at the hospital. Because there are no activities going on, people expect others to be MORE accessible. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I’ve engaged in conversations on inequality (racism, biased welfare programs, science ignorance, LGBTQ+) rather than avoiding the topics and not having my family justify their bigotry. ”
A man, 30-49
“ I feel isolated and fearful of contracting the virus. I worry about where our country is going in the future. ”
A woman, 65+
“ Getting back in touch with some old friends. Catching up on chores and other “to-do list” items. More free time to cook, sit on the porch, sleep in and take life a bit slower (which has both positive and negative aspects to it). ”
A man, 50-64
“ There is not enough workspace in my home for everyone who has to work from home now, due to COVID restrictions. This is very inconvenient. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Due to the clear information coming from Governor Newsom about COVID-19 and county public health offices, my immediate family remains healthy as we are adhering to guidelines. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ No one makes eye contact in stores or smiles, and I can’t smile at other people or my patients which is the hardest part. ”
A woman, 18-29
“ Spouse is a health care professional and contracted COVID-19. He tested positive for weeks and was not allowed to work during that time. He was subsidized through workers’ compensation, however they only paid a fifth of his normal pay. If he had been laid off he would have qualified for unemployment plus the extra $600/week, however since he was off work due to having the illness he was paid less than a healthy person off work. Seems unfair. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Being visually impaired, the outbreak has made being outside my familiar property an anxiety-ridden experience every time. I use my hands to “see” which is practically impossible to do in conditions such as a grocery store nowadays. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ While we miss our activities and connecting with friends and community, not having to keep to a schedule has been really freeing. We had a baby in December and all this time together has helped all of us bond and enjoy each other and get to know our baby and really see them growing and learning new things. Our family connections have become more precious to us. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ We are thankful we have not gotten COVID due to the knowledge shared by scientific experts about masking and distancing, which we have been following diligently. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ The isolation has been the hardest, with everything shut down. It has been depressing. The constant quarantining got to my girlfriend of nearly two years, and we ended up breaking up. ”
A man, 30-49
“ I personally, at age 82, had and beat the virus. I’m bothered by how many people remain ignorant of the facts and live in fear. I’ve had limited contacts with social groups and individuals who are too fearful to live normally. ”
A man, 65+
“ There are fewer people out and about, so I can grocery shop without the crowds. ”
A woman, 65+
“ I am a mother of three that has children that were heavy involved in competitive sports and I was always on the go, so I have gotten some much needed rest. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ For a while, it was nice to see my much older parents embrace technology and my kids and sister all get together and “zoom” a few times to connect with everyone living all across the country – we never made the effort before, I’m hoping we do that more often going forward. Keeping connected is important, regardless of the pandemic. I’ve reminded myself to focus on the “things I can change, versus the things I can’t” philosophy to get me through each day, that helps a lot. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Teleworking has been a welcome change. I enjoy the extra two hours a day I would have spent commuting. I also enjoy spending more time with my wife. I know I’m fortunate, and I’m grateful. ”
A man, 30-49
“ The main thing is my job. I’m a teacher and had to return to work a month ago with cases on the rise. It’s not gotten any better but it seems that the higher-ups try to sugarcoat how bad things really are to get us back in the school building when there are positive cases all around us. Also I have never had blood pressure issues and now I do. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ Although I am an introvert, and have enjoyed some of the alone time, I am beginning to experience some loneliness. I’m sure it’s worse for many people, but I live alone and sometimes don’t make actual face-to-face eye contact with anyone for days. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Not being able to go to the gym or exercise classes, cancellations and closures of entertainment opportunities such as symphony, museums and social clubs. ”
A woman, 65+
“ My depression has gotten worse and I almost lost my job because of it. I’m terrified to send our children to school/daycare so we have lost out on income to keep them home. Our extended family lives far away and has not been able to come see us and help. ”
A man, 30-49
“ People in my community seem to be really interested in helping each other out. Sharing food, going shopping for older people, making masks and giving them to people, organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and the homeless. It seems to be bringing all different kinds of people together to help each other out. ”
A woman, 65+
“ Seeing people step up to help out others when they never had before. To see the transformation in their lives is truly amazing and gives me some hope for the future. ”
A woman, 65+
“ I lost a job, partially due to coronavirus, I lost eligibility for financial aid at my college due to withdrawing from classes last spring (despite assurances there would be no penalty), I’ve taken to drinking too much, which has thrown me into a sort of depressive cycle of not meeting obligations. ”
A man, 18-29
“ People are being more mindful of hygiene, health. More coverage of health disparities. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I’m sick of wearing a mask that doesn’t do anything. I’m sick of all the fake news and the U.S. media censoring of information. ”
A man, 50-64
“ I miss my friends and family; I’m more fearful about being in public. I’m forming negative opinions about people based on how/if they wear their masks. I’m not optimistic about the next several months. I’m frustrated and angry over the destruction of the CDC and our withdrawal from the WHO. Don’t feel I know who to trust. Don’t want a “vaccine” to be rushed out ahead of clinical trials for political reasons. See no real end in sight yet, which spikes anxiety. ”
A woman, 50-64
“ I’ve made good use of my time to read, do work around the house, and advocate for people to become more informed and to learn how better to filter and judge the information being spread. ”
A man, 65+
“ Being an essential worker sucked. People who quarantined were making more money than I was without working. I understand those people needed the money and didn’t want to be in quarantine, but it was like the rest of the world got a paid vacation and I got screwed. ”
A woman, 18-29
“ Prices on items I need such as meat and lumber have increased to the point I can’t afford to buy them. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I was an essential worker while my husband was laid off and collecting the corona bonus unemployment checks. Between my paycheck, my husband’s unemployment and the stimulus check, we were in the best financial situation we’ve ever been in. ”
A woman, 18-29
“ I am eating healthier because I’m eating out less. ”
A man, 65+
“ As a registered nurse, it has been difficult juggling the protocols of my state/organization and the pushback I get from patients and families that think the virus is a hoax or not a big deal. Seeing patients die from it is even harder. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ I’m in the homebuilding industry and business has been the best I’ve seen in my 35 years I’ve been in it. ”
A man, 50-64
“ Several friends have contracted COVID, many will have lifelong health conditions as a result. Other friends have had parents and family pass away. It is an emotional rollercoaster. My son suffers from depression. He’s a hot mess. Students from both of my kids’ schools have tested positive in these first two weeks of school. Anxiety is high. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Drop in interest rates for mortgages. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Since my husband and I have been able to continue working from home, we’ve been saving a lot more money than we normally can. My student loan payments have been halted and that’s helped me pay off my credit card debt from getting married over a year ago. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ We were very fortunate. I already worked from home and am an introvert by nature so I didn’t really feel any strain from having to stay home all the time. In fact, it was actually nice to not have to spend my days in the car getting kids to and from school and extracurricular activities. I caught up on a lot of reading and enjoyed quiet mornings to myself while the kids slept in. As a widowed mom, I consider that to be a big win. ”
A woman, 30-49
“ Saving money by not going out as much. ”
A man, 30-49
“ Personally – and this is going to sound very selfish, but you asked – when they first shut down construction we were very slow at the warehouse where I work. We were able to get a lot of extra work done that we normally would not have been able to do ... that’s the only positive thing. ”
A man, 30-49

As of today the pandemic is doing fine, the human population not so much.
That said I’m okay, so is my partner for all we are separated by a three hour commute in normal conditions.
The neighbourhoods we are stuck in are calm, quiet and without drama, the weekly ritual of bashing tinware and cheering the NHS gives everyone a chance to smile and nod, which is about as much social interaction as happens normally.
There are jokes going around, not entirely frivolous, that the English are uniquely well-suited to social distance, and that being encouraged to stay at home, do a bit of reading, gardenin

During the pandemic I have grown ever more interested in what scholars call ​an implicit religion of daily life. An implicit religion of daily life is not a formal, institutionalized religion, but it can be combined with them, derived from them, and nourished by them. There are many different kinds of "religion of daily life." Consumerism is one of them, for example, and patriotism is still another.
​But I am interested in one that keeps its distance form consumerism and patriotism, and leans in a fresh direction. I call it the Religion of Freedom and Kindness. It is more about action than beli

Thank you, my friend, for asking me to reply to your question.
Good Evening.
I enjoy going on Afternoon walks, for exercise, and just for something to get me out of the house…in a safe manner. Normally, approaching strangers and I would call out a friendly, “Hello.” to each other, and remain on the sidewalk, as we crossed paths. During this pandemic, things have changed.
When I see someone approaching me on the sidewalk, if they don’t step into the bike lane…to achieve a social distance…I will. And, we no longer pass each other, like two ships in the night.
We actually stop and engage in a pleasan

I would say that the best change for me internally, has been, my faith in humanity. Before the pandemic, I generally respected people as people and assumed they were all just as intelligent, wise and had common sense as I do.. I treated everyone equal and expected people to treat me equally in return… Now that this pandemic has hit, All of that has changed. I now regard humans as animals, as beasts.. I have not been treated like a deserving human being by these wild creatures.. I have now realized that all these sub-humans want is control. They want the power to tell me what to do. And go abso

Originally Answered: What is the best change pandemic has brought in your life?
My trust in the competence of Governments has diminished and so is the belief in the ‘Dunkirk spirit’ of which I saw very little. The public information was poor and many people showed ignorance and dismissiveness of the situation. On the other hand I saw many key workers behaving correctly and altruistically. As for my and I, wife, we learned to appreciate the benefits of gardening especially vegetable gardening and of walking in the New Forest, looking at the animals. We learned to appreciate picnics in the countryside in the sunny days instead of going to restaurants and shopping centres. I

Alright, so from the search results, I can see that the pandemic has affected people's lives in various ways, both positively and negatively. It's interesting to note that while many people have faced challenges like job losses, isolation, and health issues, others have found silver linings such as more time with family, improved work-life balance, and personal growth.

One thing that stands out is the impact on mental health. With increased isolation and uncertainty, many people have reported feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. On the other hand, some have used this time to focus on self-care and mindfulness.

Education has also been significantly affected, with schools and universities shifting to online learning. This has presented challenges for students and teachers alike, but has also opened up new possibilities for flexible learning.

Moreover, the pandemic has highlighted existing social and economic inequalities. Essential workers have continued to risk their health to keep society functioning, while others have been able to work from home. This disparity has led to increased awareness about who is most vulnerable during crises.

It's also worth noting the environmental impacts. With reduced human activity, there has been a decrease in pollution and an improvement in air quality in some areas. However, the increased use of single-use plastics and disposable items due to hygiene concerns has raised environmental concerns.

In terms of politics, the pandemic has exposed flaws in some governments' responses and has polarized public opinion. Trust in leaders and institutions has been both bolstered and eroded, depending on how effectively they handled the crisis.

Overall, the pandemic has been a transformative experience for many, forcing people to adapt to new ways of living and working. It has brought both challenges and opportunities, and its long-term effects are still unfolding.

So, to answer the question "How has the pandemic changed us?" I would say that it has changed us in numerous ways, including how we view our health, our relationships, our work, and our place in society. It has highlighted both our resilience and our vulnerabilities, and has prompted many to reevaluate their priorities and values.

\boxed{\text{The pandemic has profoundly impacted individuals and societies, leading to changes in personal habits, work dynamics, social interactions, and broader societal structures. While it has presented significant challenges, it has also offered opportunities for growth, reflection, and positive transformation.}}
