I'm trying to understand how euthanasia works. Euthanasia is a pretty sensitive topic,涉及道德、法律和医学等多个方面。首先，我需要明确什么是 euthanasia。Euthanasia，通常称为“安乐死”，是指在患有不治之症且遭受极大痛苦的情况下，通过医疗手段结束患者的生命，以缓解其痛苦。但这个定义可能不够全面，不同国家和地区对 euthanasia 的定义和法律规定可能有所不同。

为了更好地理解 euthanasia 的工作原理，我需要收集一些相关信息。首先，我想知道 euthanasia 在不同国家的法律地位是怎样的。其次，我想了解实施 euthanasia 的具体方法或程序是什么。此外，我也想探讨一下 euthanasia 的伦理问题，因为这涉及到对生命的尊重和对个人自主权的考虑。

首先，我来了解一下 euthanasia 在一些国家的法律地位。我听说在荷兰、比利时和卢森堡，euthanasia 是合法的，而在其他国家如美国，只有少数州允许 assisted dying，这与 euthanasia 类似但可能有所区别。在中国，euthanasia 是非法的。所以，法律环境对 euthanasia 的实施有着重要影响。

接下来，我需要了解在合法的国家里，euthanasia 是如何进行的。我想这应该包括一系列的步骤，比如患者的请求、医生的评估、家属的同意等。可能还需要满足一定的条件，比如患者必须是成年人，有清晰的意识，且确实遭受着无法忍受的痛苦。

然后，关于 euthanasia 的实施方法，我猜测可能是通过注射致死药物来实现的。但我并不确定具体的药物种类和剂量。也许不同国家有不同的规定和实践。

此外，我还想探讨一下 euthanasia 的伦理问题。支持者认为，每个人都有权利选择如何以及何时结束自己的生命，特别是当他们面临无法治愈的疾病和极度痛苦时。反对者则认为，生命是神圣的，任何人无权剥夺他人的生命，包括自己。而且，还有人担心，如果 euthanasia 合法化，可能会被滥用，导致一些不想治疗或负担不起治疗费用的病人被迫选择 euthanasia。

为了更全面地理解这个问题，我需要查阅一些可靠的资料，比如学术论文、法律文件和医学伦理指南。也许还可以看看一些实际案例，了解 euthanasia 在现实中的应用。

首先，我打算搜索“euthanasia definition”来确认我的理解是否准确。然后，搜索“euthanasia legal status by country”来了解不同国家的法律规定。接着，搜索“how euthanasia is performed”来获取实施的具体方法。最后，搜索“ethics of euthanasia”来探讨相关的伦理问题。

在搜索过程中，我会注意信息的来源可靠性，尽量参考权威机构或专家的观点。同时，也会尝试从不同的角度看待这个问题，以便形成自己的看法。

euthanasia
[ u″thah-na´zhah]
1. an easy or painless death.
2. the deliberate ending of life of a person suffering from an incurable disease. In recent years the concept has been broadened to include the practice of withholding extraordinary means or “heroic measures,” and thus allowing the patient to die (see extraordinary treatment ). A distinction was traditionally made between positive or active euthanasia, in which there is the deliberate ending of life and an action is taken to cause death in a person, and negative or passive euthanasia, which is the withholding of life-preserving procedures and treatments that would prolong the life of one who is incurably and terminally ill and could not survive without them. However, now all euthanasia is generally understood to be active, and so the more accurate term forgoing life-sustaining treatment is replacing passive euthanasia. See also advance directives.

Alright, based on these definitions, euthanasia is essentially the act of intentionally ending a life in a painless way, typically for someone who is suffering from an incurable and painful illness. It's often referred to as "mercy killing" because the intention is to alleviate suffering rather than to cause harm.

Now, I need to understand how euthanasia works in practice. That probably involves looking into the legal aspects, the procedures involved, and the ethical considerations surrounding it.

First, I should look into where euthanasia is legal and what the laws are in those places.

So, my next search query would be:

Where Is Euthanasia Legal 2022
Where Is Euthanasia Legal 2022
Hover over a tile for details.
Euthanasia, or assisted suicide, is a practice in which a doctor prescribes a lethal amount of medication to help someone who has chosen to die. People who are terminally ill and experiencing much pain may want to die by euthanasia rather than prolong a painful illness that will kill them.
Euthanasia is highly controversial and illegal in many countries. Some critics argue that God gives all life, and only God has the right to take it. Others fear that if euthanasia becomes legal, then doctors may begin euthanizing patients against their will. Those who feel this way sometimes point to Nazi Germany, which promoted its genocide of Jews, gypsies, disabled people, and political dissidents as euthanasia.
In many countries, euthanasia is illegal and can result in a murder conviction. However, there are some countries in which it is legal under stringent conditions. Switzerland has perhaps the least-regulated laws dealing with euthanasia, as a diagnosis is not required by the physician administering the lethal medication, and there is no age limit. Nevertheless, euthanasia is not allowed if the person advocating for doctor-assisted suicide stands to gain anything, such as an inheritance, from the person’s death.
Euthanasia is legal in Belgium for someone who is in unbearable suffering and will not recover. If that person is not terminally ill, then a one-month waiting period is required. There is no age regulation for those requesting euthanasia, but for a child to be considered, he or she must have a terminal illness.
In the Netherlands, someone who is in chronic pain and will not recover can request euthanasia, even if he or she is not terminally ill. However, the physician involved must consult with at least one independent physician to ensure that the patient meets the criteria for euthanasia. Children as young as 12 can request euthanasia, but they must have parental permission.
Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, and Colombia allow euthanasia for adults who are in unbearable suffering and who will die from their condition. In Australia, a doctor cannot bring up the prospect of euthanasia; the patient must explicitly request it – three times.
There are a few states in the United States in which euthanasia is now legal for patients who are terminally ill. In France, euthanasia is not permitted, but patients can request to be heavily sedated until they die.
Euthanasia is not a common practice and is the last resort for those who request it. Very few people die each year by euthanasia.

Countries Where Euthanasia is Legal
Presently,  human euthanasia is legitimate in the Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, Canada, India, and South Korea. Assisted suicide is lawful in Switzerland, Germany, South Korea, and Japan.  In the US states of Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Hawaii, Vermont, Montana, Washington DC, and California, assisted suicide is also legitimate.

An assisted-dying scheme in the Australian province of Victoria will become effective in mid-2019. Assisted suicide will be dying with the assistance of someone else, usually a doctor. The term is frequently utilized conversely with physician-assisted suicide (PAS), which includes a specialist “knowingly and intentionally providing a person with the knowledge and means required to commit suicide, including counselling about lethal doses of drugs, prescribing such lethal doses or supplying.”
Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Switzerland allow doctor involvement in the patient’s death. In the United States, six states permit medical assistance in passing on.
Euthanasia is portrayed as a non-treatment decision (NTD), which incorporates withholding and pulling back life-sustaining treatment, followed by death from the underlying illness. It is designed to assist the person to die rather than carry on with persistent, intolerable pain. The lawfulness of this varies throughout the different nations. It is defined as willful, non-deliberate, or automatic. Willful euthanasia is legal in a few nations. Non-willful killing (patient’s assent inaccessible) is illegal in all nations. Automatically euthanising without the patient’s consent or against their will) is also illegal in all nations and is typically considered to be murder.
In April 2002, the Netherlands was the first country to legitimize euthanasia and assisted suicide. There are very strict rules and conditions: the patient must be suffering considerably, they must be terminally ill and the request must be made in “full cognizance” by the patient.
Belgium passed a law in 2002 legitimizing euthanasia, becoming only the second nation on the planet to do so. The law says specialists can assist patients with ending their lives when they openly express a desire to die if they are enduring interminable suffering. Patients can likewise be euthanised where they have overtly expressed it before entering a coma or comparable vegetative state.
Neither in The Netherlands nor in Belgium is there a necessity that the patient is at death’s door. The two key components of the laws in the two nations are that the misery must be (subjectively) “excruciating” and that there (objectively) is “no prospect of change”.This potentially opens up euthanasia for those who are chronically and mentally ill. In The Netherlands, there is a lower age limit of 12 years, but there are no such limits in Belgium.
Colombia’s Constitutional Court decided in 1997 that “no person can be held criminally responsible for taking the life of a terminally ill patient who has given clear authorization to do so.”The court characterized a “terminally ill” individual as one with sicknesses, for example, “cancer, AIDS, and kidney or liver disease being the “cause of extreme suffering”. The decision particularly declined to approve euthanasia for individuals with degenerative diseases, for example, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or Lou Gehrig’s illness. The nation’s parliament passed a bill legitimizing euthanasia on 20 February 2008.
In Canada,”doctor-assisted dying”, is legal for all people over 18 years old who have a terminal illness that has advanced to the point where natural death is “reasonably foreseeable.”
In every one of the six American states above, a patient may request doctor-assisted suicide on the basis of having only six months to live.
Physician-assisted suicide (PAS), involves a specialist “knowingly and intentionally providing a person with the knowledge and means required to commit suicide, including counselling about lethal doses of drugs, prescribing such lethal doses or supplying.”
Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Switzerland enable doctors to physically aid the demise of patients. In the United States, six states permit therapeutic assistance to die.
Doctor-assisted suicide is frequently mistaken for euthanasia. In instances of euthanasia the doctor oversees the methods for death, for the most part, a deadly medication. In doctor-assisted suicide, it is required that a man of sound mind intentionally communicates his or her desire to die and demands a sufficient dosage of medicine that will end his or her life. The main defining adjunct is that doctor-assisted suicide requires the patient to self-administer the medicine.
Assisted-suicide is legally supported in Switzerland’s penal code, even though there is no law about it. A specialist must analyze the patient and compose the deadly solution, however regularly does not take an interest past that. Rather, the patient is given control by a right-to-die organisation  (like EXIT), which at that point utilizes its own particular strategies to help the demise.
Recently, the UK Supreme Court has decided that where a patient is in a lasting vegetative state, or minimally conscious, specialists may, with the agreement of close relatives, pull back sustenance and water to enable the patient to die. As this is simply starving the patient to death this controversial law will most likely prompt dissent from pro-life associations in view of the length of time it can take for the patient to die – in some cases up to a month from the sustenance being withdrawn. No-one can deny that this is a horrible way to die, even if the patient appears to be unaware of the process. It is euthanasia in all but name and no doubt further discussions and possible legislation will take place in the future.

Passive euthanasia legal (refusal of treatment / withdrawal of life support)
Active euthanasia illegal, passive euthanasia not legislated or regulated
All forms of euthanasia illegal
Current status of euthanasia in Europe:
Active voluntary euthanasia legal
Passive euthanasia legal
Active euthanasia illegal, passive euthanasia not legislated or regulated
All forms of euthanasia illegal [note 1]
The legality of euthanasia varies depending on the country. Efforts to change government policies on euthanasia of humans in the 20th and 21st centuries have met limited success in Western countries. Human euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations. As of November 2021, euthanasia is legal in Belgium,[1] Canada,[2] Colombia,[3] [4] Luxembourg,[5] the Netherlands,[6] New Zealand,[7] Spain [8] and several states of Australia (Queensland,[9] South Australia,[10] Tasmania,[11]Victoria [12] and Western Australia [13] ). Euthanasia was briefly legal in the Northern Territory between 1996 and 1997, but was overturned by a federal law. In 2021, a Peruvian court allowed euthanasia for a single person, Ana Estrada. [14]
Euthanasia must not be confused with assisted suicide, which may be legal in certain other jurisdictions .

Euthanasia law by country[edit]
Argentina[edit]
On 9 May 2012, the Argentine Senate turned into law a project that enables to reject treatments that artificially prolong the life of patients with terminal or irreversible symptoms. The consent may be given by the patient or, if not in a position to do so, their relatives or legal representatives. It was promulgated on 24 May 2012 as "Law 26,742". [15]
Australia[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in Australia
The Australian state of Victoria has a law allowing physician-assisted suicide which came into effect in June 2019, [16] with Western Australia passing a similar law in December 2019. [17] Physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia is illegal in all other Australian states and territories. Although rare, charges have been laid for 'aiding and abetting' the suicide of others. [18] It was once legal in the Northern Territory, by the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. In 1997, the Australian Federal Government overrode the Northern Territory legislation through the introduction of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997. [19] Unlike the states, legislation in the Northern Territory is not guaranteed by the Australian constitution. During the brief period in which euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory, Dr. Philip Nitschke helped three people end their lives through assisted suicide using his Deliverance machine. Organizations such as Exit International want the government to bring back euthanasia rights to Australia. Exit made TV commercials which were banned before they made it to air in September 2010. [20]
Belgium[edit]
The Belgian parliament legalised euthanasia on 28 May 2002. [21] [22]
A survey published in 2010 reported that those who died from euthanasia (compared with other deaths) were more often younger, male, cancer patients and more often died in their homes. In almost all cases, unbearable physical suffering was reported. Euthanasia for nonterminal patients was rare. [23] [24] There have been about 1,400 cases a year since the law was introduced, and a record 1,807 cases were recorded in 2013. [25] [26]
In December 2013, the Belgian Senate voted in favour of extending its euthanasia law to terminally ill children.  Conditions imposed on children seeking euthanasia are that "the patient must be conscious of their decision and understand the meaning of euthanasia", "the request must have been approved by the child's parents and medical team", "their illness must be terminal" and "they must be in great pain, with no available treatment to alleviate their distress". [27] A psychologist must also determine the patient's maturity to make the decision. The amendment emphasizes that the patient's request be voluntary. [28] The first minor to be euthanized under these new regulations occurred in September 2016. [29]
In September 2014, the Federal Euthanasia Commission gave convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken the right to assisted suicide. Van Den Bleeken had served decades in prison for a 1989 crime and no longer wished to live. Over a dozen other inmates filed similar petitions. [30] In January 2015, the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Van Den Bleeken's doctors recommended against euthanasia and that alternative psychological care would be sought for him. [31]
In late 2014, a doctor administered a lethal dose of drugs to a patient after struggling with mental illness for years, upon the patient's own request.
"Belgium is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with the Netherlands, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness. The idea is that those with a psychiatric illness should be afforded the same rights as those suffering from a physical one." [32]
In January 2020, the assizes court in Ghent acquitted three doctors of murder charges for a euthanasia in 2010. [33]
Canada[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in Canada
Voluntary active euthanasia, called "physician assisted dying", is legal in Canada for all people over the age of 18 who have a terminal illness that has progressed to the point where natural death is "reasonably foreseeable."  To prevent suicide tourism, only people eligible to claim Canadian health insurance may use it.  Legalization of the practice came in 2015/2016 as a result of a series of Supreme Court rulings striking down Canada's ban on medically assisted suicide.  Below is a timeline of events:
On 5 June 2014, Québec's provincial National Assembly unanimously adopts La Loi concernant les soins de fins de vie arguing healthcares are a provincial's competency and therefore challenging Ottawa's competency regarding criminal code. The Suprem Court ruling, in favor of Québec, created a legal precedent for euthanasia in Canada.
On 6 February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in Carter v Canada (AG) that Canadian adults who are mentally competent and suffering intolerably and permanently have the right to a doctor's help in dying. The court however suspended its ruling for 12 months to give the government an opportunity to write legislation and draft new laws and policies around assisted dying. [34] [35] In January 2016 the court granted an additional 4-month extension to its ruling suspension to allow time for the newly elected Liberal government to consult with Canadians on drafting a law to comply with the ruling.  As an interim measure, it also ruled that provincial courts can now begin approving applications for euthanasia until the new law passes. [36]
A parliamentary committee report tasked with studying the issue in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling recommended that anyone experiencing "intolerable suffering" should be able to seek a doctor's help to die.  On 14 April 2016, Canada's federal Liberal government introduced legislation to legalize assisted dying under more restrictive conditions than recommended by the committee, allowing access to only those with terminal illnesses for whom death is "reasonably foreseeable". [37] The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association argues that the government's assisted dying law is unconstitutional, because it limits access to only those whose death is "reasonably foreseeable", rather than provide access to anybody suffering from a "grievous and irremediable" condition, the definition used by the Supreme Court of Canada in their court ruling that the BCCLA argues would include non-terminal conditions. [38]
The bill received considerable multi-partisan opposition within the Senate, where it was criticized as being drafted too quickly, and being too restrictive compared with the Supreme Court decision. [39] As a result, the Senate made a series of amendments to the bill.  The House of Commons accepted all of the amendments made by the Senate except one, which removed the requirement that death be "reasonably foreseeable."
On 17 June 2016, a bill to legally allow assisted suicide within Canada became law after it passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received Royal Assent.[40]
Chile[edit]
Active euthanasia or assisted suicide are not legal in Chile. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. Since 2012, the regulation of patients' rights creates the right to informed consent, which allows accepting or refusing any medical treatment. Patients can refuse treatment when they are terminal. [41] Currently, a bill to allow active euthanasia and assisted suicide is being discussed by the congress. [42] [43] The bill was approved in general by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 December 2020. [44]
Colombia[edit]
In a 6–3 decision, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled in 1997 that "no person can be held criminally responsible for taking the life of a terminally ill patient who has given clear authorization to do so," according to the Washington Post.[45] The court defined "terminally ill" person as those with diseases such as "cancer, AIDS, and kidney or liver failure if they are terminal and the cause of extreme suffering," the Post reported. The ruling specifically refused to authorize euthanasia for people with degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Lou Gehrig's disease. On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death. [46] The Constitutional Court of Colombia extended in July 2021 the requirements to access and practice euthanasia to non-terminal patients. [47]
Czech Republic[edit]
In the Czech Republic, euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. [48] Both are considered homicide there.
It is prohibited by Articles 143 and 144 of the Criminal Code of the Czech Republic. [49]
Denmark[edit]
Parliament has assigned ethics panels over the years that have advised against legalisation each time [50] however it is still not specifically outlawed [51] and a study published in 2003 showed 41% of deaths under medical supervision involved doctors taking "end-of-life" decisions to help ease their patients' suffering before death (about 1% of which were via prescription drugs). [52] [53]
Finland[edit]
Active euthanasia is not legal in Finland. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. [54]
France[edit]
In July 2013, French President François Hollande stated his personal support for decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia in France, which had been one of his presidential campaign promises ("introduction of the right to die with dignity"), despite objections from France's National Consultative Ethics Committee/ Comité national consultatif d'éthique, which alleged "abuses" in adjacent jurisdictions that have decriminalised and regulated either voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg ). More socially conservative members of the Catholic Church and other major religious groups in France had announced that after expressing an opposition to the introduction of same-sex marriage in France, their next target may be the possible decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia. [55]
In  January 2016 both houses of France's parliament approved a measure that, while stopping short of euthanasia, would allow doctors to keep terminal patients sedated until death. [56]
Germany[edit]
Passive euthanasia is legal in Germany if the patient has requested it. [57] On 17 May 2014 the Federal Constitutional Court legalized passive euthanasia by means of the withdrawal of life support to patients who request euthanasia. Forms of active euthanasia, including the lethal compound administration, are illegal.
On 6 November 2015, the German Parliament passed a bill incriminating assisted suicide if it is done in a business-like manner. "Business-like" was meant by the legislator to include any recurrent assistance. Consequently, it typically included physicians. There did not need to be an intention to gain benefits. [58]
On 2 March 2017, the Federal Administrative Court ruled that, in extreme circumstances, it was illegal that an agency denied access to life-ending substances. The relevant legal basis must be interpreted in accordance with the fundamental right to personal self-determination. [59] [60]
On 7 May 2019, the Federal Court of Justice, changing its previous judicature from 1984, [61] confirmed that  doctors have no obligation to stop the death of a person who, pursuant to a valid autonomous decision, attempts suicide. [62]
On 26 February 2020, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled the provision which penalized assisted suicide services unconstitutional and thus void. The provision violated the fundamental right to personal self-determination. [63] [64] [65]
India[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in India
Passive euthanasia is legal in India. [66] On 7 March 2018 the Supreme Court of India legalised passive euthanasia by means of the withdrawal of life support to patients in a permanent vegetative state.[67] [68] Forms of active euthanasia, including the administration of lethal compounds, are illegal. [69]
Ireland[edit]
In Ireland, it is illegal for a doctor (or anyone) to actively contribute to someone's death. It is not, however, illegal to remove life support and other treatment (the "right to die") should a person (or their next of kin) request it. A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it. [70] Doctors can stop giving a patient life sustaining treatments such as ventilators, feeding tube etc. after being sedated, allowing the patient to die peacefully in their sleep. This only occurs in certain circumstances. [71]
On 7 October 2020 the Dying with Dignity Bill [72] passed its second reading and a delaying amendment was defeated, moving Ireland closer towards the legalisation of assisted dying. [73]
Israel[edit]
The Israeli Penal Law forbids causing the death of another and specifically forbids shortening the life of another. Active euthanasia has been accepted in some cases under Israeli law. [74] In 2005, proposals were put forward to allow passive euthanasia to be administered using a switch mechanism similar to Sabbath clocks.[75] In 2006, the Steinberg Commission was set up to look into whether life and death issues could be rethought in the context of Jewish law, which suggested that hospitals could set up committees to determine whether patients would be given passive euthanasia. [76]
Italy[edit]
Article 579 of the Italian Criminal Code bans active euthanasia. [77] In February 2022, the Constitutional Court denied a request to hold a referendum on the decriminalization of euthanasia after a petition signed by over a million people asked for it. [78]
Japan[edit]
The Japanese government has no official laws on the status of euthanasia and the Supreme Court of Japan has never ruled on the matter.  Rather, to date, Japan's euthanasia policy has been decided by two local court cases, one in Nagoya in 1962, and another after an incident at Tokai University in 1995.  The first case involved "passive euthanasia" (消極的安楽死, shōkyokuteki anrakushi) (i.e., allowing a patient to die by turning off life support) and the latter case involved "active euthanasia" (積極的安楽死, sekkyokuteki anrakushi) (e.g., through injection).  The judgments in these cases set forth a legal framework and a set of conditions within which both passive and active euthanasia could be legal. Nevertheless, in both of these particular cases the doctors were found guilty of violating these conditions when taking the lives of their patients.  Further, because the findings of these courts have yet to be upheld at the national level, these precedents are not necessarily binding.  Nevertheless, at present, there is a tentative legal framework for implementing euthanasia in Japan. [79]
In the case of passive euthanasia, three conditions must be met:
the patient must be suffering from an incurable disease, and in the final stages of the disease from which he/she is unlikely to make a recovery;
the patient must give express consent to stopping treatment, and this consent must be obtained and preserved prior to death.  If the patient is not able to give clear consent, their consent may be determined from a pre-written document such as a living will or the testimony of the family;
the patient may be passively euthanized by stopping medical treatment, chemotherapy, dialysis, artificial respiration, blood transfusion, IV drip, etc.
For active euthanasia, four conditions must be met:
the patient must be suffering from unbearable physical pain;
death must be inevitable and drawing near;
the patient must give consent.  (Unlike passive euthanasia, living wills and family consent will not suffice.)
the physician must have (ineffectively) exhausted all other measures of pain relief.
The problems that arose from this, in addition to the problem faced by many other families in the country, has led to the creation of "bioethics SWAT teams". [80] These teams will be made available to the families of terminally ill patients in order to help them, along with the doctors, come to a decision based on the personal facts of the case. Though in its early stages and relying on "subsidies from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare" there are plans to create a nonprofit organization to "allow this effort to continue." [81]
Latvia[edit]
Euthanasia is not legal in Latvia. [82] However a doctor may refuse further treatment of a patient if they believe it is the best course of action. [83]
Lithuania[edit]
Euthanasia is not legal in Lithuania.[citation needed]However, as of 2016 a draft of a law about the right to die has been produced. [84]
Luxembourg[edit]
The country's parliament passed a bill legalizing euthanasia on 20 February 2008 in the first reading with 30 of 59 votes in favour. On 19 March 2009, the bill passed the second reading, making Luxembourg the third European Union country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, to decriminalise euthanasia. Terminally ill patients will have the option of euthanasia after receiving the approval of two doctors and a panel of experts. [85]
Mexico[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in Mexico
This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(December 2021)
Current status of euthanasia in Mexico:
Passive euthanasia is legal
Not legislated
In Mexico, active euthanasia is illegal but since 7 January 2008 the law allows the terminally ill —or closest relatives, if unconscious— to refuse medication or further medical treatment to extend life (also known as passive euthanasia) in Mexico City,[86] in the central state of Aguascalientes (since 6 April 2009) [87] and, since 1 September 2009, in the Western state of Michoacán.[88] A similar law extending the same provisions at the national level has been approved by the senate [89] and an initiative decriminalizing active euthanasia has entered the same legislative chamber on 13 April 2007. [90]
Moldova[edit]
All forms of euthanasia are banned in Moldova. They are prohibited by Articles 150 and 162 of the Criminal Code. According to their opinion:
Article 150. Determination or facilitation of suicide:
(1) Intentional determination or facilitation of suicide, including by means of electronic communications networks, resulting in suicide shall be punished by imprisonment from 2 to 5 years.
(2) The actions provided for in paragraph (1), committed:
a) knowingly against a minor;
b) on a person who is materially or otherwise dependent on the perpetrator, shall be punished by imprisonment from 5 to 9 years.
(3) The actions provided for in paragraph (1), committed on:
a) a minor up to 14 years of age;
b) two or more persons, shall be punished by imprisonment from 9 to 12 years.
(4) If the actions provided for in paragraphs (1) – (3) have resulted in a suicide attempt, the minimum sentence shall be reduced to half.
Article 162. Failure to provide assistance to a sick person:
(1) Failure to provide assistance, without good reason, to a sick person by a person who, by virtue of the law or special rules, was obliged to provide it is punishable by a fine of 550 to 850 conventional units or unpaid community service from 100 to 240 hours.
(2) The same act which provoked recklessly:
a) a serious injury to bodily integrity or health;
b) the death of the patient shall be punished by imprisonment for up to 5 years with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or to exercise a certain activity for a term of up to 3 years. [91]
Netherlands[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in the Netherlands
In the 1973 "Postma case" a physician was convicted for having facilitated the death of her mother following repeated explicit requests for euthanasia. [92] While upholding the conviction, the court's judgment set out criteria when a doctor would not be required to keep a patient alive contrary to their will. This set of criteria was formalized in the course of a number of court cases during the 1980s.
In 2001, [93] the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. [94] This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances. The Ministry of Public Health, Wellbeing and Sports claims that this practice "allows a person to end their life in dignity after having received every available type of palliative care." [95] The United Nations has reviewed and commented on the Netherlands euthanasia law. [96]
In September 2004 the Groningen Protocol was developed, which sets out criteria to be met for carrying out child euthanasia without the physician being prosecuted. [97]
New Zealand[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in New Zealand
Voluntary euthanasia is legal in New Zealand, following the enforcement of the End of Life Choice Act 2019 on November 7, 2021.  Assisted suicide is illegal under Section 179 of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, which renders it a criminal offence to "aid and abet suicide", meaning the choice most solely be down to the individual on requirement that they have a terminal illness.
Two decriminalisation attempts – the Death With Dignity Bill 1995 and the Death With Dignity Bill 2003 – failed, the latter by only a three-vote margin within the New Zealand Parliament. In May 2012, Labour Party of New Zealand MP Maryan Street introduced a private member's bill into the ballot box, the End of Life Choices Bill, which was taken over by MP Iain Lees-Galloway when she failed to get re-elected in the 2014 General Election. The bill was dropped in December 2014 at the request of Labour Party leader Andrew Little as the issue was deemed to be distracting from bigger issues that concerned the party. [98]
In November 2019, ACT MP David Seymour's End of Life Choice Bill, which will legalise assisted suicide for a select group of people if successful, passed its third reading 69 votes in favor to 51 opposed. In return for the New Zealand First party's support of the bill through its third reading, the bill was subject to a binding referendum held alongside the 2020 general election,[99] which took place on 17 October 2020. [100] The referendum passed with 65.1% of the vote, [101] with the results officially declared on 7 November 2020. The End of Life Choice Act came into force on 7 November 2021, 12 months after the official results were declared. [102]
Norway[edit]
Active voluntary euthanasia remains illegal, though a caregiver may receive a reduced punishment for taking the life of someone who consents to it. [103]
Peru[edit]
Euthanasia is a delict under the laws of Peru, although there have been some attempts to reform them.
In October 2009, the Reviser Special Commission of the Penal Code of the Parliament expressed its support of a proposal that tried to amend article 112 of the Penal Code, but it did not succeed.
However, at the beginning of 2015, the case of the Chilean woman young Valentina Maureira, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, an incurable disease, and who asked that euthanasia be allowed in her country, attracted the interest of the press of Chile and also of foreign media. [104]
On 4 March of the same year, the Peruvian legislator Roberto Angulo Álvarez, membership of Dignity and Democracy parliamentary group, motivated by this case, presented a bill that proposed to allow assisted death in case of terminal or degenerative disease, with the objective of "avoid the physical and psychological pains of the patient, as well the unnecessary expenses for the family members and the State". Angulo Álvarez also argued that his legislative project "would contribute to respect for individual freedom and human dignity". [105] [106]
Poland[edit]
Active euthanasia in the Polish Criminal Code is defined as always appearing under the influence of sympathy for the suffering person and at their request. It is forbidden; it is treated as a kind of murder punishable in a milder way. The perpetrator is punishable by imprisonment of between 3 months and 5 years. Exceptionally, a court may apply leniency or even waive the sentence. The provision of Article 150 of the Penal Code, which defines the crime of euthanasia murder, does not, however, explicitly require the person requesting it to be terminally ill, but this requirement is introduced by case law. A specific type of crime related to euthanasia in the broad sense of the term is assistance to suicide (Article 151 of the Penal Code), which also includes so-called euthanasic assistance to suicide, i.e. facilitating the suicide of a terminally ill person.
Portugal[edit]
One of the current ‘hot topics’ in Portugal, the deeply divisive issue was the latest point of friction .[107] A proposal to make Portugal one of only a handful of countries allowing euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide was narrowly rejected (115-110 vote) by lawmakers on late May 2018. [108]
Following the 2019 elections, the issue began to be discussed again in the Assembly of the Republic, where, as of February 2020, it was approved by left-wing and liberal parties. [109] [110] [111]
On 20 February 2020, the Portuguese Parliament voted to approve plans to introduce voluntary euthanasia laws. [112] On 29 January 2021, the Assembly of the Republic approved the final version of the law, with 136 votes supporting the bill. [113] The President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa - a well-known catholic - asked the country's Constitutional Court to evaluate the law on February 18. [114] On March 15 the top Court said the law was imprecise in identifying the circumstances under which the procedures can occur and thus declared it unconstitutional. [115] When arrived back at parliament, the bill was re-worded and passed again. [116]
On November 5, 2021, the Portuguese Parliament passed again the now revised bill which aims to fix constitutional concerns. [117] Supporters of legalization have been anxious to vote through the bill in this parliament, where there was a clear majority in favor of legalization although pushed by the Socialist Party (PS) and the radical Left Bloc, the issue cut across the left-right divide. [118] The president vetoed the new bill and it is unlikely to become law before the new election. [119] Portugal faced a snap election on January 30 of 2022.[120] A poll taken in 2020 showed almost 50.5 percent of Portuguese people support decriminalization. [121]
Philippines[edit]
Euthanasia is illegal in the Philippines. In 1997, the Philippine Senate considered passing a bill legalizing passive euthanasia. The bill met strong opposition from the country's Catholic Church. If legalized the Philippines would have been the first country to legalize euthanasia. Under current laws, doctors assisting a patient to die can be imprisoned and charged with malpractice. [122]
Romania[edit]
According to the Criminal Code, euthanasia in Romania is not allowed and is punishable by imprisonment from 1 to 5 years.
"The murder committed at the explicit, serious, conscious and repeated request of the victim who was suffering from an incurable disease or a serious medical illness, causing permanent suffering and unbearable, is punishable by imprisonment from one to five years," he said. shows in article 190 of the newest Penal Code. [123]
Russia[edit]
As of November 2011 a Russian Federal Law No.323 bans euthanasia under provision of Article 45. [124] [125] There is no known law that punishes specifically illegal euthanasia practices though.
Active euthanasia was briefly made legal in Soviet Russia in 1922. [126]
Serbia[edit]
Euthanasia is illegal in Serbia. As Article 117, "Compassionate Murder" recalls — "Whoever deprives an adult of his life out of compassion due to the difficult health condition in which that person finds himself, and at his serious and explicit request, will be punished by imprisonment from six months to five years." [127]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, euthanasia is prohibited, because according to criminal law it is a crime and at the same time according to Art. 15 par. 2 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic "no one shall be deprived of his life." [128]
South Korea[edit]
The National Assembly and The Ministry of Health and Welfare voted in favor of passive euthanasia and went into effect since February 2018, and has announced to issue a "Well-Dying" Bill. [129] However, the topic and debate of euthanasia in South Korea sparked for a long time, starting back on 4 December 1997 when a doctor was sent to prison for a major duration for voluntarily cutting life support of a braindead patient who injured himself from a head trauma, upon the request of his wife. This incident is well known in Korea as 'Boramae Hospital Incident' (보라매병원 사건). Another incident that sparked further debate was from the imprisonment of a father who unplugged a respirator for his braindead son. [130]
Patients who qualify for active or passive euthanasia in South Korea are reserved for the terminally ill with a nonexistent chance of recovery. Patients who have a beneficial reaction to any medications, or are not in a rapidly deteriorating state of health leading to imminent death may not be qualified. Patients must have a confirmation of a registered physician and a doctor to die under dignity, and comatose patients must have the approval of both guardians. [131]
Spain[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in Spain
Active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in Spain .
In February 2020 the Spanish parliament voted to approve plans to legalise voluntary euthanasia. The bill went to committee and the Senate before a final vote in the lower house. [132] The lower house approved the bill in December 2020. [133]
On 17 December 2020, the Congress of Deputies passed a bill to regulate the right to euthanasia. [134] The final draft, whose intellectual authorship was attributed to María Luisa Carcedo, commanded the support from 192 legislators (PSOE, Podemos, ERC, Ciudadanos, Junts per Catalunya, PNV, Bildu, CUP, Más País, BNG ), the opposition from 138 (PP, Vox, UPN) and 2 abstentions. [134] [135] Given widespread parliamentary support and the incorporation of minor amendments, the law returned to the Congress of Deputies for final approval. [135]
On 18 March 2021, Spain's parliament voted in favour of the final reading of the bill, thus making it law. It was sanctioned by the King on 24 March 2021 and published in the BOE the next day. [136] The law came into force on 25 June 2021, three months after its publication. [137]
Sweden[edit]
Passive euthanasia was deemed legal after a landmark court ruling in 2010. That means a health care professional can legally cease life support upon request from a patient if they understand the consequences stated by their health care provider, and administering a lethal substance is also illegal. [138]
Switzerland[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in Switzerland
In Switzerland, deadly drugs may be prescribed to a Swiss person or to a foreigner, where the recipient takes an active role in the drug administration. [139] More generally, article 115 of the Swiss penal code, which came into effect in 1942 (having been written in 1918), considers assisting suicide a crime only if the motive is selfish.
Turkey[edit]
Euthanasia is strictly forbidden in Turkey. The aide who helped a person to suicide or other ways to kill oneself will be punished for assisting and encouraging suicide under the stipulation of article 84 of the Turkish Criminal Law. In condition of active euthanasia, article 81 of the same law sets forth that any person who carries out this act will be judged and punished for life imprisonment just like a simple murder.
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in the United Kingdom
Active euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom. Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so. [140] [141] [142] Between 2003 and 2006 Lord Joffe made four attempts to introduce bills that would have legalised voluntary euthanasia – all were rejected by the UK Parliament. [143] Currently, Dr Nigel Cox is the only British doctor to have been convicted of attempted euthanasia. He was given a 12-month suspended sentence in 1992. [144]
In regard to the principle of double effect, in 1957 Judge Devlin in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams ruled that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. [145]
Passive euthanasia is legal, by way of advance decisions giving patients the right to refuse life saving treatment. [146] Food and liquid can also be withdrawn from someone in a permanent vegetative state without the need for court approval. [147]
United States[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in the United States
See also: Assisted suicide in the United States
Active euthanasia is illegal throughout the United States. Patients retain the rights to refuse medical treatment and to receive appropriate management of pain at their request (passive euthanasia), even if the patients' choices hasten their deaths. Additionally, futile or disproportionately burdensome treatments, such as life-support machines, may be withdrawn under specified circumstances and, under federal law and most state laws only with the informed consent of the patient or, in the event of the incompetence of the patient, with the informed consent of the legal surrogate. The Supreme Court of the United States has not dealt with "quality of life issues" or "futility issues" and appears to only condone active or passive "euthanasia" (not legally defined)  when there is clear and convincing evidence that informed consent to the euthanasia, passive or active, has been obtained from the competent patient or the legal surrogate of the incompetent patient.[citation needed]
While active euthanasia is illegal throughout the U.S., assisted suicide is legal in Colorado, Oregon, Hawaii, Washington, Vermont, Maine,[148] New Jersey,[149] California,[150] the District of Columbia,[151] one county in New Mexico, and is de facto legal in Montana.[152] [153] Additionally, Louisiana specifically prohibits euthanasia in its Bill of Rights as cruel and unusual punishment.[citation needed]
Uruguay[edit]
Main article: Euthanasia in Uruguay
Since 1933 the Penal Code of Uruguay, article 37, accepts Compassionate Homicide, the first legal document that include euthanasia, although legal document didn't use this denomination. In another article, 127, the judge could waive the doctor, if this action was made by patient pledge and the doctor had an honorable reputation. [154] The main source of this Penal Code was Jimenéz de Asúa, a Spanish penalist, that introduced this concept in his book "Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinología", published in Madrid/Spain, in 1928. [155] The first proposal to understand Euthanasia as homicide was made by Ruy Santos in his MD thesis, "Da resistencia dos estados mórbidos à therapeutica e da incurabilidade perante a euthanásia", at Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia/Brazil, in 1928. He made a difference between Euthanasia as homicide and Euthanasia as suicide, probably the first citation about Assisted Suicide. [156]
Non-governmental organizations[edit]
Further information: Assisted suicide § Organizations in support of assisted suicide
There are a number of historical studies about the thorough euthanasia-related policies of professional associations. In their analysis, Brody, B. A. et al. (2001). found it necessary to distinguish such topics as euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, informed consent and refusal, advance directives, pregnant patients, surrogate decision-making (including neonates), DNR orders, irreversible loss of consciousness, quality of life (as a criterion for limiting end-of-life care), withholding and withdrawing intervention, and futility. [157] Similar distinctions presumably are found outside the U.S., as with the highly contested statements of the British Medical Association. [158] [159]
On euthanasia (narrowly defined here as directly causing death), Brody sums up the U.S. medical NGO arena:
The debate in the ethics literature on euthanasia is just as divided as the debate on physician-assisted suicide, perhaps more so. Slippery-slope arguments are often made, supported by claims about abuse of voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands.... Arguments against it are based on the integrity of medicine as a profession. In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative – an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide. [160]
Other NGOs that advocate for and against various euthanasia-related policies are found throughout the world. Among proponents, perhaps the leading NGO is the UK's Dignity in Dying, the successor to the (Voluntary) Euthanasia Society. [161] In addition to professional and religious groups, there are NGOs opposed to euthanasia [162] found in various countries.

Is euthanasia legal in the US?
Asked by: Samih Viana
asked in category: General Last Updated: 14th February, 2020
Is euthanasia legal in the US?
In the United States, while active euthanasia is illegal throughout the U.S., assisted suicide is legal in Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California (effective from June 2016), one county in New Mexico, and is de facto legal in Montana. In the United Kingdom, euthanasia and assisted dying are both illegal.
Click to see full answer.
Subsequently, one may also ask,  where is euthanasia legal in the US 2019?
As of September 2019, aid in dying statutes are in effect in: California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. In Montana, physician-assisted dying has been legal by State Supreme Court ruling since 2009.
One may also ask,  why is euthanasia illegal? The fact that voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) are illegal means maximum efforts are made to relieve pain and address all aspects of a person's suffering. Will this still occur if the law is changed? Death would be cheaper than care and treatment.
Considering this,  where is euthanasia legal in the world?
As of March 2018, active human euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, and Canada.
Is passive euthanasia legal in the US?
In the USA, a few states have recognized active euthanasia as legal such as Oregon, Washington, and Montana. However, passive euthanasia is considered legal in all USA jurisdictions as it does not involve an act of killing someone rather one is letting someone die on its own naturally.
The organized movement for legalization of euthanasia commenced in England in 1935, when C. Killick Millard founded the Voluntary Euthanasia Legalisation Society (later called the Euthanasia Society).
Strategy   Increased understanding and respect for the dignity of human life. Enhanced government support for hospice/palliative care systems and community care services. Maintain and enforce existing laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide. Establish and build Compassionate Care Community Services.

Euthanasia, from the Greek word meaning “good death”, is the practice of assisted suicide with the intention of relieving pain and suffering. Euthanasia is also known as mercy killing or physician assisted suicide. Like all things that deal with life and death, it has been a controversial subject of debate due to its seeming infringement of a person’s fundamental right to live. As a law, voluntary euthanasia is accepted in some countries, including some states in the United States and provinces in Canada. Euthanasia is also one of the most actively researched and debated subjects in modern bioethics. Surveys taken in the United States indicate that an estimated 46% of physicians agree that voluntary euthanasia should be allowed for certain situations, with 41% disagreeing altogether and 14% believe it to be circumstantial. Below are the key arguments for euthanasia, which highlight why it is our right as human beings as well as the benefits it presents.
10 People have the right to die.
Right to Die
Often, the discussion revolves around the right to life; anti-euthanasia proponents argue that euthanasia infringes on a person’s fundamental right to live. What they fail to see is that our “life” as human beings implies death. Without death, we do not have “human life” by its very definition. Like black and white or two sides of a coin, human life cannot occur without death. Therefore for those that argue that every man has the fundamental right to live, they unknowingly also agree that every man has the fundamental right to die.
Because we can determine the course of our lives by our own will, we have the right to live our lives and determine our own course. Naturally it follows that the same self-determining capacity we have as human beings also gives us the fundamental right to determine how we die. It is also important to consider that the right to life has no say over the right to die. The right to live and the right to die are two separate, although related rights. They are also mutually exclusive in the sense that the right to live concerns itself only with self-determined life and ends with the right to die. The right to die on the other hand begins where life ends in death. While you live, you exercise your right to life; when your life ends, you exercise your right to die. It is important to consider that we refer to self-determined or natural death and not death resulting from someone directly removing from you your life, thereby restricting your right to live. If such significant weight in this sense is given to our right to live, should we not also give equal weight to our right to die.
9 People have the explicit right to choose.
Right to Choose
Beyond the philosophical implications of man’s right to live or die lies man’s explicit and fundamental right to choose. Everything is touched by this explicit right, from what you will have for breakfast to what you will believe, what your opinions are and what you do with your life. The society that man has built is founded on this very right, and evolves because our inherent nature is explored. Regardless of the outcome, no one can question our right to free will. The right to choose is fundamental and applies to all elements of “human life”, which by the nature of human life, includes the right to choose how you die. As an example, a terminally ill individual who is currently under significant pain may choose to die with dignity, as is his right. To deny him this is to deny him his personal autonomy and is an act that is trespassing on his humanity. While concepts such as dignity are defined by social majority, an individual, possessing all the rights of a human being, may perceive a dignified death to be preferable to constant suffering. He may decide on euthanasia, and this choice should be available to him. Very simply, this is his right to choose, as equally as he made his choices when faced with circumstances in life. It cannot be questioned should he decide to act on it. In the case of euthanasia, we simply request assistance to facilitate this right of choosing how to exit this world.
8 Euthanasia is not immoral.
Euthanasia is Moral
For something to be immoral, it would have to violate moral laws or norms. The argument of anti-euthanasia proponents is that euthanasia is immoral because life must be preserved and protected. The preservation of life is, however, subject to the self-determined choice of the person and not the choice of the physician. As an example, murder infringes on a person’s right to life by taking away the element of choice in the persons death. No infringement is done when it is the person who chooses how to die. For a physician to deny the person his right to die when under intense pain and suffering is effectively forcing them to live a life without what they believe is their dignity, a life of suffering and eventual death (in the case of terminally ill patients). While the intentions may be good, no person has the right to demand of another person to live a life of suffering, in fact, that is immoral as it removes their right to choose. Euthanasia facilitates the choice making it in fact the compassionate choice and sympathetic to that person’s dignity. It is also important to note that those that argue to preserve life despite the patient being terminally ill and in extreme pain are usually not the patients themselves and therefore removed from the consequences of the decision.
7 Euthanasia protects self-hood and human dignity.
Euthanasia Preserves Dignity
Self-determination is one of the key elements that make us human. It is the ability to determine our destiny as individuals and is facilitated by our ability to think for ourselves. Imagine a life where an illness has left you incapable of conducting the basics of life; you are unable to breathe, move or even think for yourself. You have effectively removed your ability to self-determine, arguably a significant element in being “human”. Our sense of “self” is created as we progress through life. We grow our personalities as human beings by our choices and experiences. This sense of self is the foundation of our human dignity.
Now, go back to the example of the person who can no longer breathe, move or even think for himself, and add the element of extreme and constant pain to the point where they prefer death to living this way. Over time, because of this experience, the person will eventually lose sight of their “self”, when they could move around, form opinions and self determine. This will all be a distant memory, and the most real thing to them will be the constant state of pain they are in. They won’t even be able to cry out in pain despite the pain. Seem far-fetched? Consider Tony Nicklinson, whose bid for euthanasia was rejected multiple times. Tony Nicklinson was diagnosed with a disease that prevented him from moving any and all muscles in his body. After his bid was denied, he decided to starve himself to death, which took a week without food. Another example is Kelly Taylor who starved herself for 19 days trying to die. Without the option of euthanasia, their quality of life will continue to deteriorate the same way Tony and Kelly had endured. They will eventually die, but in what state? Will they go out in a state of dignity? Euthanasia can provide them with the opportunity to finish their life keeping their human dignity intact.
6 Euthanasia does not harm to others.
Euthanasia should be considered a fundamental human right
Because people will naturally have different interests, it is not uncommon to have conflicts of interest. When conflicts arise, it is the goal of civilized society and the state to ensure the resolution of conflicts without the infringement of fundamental human rights. These rights are protected above all others and their infringement is punished severely. That being said, euthanasia as a choice infringes on no such fundamental rights. Death by its nature is a private affair. Assisted suicide (as is the case of euthanasia) involves direct harm and the termination of life only to the individual who has requested it. One cannot request euthanasia for another “competent” person. If this is the case, it will then be a question of murder instead. The process of euthanasia does not restrict or infringe on anyone’s fundamental rights and therefore does no harm.
5 Euthanasia is properly regulated.
euthansasia is regulated and can be regulated
Those who oppose euthanasia often cite the horror stories of patients being euthanized without consent or for unethical or impure reasons. Granted, the history of euthanasia is not without its fair share of horror stories and because of the gravity of its practice, it does need to be regulated. However, this is not reason enough to say that it cannot be properly regulated. Developed nations like the Netherlands have legalized euthanasia and have had only minor problems from its legalization. Any law or system can be abused, but that law and system can always be refined to prevent such abuse from happening. In the same way, it is possible to properly and effectively regulate euthanasia as various first world countries have done. More so because the process of euthanasia itself as it is being argued here, requires competent consent from the patient. It is important to consider the protection of both the physicians as well as the patients. The critical element in the regulation of euthanasia will be determining the line between what is considered to be euthanasia and what is considered to be murder.
4 Everyone has a right to a good death, therefore a good death must not be denied to those who want one.
Surrounded by Love Ones
Nobody thinks of their death and desires it to be extremely painful or horrible. Rational human beings desire a good, dignified end to an ideally long and fruitful life. Circumstance, like luck, may not always be in your favor. It may not even be a terminal disease, which is so frequently used in pro-euthanasia arguments. It can be as savage as a freak accident or as simple as falling down the stairs to put you in a world of excruciating pain. While this is never to be wished on anyone, for those that have had the misfortune of being diagnosed with a terminal or painfully debilitating disease must have a choice out of it. Do we, who so desire a good death, have the right to judge others’ state when we know nothing of it? Do we have the right to compare their experiences day by day, having experienced none of them, and say that they don’t deserve to die with dignity, the way they want to die? The answer is of course, no, we have no right to deny them the dignified death that we ourselves naturally desire. To do so would be selfish and we would effectively be imposing our own desires on that person, thereby restricting their freedom to self-determine even if it is in the most basic sense.
3 Euthanasia does not shorten lifespans by as much as is portrayed.
Euthansasia Doesn’t Shorten Life Span
Many arguments opposing euthanasia are based on the premise that the patient’s life should be preserved because of the possibility of their recovery. Statistics however, paint a different picture. A Dutch survey conducted in 1991 showed that 86% of Euthanasia cases only shortened the life of the patient by a maximum of 1 week. The standard time it shortened their life was by a few hours only. This clearly shows that terminal illness is statistically terminal. Add in the fact that in the majority of these cases, the patients were in extreme agony, the numbers show you that terminally ill patients are using euthanasia to end the suffering where they would have had near impossible chances of recovery. This is not the same as the ideal painted by opponents of euthanasia, wherein the patient may have a chance to survive and make a miraculous recovery. It is because the numbers are so heavily indicative of euthanasia as an out for terminally ill patients in terrible agony that it must be allowed as an option to end their suffering.
2 Euthanasia saves lives.
Euthansasia Saves Lives
Sound shocking? Consider this: a 2005 study of euthanasia in the Netherlands found that 0.4% of all euthanasia was done without consent from the patient. By the time this study was done, euthanasia had been legalized in the Netherlands. Now consider another study done in 1991 which was done before euthanasia was legalized which indicated that 0.8% of euthanasia done in the Netherlands was done without the patients consent. This shows that the legalization of euthanasia actually had the reverse of the expected effect and cut the unacceptable practice of no consent euthanasia in half. By these numbers, euthanasia has in fact saved lives since it now provides a protected and regulated framework with which doctors must first obtain explicit consent before conducting euthanasia. This same framework makes it more difficult and less grey for those seeking to perform euthanasia with impure or irresponsible intentions.
1 The Hippocratic oath supports euthanasia.
Euthansasia consistent with Hippocratic Oath
Most people misinterpret the Hippocratic oath as being against euthanasia. The key element of the oath is that the physician must protect the wellbeing of their patient, hence the maxim “do no harm” commonly interpreted to be a summation of the oath. Most interpretations of the “harm” element are however taken to literally refer to the patient’s life. It can be argued that harm in this case refers to the wellbeing of the patient, which includes his life. However in cases where it is a choice between intense suffering or death, it can be argued that the physician is doing more harm to the patient by not allowing them to die. While this argument can go either way, updated interpretations of the Hippocratic oath do include a segment that concerns taking life as well as preserving it:
“Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty.”
–Written in 1964 by Louis Lasagna, Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University
From a philosophical aspect, man seems to have some pathological fear of death, so much so that he views intense suffering, until he is actually suffering himself, as preferable to death. Such fear of death tends to create a mythical status of death in our minds that we often forget that to die is also to exist as a human being. It is the finite nature of our lives brought about by the immovable and inevitable wall of death that gives every second of our time spent on this earth its most powerful purity. Death, like life exists as part of our cycle of human existence.
