So I have this question: "Is sex socially constructed?" Hmm, that's an interesting topic. I'm not entirely sure what "socially constructed" means in this context, so maybe I should start by understanding that term.

I think "socially constructed" refers to ideas or concepts that are created and shaped by society and culture, rather than being innate or natural. So, in this case, the question is asking whether sex—the biological differences between males and females—is something that society has created or defined, or if it's a natural, biological fact.

Wait a minute, I know that sex is usually determined by biological factors like chromosomes, hormones, and reproductive anatomy. For example, typically, males have XY chromosomes and females have XX chromosomes. So, in that sense, it seems like sex is a biological reality, not something society has constructed.

But then again, I've heard about intersex people, who don't fit neatly into the male or female categories because of variations in their biology. Does that mean that the strict male/female binary is a social construct, even if sex itself is biological?

Maybe I need to do some research to get a better understanding. Let me try searching for "is sex socially constructed" and see what comes up.

Is Sex Socially Constructed?
Examining the arguments
“Sex is not gender,” the wildly popular YouTuber and sex educator Laci Green tweeted last year. On one standard way of explaining the difference, sex is biologically given, natural, the raw material on which culture and society can do their work. Gender is the result of that work, the social significance that we invest in sex. Nature gives us our sexed bodies, and “gender is the cultural meanings that the sexed body assumes.”
That last line is from Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble, the book at the pinnacle of the gender studies canon. According to the European Graduate School’s brief biography of Butler, she is “one of the most challenging thinkers of our time.” Since the previous paragraph seems quite sensible and not especially challenging, you might guess that Butler disagrees with it.
Indeed she does. According to Butler, nature gives us something, a kind of clay that can be molded by cultural norms and power structures, but it doesn’t give us sexed bodies any more than it gives us police officers, people who identify as genderqueer, or professors of philosophy. Sex is not a purely biological matter, it is in part a social or cultural one; it is socially (or culturally) “constructed.” As she puts it in Gender Trouble: “perhaps this construct called ‘sex’ is as culturally constructed as gender.” This is a Butlerian “perhaps” — she evidently means to endorse it. Green, for her part, does not — she also tweeted “sex is not a social construct!”
If Butler is right, then radical possibilities open up. If we construct sex, we might be able to demolish it, or construct it differently. The idea that sex is socially constructed did not originate with Butler, but her influence has been enormous, both in academia and popular culture. You can find the idea endorsed in sociology, gender studies, and philosophy — it sometimes even makes an appearance in psychology. (Biology is an exception — the biologists are apparently not up to speed with the latest discoveries.) Whenever sex and gender are the topic online, “sex is a social construction” is likely to be a bone of contention sooner or later.
But what does this slogan mean, precisely? Why does it matter? And is it true?
Let’s take our three questions in order.
What Does It Mean To Say That Sex Is A Social Construction?
Start with sex, which is shorthand for the categories female and male. So the thesis that sex is socially constructed can be better put like this: the categories female and male are socially constructed. Categories are basically the same as the properties (or features, or attributes) of things. My cat Maisie is furry — equivalently, she has the property of being furry. In other words, furriness is one of her features or attributes. Said another way, Maisie belongs to the category furry.
But what does it mean to say that a category is socially constructed? The terminology of “social construction” is often thrown around so carelessly that its intended meaning is impossible to divine, but there is one clear answer that corresponds closely with what Butler has in mind. A socially constructed category is a category that meets this condition: If an object belongs to the category, the object must exist (or have existed) within a society or social organization.
As the philosopher (and my colleague) Sally Haslanger puts it in her book Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique, in order for an object to belong to a socially constructed category it “must exist within a social matrix.”¹ The relevant kind of “social matrix,” or social organization, needs to be of a human-like level of complexity — ants are social insects, but do not exist within a social matrix in Haslanger’s sense.
That’s a bit abstract; some examples will help. Consider the categories engagement ring, planet, and queen. Engagement ring is a socially constructed category: if something is an engagement ring, then it must exist (or have existed) within a society with the institution of marriage — a band of silver could be found in pre-social nature, but not an engagement ring.
Planet, on the other hand, is not a socially constructed category: the Earth currently hosts many societies, but this is irrelevant to its status as a planet. The planets in our solar system were around for billions of years before life even evolved. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union proposed a definition of “planet” that excluded Pluto. The IAU’s decision to define “planet” in this way was a social matter — the IAU itself is a social organization. But that does not mean that the astronomical category the IAU decided should be labeled by the word “planet” is socially constructed, and it isn’t.
Finally, queen (in the monarchy sense) is a socially constructed category. Elizabeth Windsor, for instance, is only the Queen of the United Kingdom because she is embedded in a society with certain political practices. In a world with no societies, there are no queens.
The terminology of “social construction” is unfortunately very misleading. Engagement rings are literally and straightforwardly constructed: they are manufactured by jewelers. Queens are constructed only in a loose and extended sense: the present British queen wasn’t built by anyone (your parents don’t exactly build you), but Elizabeth only became a queen because certain social groups did certain things, like place a crown on her head in Westminster Abbey. However, the categories themselves — engagement ring and queen — are not “constructed” in any helpful sense. Societies produce engagement rings, and also various phrases to label them (“engagement ring” in English, “anillo de boda” in Spanish), but not the category engagement ring. If there hadn’t been any engagement rings, the category engagement ring would not have disappeared — rather, the category would have had nothing belonging to it. Similarly, the category existed before the ancient Romans started the tradition of giving engagement rings.
More cautiously put: It is highly controversial whether categories are the sorts of things that can be “constructed.” A much better term than “socially constructed category” would simply be “social category,” but let’s keep the misleading terminology for uniformity.
We should guard against another potential confusion. It is crucial to distinguish socially constructed categories from socially significant ones — categories that social groups regard as important in one way or another. But not all socially constructed categories are socially significant, and not all socially significant categories are socially constructed. The category Pepsi drinker is a socially constructed category, but is pretty insignificant: apart from the Pepsi company, no one really cares whether you drink Pepsi, Coke, or something else. On the other hand, despite the fact that the category gold is not socially constructed (gold is just a chemical element), it is highly socially significant: King Midas personifies the human obsession with this metal. It is not in dispute that the categories female and male are socially significant — nothing could be more obvious. What is very much in dispute is whether those categories are socially constructed. And that leads to our second question.
Why Is It Important Whether Sex Is Socially Constructed?
What exactly rides on whether female and male are socially constructed categories? We have already gestured at the answer. At least for many socially constructed categories, if we change society, or the position of people within a society, we can change what belongs to the category. Legalizing same-sex marriage might have increased the number of things belonging to the category engagement ring. We can ensure that there will be no more queens (or kings) by abolishing the monarchy and establishing a republic. If sex is socially constructed, someone might be able to change his sex by changing his social position — a truly spectacular feat of self-determination. When the transgender woman and reality star Jazz Jennings says “ I am female ,” she could be speaking the plain truth. She is socially female, in almost all the ways that matter, and this might be sufficient — or might be sufficient with some surgery or hormone treatment — for simply being female. More ambitiously, perhaps if we drastically reorganize society we can look forward to an androgynous future, without females and males, or one with a number of liberating new sexes. To the revolutionary minded, social construction presents an opportunity.
Of course, what belongs to categories that are not socially constructed can also change. If you put on a few pounds you are changing your weight: you cease to belong (say) to the category weighs 164 pounds and now belong to the category weighs 166 pounds. Neither of those categories is socially constructed. If sex is not socially constructed, someone might still be able to change his sex solely by medical means. (However, current medical means do not reproduce the processes that allow some animals to change sex.) Humans could perhaps be genetically engineered to be sexless, with reproduction taking place by cloning. But all this is science fictional speculation; at least in the case of female and male, if those categories are not socially constructed then the revolution will have to wait.
Is Sex Binary?
The answer offered in a recent New York Times opinion piece is more confusing than enlightening

Is Sex Socially Constructed?
So, is sex socially constructed? Since a yes answer is hardly obvious, we need an argument. Unfortunately, explicit arguments are hard to find, let alone ones that are carefully laid out and worth taking seriously. Still, we can extract two arguments from the literature. The first can be found in the writings of Butler, and the second is close to the surface in many discussions of so-called intersex conditions (for instance, in Anne Fausto-Sterling’s Sexing the Body ). There is a third argument which—unlike the first two—is carefully laid out and needs no extraction; we will get to that later. Let us start with Butler.
The Performative Argument
Butler has an argument for the social construction of sex that turns on a kind of sentence called a “performative.” (You might have heard of Butler’s “performative” theory of gender, which is related; luckily, we do not need to examine it here.) The term “performative” is due to the British philosopher J. L. Austin, who wrote and lectured about the topic starting in the 1940s. What are performatives?
Sometimes we use language simply to report the facts, as when we say “It’s noon,” or “The Earth is a planet.” But sometimes we bring about what we report, just by reporting it, as when we say “I apologize,” or “I name this ship Queen Elizabeth 2 ,” or “I sentence you to three months in prison.” As if by magic, saying it makes it so: if I say “I apologize” in suitable circumstances then I will have made it the case that I apologize. The qualification about “suitable circumstances” is important. If I say “I apologize” as an actor on the stage, then I am only pretending to apologize, not really apologizing. The need for the qualification is even clearer with the second and third examples. Saying “I name this ship Queen Elizabeth 2 ” will only succeed in naming a ship if the speaker has some social position that confers authority in ship-naming. (The QE2 was christened by Elizabeth herself.) If I spot the USS Constitution in Boston Harbor and exclaim “I name this ship Queen Elizabeth 2 !” I will not have renamed Old Ironsides. Similarly, without any legal authority, saying “I sentence you to three months” will not succeed in sentencing anyone.
Sentences like “I apologize” — which can be used, given the appropriate social setting, to bring about what they report — are called explicit performatives. Note that there are other ways to apologize than to utter an explicit performative. “I’m sorry” will usually do just as well, but is not itself an explicit performative. Saying “I’m sorry” does not report the speaker as apologizing, and does not bring about what it does report, namely a feeling of regret; it is, rather, an implicit performative. Similarly, one can name a ship or sentence someone without uttering an explicit performative. In the appropriate social setting one can name a ship simply by keeping quiet and cracking champagne on the bow. And a judge can sentence someone to three months by saying “You will go to prison for three months.”
What could this have to do with whether sex is socially constructed? One more preliminary observation and all will be revealed. By uttering a performative, the speaker can make it the case that she apologizes, or that a ship is named, or that a defendant is sentenced to three months. Put in the jargon of categories, the speaker can make it the case that a thing belongs to a category — that the speaker belongs to the category apologizer; that this ship belongs to the category named “Queen Elizabeth 2”; that the defendant belongs to the category sentenced to three months. Now notice that all three categories are socially constructed categories: without some kind of society, there would be no apologizers, no things with names in a public language like English, and no one would be sentenced to jail terms. Consideration of these and other examples should make the following principle plausible: if performatives can be used to bring it about that a thing belongs to a category, that category is socially constructed.
In Bodies That Matter, Butler writes:
Consider the medical interpellation which (the recent emergence of the sonogram notwithstanding) shifts an infant from an ‘it’ to a ‘she’ or a ‘he’.
Never mind what “interpellation” means — the example is simply one in which a medical authority examines a fetus or a neonate and says “It’s a girl,” or “It’s a boy.” Butler claims that those sentences are “initiatory performatives.” As Sara Salih puts the idea in her useful book on Butler,
When the doctor or nurse declares “It’s a girl/boy!,” they are not simply reporting on what they see…they are actually assigning a sex…to a body that can have no existence outside discourse. In other words, the statement “It’s a girl/boy!” is performative.
Using the principle mentioned at the end of the second paragraph above, we can now set out the Performative Argument.
Premise 1: “It’s a girl” as uttered by an appropriate medical authority is a performative; specifically, such performatives can be used to bring it about that the baby is a girl, and so belongs to the category female. Similarly with “It’s a boy.”
Premise 2: If performatives can be used to bring it about that a baby belongs to the categories female or male, the categories female and male are socially constructed.
Conclusion: The categories female and male are socially constructed.
Since the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the only way of resisting the argument is to reject one of the premises. And premise 1 seems very easy to reject: it is not plausible at all that “It’s a girl” is a performative. Explicit performatives contain an action-verb like “apologize,” “thank” (“I thank you”), or “bet” (“I bet $100”), and “It’s a girl” does not. That sentence is therefore not an explicit performative. And if it is an implicit one, then we should be able to make what is implicit, explicit. Just as we can roughly paraphrase the implicit performative “I’m sorry” by the explicit performative “I apologize,” we should be able to find an explicit performative that corresponds to “It’s a girl.” Explicit performatives are typically in the first-person present indicative: “I apologize,” “I thank you,” and so on; their performative character can be further highlighted with the adverb “hereby” — “Hereby, I apologize.” So is the doctor or other medical authority in effect saying “Hereby, I make the baby a girl”?
That doesn’t sound right! If it were right, then provided the doctor had the appropriate authority and sincerely proclaimed “It’s a girl,” then the baby would be a girl, with no possibility of error. Similarly, if I say “I apologize” in suitable circumstances, then I really did apologize, even if I later realize that I had nothing to apologize for. I will say “I shouldn’t have apologized,” not “I didn’t apologize.” But in the case of sexing a baby there is a possibility of error in “suitable circumstances.” If the authoritative doctor later realized that she had (for instance) misinterpreted the ultrasound image, her previous announcement that the baby was a girl was simply false. She won’t say “The baby shouldn’t have been a girl,” but rather “The baby wasn’t a girl.”
The Performative Argument is a complete failure, then. Charity might lead us to suspect this was not quite what Butler intended. Rather than enter the labyrinth of Butler interpretation, let us try something different.
The Assignment Argument
Cloacal exstrophy is a particularly serious (and, fortunately, exceptionally rare) birth defect which affects lower abdominal development, with part of the large intestine appearing outside the body; in infants with male sex chromosomes (XY), the penis is either absent or malformed. (It is not an intersex condition, but bringing those in needlessly complicates matters.) In these cases a practical decision needs to be taken about the assignment of sex. Given the available surgical techniques, and previous evidence about patient outcomes, should we raise the infant as a girl, a boy, or — an option never considered — neither? The focus is not on whether the infant is really a female or a male, but on which option will lead to the best quality of life. And that means that social considerations are important to the assignment.
This is a dramatic example, but actually the point generalizes. With very few exceptions, we assign babies with penises to the category male and raise them as boys; similarly, we assign babies with vaginas to the category female and raise them as girls. But that practice is not forced on us by the biology. There usually seems little harm in doing it this way, but if a baby with a penis would be utterly miserable being raised as a boy and would flourish personally and socially being raised as a girl, why not go for it? Social considerations, in other words, are always lurking in the background of sex assignment, even in perfectly normal cases. If someone says (in the case of a seemingly unexceptional birth of a child with a penis) “But the child will be much better off assigned female ,” the right response is “Why do you think that?” rather than “Who cares?”
When Elizabeth became a queen, that had something to do with biology, in particular her family structure. But, just like sex assignment, the austere biological facts about Elizabeth’s parentage and siblings did not dictate that she would be a member of the category queen — social considerations also mattered. In general, it seems plausible that if belonging to a category depends on social considerations, the category is socially constructed. Putting all this together gives us the Assignment Argument:
Premise 1: A baby’s assignment to the categories female or male at birth depends on social considerations — biology does not dictate how the baby should be assigned.
Premise 2: If a baby’s belonging to the categories female or male depends on social considerations, the categories female and male are socially constructed.
Conclusion: The categories female and male are socially constructed.
The Performative Argument had a false premise. The Assignment Argument has a different defect: the premises do not logically imply the conclusion. The first premise is about being assigned to a category; the second premise is about belonging to a category. If we tried to repair the argument by replacing “assignment” in one premise by “belonging” (or vice versa), the repaired argument would logically imply the conclusion. But then it would have a false premise, or at least one without any support. (If we replaced “assignment” by “belonging” the first premise, the claim would be false or unsupported; vice versa, and the culprit would be the second premise.) Assigning and belonging — although connected — are quite different.
To assign an item to a category (in the sense of premise 1) is to perform a public classificatory act, to publicly label or mark the item as belonging to a category. Assignment can be used to get people to treat the item (in certain respects) as if it belonged to the category. Assigning an infant to the category female at birth almost invariably results in the child being socially treated as if it is female — the child is given a girl’s name, perhaps, or dressed in girl’s clothes, or is expected to have a preference for dolls over toy cars. In the vast majority of such cases, the child also belongs to the category female, but assigning and belonging can come apart.
This point should be perfectly familiar. Consider the category fool. It often isn’t nice to label fools as such, and to treat them publicly as if they are fools. Often it’s best to suffer them gladly. So someone can belong to the category fool even if he is not assigned to that category. Conversely, you might insult your Machiavellian enemy by calling her “a fool,” and treating her with the contempt befitting fools; we can imagine that this catches on, and everyone else gets in on the act, to your enemy’s chagrin. Your enemy is no fool, which is precisely why your insults are so effective. She is assigned to the category fool, but does not belong to it.
The moral is that sometimes someone can be assigned to a category even if the person does not belong to the category. No reason has been given for thinking that this moral fails to apply in the case of sex assignment at birth. Assigning depends on social considerations, but this is quite compatible with belonging not depending on social considerations at all.
The two arguments examined so far have been duds. Is the third one any better?
The Explanatory Argument
The philosopher Ásta’s recent book Categories We Live By contains a clearly stated argument for the social construction of sex. (She also takes the time to explain what “social construction” means; her explanation is close enough to the one given earlier.) Ásta concedes that sex appears to be “biologically given,” but she argues that it is not. “Being of a certain sex,” she thinks, is to have a “conferred legal status,” a property that someone has only because she or he is embedded in a society with certain legal institutions.
Why does Ásta think that sex is socially constructed? This is her key reason:
if a property [i.e. a category] chiefly figures in explanations of social facts, and not natural facts, then that suggests that the property is a social property [i.e. is socially constructed].
There is something to this. Go back to our earlier examples of socially constructed categories: engagement ring and queen. One can explain various social facts by citing facts about engagement rings: for instance, Romeo had to borrow money because engagement rings are expensive. Similarly, one can explain various social facts by citing facts about queens: there is a parade occurring in London because it’s the Queen’s official birthday. On the other hand, facts about engagement rings or queens are not very well suited for explaining “natural” facts — facts in the non-social world, for example, about the weather or the tides. That is not to say that they can never explain non-social or natural facts. Why does this silver band fit perfectly on this human’s fourth finger? (A natural fact.) “Because she just got engaged, and it’s her engagement ring” might give a reasonably adequate explanation. The point is just that a socially constructed category does its main explanatory work in the social world, not outside it.
Ásta thinks that the categories female and male fit this pattern too. All sorts of social facts are explained (at least in part) by citing facts about these categories. There are doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology because there are many human females; the app Grindr has been successful because many human males are same-sex attracted; many children in Afghanistan do not get an education because they are females, and so on. It is not immediately obvious that all sorts of non -social or natural facts are explained by citing facts about females and males. (What about the natural fact that many humans can bear children? Ásta argues that this is better explained by specific physiological facts, rather than by the fact that many humans are female.) Putting the points of this and the previous paragraph together gives us the Explanatory Argument.
Premise 1: The categories female and male chiefly figure in explanations of social facts, and not natural facts.
Premise 2: If the categories female and male chiefly figure in explanations of social facts, and not natural facts, then the categories female and male are socially constructed.
Conclusion: The categories female and male are socially constructed.
Like the Performative Argument, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The problem is that, on closer examination, there is no reason to believe the second premise. (The first premise is also debatable, but the problem with the second is easier to explain.²) We noted earlier that the category gold is socially significant, but not socially constructed. Now consider another category that is like gold in these two respects: the category red diamond. Red diamonds are very rare, and the most expensive kind of diamonds. The category chiefly figures in explanations of social facts: the crowds flocked to the museum because a red diamond was on display; the collector paid a high price because the item was a red diamond, and so on. The category figures in few, if any, explanations of natural facts: red diamonds can scratch anything because they are diamonds, not because they are red diamonds. And yet the category red diamond, although a socially significant one, is not socially constructed. So even if female and male do their main explanatory work within the social world, this does not indicate that those categories are socially constructed.
None of these three arguments come close to establishing that sex is socially constructed. In fact, no argument could establish that, because sex is not socially constructed. In the contest between Judith Butler and Laci Green, we can declare the vivacious YouTuber the winner.
Recall my cat Maisie. The ordinary English word “female” has no special sense in which it applies only to humans: Maisie is female, just like Elizabeth II. Females are to be found across the animal (and vegetable) kingdoms: Elizabeth, Maisie, and numerous fish, beetles, and earthworms all belong to the category female. (Every earthworm enjoys the privilege of belonging to both categories, female and male .)
Now return to the definition of “social construction.” If a category is socially constructed, then in order for an object to belong to the category, the object must exist (or have existed) within a society or social organization. Clearly many animals have belonged to the category female (or male) without existing within a society of any kind. Indeed, there would have been females and males even if life on Earth had been destroyed by an asteroid half a billion years ago and humans had never evolved. Female and male are therefore not socially constructed categories; that is, sex is not socially constructed.
It might be replied that the slogan “Sex is socially constructed” was supposed to be restricted to humans. Human sex is socially constructed, not feline sex or beetle sex. But this reply is confused. The categories of “human sex” are presumably human female and human male. To belong to the category human female is simply to have the property being human and the property being female; in other words, it is to belong both to the category human and the category female. But the category human is no more socially constructed than the category female — and if it were, then the thesis should have been that the category human is socially constructed, not that female and male are socially constructed. Admittedly, human children and adults almost invariably exist within social groups, but the occasional human who has always been completely isolated from any society is doubtless part of our history too. (Even if not, there could easily have been such an isolated human.) By the same token, there have surely been socially isolated human females and human males. Perhaps an early hunter-gatherer couple left their group and fended for themselves; she became pregnant, he was eaten by a saber-toothed cat, and she died shortly after giving birth. Their short-lived but developmentally typical child did not exist within any society, but was a human being, and was either female or male.
Why are these elementary points almost always overlooked? If the gender theorist’s focus is on the human condition, and especially how existing social arrangements can be improved, the rest of the natural world (and long-dead hunter-gatherers) can seem irrelevant. Seeking (in Butler’s words) “to undermine any and all efforts to wield a discourse of truth to delegitimate minority gendered and sexual practices,” it is easy to ignore my cat Maisie, not to mention beetles.
Those who press the claim that sex is socially constructed are likely to sympathize with Marx’s adage that “Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.” That may be, but if you want to change the world you need to understand it first.
Notes:
¹For a very similar account, see “constitutive construction” in section 1.3 of Ron Mallon’s Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry, “ Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction .” That entry also explains some of the many bewildering ways in which “social construction” is used.
²Biologists are frequently concerned to explain facts about females and males, but the first premise is about what facts about sex explain, not what explains facts about sex. Here is one observation relevant to the assessment of premise 1. Once it is understood what the categories female and male amount to (roughly, large gamete producers and small gamete producers), they figure in an explanation of why males across the animal kingdom are usually more sexually competitive. See J. Lehtonen, et al., “ Why Anisogamy Drives Ancestral Sex Roles .”

The Social Construction of Sex
Many of us probably get our core gender identities as much from our biological origins as we do from our gender educations.

I keep running into smart people who seem to think I believe that sex “isn’t real” because it is all “socially constructed.” Allow me to correct this erroneous social construction of me by summarizing here what I think about sex and gender. I’m tempted to say “what I know about sex and gender” because there are few things I feel as sure about as this.
Testes are real. Ovaries are equally real. They sometimes make real gametes. (I don’t mean to imply they sometimes make fantasy gametes—just that they sometimes don’t make gametes.) Chromosomes and genes are also real. As anyone who’s every forgotten to wear a pad on the right day knows, menstrual blood is real. To the delight of this straight woman, penile erections are real. So are clitoral erections. I’m equally delighted about those. When I say these are “real,” what I mean is that these things have a material existence independent of our ability as humans to notice, study, deny, politicize, or categorize them. I can’t believe I even have to assert this claim, but some academics have gone over the deep end and disagree. (I don’t hang out with such people unless there I have some form of pain killer at the ready.)
So why would I write a book with the phrase medical invention of sex in the title?
Because the way we choose to categorize and delineate males and females (and others) is basically a social decision ... a decision some would call a social construction. I might even call it that, if it didn’t lead people to believe I am looped. (That’s why I used “invention” in the book’s title and not “construction,” but I guess the subtlety didn’t work.)
Yes, most men have recognizable penises, scrotums, testes, etc. Most women have recognizable clitorises, labia, vaginas, etc. But some people are born with versions of these organs that are in-between. Most people have either XX or XY chromosomes, though (because of genetic variations) some people have the opposite of what you’d guess from the way their bodies look and/or function, and some people have combinations like XXY or XO or XX/XY. Nature doesn’t care that we humans tend to like discrete categories. The real world is messy. To quote a guy who knew a lot about the fictions of sex, “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”
For any given child, we can’t predict with certainty what gender identity or sexual orientation she or he will grow up to have, even if the child is raised in a very sex-role-strict culture.
Can you decide what ultimately makes someone male, female, or other? Practically speaking, sure. That is to say, you can go ahead and make a decision. You won’t be the first. Over time, various scientists, doctors, midwives, grandmothers, judges, etc. have in practice decided who will count as male, female, or other. They’ve decided things like how small a penis has to be before the person attached to it counts as “other” (what we might call intersex). Some Texas judges have decided which chromosome (Y) you have to have to count as male and have to lack to count as female.
But such decisions are based on social need. They lack scientific and intellectual vigor—there are always reasonable objections and exceptions to each attempt. In fact, these decisions keep getting revised, over and over and over again, and I suspect they always will. People want their anatomical categories neat, but nature is (in this metaphor) a slob. We’re an odd couple that way.
In short, while lots of aspects of what we call “sex” are real—so real we can truly say they have been discovered and not constructed—the borders human draw on sex categories are ... invented. They are invented like other tools, to do a special job. Sometimes that job is to assign a sex to a kid, sometimes that job is to try to prohibit “same-sex” marriage, sometimes that job is to try to keep Japan’s emperor from becoming an empress.
What, then, about gender?
And what is gender? For those of you who haven’t had Sex/Gender-101, “sex” is a term usually used to talk about biological aspects of males and females, and social scientists sensibly break down “gender” into two basic ideas, “gender roles” and “gender identities.”
“Gender roles” are the parts males and females are expected to play in social settings. Are these “socially constructed”? Sure. The expectation that women will perform more housework and childcare and be paid less at work than men is a social construction in the sense that we find constant social reiterations of these gender-based expectations. The expectation that men will be strong, insensitive, and hornier than women could also be described as a social construction.
But—and here’s a big but—social gender roles may very well be fuzzy manifestations of our ontogeny (individual development, from conception onward) and phylogeny (the evolution of our species). In other words, the plasticized gender role expectations we find in the toy aisles of Target may be like the end of a telephone game where the start is our evolutionary history and our genes.
I think there’s good reason to think this is the case. First off, there’s some pretty good evidence that across almost every (if not every) culture, there is some consistency in gender role expectations. Boys across cultures are expected to—and do—play with toys meant to represent weapons. Girls across cultures are expected to—and do—play with toys that represent cooking and parenting. This doesn’t mean all children meet these expectations (we know they don’t), it just means all cultures seem to share some basic gender expectations.
OK, so maybe we could say “weapon” toys are also toys that represent a form of cooking and parenting—after all, weapons can be used to hunt for food and protect the young—but here we’re getting into the reality versus representation problem. And I think the reality is that there are some consistent patterns in male and female behaviors across cultures. Any feminist mother who has ever seen her carefully-raised three-year-old son pick up a stick and pretend to shoot or sword-play with it, or her carefully-raised three-year-old daughter go into full princess mode, will tell you this. Is it possible these kids learned these things from their culture? Sure, but it’s tough not to notice the persistence of the gender/behavior correlations anecdotally and in good studies.
Let me be clear: I’m not advocating we give up on trying to end oppressive gender norms. Just because something may be natural doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to figure out what might be better.
This, then, brings us to the issue of gender identity. Gender identity can be described as the internal feeling of being a boy, girl, man, woman, or something else. Is gender identity socially constructed—that is, are people taught to feel like one or the other?
When I started doing intersex work, I thought so. I thought we were taught to feel, act, and behave like girls and boys. But I don’t think that anymore. That is to say, sure we’re taught these things, but many of us probably get our core gender identities as much from our biological origins as we do from our gender educations. I’ve met too many people who, in spite of careful gender educations—sometimes even intensive gender educations—just clearly felt the gender assigned to them was the wrong one. I’ve also seen a lot of evidence from intersex that prenatal hormone levels correlate with gender-type behaviors, gender identities, and even sexual orientation. (Correlate, not cause! But correlations can be useful clues to causal factors.) I am not one of the people that flips out when the scientist Mike Bailey points out that, statistically speaking, gay men enter feminine-identified professions more than straight men, any more than I flip out when the scientist Bruce Bagemihl points out the tremendous sexual (and gender!) diversity found in the natural world. I’m fascinated, not infuriated, that the scientist Marc Breedlove has found some evidence that prenatal androgen levels seem to correlate with sexual orientation. Species show patterns in sex and gender diversity; we humans are no different.
It makes me crazy that some of my feminist friends try so hard to stop their kids from being gender-typical. I have one such friend who has a fairy-princess daughter, and my friend keeps trying to keep her daughter butch, as if she owes this to Susan B. Anthony. I asked my friend, “If your son wanted to wear a pretty pink dress, would you let him?” She turned red and said, “Yes.” I answered, “Then why isn’t it gender-based oppression to deny your daughter a pretty pink dress?”
Oy! Is this what we’ve come to?
While on the road a few years back, I met a stridently-feminist soon-to-be mom who pulled me aside to worry aloud about how she was going to raise her child. How was she going to keep this child free from gender expectations? Here’s what I told her: Gender isn’t just about oppression. It’s also about pleasure. We get pleasure from our genders. You will get pleasure from your child’s gender, and will sometimes delight in it the same way you will delight in your child growing and learning how to count. Your child will get pleasure from his or her gender. When we have sex, it is often in gendered ways—we enjoy sex as a woman with a man, or as a woman with a woman. How much more evidence do you need that gender can be joyfully delicious? Why oppress yourself and your child with your expectation that gender is always about oppression?
On this note, let me just say this: People who think gender identities, gender roles, and sexual orientations are all socially constructed are the most naive biological determinists I’ve ever seen. They think all human brains are completely without structure when it comes to these things; we all have empty slates in our skulls at birth. No, we don’t! Really!
In fact, I think we can’t know that much about any individual person’s biology without a huge amount of study on that person—and even then, it’s hard to know much. (I think the same is true about an individual person’s social history.) In this sense, I’m much less of a strict biological determinist than the social constructivists people incorrectly lump me with. I happen to think that, for any given child, we can’t predict with certainty what gender identity or sexual orientation she or he will grow up to have, even if the child is raised in a very sex-role-strict culture. Some will go against our best guesses and educational attempts—we know that again from cross-cultural studies, where transgender, lesbian, bi, and gay children and adults show up again and again.
Should we work to end economic and resource disparities between men and women? Absolutely. Should we press for LBGT rights? I got a big ol’ rainbow flag waving outside my house. But as we do all that good political work, I don’t think we should deny the findings of science. And I also don’t think we should deny pretty pink dresses and dolls to the significant numbers of little girls who want them just because some people wrongly think it profoundly unnatural that a few little boys want pretty pink dresses and dolls, too.
So, please, please don’t say Alice Dreger thinks sex is socially constructed (if what you mean by that is that gonads, gametes, and genes aren’t real) and please don’t say that Alice Dreger thinks we should get rid of gender. That’s not the real me.

‘Heterosexuality is socially constructed.' Discuss
Not only heterosexuality, but the very word, has changed in the way it is understood. I begin this essay with a clarification of terms, discussing what is understood by sexuality and gender and the implications of constructivist views. From this it is natural to move on to a discussion of labelling theory, of the effects of heteronormativity and of homovisibility, noting Foucault's recognition of positive implications in terms of difference. Finally, I consider how arguments against heteronormativity might be answered, in part, by Foucault.

Constructionists hold human behaviour is socially constructed, by the environment in which people live. They do not consider human behaviour to be innate or immutable, as they believe human behaviour is shaped by their social context throughout their lives. They hold that sexuality is also socially constructed and sexual behaviour to be a product of socio-cultural conditioning. Sexual meanings are not universal absolutes, but are subject to historical and cultural variation. (DeLamater, Hyde, 1998, p.16)
Constructionists regard the meaning of a sexual act as dependent solely on the cultural, historically specific context in which it occurs; they believe that sexuality is expressed in many different forms across a variety of different cultures in many countries. A sexual act in one country might not be construed as sexual in another. (Weeks, 1991. p. 20)
This is evident in the anthropological study of a tribe in New Guinea. It is part of this tribe's cultural belief that masculinity can be transmitted by insemination of semen to a young boy, either anally or orally, by an older male. (Herdt, 1984 p.165) In western society this could be perceived as a homosexual act, or, for essentialists, used as evidence of universality. But for constructionists this behaviour cannot be generalised to the larger population; constructionists suggest that labelling these acts as homosexual is incorrect as the tribe do not apply the same meaning to these acts as in western culture: to impose the same understanding as in the west would be ethnocentric. (Gergen, K. 1999. p. 26)
Social constructionists want to chart ways that the meanings of sexual desires shift throughout history. Social constructionists regard sexual desire as contingent, not biologically determined as viewed by essentialists. (Warner, 1993 p.45)
Michel Foucault (1981) works analyzed the history of sexuality from ancient Greece to the modern era. Foucault articulated how profoundly understandings of sexuality can vary across time and space. This is demonstrated by how the prevalence of what we now term heterosexuality has varied over the centuries and also from culture to culture. This is discussed by Foucault, who also notes that, although sexual behaviours in ancient societies resemble what we today see as homosexual/ heterosexual behaviour, the terms are not congruent with ancient societies. For example the ancient Greeks did not have terms or concepts that correspond to the contemporary dichotomy of ‘heterosexual' and ‘homosexual' therefore to this different historical context the modern terminology cannot be accurately applied. (Foucault, 1981, p.89)
Constructionists aim to gain a deeper understanding of sexual phenomena and are not primarily interested in the first cause of sexual orientation: they look at understanding the ways in which differences in sexual behaviour are ‘produced' by social processes in a particular social context. Constructionists aim to understand how we express and organise sexuality and why labels of difference in specific areas have been invented in some cultures and not others; why a particular culture accepts one form of sexual expression and not another; and how heteronormativity has come to dominate modern western society. (DeLamater, Hyde, 1998, p.10) These important questions I will investigate in my essay.
Constructionists can identify many historical contexts where individuals have engaged in same-sex relations, but it was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that terminology labelled categories of sexual acts as specifically either heterosexual or homosexual. They suggest, therefore, that these terms contributed to the construction of sexuality in the western modern era. (Katz, 1995, p.45)
Ned Katz is an important figure in the sexuality studies and he supports the constructionists' argument. In The Invention of Heterosexuality (1995) he looks at how the meaning of the term heterosexuality changes throughout time. Katz notes that the term 'heterosexuality' (Heterosexualität) was first used in 1868 by German-Hungarian journalist, Karl Maria Kertbeny, not long after the term 'homosexuality' was coined by Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. 'Heterosexuality' made its first published appearance in English in a medical publication in 1869. (Katz, 1995, p.40) At first, the term heterosexuality was not used as homosexual's binary opposite but was used to describe "abnormal manifestations of the sexual appetite", either same sex or opposite sex, which did not conform to social norms that held that sex was 'for' procreation. At one time the term ‘sodomite' had a similar meaning, this term was applied to people engaged in specific non-procreative sex acts, and related to the activity rather than their holistic sexual identity. (Katz, 1995, p.45) This distinction between the activity performed by someone who, among many other things, does that (a baker bakes, and a sodomite sodomises) and a person defined in a particular way regardless of activity (a woman, a Jew) is now largely lost in contemporary use of gender labels, which now seem inescapable.
Furthermore Katz suggests that in the 1920s the term was revisited in the second edition of the publication: ‘heterosexuality' was then used to describe a "manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex; normal sexuality." (Katz, 1995, p.42) This term became well established and was used by Freud to describe 'normal' sexuality. However this adaptation, used by scientists and physicians, signifies the start of heteronormativity as it suggests that sexual passion for the opposite sex was 'normal', healthy and superior influencing the rise of what Rich terms 'compulsory heterosexuality'. (1994, p.45) Creating this distinction between normal and abnormal sexual preferences encouraged scientists and physicians to seek 'cures' for those considered abnormal, thus compromising the liberty of the segregated and aggrandising the professional who diagnosed deviance. (Rivkin and Ryan: 1998, p.670) This was supported by Foucault, who writes that “it was this categorisation of homosexuality that first exposed the hitherto unfettered and unmonitored human sexual desire to scientific scrutiny and classification” (Rivkin and Ryan, 1998, p.677). Katz suggests that "If homosexuals were to win society-wide equality with heterosexuals, there'd be no reason to distinguish them." (Katz, 1995, p.52) Furthermore, he holds that if homosexuals and hetrosexual do "win society- wide equality […] the homosexual/heterosexual distinction would be retired from use, just as it was once invented." (Katz, 1995, p.52)
The term 'heteronormativity' was coined by Michael Warner, to contest "the elemental form of human association" (Warner, 1993, p.21). This term describes how society has been dominated by heteronormative behaviour through the prevalence of ‘compulsory heterosexuality'. Warner suggests that heterosexuality has become an institutionalised form of normative social practice. (p.22)
Heteronormativity describes the dominating societal norms that shape individuals' behaviour, pressuring the individual to conform to accepted cultural forms. This suggests some discomfort and constraint, finely distinguished from Foucault's suggestion that “the individual is not repressed by social order; the individual is in fact formed by it" (Foucault: 1981, p.217).
Heteronormativity has consequences for that minority who do not comply with normative society, for example homosexual, bisexual, transsexual, and intersexual people; individuals who deviate from atypical accepted heteronormativity are liable to heterosexism as they face prejudice and discrimination by some in the conforming proportion majority. (Warner, 1993, p.23) Heteronormativity has been reinforced by religious beliefs, partly through the prevalence of Christianity in western culture. The major western faiths reject homosexuality and elevated heterosexuality as the only accepted sexual preference. Although there have been disagreements on interpretation of the bible, the influence of institutional faith has largely underpinned heteronormativity. (Warner, 1993, p.27)
Heteronormativity is demonstrated at the moment of birth: individuals are quickly assigned to a sex category dependent on their sexual organs and therefore expected to conform to social gender roles. The power and dominance of heteronormativity is apparent when intersexual babies, with both male and female sex organs, are born. Intersexuals do not conform to 'normal' categories and this deviance generates such anxiety that some intersex babies have surgery shortly after birth to assign their sexual organs and their gender to either a male or female sex category - obviously without their consent. (Dreger, 1998, p.45) This demonstrates the extent in which heteronormativity has come to dominate modern western society. This type of operation has been reported to cause problems with sexual pleasure in later life. This begs the question, is conforming to heteronormativity necessary if it conflicts with personal preference or if it has negative implications for the individual? Hetronormativity can be challenged by increaseing homovisability, Societal visability of gay couples, gay teachers, or even open conversation about homosexuality can reduce the dominance of hetronormativity (Dreger, 1998, p.44)
Judith Butler (1991) challenges heteronormative views in her publication Imitation and Gender through challenging binary sexual (and gender) categories, thus demoting heterosexuality's dominance, reducing its normative power by increasing homovisibility and awareness of alternative sexual orientation, which in turn makes alternative sexual preferences more socially acceptable. She holds that sexual identities and desires are constantly changing: sexual expression is intertwined with societal power relations. (p.727) For example, in ancient Greece, in determining sexual preference the gender of a partner was less significant than whether or not someone took the active or passive role in sexual relations. This demostrates how power relations are intertwined into sexuality. Similar influences are also at work in contemporary stereotypes as womon are frequently portrayed as the passive sexual partner and men the active partner, however this perception is changing. (Dover, 1989. p.89).
Butler suggests that hetronormativity is reinforced through socio-cultural conditioning and also via the transmitting of visual culture which promotes hetero-visability and homo-invisability. This notion is supported by Richard Dyer (1993), who holds that contemporary cinema plays a vital role in maintaining heteronormativity (p.726)
Butler also investigates gender categories, and the implications categories of difference have on gender identity and gender roles. Butler argues that men and woman are essentially the same apart from different organization of sexual organs and, as a feminist; she defends individuals' rights to equality. Foucault would support this as he would argue that our habit of categorising the world in a ‘gendered' way is itself a social construction. He states that "when you view the world through the lens of gender differences, gender differences will be found." (McNay, 1992, p.121)
Butler (1991) believes that gender - like sexuality - is socially constructed. She suggests that gender is not something we are, but something we do. She holds that individuals play out a role that is socially enforced upon them through social conditioning. Gender roles assigned at birth are based on individual's biological sex; this gender role is played throughout individuals' lives. (p.720) Furthermore, Butler like Katz, holds that heteronormativity could not exist without the categorisation made by terms of difference and therefore questions the whole purpose of their invention. (p.723)
While the theories already discussed recognise the power of categorisation and a 'norm' Foucault is more explicit about the political effects of consciousness. Foucault, in History of Sexuality (1981), challenged essentialist assumptions, and his ideas have been important in the constructionist approach to sexuality. Foucault suggests that the way that individuals are categorised by difference is part of a larger social discourse that is representative of the power relationships within society. Foucault holds that these power relations are constantly changing depending on historical and cultural context and that there are also positive implications to the generation of terms of difference. These terms can provide recognition and power to people otherwise invisible, and provide leverage for visibility, a source of pride and political power in order to fight for their right to equality. He suggests that segregating homosexuals in this way heightens homo-visibility, and homosexuals feel part of a collective who can create their own subcultures, fighting the dominance of heteronormativity. (p.67) Increased homovisability can be demonstrated by the gay liberation movement in the Stonewall protests, and the extent of popular support for the London Lighthouse.
All constructivists hold that heterosexuality is socially constructed: indeed, all behaviour is product of socio-cultural conditioning. Similarly, all hold that heterosexually is a social construct that is culturally and historical dependent on the social context in which the term is used. Ned Katz, in particular, looks at the evolution of the term heterosexual and demonstrates the way the meaning of the term has changed throughout time, supporting the constructivists' claim that sexuality is historically and culturally contingent. (Katz, 1995, p.52) With such consensus, what evidence is there to the contrary?
Firstly, essentialists suggest that homosexual and heterosexual acts are historically consistent. This argument seems to be supported by Darwin's evolutionary theory that holds heterosexuality is essential for reproduction and the continuation of the species, and that there is regularity and consistency in some patterns of sexual behaviour, displayed across space and time. This might seem a strong criticism of the constructionist position as it suggests that sexuality is rooted in our biological nature rather than a product of social conditioning. Secondly, another question that must be asked of constructionists is that, if those who are considered deviant face heterosexism and discrimination, why would they choose to 'come out' and face the negative implications of a homophobic society? Also, the constructionist suggestion that all behaviour is a product of social conditioning can also be questioned, as it fails to explain why transexuals seek gender reasignment. Finally, the constructionist argument cannot account for those who generally believe that they are born with the biological sex organs that do not correspond with their psychological sex.
Paradoxically, perhaps Foucault provides an answer to the final two questions as, although he agrees the terms heterosexual and homosexual are of modern construction and therefore cannot be used to describe same sex or opposite sexual relations that have existed before the modern era, he also suggests that labels of difference have positive implications for the segregated: a shared label is a collective identity, providing them with the public visibility need to fight for equality. People might suffer prejudice, but the reality of their experience is recognised and endorsed by the labels of difference.

Social Construction of Gender 

      1. Historicizing Constructionism 
               a. What does it mean to historicize constructivism? 

                   Historicizing means when one presents something as a product of 
                   historical development. Constructionism means that we view the world 
                   through certain self made constructs1(or ideas about reality). 

                   Historicizing Constructionism hence means that over the course of history 
                   certain ideas have been constructed about gender. These ideas have been 
                   enforced and reinforced throughout time. So in today s world they are not 
                   presented as constructs but as essential truths which have been 
                   established through historical development of man.  

 

               b. What is social constructionism? 

                   It means that our realities are based on our experiences and interactions 
                   with other people. We experience the world through our own opinions. 
                   These opinions are constructed through a number of things such as 
                   culture, mores, tradition, beliefs and values.2 So one person might 
                   consider a dishwasher a necessity and the other might consider it a 
                   luxury. This will be discussed in subsection 3 when we consider whether 
                   sex is socially constructed or not.

    These are collectively called a social agreement

    2. Problematizing the category of Sex : Queer 
       Theory 
Queer theory developed in mid 1980s. The term was coined by T
                                                            ​ eresa de Lauretis​. 

          1. Historical and a mostly political Context: 

In the late 1970s and 1980s problems regarding the recognition of homosexuality led to 
widespread activism. The Gay Liberation Front was born in 1970 in Britain and it, along 
with other campaigns such as Campaign for Homosexual Equality, began to work for 
law reform. 

Public policies in the mid 1980 s were selectively blind to the plight of gay men who had 
contracted AIDS. It is estimated that 20,000 men died by 1987. This led to setting up of 
in-formal and non governmental health centres by civilians. Like the women of the 
second wave, these gay individuals were incensed by the casual attitude shown by the 
government.  

In such an atmosphere the idea of fluidity of gender was created. It led to the idea that 
gay individuals were no different than others and that their sexuality did not mean 
something was wrong with them. It was rather the heterosexual men and women who 
were acting according to social constructs. 

          2. What is queer theory? 

It is a set of ideas based around the fact that identities are not fixed and do not 
determine who we are. It suggests that it is meaningless to talk in general about 
'women' or any other group, as identities consist of many different elements. It is wrong 
to think that people can be seen collectively on the basis of one shared characteristic 
such as men, gay, lesbian. Queer theory proposes that we should deliberately challenge 
all notions of fixed identity, in unconventional ways. It denies that heterosexuality is 
normal or natural . Embodied in popular culture by Madonna.

Criticisms: 

 

                  i.      For most people, their sexual identity isn't fluid, it's constant. 
                 ii.      Queer theory focuses on cultural texts3 (rather than real life) where 
                          it is easier to find sexual or gender ambiguities. 
                 iii.     Discrimination at home and at work, for everyday gay people, are 
                          forgotten about in this approach as it reduces everyone to the same 
                          fluid identity. 
                 iv.      By celebrating difference, queer politics makes the 'gay' or 'lesbian' 
                          identity all too important. Other identities such as heterosexuality or 
                          asexuality are ignored. 
                  v.      Queer theory celebrates pleasure and therefore puts too much 
                          emphasis on sex.  

 

 

           3. Judith Butler’s Gender performativity theory.  

Judith Butler s book Gender Trouble (1990) made a profound contribution to the field. 
She argued that gender is socially constructed. So male and female behaviors are 
constructed and reinforced by media and culture4. Gender performativity theory also 
suggests that sexuality is not assigned to one orientation or preference. Sexual identity 
is fluid, a person can be heterosexual at one time and bisexual at another. 

                       ● Key Aspects of Butler’s theory: 
                              ○ Our identity is not fixed (male, female, heterosexual)

  These are objects that reveal cultural meanings. Examples can be movies, songs, performers (such as 
Madonna and David Bowie) and their personalities. 
4
  We can see examples where gender is seen to be socially constructed. Drag queens or the trend of 
househusbands (men who stay at home to take care of their children) shows that gender is socially 
constructed. Another example is that of Captain JAck Sparrow who uses make up and ses feminine 
gestures. These cause Gender Trouble by showing people not acting in accordance with their assigned 
gender roles.

                               ○ Our identity is made up of a pile of (social and cultural) 
                                    things which we have previously expressed, or which have 
                                    been said about us. IT is made of certain expectations from 
                                    us. 
                               ○ There is not really an inner self .  
                               ○ Gender, like other aspects of identity, is a performance. If 
                                    you perform the requirements of one gender than you are 
                                    assigned that gender 
                               ○    People can therefore change if they perform the 
                                    characteristics of another gender. (If a heterosexual female 
                                    starts performing activities and adopts characteristics of a 
                                    heterosexual male then her identity changes.) 
                               ○ The binary5 divide between masculinity and femininity is a 
                                    social construct built on the binary divide between men and 
                                    women          which is also a social construction.  
                               ○    We should challenge the traditional views of masculinity, 
                                    femininity and sexuality by causing gender trouble 

 

               4. Critics: 
                              i.    Judith Butler's followers ignore real-life oppression and 
                                    instead support their optimistic worldview by gazing at 
                                    gender-blending movies and photography.

Is Sex also socially determined? 

It can be said that to an extent sex is also socially constructed. It is true that the 
distinctions between the sexes depend on 6 anatomical features, however let s look at 
all these in detail. 
 
    1.    Chromosome make-up: XY (M) OR XX (F) (XXY Chromosomal variations = Klinefelter 
         Syndrome, XO Chromosomal variations = Turner Syndrome)  
    2.   External genitals: Penis(M) OR Vagina (F) (Some people are born with ambiguous 
         genitalia and they are classified as intersex) 
    3.   Internal genitalia: testes(M) OR Ovaries (F) (Internal genitalia of certain individuals may 
         not match their internal genitalia) 
    4.   Gonads 
    5.   Hormonal states [estrogen (F) and Testosterone (M)]  
    6.   Secondary sex characteristics 
 
Who determines when the size of the genitalia is sufficient for male? Not every genitalia is of 
the same size. When is a male genitalia small enough to be categorised as a female genitalia?6   



    5. Masculinities and Femininity 
 

6
  Phall-o-meters are used to classify children with ambiguous genitalia. Doctors make decisions regarding 
such children and whether they should be classified as male or female. So sex is also socially determined 
in such instances.

Ideas about masculinity and femininity are socially constructed. They vary across 
different cultures and societies as well as history.7 Femininity and masculinity are based 
upon, amongst other things, the social roles that women and men are expected to 
perform in their lives. 



    6. Nature versus Culture: A Debate in Gender 
       Development 
Nature vs Culture debate is a debate on what influences our gender. Do we identify as 
females because it has been re-inforced by our culture or because it is part of our 
biology? 

 

Research at the Johns Hopkins Children Center has shown that gender identity is 
almost entirely based on nature and is almost exclusively predetermined before the

birth of the baby. Two studies conducted by William Reiner, a child and adolescent 
psychiatrist and urologist, have confirmed that the amount of exposure to male 
hormones and androgens in utero almost exclusively decides whether the child 
identifies as masculine or feminine. 

Reiner followed 14 children whose testicles and male hormone levels were completely 
normal at birth, but who were born without a penis 12 of the children were surgically 
reconstructed to appear female. Today, all 12 of the children raised as females are 
strongly male a-typical in their behaviors, attitudes, friends and play. This re-iterates that 
perhaps gender may not totally be culturally constructed and certain aspects are a 
result of nature.  

However we can also argue that traits of masculinity or femininity may rest on cultural 
factors. 

Other natural differences between binary genders are; 

    ● Females attain puberty earlier than males 
    ● There is difference in bone development and structure between both 
    ● There is research to suggest that males are better math and females are better 
       at multitasking and speaking.

Alright, I've got these search results. Let's see what I can make of them.

First up, there's an article from Medium by Alex Byrne titled "Is Sex Socially Constructed?" It seems pretty comprehensive. Let me try to summarize it.

So, the main question is whether sex is socially constructed. Sex here refers to biological categories: female and male. The author argues that if sex is socially constructed, it means that these categories are created and defined by society and culture, not by natural biological facts.

The author mentions that sex is usually determined by biological factors like chromosomes, hormones, and reproductive anatomy. So, typically, males have XY chromosomes and females have XX chromosomes. But then there are intersex people who don't fit neatly into these categories, which makes the author wonder if the strict male/female binary is a social construct.

The author then introduces the concept of social construction, explaining that a socially constructed category is one where, if an object belongs to that category, it must exist within a society or social organization. For example, an engagement ring is socially constructed because it exists within societies that have the institution of marriage. On the other hand, a planet is not socially constructed because its existence doesn't depend on human societies.

The author presents three arguments that have been used to claim that sex is socially constructed, and then critiques these arguments.

The first argument is based on performativity, drawing from Judith Butler's work. The idea is that when a doctor declares "It's a girl!" or "It's a boy!" at birth, this is a performative act that constructs the baby's sex. However, the author argues that this doesn't hold up because "It's a girl!" is not a performative statement in the same way as "I apologize" is. The doctor isn't performing an action by saying those words; they're just stating a fact based on biological observations. So, the author concludes that this argument fails.

The second argument is based on the assignment of sex at birth. In cases like cloacal exstrophy, where the baby has ambiguous genitalia, medical professionals have to assign a sex category to the baby, considering social factors and potential quality of life. The author suggests that since social considerations are involved in assigning sex, this implies that sex is socially constructed. But the author points out that assignment and belonging are different things. Just because society assigns a sex to a baby doesn't mean that the baby's actual sex is socially constructed. So, this argument also doesn't hold water.

The third argument is from philosopher Ásta, who argues that if a property chiefly figures in explanations of social facts rather than natural facts, then it's a social property. Applying this to sex, Ásta says that sex mainly explains social facts, not natural ones, hence it's socially constructed. But the author counters this by using the example of red diamonds, which are socially significant but not socially constructed, even though they mainly explain social facts (like why people pay a lot for them) rather than natural facts.

After critiquing these arguments, the author concludes that none of them successfully establish that sex is socially constructed. The author then presents their own argument: sex is not socially constructed because females and males exist independently of human societies. Even if humans never evolved, there would still be females and males in the animal kingdom. Therefore, the categories of female and male are not dependent on human societies, and hence not socially constructed.

The author also addresses the objection that maybe human sex is socially constructed, even if animal sex isn't. But the author points out that human females and males have the same biological characteristics as other animals, and that even humans who have never been part of any society would still be female or male based on their biology.

So, in summary, the author argues that sex is not socially constructed because it's a biological reality that exists independently of human societies.

Moving on to the next article from Pacific Standard by Alice Dreger, titled "The Social Construction of Sex." Dreger seems to be responding to people who misinterpret her views on sex and gender. She clarifies that she doesn't think sex isn't real; she acknowledges that biological differences like testes, ovaries, chromosomes, and reproductive anatomy are real and not just social constructs.

However, she argues that the way we categorize and delineate males and females is a social decision. Nature doesn't provide clear-cut boundaries between sexes, especially considering variations like intersex conditions. Therefore, the borders we draw between male and female are inventions based on social needs, not inherent in nature.

Dreger distinguishes between sex (biological aspects) and gender (social roles and identities). She acknowledges that gender roles are socially constructed but suggests that gender identities may have biological roots, as evidenced by persistent patterns across cultures and individual experiences.

She criticizes strict biological determinism and social constructionism extremes, advocating for a nuanced view that recognizes both biological and social influences on gender and sexuality.

Next, there's an essay from UK Essays titled "Is Heterosexuality Socially Constructed?" This essay delves into the debate between constructionism and essentialism regarding sexuality. The author defines constructionism as the view that human behavior and sexuality are shaped by social and cultural contexts rather than being innate.

The essay discusses how terms like "heterosexuality" and "homosexuality" are relatively modern constructions, coined in the 19th century, and how their meanings have evolved over time. The author cites Michel Foucault and Judith Butler to argue that sexuality is discursively produced and that categorizations of sexuality serve to maintain power structures.

The concept of heteronormativity is central here, referring to the dominance of heterosexual norms and the marginalization of other sexualities. The author argues that heteronormativity is reinforced through socialization and cultural representations, but also notes that increased visibility of homosexuality can challenge this dominance.

The essay concludes by reasserting that heterosexuality is socially constructed and that this construction has historical and cultural specificity.

The fourth document is an Academia.edu paper on "Social Construction of Gender" by Abiha Mohsin. This paper discusses the social construction of gender, particularly through the lens of queer theory and Judith Butler's gender performativity theory.

Mohsin explains that queer theory emerged in the 1980s in response to the AIDS crisis and the lack of governmental support for LGBTQ+ communities. Queer theory challenges the fixed categories of gender and sexuality, arguing that identities are fluid and performative.

Butler's gender performativity theory posits that gender is not an essence but something we do through repeated performances. Gender roles are thus maintained through social expectations and individual actions that conform to these expectations.

The paper also touches on criticisms of queer theory, such as its focus on cultural texts over real-life experiences and its potential to overlook ongoing discrimination.

Lastly, there's a webpage from Treehozz.com that briefly defines social constructionism in relation to sexuality, reiterating that characteristics like gender, race, class, ability, and sexuality are products of human definition and interpretation shaped by cultural and historical contexts.

Analyzing these sources, it's clear that there's a distinction being drawn between the biological aspects of sex and the social aspects of gender and sexuality. While biology provides the physical foundations, the ways in which societies categorize and assign meaning to these biological differences are constructed through cultural norms and practices.

The debate seems to center around whether sex itself is socially constructed. The Medium article argues against this, maintaining that sex is a biological reality independent of social constructs, while other sources suggest that even the categorization of sex is a social decision, given the variations and ambiguities in biological sex.

It's also evident that gender roles and identities are widely considered to be socially constructed, influenced by cultural norms and expectations. The interplay between biology and society in shaping sexuality is complex, and different theorists emphasize different aspects of this interplay.

In conclusion, while sex may have a biological basis, the way societies categorize and understand sex and gender is indeed socially constructed. This social construction influences how individuals perceive themselves and are perceived by others, affecting their social roles, opportunities, and experiences.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{Sex is biologically determined, but the categories and meanings assigned to sex are socially constructed.}} \]
