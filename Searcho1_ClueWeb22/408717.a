So I've been asked whether manipulation is a form of abuse. Hmm, this is an interesting question, and I need to think carefully about it. First off, I should probably understand what manipulation and abuse mean individually before considering if one falls under the other.

Let me start by trying to define manipulation. From what I know, manipulation is when someone tries to influence another person's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors, often in a way that serves the manipulator's own interests. It can involve tactics like lying, withholding information, or playing on someone's emotions. Manipulation can be subtle and not always obvious.

Now, abuse is a broader term that can cover physical, emotional, sexual, or verbal harm inflicted on someone. Emotional abuse, in particular, involves behaviors that control, belittle, or intimidate another person, causing them distress or trauma.

So, is manipulation a form of abuse? Well, manipulation can certainly be abusive, especially when it's used to control or harm someone. For example, if someone constantly lies to you or withholds important information to make you feel insecure or dependent on them, that could be considered emotional abuse.

But not all manipulation is abuse, right? There are situations where manipulation might be mild or even somewhat benign. For instance, a parent might manipulate their child's behavior by using rewards or punishments to encourage good habits. While this is a form of manipulation, it's generally accepted as part of good parenting and not considered abusive.

So, maybe it's about the intent and the impact. If the manipulation is intended to harm or control someone and causes them distress, then it could be classified as abuse. On the other hand, if the manipulation is for the benefit of both parties or doesn't cause harm, it might not be considered abuse.

I should probably look into this more deeply. Maybe there are established definitions or research on this topic that can help clarify things.

Let me try searching for some information on manipulation and abuse.

Manipulation is Abuse
Manipulation is abuse
Not all kinds of abuse and toxicity show themselves through physical violence.
How to identify manipulative situations and people, & how to deal with them.
Crowdsourced by survivors
hello
This guide will help you identify manipulative situations and find support to get yourself out of a controlling relationship.
A healthy relationship is...
.....balanced and equal. You feel that you can express your views and opinions freely and act on them without fearing a negative reaction.
A healthy relationship is not ...
...feeling that you are being used by someone that your emotional wellbeing is the cost for their happiness. If you feel like this, you are most likely being manipulated and are in an abusive situation.
A controlling relationship is one-sided and unstable.
A controlling relationship does not have to be romantic. It is a relationship where you feel you are being emotionally abused or manipulated into doing things (or put into situations)that make you feel physically and / or emotionally distressed.
Partners, family members, carers, friends, colleagues to even teachers: anyone could be manipulating you.
MANIPULATION
‍ the action of indirectly interfering with the decision-making process of another person, particularly in a clever or unscrupulous way.
‍
‍ PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION
‍ can be abusive, deceptive and sneaky, to make you behave the way the perpetrator wants.
‍
‍ EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION
‍ is meant to confuse you and leave you off-balance, and is often very subtle and deceptive
This guide has been crowdsourced by Chayn volunteers, many of which are survivors of abuse, to help signpost you towards as many of the relevant resources we’ve been able to gather. Get in touch if there’s more that we can add. Throughout the guide, we will be using controlling and manipulative interchangeably.
Who this guide is for:
We are all at risk of being controlled, regardless of our gender identity or sexual orientation. It’s not easy to identify abuse in your relationships, especially where there are emotions involved. And it becomes even harder when the perpetrator is not physically harming you. But let’s get one thing straight: mental abuse caused by manipulation is equally harmful.
Moreover there are various social and economic factors that can have an impact some people’s ability to identify and report abuse.
Sadly, if the manipulator is aware of these vulnerabilities, they may try to exploit them to maintain control over you.
We know that women are more likely to experience abuse but there are other factors that we need to keep in mind. Some groups are more vulnerable than others when it comes to controlling relationships, including (but not limited to):
Minorities and marginalised groups
Recent immigrants
Elders who are facing abuse and manipulation from caregivers
Parents in fear of losing children
Individuals in forced marriages
Queer communities
Physically disabled
Here’s the bottom line: If you are in an abusive relationship with anyone, you deserve to get the help you need.
Every person has a right to live a life free from abuse.
What the guide is for
Ever felt like someone knew how to push your buttons and despite how uncertain you were of believing or doing something, somehow they were able to make you believe or do something else? Ever felt like someone was trying to control you or force you into situations you do not wish to participate in?
You could be dealing with a controlling person and have found yourself in a manipulative relationship.
This is not limited to behaviour in romantic relationships. You can be manipulated by partners, family, friends, carers, colleagues, teachers - any situation where you feel you are being emotionally abused or manipulated into actions and situations you do not want to be a part of.
This guide is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but is rather a compilation of subtle and more outright examples of manipulation and control, how you can identify them and remove yourself.
Not everyone who acts in the following ways may be deliberately trying to manipulate you. Regardless, it’s important to recognize these behaviours in situations where your rights, interests and safety are at stake.
This is a list of things you can think about, to help you increase your safety.
If you are still in the relationship:
See what are the different options for a safe and happy future - do you want to confront your significant other, or do you want to leave? Or do you think you have a third option?
Elders who are facing abuse and manipulation from caregivers
If you decide to leave:
Try not to place yourself in a vulnerable position or to isolate yourself
Consider telling your employer or others at your place of work - particularly if you think your abuser may try to contact you there
If you live with the person, spend time planning where would be a safe place for you to stay as soon as you leave
If your abuser continues to (try to) manipulate and control you:
Keep detailed records of each incident, including the date and time it occurred, what was said or done, and if possible and relevant, photographs of any damage or injury caused to yourself or others. Also, see “How to build your own Domestic Violence case without a Lawyer” guide.
These three scenarios have an emphasis on romantic relationships, but the principles behind all of them apply to any manipulative situation you may find yourself in, and need to remove yourself from.Even if you don't feel your safety is at risk, you could still be in a manipulative relationship. Please do read on if you feel this could be the case.
Regardless of what may drive someone to be controlling, you do not deserve to be subjected to, or continue to accept, this aggression.
Take the quiz
A quiz (researched and taken from this book) to self-assess the healthiness of a personal/professional relationship:
Answer the following questions with a TRUE or F ALSE.
I sometimes feel confused about what my partner/colleague really wants.
I feel that my partner/colleague frequently takes advantage of my giving nature.
Even when I do something that pleases my partner/colleague, the positive feelings between us never last long.
With my partner/colleague, I feel that it's hard just to be myself or do what I really want.
Around my partner/colleague, I feel taken for granted.
I seem to work harder on this relationship than my partner/colleague does.
My partner/colleague has a very strong impact on what I think and feel
I sometimes feel that I am trapped in this relationship and there is no way out.
I don't feel as good about myself in this relationship as I once did.
I feel that I need my partner/colleague more than my partner/colleague needs me.
No matter how much I have done, I feel that it's not good enough for my partner/colleague.
I feel that my partner/colleague does not understand who I really am.
There are twelve questions in this quiz.
If you answered more than six of them with TRUE, then you might want to consider the possibility that you are in a controlling relationship. You will find more detailed examples of manipulative behaviour later in this guide.
Take the quiz
How to identify manipulative situations and people,
& how to deal with them.
Manipulation in any situation, resulting in control of your behaviour, thoughts and actions, is a sign of an unhealthy and unbalanced / one-sided relationship.
Healthy social influence is part of the give and take of constructive relationships. In psychological manipulation, one person is used for the benefit of another. The manipulator deliberately creates an imbalance of power, and exploits to serve their own agenda.
Do any of these sound familiar to you in any of your relationships?
Controlling other people’s perceptions of you
This might sound like: “They only like you because I lie to them about you!”
This could include spreading misinformation about you to others, and / or emphasising to you that others’ good opinion of you is entirely dependent on their representation of you, and that you have them to thank for your own success.
Isolation
This might sound like: "I don't like your parents, they are not good to you and I don't want you to see them”, or telling you which friends you’re allowed to see.
Financial control
This might sound like: "You spend too much on yourself" / "Dear, you know you can't be trusted with money. It's best that I'm in charge."
Manipulative people will use financial control methods to gain power and control in relationships.
Financial abuse is one of the most powerful ways to keep someone trapped in a relationship, and can take subtle or overt forms to limit access to assets and accessibility to family finances. This is intentional and is used to entrap you in the relationship.
Dependence
This might come out in the form of drastic statements about what the manipulator might do if you don’t do what they ask, or over-reactions, such as obsessively calling you if you don’t answer at first.
This could be a form of emotional blackmail and might appear in exaggerated, dramatic language that makes you feel as though the other person’s wellbeing is entirely your responsibility.
Using your beliefs to control you
This might sound like: “How will I get to heaven if I have a child like you?!” / “You have no respect and will never pray for me when I am gone.”This exploits your beliefs for the benefit of the manipulator,resulting in controlling you and your actions.
They may refer to your faith or a higher calling as the reason you need to do something, in order to achieve their own goals.
Not allowed to defend yourself
This might sound like: “I’m sure he / she only has your best interests at heart” / “What did you do to make them feel like that?”
Controlling people may make themselves out to be the victim to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions. They may react to your defence- in family situations this can be seen as “talking back”, and is seen as a sign of insolence and disrespect from you.
They will act as though you are the one who has done something wrong and hurt them.Remember you have every right to speak up for yourself.
People will defend your abuser
This might sound like:
“I’m sure he / she only has your best interests at heart”
“What did you do to make them feel like that?”
“he / she only yelled at you because you made him / her so angry with what you did”
What happens? Others around you may not realise the extent or persistence of the manipulative person’s behaviour, as they may be an expert at hiding it from others, or they believe the abuser’s lies about you, and may have the same beliefs as the abuser but not agree with their methods.
Keeping the status quo is more important than your health
This might sound like: “They are old and set in their ways, it’s our culture.” / “They only want the best for you, I can’t believe you are being so dramatic about this / mean to them.”
What happens? People may make excuses for an abuser's behaviour, even if they know the damage they are inflicting. They will ignore the issue, make excuses, believe the abuser’s lies about you, and in certain cultural contexts, may not agree with the abuser’s methods but fundamentally have the same beliefs as the abuser.
Silent treatment
This might sound like: “Why am I such an awful person…” / “How can I make this better…” / “It doesn’t matter I’m upset because I’ve made them angry…”
What happens? Controlling people may stop talking to you completely to exert pressure upon you, and to coerce you into what they want you to do, and see how long it will take before you break down. One person shares:“My very first boyfriend did this when I didn't want to have sex. He literally turned his back on me, and didn't respond to anything until I agreed to have sex. No violence involved, but very damaging still…”
The ‘no way out’ question
This might sound like: “How could you say that to me?”
What happens? You might think you are given a choice by being asked a question but the answer has already been decided by the manipulator. Usually, after such a question, there is a pause and people are programmed to respond to a conversational pause by offering to help, hence you might just do whatever the manipulator wants you to do.
A question disguised as a statement
This might sound like:
“I was wondering why you…”
“Perhaps you could…”
“I wish you would…”
What happens? Manipulative people avoid asking questions because they do not want to lose control. So instead they frame statements as questions.
Lies
This might sound like:
“They only like you because I lie to them about you!”
“I never said that! You are imagining things again.” or
“You are nowhere near as beautiful as she is”
“You are nothing compared to them”.
What happens? Manipulators may react aggressively to avoid answering as they may fear loss of control. They may even shift the focus onto you by asking you questions, or may start accusing you or even change the subject completely.
Guilt-tripping
This might sound like:
“If you loved me…”
“Every decent person would…” or “You should be grateful you have me…” “Do you think anyone else would want you?”
“You would be nothing without me”,
or making you feel guilty for normal actions - e.g. “Why did you get your haircut without telling me?”
What happens? Controlling people use statements to make you feel guilty about doing or not doing something.
Normalisation
This might sound like: “What will people say if you leave? You made your decision and you have to stop being so ungrateful.”
What happens? Normalisation refers to social processes through which ideas and actions are seen as culturally “normal” in everyday life. Manipulative people take full advantage of this and use it against you.
Universal statements
This may sound like: “You are so lazy!” / “You forget to do this every time!” / “Everyone knows that you’re bad.”
What happens? These generalise a person’s character or behaviour in a negative way. They often involve the use of words such as “always,”“never,”“again,”“so,”“every time,”“such as,” and “everyone.”
Invalidate feelings
This may sound like: “You’re blowing things way out of proportion.” OR: “Your anger is a big of an overreaction.”
What happens? Manipulators will invalidate your feelings. This happens when we recognise emotions, positive or negative, coming out of a person, and either discount, belittle, minimise, ignore or negatively judge these feelings.
If these behaviours seem familiar to you, you could be in a controlling relationship.

The law
It is encouraging to see many countries are taking important steps to include emotional abuse in existing legislation as well as introducing new legislation on domestic abuse. One such case is the UK.
The UK Government has published a Statutory Guidance Framework on Controlling and Coercive Behaviour in an Intimate or Family Relationship here. This created a new offence of controlling or coercive behaviour.
Remember,manipulation and coercive control - that is the use of force or intimidation to obtain compliance - is illegal in England and Scotland. New powers will target perpetrators who subject spouses, partners and other family members to serious psychological and emotional torment, but stop short of violence.

Manipulation in Abusive Relationships
Manipulation
A broad definition of manipulation is anyway of trying to get something other than asking directly. The term is used most however, to describe a situation in which someone ends up doing what they do not really want to do, because someone has made the alternatives difficult. There are always situations in which a person has to pick between two unwanted alternatives. With manipulation, though, it is the active efforts of another person that brings the two choices together artificially, and that is what is so unnerving and unfair for the target.
In coercion, force or threats of real harm are used to get someone to do what they do not want to do. In manipulation, usually the target's beliefs or self-image is used against his self-interest or real desire. Manipulation can work even if the target understands what is happening, because it is still difficult to say no. In this sense, manipulation is not invincible, and alone cannot constitute abuse. Just like other forms of subtle control, however, manipulation is useful to understand because no controlling person fails to use it frequently. Anything can be manipulated, especially by someone who knows the target well, but below are some examples based on common situations:
The manipulator promises vague help or benefit in the future, then asks for something concrete and substantial in the present. [ Most people feel that they should reciprocate and may miss that there is actually no exchange here.]
The manipulator just goes ahead and does what he knows the target won't agree to. [This is based on the saying that it is easier to get forgiveness than permission. This puts the burden on the target to do something, and be the 'heavy'.]
The manipulator brings up something alarming, as in the news, then asks for something unrelated. [ Alarm causes people to want to take action. If there is no obvious action--say because there is no real threat--a mildly alarmed person will be more amenable to suggestions.]
The manipulator compliments someone, then asks for something. [This is common enough that most people pick up on it, but it works nonetheless, because most people feel they owe something for a compliment, even, strangely, a compliment they know to be insincere.]
The manipulator brings up something the other person feels guilty about, then asks for something. [Even if the guilt is unrelated to the manipulator, a target will tend to feel indebted and embarrassed, and give what is asked, because he or she feels they 'owe.']
The manipulator implies that something is needed, but never asks for it. [Most manipulators understand that this is more powerful than actually asking. If they just asked, a discussion or negotiation could ensue in which the target asks for something in return and considers the merits of the request. Not asking short-circuits this possible conversation, while still leaving the target, as is natural with people, wanting to help.]
The manipulator calls the target selfish. [ Most targets have as a self-image of selflessness, which is an unobtainable idea, so they are very vulnerable to this word, even if there already exists a huge imbalance in the relationship in the manipulator's favor.]
The manipulator starts an elaborately planned activity or trip with the target, then asks at the last minute for something that has to be completed to continue. [ The target will not want to endanger what has taken effort to arrange or has been eagerly awaited so they will go along.]
The manipulator asks for something clearly unreasonable and receives an abrupt no, then asks for something smaller. [Saying no, even justly, creates guilt and a sense of indebtedness in most targets, and so they will often give after a no what they would no give in the first place.]
The manipulator 'confides' an irresponsible behavior to the target. [The target from that point forward, is hampered in addressing any irresponsible behavior within a family or group because that might betray the confidence. Although the information probably would have been discerned anyway,  giving it first as 'a secret' works as self-conveyed immunity. Some helping professions keep strict confidentiality of course, but that works because they aren't impacted by the behavior.]
If the manipulator is in a position to be the one to give to the target what they should get anyway, he or she may still ask the target for something. [  If there is a likelihood or possibility that the manipulator actually will withhold, that is coercion, but commonly the manipulator is just abusing the feeling of reciprocity.]
The manipulator knows it is easier to get 'forgiveness' than permission [The large inconvenience of making the manipulator undo something does not seem justified by the small inconvenience of letting it pass.]
The manipulator asks for something that they know the target does not want to give in front of other people. [ There is a social norm to not allow conflict to be public, so a "no" is harder in this situation.]
The manipulator insists that the target promised, and is now morally bound. [First, changing one's mind is a fundamental human prerogative, with or without new information or more time to reflect. Second, a promise only has a moral aspect to it at all if one obtained something specific for the promise in the first place, which is actually the opposite of this manipulation.]
The manipulator wears the target down in steps. [First an agreement is negotiated which is suitable to both parties. In this process it has become clear there is something the target won't agree to. A short time later, the manipulating party contacts the target with a 'problem' and asks for a change in the agreement to accommodate the difficulty. Because the target wants to be reasonable, and because good people always have a desire to keep agreements and plans working, and the change seems small, the target agrees. A short time later there is another difficulty reported to the target, and another step is allowed. Eventually, the target ends up agreeing to what they would not have agreed to all at once. Perhaps the manipulator never intended to fulfill the original agreement but wanted to make the target feel committed and  let down their guard.]
The antidote to manipulation includes:
Responding in the context of the entire relationship, not just the moment
Honoring feelings
Understanding the difference between on the one hand, words and promises and on the other hand, something substantial and actual
Understanding that consistency is not a moral imperative
Having a healthy relationship to one's self-interest-- neither dominating or a doormat. This benefits everyone the most because it prevents dehumanizing distortions in relationships on all sides.
Knowing that a sincere "no" usually strengthens any relationship worth keeping.
Sometimes insisting people undo something they had no right to do in the first place.
Understanding that maintaining a sense of integrity in the long run is far more important than any missed opportunity, inconvenience, or awkwardness in the moment.

Manipulation
Manipulation
Manipulation is the practice of using indirect tactics to control behavior, emotions, and relationships.
What Is Manipulation?
Most people engage in periodic manipulation. For example, telling an acquaintance you feel “fine” when you are actually depressed is, technically, a form of manipulation because it controls your acquaintance’s perceptions of and reactions to you.
Manipulation can also have more insidious consequences, however, and it is often associated with emotional abuse, particularly in intimate relationships. Most people view manipulation negatively, especially when it harms the physical, emotional, or mental health of the person being manipulated.
While people who manipulate others often do so because they feel the need to control their environment and surroundings, an urge that often stems from deep-seated fear or anxiety, it is not a healthy behavior. Engaging in manipulation may prevent the manipulator from connecting with their authentic self, and being manipulated can cause an individual to experience a wide range of ill effects.
Mental Health Effects of Manipulation
If unaddressed, manipulation can lead to poor mental health outcomes for those who are manipulated. Chronic manipulation in close relationships may also be a sign emotional abuse is taking place, which in some cases, can have a similar effect to trauma —particularly when the victim of manipulation is made to feel guilty or ashamed.
Victims of chronic manipulation may:
Feel depressed
Develop anxiety
Develop unhealthy coping patterns
Constantly try to please the manipulative person
Lie about their feelings
Put another person’s needs before their own
Find it difficult to trust others
In some cases, manipulation can be so pervasive that it causes a victim to question their perception of reality. The classic movie Gaslight illustrated one such story, in which a woman’s husband subtly manipulated her until she no longer trusted her own perceptions. For example, the husband covertly turned down the gaslights and convinced his wife the dimming light was all in her head.
Manipulation and Mental Health
While most people engage in manipulation from time to time, a chronic pattern of manipulation can indicate an underlying mental health concern.
Manipulation is particularly common with personality disorder diagnoses such as borderline personality (BPD) and narcissistic personality (NPD). For many with BPD, manipulation may be a means of meeting their emotional needs or obtaining validation, and it often occurs when the person with BPD feels insecure or abandoned. As many people with BPD have witnessed or experienced abuse, manipulation may have developed as a coping mechanism to get needs met indirectly.
Individuals with narcissistic personality (NPD) may have different reasons for engaging in manipulative behavior. As those with NPD may have difficulty forming close relationships, they may resort to manipulation in order to “keep” their partner in the relationship. Characteristics of narcissistic manipulation may include shaming, blaming, playing the “victim,” control issues, and gaslighting.
Munchausen syndrome by proxy, during which a caregiver makes another person ill to gain attention or affection, is another condition that is characterized by manipulative behaviors.
Manipulation in Relationships
Long-term manipulation can have serious effects in close relationships, including those between friends, family members, and romantic partners. Manipulation can deteriorate the health of a relationship and lead to poor mental health of those in the relationship or even the dissolution of the relationship.
In a marriage or partnership, manipulation can cause one partner to feel bullied, isolated, or worthless. Even in healthy relationships, one partner may inadvertently manipulate the other in order to avoid confrontation or even in an attempt to keep their partner from feeling burdened. Many people may even know they are being manipulated in their relationship and choose to overlook or downplay it. Manipulation in intimate relationships can take many forms, including exaggeration, guilt, gift-giving or selectively showing affection, secret-keeping, and passive aggression.
Parents who manipulate their children may set their children up for guilt, depression, anxiety, eating issues, and other mental health conditions. One study also revealed that parents who regularly use manipulation tactics on their children may increase the likelihood their children will also use manipulative behavior. Signs of manipulation in the parent-child relationship may include making the child feel guilty, lack of accountability from a parent, downplaying a child’s achievements, and a need to be involved with many aspects of the child’s life.
People may also feel manipulated if they are part of a friendship that has become toxic. In manipulative friendships, one person may be using the other to meet their own needs at the expense of their friend’s. A manipulative friend might use guilt or coercion to extract favors, such as loaning money, or they may only reach out to that friend when they need their own emotional needs met and may find excuses when their friend has needs in the relationship.
Examples of Manipulative Behavior
Sometimes, people may manipulate others unconsciously, without being fully aware of what they’re doing, while others may actively work on strengthening their manipulation tactics. Some signs of manipulation include:
Passive-aggressive behavior
Implicit threats
Dishonesty
Withholding information
Isolating a person from loved ones
Gaslighting
Verbal abuse
Use of sex to achieve goals
As the motives behind manipulation can vary from unconscious to malicious, it’s important to identify the circumstances of the manipulation that is taking place. While breaking things off may be critical in situations of abuse, a therapist may help others learn to deal with or confront manipulative behavior from others.
How to Deal with Manipulative People
When manipulation becomes toxic, dealing with the behavior from others can be exhausting. Manipulation in the workplace has been shown to reduce performance, and manipulative behavior from loved ones can make reality seem questionable. If you feel you are being manipulated in any kind of a relationship, it may be helpful to:
Disengage. If someone is trying to get a particular emotional response from you, choose not to give it to them. For example, if a manipulative friend is known to flatter you before asking for an overreaching favor, don’t play along—rather, reply politely and move the conversation along.
Be confident. Sometimes, manipulation may include one person’s attempts to cause another person to doubt their abilities, intuition, or even reality. If this happens, it may help to stick to your story; however, if this happens often in a close relationship, it could be time to leave.
Address the situation. Call out the manipulative behavior as it’s happening. Keeping the focus on how the other person’s actions are affecting you rather than starting with an accusatory statement may also help you reach a resolution while emphasizing that their manipulative tactics won’t work on you.
Stay on-topic. When you point out a behavior that makes you feel manipulated, the other person may try to minimize the situation or muddle the situation by bringing up other issues as a distraction. Remember your main point and stick to that.
Addressing Manipulation in Therapy
Treatment and therapy for manipulative behavior may depend largely on what underlying issues are causing the behavior. If, for instance, the manipulation is being caused by an underlying mental health issue, individual therapy may help that person understand why their behavior is unhealthy for themselves and those around them. A counselor may also be able to help the manipulative person learn skills for interacting with others while respecting their boundaries and address underlying insecurities that may be contributing to the behavior.
Certain mental health issues such as borderline personality may cause people to feel anxiety in relationships, causing them to act manipulatively in order to feel secure. In these instances, a therapist may help the person address their mental health issue, which in turn can reduce their anxiety and help them feel secure in their relationships.

What is Psychological Manipulation?

Psychological manipulation may involve the act of bullying.
Psychological manipulation, also known as emotional manipulation, is a form of coercion or persuasion. It can involve brainwashing or bullying, and is usually deceptive or abusive in nature. It is usually employed in an attempt to control the behavior of others. It typically uses various forms of abuse, such as emotional blackmail, to coerce others into doing things that they may not want to do.
Psychological manipulators may use sympathy to coerce others into doing what they want.
People who practice this behavior generally use bullying, brainwashing, or mind control tactics to get others to do things for them. Manipulative people may lack appropriate sensitivity and caring for others, or they may believe that manipulating others is the best way to get what they want. Manipulative people may be afraid to form healthy relationships, or afraid of not being accepted. Manipulative behaviors often stem from an inability to accept responsibility for one's own life, problems, and behaviors. Psychological manipulation tactics are often employed in an attempt to foist that responsibility off on others.
Psychological manipulators will most likely experience problems with personal relationships.
Most manipulators use the same mind control tactics to exercise influence over others. Emotional blackmail is considered one such tactic, in which the psychological manipulator seeks to inspire guilt or sympathy in the manipulated person. Guilt and sympathy are considered two of the strongest human emotions, and are capable of spurring most people into action. Manipulative people often take advantage of this, using guilt or sympathy to coerce others into helping or cooperating with them. They are often capable of inspiring degrees of guilt or sympathy vastly disproportionate to the situation at hand.

Passive-aggressive behavior may be a form of psychological manipulation during a conflict between two people.
Another tactic used in manipulation is a form of abuse known as crazy-making. Crazy-making usually aims to foster self-doubt in the manipulated person, to the point where some victims may in fact feel as if they are going crazy. Crazy-making tactics can involve passive-aggressive behavior. A manipulative person might express approval or support verbally, while giving contradictory non-verbal cues. Those who use psychological manipulation might even actively attempt to undermine certain behaviors, all while openly claiming to support or approve of them. They may employ deception, rationalization, justification, and even outright denial of any ill intent if confronted with their behavior.
Victims of psychological manipulation may be emotionally damaged by the experience.
Persons who practice psychological manipulation often may not fully recognize the needs of others, and usually lose the ability to consider or meet the needs of others. They may find it difficult to form long-lasting relationships and friendships, as others may find them difficult to trust. It can be difficult for the victims to maintain an emotional connection with the manipulative person, who may often give the impression of putting his own problems, needs, and experiences before those of others.

Alright, so I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they have to say about manipulation and whether it's a form of abuse.

First, from the Chayn.co website, there's a guide titled "Manipulation is Abuse." It starts by defining manipulation as indirect interference in someone's decision-making process, often in a clever or unscrupulous way. It also mentions that psychological manipulation can be abusive, deceptive, and sneaky, aiming to make someone behave in a way the manipulator wants. Emotional manipulation is described as confusing and off-balance, and it's often subtle and deceptive.

The guide emphasizes that manipulation is a form of abuse, particularly emotional abuse, which involves controlling, belittling, or intimidating behaviors that cause distress or trauma. It lists various signs of manipulation, such as controlling perceptions, isolation, financial control, dependence, using beliefs to control, not allowing self-defense, and more. The guide also provides a quiz to assess the healthiness of a relationship based on these factors.

From the AbuseAndRelationships.org site, manipulation is defined broadly as any way of trying to get something without asking directly. It's used to describe situations where someone ends up doing something they don't really want to do because the alternatives are made difficult by the manipulator. The site distinguishes manipulation from coercion, where force or threats are used, and notes that manipulation often uses the target's beliefs or self-image against their self-interest.

The site provides a list of examples of manipulative behaviors, such as promising future benefits while asking for immediate action, doing something without permission and then expecting forgiveness, bringing up alarming topics to influence decisions, complimenting before making a request, exploiting guilt, implying needs without asking, calling the target selfish, starting elaborate plans to create dependency, asking for unreasonable things to negotiate down, confiding in the target to limit their ability to address issues, and wearing down the target through incremental requests.

The antidote to manipulation includes considering the entire relationship context, honoring feelings, understanding the difference between words and actions, recognizing that consistency isn't always required, having a healthy sense of self-interest, being willing to say no, sometimes insisting on undoing manipulative actions, and prioritizing long-term integrity over short-term discomfort.

GoodTherapy.org defines manipulation as using indirect tactics to control behavior, emotions, and relationships. It notes that while most people engage in occasional manipulation, chronic manipulation can indicate underlying mental health issues, such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) or narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Manipulation in these cases may stem from a need to control the environment due to deep-seated fears or anxieties.

The article discusses the mental health effects of manipulation, including depression, anxiety, unhealthy coping mechanisms, and difficulties in trusting others. It also mentions that chronic manipulation can lead to outcomes similar to trauma, especially when combined with guilt or shame. The site provides examples of manipulative behavior, such as passive-aggressiveness, implicit threats, dishonesty, withholding information, isolating individuals, gaslighting, verbal abuse, and using sex to achieve goals.

Lastly, TheHealthBoard.com defines psychological manipulation, also known as emotional manipulation, as a form of coercion or persuasion that is often deceptive or abusive. It involves tactics like brainwashing or bullying to control others' behavior. Manipulators may use sympathy or guilt to get others to do what they want, or employ "crazy-making" techniques to instill self-doubt in their targets.

So, synthesizing this information, manipulation can indeed be a form of abuse, specifically emotional abuse, when it's used to control, belittle, or intimidate someone, causing them distress or trauma. Not all manipulation is abuse, but when it's intended to harm or control and causes negative effects, it crosses into abusive territory.

I think the key points are:

1. Manipulation involves influencing someone's decisions indirectly, often for the manipulator's benefit.

2. When manipulation is used to control or harm someone, it can be considered emotional abuse.

3. Manipulation can take many forms, from subtle tactics like complimenting before a request to more overt actions like isolating someone or exploiting their guilt.

4. Chronic manipulation can have severe mental health consequences for the target, including depression, anxiety, and trust issues.

5. Certain mental health conditions, like BPD and NPD, are associated with higher tendencies toward manipulative behavior.

Therefore, while not all manipulation is abuse, it can certainly be a form of abuse when it's used to control or harm others.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes, manipulation can be a form of abuse when it is used to control or harm someone, causing distress or trauma.}}\]
