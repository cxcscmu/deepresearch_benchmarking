Alright, I need to figure out what effect the Great Awakening had on the American colonies. I'm not super confident about this, so I think I should look up some information to make sure I get it right. Let me start by understanding what the Great Awakening was.

I think it was a religious movement in the 1700s, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should do a search to get a basic definition and some key points about it. That way, I can build my answer from there.

So, I'll write:

The First Great Awakening: AP® US History Crash Course
The First Great Awakening: AP® US History Crash Course
The Albert Team
Last Updated On: March 1, 2022
Before the age of revolution, America experienced a time of intense revival and renewed focus on religion.  It shaped much of American culture in years to come and laid the foundation for future religious and social movements. As an AP® US History student, it is absolutely essential that you understand the importance of the first great awakening in America. This crash course will fill you in!
Definition:
A movement of religious revival during the mid to late 18 th century.
Background:
One of the most prominent movements of the 18 th century was the enlightenment, which was a result of the scientific revolution. The Enlightenment, which originally took hold in Europe, encouraged people to value logic and reason more than just taking things at face value or accepting them by faith. People such as philosophers John Locke and David Hume led the movement. This ultimately led to a decline in faith, and often, a decline a piety. Church attendance declined, and the importance of spiritual matters in daily life was diminished.
Overview:
As stated in the definition, the first great awakening refers to a period of time in the mid 18 th century marked by religious renewal. It was a time that saw a dramatic increase in preaching and church attendance, and religious and spiritual matters were brought to the forefront of American life, more so than they had been since before the enlightenment. People not only started to pay more attention to spiritual matters, particularly the Christian faith, but people also started to think about how these things played a role in their everyday lives. Also, emotion, more than reason, started to have a significant impact on people’s faith.
A couple of key figures ultimately sparked the Great Awakening in America. One of those figures was Jonathan Edwards, a prominent minister who is most well known for his sermon titled “Sinners in the Hand of an Angry God.” Edwards not only delivered very intense and emotional sermons, he was also an extremely well known author with many popular books. One of these books is simply known as “A Faithful Narrative” and it describes a revival that took place in Northampton, MA. His accounts of this revival sparked many other revivals across the country.

Another key figure to the first Great Awakening is George Whitefield. Whitefield was a popular preacher at the time and he was famous for his incredible oratory. He was known to attract thousands of people just to hear him speak. He is often described as a very theatrical teacher with a flair for the dramatic, and his preaching is rumored to have brought grown men to tears. Similar to Edwards, there was a certain emotional aspect to his teaching, which was mostly unheard of before hand.
One important theme that is important to know about the first Great Awakening is the idea of Old Lights and New Lights. Basically, Old lights did not appreciate all of the emotional fervor that went along with the Great Awakening, and they were ultimately against the Great Awakening movement. New lights, on the other hand, embraced the emotional aspects of the movement and were very much in support of it. Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield both fall under the category of new lights. This created a divide within the church, although the New light movement was much more popular. It eventually even led to the creation of separate churches and universities based on this divide. Princeton University actually stemmed out of the first Great Awakening and the divide between Old and New Lights.
Effects of the Great Awakening:
The Great Awakening had numerous effects on the political and social spheres of the United States. For one, Protestant Christianity became one of the most prominent religions in America. Within Christianity, a lot of different forms and denominations emerged. Up until the Great Awakening, it was pretty much just Congregational, Quaker, and Puritan churches in the U.S. Because of all the new ideas being put forward, and the inevitable disagreements over these ideas, Christian groups broke off into different denominations. As a result Methodism, Baptists, Presbyterians, and a few other groups grew immensely.

Another effect is that it unified colonies. Although denominations meant more division within the church, they created a certain kind of unity among the colonies. This is mostly just due to the large scope of the Great Awakening. Regardless of where in the states you lived, chances are you had been exposed to Great Awakening teachings or had even been a part of the movement in some shape or form.
Lastly, it drastically changed the religious landscape of the United States. Religion started to become a much bigger part of everyday life. People began to practice piety, meaning that they practiced their faith fervently and consistently. It also had a much more emotional spirit to it, and was not so centered on knowledge and traditions. At the same time, it caused a refocusing on different theological ideas such as the pre-destination versus free will debate that marked the time. These new thoughts and ideas also opened up the way for different religious movements in the future, and made it easier for these to take hold.
Why you need to know it for AP® US History:
For the AP® US History exam it is almost a guarantee that you will be asked at least one question about the Great Awakening. It is absolutely essential that you know the time period when the first Great Awakening took place. Further, you may be asked about whom Jonathan Edwards or George Whitefield were. A likely question might ask you which leader wrote “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.” Further, you could be asked a multiple choice question about the effects of the Great Awakening, and you should know that if “increased diversity among religions” is an answer, then it’s the right one.
For free response or document based questions, you will need to know some of the origins of the Great Awakening, as well as some of the themes and effects of the movement. You should note how it was a time marked by religious fervor, and how the importance of emotions within religion greatly increased. Aside from specific people, time, and places, be aware of the themes and shifts that occurred.
This is a great topic to try to start thinking about potential questions and answers that may be asked (there aren’t a ton of possibilities). Using this crash course review as a guide, you should be set for an APUSH questions about the first Great Awakening.

Introduction
The Great Awakening was the most profound social, cultural, and religious upheaval in the North American British colonies prior to the American Revolution. The most intense phase of these evangelical Christian revivals transpired in New England and the Middle Colonies in the early 1740s, but revivals associated with the Great Awakening began in the 1730s and continued through the American Revolution and beyond. There were similar, and often associated, revivals happening in Britain and Europe in the same time period, but the term “the Great Awakening” is usually understood to apply to revivals in the American colonies. The key figure in precipitating the Great Awakening was the English revivalist George Whitefield, who became one of the greatest media and marketing sensations of early modern history. Since the 1980s, debates over the Great Awakening have primarily focused on the significance of the revivals in colonial American history, and their effect (or lack thereof) on the American Revolution. Since the 19th century, scholars had largely assumed the Great Awakening’s existence and importance, but some modern scholars have raised serious questions about how “great” the awakenings really were. A rough consensus seems to have emerged that we can accurately speak of a “Great Awakening,” but that participants and later evangelical historians were undoubtedly eager to promote its “great” significance. Moreover, many historians have suggested that while the revivals hardly caused the American Revolution, the Great Awakening did help make American colonial culture more receptive to an uprising against British authority thirty years later.
General Overviews
As Butler 1982 (cited under Historiography) notes, Tracy 1976 (originally published in 1842) helped establish the common use of the term “the Great Awakening” and was the first attempt at a synthetic history. Kidd 2007 is the first major scholarly treatment of the Great Awakening as a whole. Smith 2015 likewise seeks a more comprehensive approach. Other overviews have focused on particular aspects of the awakenings, such as Bumsted and Van de Wetering 1976, which emphasizes evangelical radicalism, Hall 1994, which is framed by itinerancy, and Lambert 1999, which considers the Great Awakening within the burgeoning print culture of Anglo-America. Smith 2012 provides a finely grained analysis of the role of colonial newspapers in promoting the revivals.
Bumsted, J. M., and John E. Van de Wetering. What Must I Do to Be Saved? The Great Awakening in Colonial America. Hinsdale, IL: Dryden, 1976.
A short, sympathetic overview of the Great Awakening that gives particular attention to the radical evangelicals. A lack of footnotes restricts the scholarly value of the book.
Hall, Timothy D. Contested Boundaries: Itinerancy and the Reshaping of the Colonial American Religious World. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1994.
Itinerant ministers, of whom George Whitefield was the archetype, were vital conveyers of evangelical faith in the Great Awakening. In this work, Hall explores prorevival and antirevival attitudes toward itinerancy and how itinerancy destabilized the traditional world of parish-based colonial religion.
Kidd, Thomas S. The Great Awakening: The Roots of Evangelical Christianity in Colonial America. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2007.
A broad-ranging history of the Great Awakening, this book examines the revivals from Continental, Scottish, and English roots, to Whitefield’s prodigious American meetings, to the cascading revivals of the era of the American Revolution. It especially highlights the social and theological tensions between moderate and radical evangelicals.
Lambert, Frank. Inventing the “Great Awakening.” Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999.
A study of the revivals and how participants promoted them as a highly significant, unitary transatlantic event. Through analysis of the developing networks of print and transatlantic communication, Lambert concludes that leaders of the revivals invented the Great Awakening, not later evangelical historians such as Joseph Tracy (Tracy 1976 ).
Smith, Lisa. The First Great Awakening in Colonial American Newspapers: A Shifting Story. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2012.
Offers a detailed overview of the role that print media, especially newspapers, played in the unfolding of the revivals from 1739 to 1748. Smith especially focuses on the coverage of Whitefield and the critical role of Benjamin Franklin in promoting news of the awakenings.
Smith, John Howard. The First Great Awakening: Redefining Religion in British America, 1725–1775. Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2015.
Provides a good overview of previous scholarly approaches to the revivals, emphasizes the radical dynamic within the awakenings, and attempts to take a “secular” interpretation of the Great Awakening.
Tracy, Joseph. The Great Awakening: A History of the Revival of Religion in the Time of Edwards and Whitefield. Carlisle, PA: Banner of Truth, 1976.
First published in 1842, this pietistic book originally gave the name “Great Awakening” to revivals of the 1730s and 1740s. As the chief 19th-century religious history of the awakenings, it remains useful, at least for historiographical purposes.

Great Awakening,  religious revival in the British American colonies mainly between about 1720 and the 1740s. It was a part of the religious ferment that swept western Europe in the latter part of the 17th century and early 18th century, referred to as Pietism and Quietism in continental Europe among Protestants and Roman Catholics and as Evangelicalism in England under the leadership of John Wesley (1703–91). The Puritan fervour of the American colonies waned toward the end of the 17th century, but the Great Awakening, under the leadership of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and others, served to revitalize religion in the region.
The Great Awakening represented a reaction against the increasing secularization of society and against the corporate and materialistic nature of the principal churches of American society. A number of conditions in the colonies contributed to the revival: an arid rationalism in New England, formalism in liturgical practices, as among the Dutch Reformed in the Middle Colonies, and the neglect of pastoral supervision in the South. The revival took place primarily among the Dutch Reformed, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and some Anglicans, almost all of whom were Calvinists. By making conversion the initial step on the road to salvation and by opening the conversion experience to all who recognized their own sinfulness, the ministers of the Great Awakening, some intentionally and others unwittingly, democratized Calvinist theology. The Great Awakening has been seen, therefore, as a development toward an evangelical Calvinism. Indeed, the evangelical styles of religious worship promoted by the revival helped make the religious doctrines of many of the insurgent church denominations—particularly those of the Baptists and the Methodists—more accessible to a wider cross section of the American population.

The revival preachers emphasized the “terrors of the law” to sinners, the unmerited grace of God, and the “new birth” in Jesus Christ. They frequently sought to inspire in their listeners a fear of the consequences of their sinful lives and a respect for the omnipotence of God. This sense of the ferocity of God was often tempered by the implied promise that a rejection of worldliness and a return to faith would result in a return to grace and an avoidance of the horrible punishments of an angry God. There was a certain contradictory quality about Great Awakening theology, however. Predestination, one of the principal tenets of the Calvinist theology of most of the ministers of the Great Awakening, was ultimately incompatible with the promise that humans could, by a voluntary act of faith, achieve salvation by their own efforts.
One of the great figures of the movement was George Whitefield, an Anglican priest who was influenced by John Wesley but was himself a Calvinist. Visiting America in 1739–40, he preached up and down the colonies to vast crowds in open fields, because no church building would hold the throngs he attracted. Although he gained many converts, he was attacked, as were other revival clergy, for criticizing the religious experience of others, for stimulating emotional excesses and dangerous religious delusions, and for breaking into and preaching in settled parishes without proper invitation by ecclesiastical authorities.
Jonathan Edwards was the great academician and apologist of the Great Awakening. A Congregational pastor at Northampton, Massachusetts, he preached justification by faith alone with remarkable effectiveness. He also attempted to redefine the psychology of religious experience and to help those involved in the revival to discern what were true works of the Holy Spirit. Although the call for a return to complete faith and the emphasis on the omnipotence of God can be seen as the very antithesis of Enlightenment thought, which called for a greater questioning of faith and a diminishing role for God in the daily affairs of humankind, Edwards explicitly drew on the thought of men such as John Locke and Isaac Newton in an attempt to make religion rational. His chief opponent was Charles Chauncy, a liberal pastor of the First Church in Boston, who wrote and preached against the revival, which he considered an outbreak of extravagant emotion.

The Great Awakening stemmed the tide of Enlightenment rationalism among a great many people in the colonies. One of its results was division within denominations, for some members supported the revival and others rejected it. The revival stimulated the growth of several educational institutions, including Princeton, Brown, and Rutgers universities and Dartmouth College. The increase of dissent from the established churches during this period led to a broader toleration of religious diversity, and the democratization of the religious experience fed the fervour that resulted in the American Revolution.
Edwards maintained that the Holy Spirit withdrew from Northampton in the 1740s, and some supporters found that the revival came to an end in that decade. A revival known as the Second Great Awakening began in New England in the 1790s. Generally less emotional than the Great Awakening, the Second Great Awakening led to the founding of colleges and seminaries and to the organization of mission societies.
Kentucky was also influenced by a revival during this period. The custom of camp-meeting revivals developed out of the Kentucky revival and was an influence on the American frontier during the 19th century.

Second Great Awakening, Protestant religious revival in the United States from about 1795 to 1835. During this revival, meetings were held in small towns and large cities throughout the country, and the unique frontier institution known as the camp meeting began. Many churches experienced a great increase in membership, particularly among Methodist and Baptist churches. The Second Great Awakening made soul-winning the primary function of ministry and stimulated several moral and philanthropic reforms, including temperance and the emancipation of women. Generally considered less emotional than the Great Awakening of the early 18th century, the second wave of evangelical revivalism led to the founding of numerous colleges and seminaries and to the organization of mission societies across the country.
The Second Great Awakening can be divided into three phases. The first phase (1795–1810) was associated with frontier camp meetings conducted by American preachers James McGready, John McGee, and Barton W. Stone in Kentucky and Tennessee. The second and more conservative phase of the awakening (1810–25) centred in the Congregational churches of New England under the leadership of theologians Timothy Dwight, Lyman Beecher, Nathaniel W. Taylor, and Asahel Nettleton. The third and final phase (1825–35) stemmed from the activities of evangelist Charles Grandison Finney, who began his revivalism in small towns in western New York in the 1820s but eventually conducted revival meetings in the largest cities in the United States and Britain.
During the Second Great Awakening revivalistic theology in many denominations shifted from Calvinism to a practical Arminianism as preachers emphasized the ability of sinners to make an immediate decision for their salvation; theological differences almost disappeared among evangelical churches. Moreover, under Finney’s aegis a rationale for carefully contrived revival techniques evolved. After 1835 an irregular corps of professional revival experts traveled through the towns and cities of America and Britain organizing annual revival meetings at the invitation of local pastors who wanted to reinvigorate their churches. Although many American Protestants lost interest in revivalism in the first half of the 20th century, tent revivals as well as annual revivals in churches in the South and Midwest continued to be an important feature of Protestant church life.

Alright, so I've got this information about the Great Awakening. It seems like it was a big deal in the American colonies back in the 1700s, but I'm not entirely sure what it was or why it mattered. From what I can gather, it was a religious movement, kind of like a revival, that spread through the colonies and had a big impact on the way people thought and acted.

First off, I need to understand what exactly the Great Awakening was. According to the sources, it was a series of religious revivals that happened in the American colonies, particularly in New England, between about 1720 and 1750. It seems like it was part of a larger religious ferment that was going on in western Europe at the time, and it's connected to movements like Pietism and Quietism in Europe and Evangelicalism in England.

So, it sounds like there was a renewal of religious enthusiasm and a return to more personal and emotional forms of religion, moving away from some of the more formal and rational approaches that had become prevalent. That makes sense, I guess, because sometimes societies go through cycles where people feel a need to reconnect with their spiritual roots.

Now, why did this happen? What were the causes behind the Great Awakening? From what I've read, one of the main reasons was that there was a sense that religion in the colonies was becoming too secular and too focused on outward forms without much depth of feeling or genuine faith. There was a desire to revive a more passionate and heartfelt commitment to religious beliefs.

Also, different regions had different issues that contributed to the Awakening. In New England, there was a trend towards a more rationalist approach to religion, which some people felt was making faith too intellectual and not touching the heart enough. In the Middle Colonies, among Dutch Reformed and other denominations, there was a sense of formalism and routine in worship that seemed to be lacking in spiritual vitality. And in the South, there was sometimes a neglect of pastoral care, which left many people feeling spiritually abandoned.

So, overall, there was a widespread feeling that religion needed to be refreshed and made more meaningful and engaging for people. That's where the Great Awakening came in, with its emphasis on powerful preaching, emotional experiences, and a personal encounter with God.

Who were the key figures in this movement? Well, one of the most prominent was Jonathan Edwards. He was a Congregational pastor in Northampton, Massachusetts, and he's famous for his sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," which is pretty intense. He was a deep thinker and tried to provide a theological framework for the revivalist experiences that were happening.

Another key figure was George Whitefield, an Anglican minister from England who came to the American colonies and preached to massive crowds. He was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to move people emotionally. His preaching style was very different from the staid, intellectual sermons that were common at the time, and he really captured people's imaginations.

There were also others like Samuel Davies and Gilbert Tennent who played important roles in spreading the revivalist message, especially in the Middle and Southern colonies.

Now, what were the effects of the Great Awakening? It seems like it had a profound impact on colonial society. For one thing, it led to a democratization of religion. By emphasizing that anyone could have a personal experience of God's grace, regardless of their social status or education, it broke down some of the barriers that had existed in the established churches.

This democratization of religion also had political implications. Some historians argue that the Great Awakening helped lay the groundwork for the American Revolution by fostering a spirit of individualism and challenging established authority, not just in religion but also in politics.

Additionally, the Awakening led to the formation of new denominations and the growth of existing ones, particularly the Baptists and Methodists, which became more populist and less hierarchical than the established churches.

There was also a focus on moral reform and social activism that came out of the Awakening. For example, there were efforts to promote temperance, abolish slavery, and improve education.

However, the Awakening wasn't universally welcomed. There were critics who saw it as causing disruption and disorder, promoting emotional excesses, and even questioning the authority of established religious leaders. One notable critic was Charles Chauncy, a prominent Congregational minister in Boston, who argued that the revival was leading to confusion and instability.

Despite these criticisms, the Great Awakening seems to have had a lasting impact on American religion and culture. It helped shape the evangelical tradition in the United States and influenced later revival movements, such as the Second Great Awakening in the nineteenth century.

In summary, the Great Awakening was a significant religious revival in the American colonies that brought about greater emotional engagement in religion, challenged established religious and social norms, and had far-reaching effects on both religion and politics in the emerging nation.

So, to directly answer the question, "What effect did the Great Awakening have on the American colonies?" I would say that it fostered a greater sense of religious enthusiasm and personal faith, promoted a more democratic and egalitarian approach to religion, and contributed to a growing sense of identity and independence among the colonists that would later influence the political developments leading up to the Revolution.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Great Awakening fostered religious enthusiasm, promoted democratic and egalitarian values in religion, and contributed to a growing sense of identity and independence among the American colonies.}} \]
