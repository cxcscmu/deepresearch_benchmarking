Alright, I need to figure out how Herbert Hoover responded to the demands of the Bonus Army. I don't remember much about this, so I'll need to do some research. First, I should understand who Herbert Hoover was and what the Bonus Army was demanding.

I know that Herbert Hoover was the 31st President of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. He took office just before the stock market crash of 1929, which led to the Great Depression. Now, the Bonus Army was a group of World War I veterans who marched on Washington to demand cash payments for bonuses they were due to receive later. I think these bonuses were promised as a form of gratitude for their service in the war, but they were scheduled to be paid out in the future, maybe around 1945.

During the Great Depression, many of these veterans were facing financial hardships, so they wanted the bonuses early. They formed the Bonus Army and camped out in Washington, D.C., to pressure Congress and the president to pass a bill authorizing the early payment of these bonuses.

Now, I need to recall how Hoover reacted to this situation. I have a vague memory that Hoover was not very sympathetic to their cause, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Maybe he thought that paying the bonuses early would exacerbate the government's financial problems during the depression.

Let me try to find more information. Perhaps I can look up "Herbert Hoover and the Bonus Army" to get more details.

The "Bonus Army" was a group of WWI veterans.  In 1924, Congress had voted to give WWI veterans a monetary bonus of about $1,000 each that would be fully payable in 1945.  The Bonus Army wanted to get that money in 1932 because of the problems that they were having due to the Depression.  Congress considered a bill to do this, but it was rejected by the Senate.
Hoover did not want the bonus paid out in 1932.  He opposed payments because he felt taxes would have to be raised to fund them.  After the bill was rejected, Hoover ordered the army to move against the Bonus Army and evict them violently from the camps that they had erected while they waited to see what would happen with the bill.  It is for these reasons that I say Hoover rejected the demands of the Bonus Army.

On July 28, 1932, the United States Army forcibly dispersed the Bonus Army, an assembly of World War I veterans hoping for relief in the midst of the Great Depression.
In 1924, Congress had authorized the World War Adjusted Compensation Act, a law that granted American veterans of World War I a special cash bonus to be paid in 1945 as a sort of pension. The amount to be paid varied on service, but didn't exceed $625, roughly $8,000 in 2013 dollars.
With the coming of the Great Depression in 1929, many Americans found themselves in dire financial straits. The economic crisis hit virtually every sector of the economy at the same time, producing rampant unemployment and poverty. By 1933, the worst year of the depression, unemployment stood at 25 percent. Roughly one in four banks had gone under, and relief looked to be nowhere in sight.
President Herbert Hoover was reluctant to intervene directly in the economy, believing that too much government control would only exacerbate the crisis. Consequently, many Americans came to see the president as an unfeeling, uncaring embodiment of the depression. Those who lost their homes were forced to live in shanty towns known as “Hoovervilles,” and those forced to sleep on park benches vainly tried to insulate themselves from the cold with newspapers, now called “Hooverblankets.”
Among the hardest hit were America's Great War veterans. By early 1932, many in Congress considered legislation that would have allowed veterans to receive their bonus early, rather than having to wait 13 more years. Many of these veterans began to arrive in Washington, D.C., in mid-June to march and show their support for the bill, and to show Congress their plight firsthand. A small Hooverville camp was created on the far side of the Anacostia River, a swamp not far from the city center. All told, 20,000 World War I veterans had assembled.
After a Senate bill to grant the bonuses failed on June 17, many of the marchers went home. Many others, without any prospects to go home to, stayed.
In his biography of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “FDR,” Jean Edward Smith wrote: “Washington officials coped the best they could. Police Chief Pelham Glassford did his utmost to provide tents and bedding for the veterans, furnished medicine and assisted with food and sanitation. Maintaining order was never a problem. The men were camped illegally, but Glassford (who had been the youngest brigadier general with the AEF in France) chose to treat them simply as old soldiers who had fallen on hard times. He resisted efforts to use force to dislodge them.”
Unfortunately, many in the federal government did not share Glassford's rather benign view of the marchers. With America in the midst of its greatest crisis since the Civil War, many believed that a communist revolution, not unlike what had occurred in Russia only 15 years earlier, might happen in Washington, D.C. Refusing to meet with a delegation representing the marchers, Hoover instead ordered greater security surrounding the White House, lest it suffer the same fate as the Czar's Winter Palace.
On July 28, Hoover urged the city government to move against some of the marchers who had been squatting in abandoned buildings. When some of the marchers resisted, a brief gun battle occurred, and two of the marchers were killed. Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley, who feared the marchers were preparing for a Bolshevik revolution and who had longed for a pretext to clear out the veterans, was delighted. The government could finally take action against what he considered a dangerous rabble.
That afternoon, city commissioners formally asked for military help in dispersing the marchers. Smith wrote:
“Within the hour, troopers from the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, led by their forty-seven-year-old executive officer, Major George S. Patton, clattered across Memorial Bridge into Washington, supported by tanks and machine guns. (Army Chief of Staff General Douglas) MacArthur, who normally wore mufti to the War Department, changed into Class A uniform (replete with Sam Browne belt, medals, and decorations) and took command. At his side was his aide-de-camp and military secretary, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower, also in Class A.”
Eisenhower had urged MacArthur not to personally oversee the operation. On one hand, he feared the consequences and hoped to insulate his superior from blame should things go wrong. He also had grave reservations about the mission in general — using the Army to force citizens out of the city.
By late afternoon, Patton's cavalry moved into the streets, sabers drawn, to force the marchers out of the city and back across the river. Infantrymen moved into the abandoned buildings, their bayonets fixed on the ends of their rifles, and ordered the squatters out. Tear gas was used liberally, forcing not only the veterans, but their wives and children, to choke and cry as they were escorted out of town at saber-point. The whole scene did indeed resemble Russia, though it looked more like Czarist repression in the years before the Bolshevik revolution.
In his book “Ike: An American Hero,” biographer Michael Korda wrote:
“(MacArthur) and Ike — who was by now appalled at the unfolding of exactly the consequences he had predicted — marched across the bridge at the head of the troops, whereupon the entire encampment went up in flames. Whether the fire was started by the soldiers or the veterans was never subsequently made clear, but Ike clearly spoke for a lot of people in remarking, 'The whole scene was painful. … The veterans were ragged, ill-fed and felt themselves badly abused. To suddenly see the whole encampment going up in flames just added to the pity one had to feel for them.”
Korda also noted that: “Two babies were suffocated by tear gas and died, and a seven-year-old boy was bayoneted through the leg while trying to rescue his pet rabbit.” Many others were injured in the action, and well over 100 were arrested.
Though some newspapers across the country endorsed Hoover's actions in dispersing the Bonus Army, most characterized it as a major disaster, as unnecessary as it was unfeeling. The image of the president as unsympathetic to the needs of most Americans was reinforced, and Hoover lost his re-election bid that fall to FDR by an electoral margin of 472 to 59. In 1936, Congress passed legislation finally granting the veterans their bonus.

The Bonus Army was known to be the group of around 43000 demonstration and many of these were veterans from world war 1 and they all gathered in Washington DC in the year 1932. Their demand was to get cash redemption of their service in the US army as many of these veterans were facing a work shortage or were unemployed due to the great depression. They were given bonuses in the form of certificates post world war 1 and were given authority to redeem those certificates in form of cash till 1948 and they were demanding their cash long with interest in exchange for those certificates.
It was on July 28, 1932, that the Attorney general of the United States ordered the veterans to be removed from the government property but the Washington police department was met with resistance from these veterans and in this resistance, two veterans died. Post that, President of the United States during that time, Herbert Hoover ordered the US army to take control over the situation and clear march’s campsite.

Answer:
By using military force against its members is the correct answer.
Explanation:
The gathering of 12,000 to 15,000 world war one veterans and their wives, children in Washington D.C in 1932 is known as Bonus army. They demanded payment for their wartime services to ease the distress of great depression. Although Congress had voted for compensation certificates but but the veterans could not get the payment until 1945. The veterans engaged in riots. Herbert Hoover intervened by calling the troops which were led by General Perry L. Miles. While removing the veterans one veteran got killed and many more were wounded. The troops destroyed their campsites by using teargas and tanks. The event was a big blow to president Hoover. Another bonus army marched to D.C in May 1933 but unlike Hoover they were welcomed by Eleanor Roosevelt.

Hoover's public image and approval ratings, already low due to his inability to adequately address the Great Depression, sank even lower after the Bonus Army March in July 1932. Initial blame perhaps lays with Congress, as they were the ones who failed to approve the Wright Patman Bonus Bill, which would have provided the World War I veterans with $1,000 cash bonuses that they weren't scheduled to receive until 1945. The House of Representatives actually passed the bill; however, the Senate overwhelmingly voted against it.
Once the bill was defeated, Hoover sent troops and police officers to disperse the Bonus Army. When many veterans remained in the makeshift camps they had built in DC, officers shot and killed two of the veteran protesters. General MacArthur is perhaps even more to blame than Hoover for the continued violence. Twice Hoover ordered MacArthur not to pursue the protesters, yet MacArthur ignored Hoover's directives. Mac Arthur argued that the marchers, most of whom were fleeing or had fled, were attempting to overthrow the government, and he pursued them out of the Capitol, despite Hoover's demands to end the pursuit. During this "military operation" to drive the Bonus Army out of the Capitol, one wife of a veteran suffered a miscarriage and an infant died after being exposed to tear gas.
Hoover received much of the blame for the violence, as he first ordered troops to disperse the marchers, and public opinion was sharply against him. Many Americans were suffering from the impact of the Depression and sympathized with the Bonus Army, believing Hoover and the government had done little-to-nothing to try to end the Depression. Unfortunately for Hoover, he was up for reelection and had to campaign throughout that summer and fall. Franklin Roosevelt easily defeated Hoover in the 1932 election.

Hoover's treatment of the Bonus Army greatly hurt his standing with the public.  The Bonus Army gets its name from the Bonus that these World War I vets were promised. They were promised a delayed cash bonus at the end of the war.  This delay was alright during the 1920's when times were good, but when these veterans were suffering from poverty in the Depression, they really wanted and needed this money.  They began to ask President Hoover to give them their money early.  When Hooper refused, they gathered together and about 15,000 of them marched on Washington in 1932.  With little or no resources, they were forced to camp out within the city of Washington building their own little Hooverville.  President Hoover was not amused and he not only refused to help them, he sent Douglas MacArthur after them with tanks.  MacArthur set their camp aflame and forced them from Washington.  This picture of Hoover sending the army after down and out former soldiers drew much criticism and greatly increased his reputation as uncaring and unfeeling.  It also greatly hurt his reelection bid that year, helping FDR into office.

20 Facts about the Bonus Army: US History for Kids ***
The Bonus Army
Definition and Summary of the Bonus Army
Summary and Definition: The devastation of Great Depression led to the despair and dejection of the unemployed and homeless in this terrible time in American history. Over 12 million people were unemployed and the unemployment rate was a massive 25%. In 1924 the Bonus Act was passed promising a cash bonus to veterans who had bravely fought in WW1. But there was a catch. Payment would not be made until 1945. The Bonus Army March took place in the summer of 1932 as over 40,000 WW1 veterans marched to Washington to lobby Congress to pass legislation authorizing the early payment of veterans bonuses. Congress to failed to pass legislation for early payment to the veterans. Disappointed and desperate veterans, with no where else to go, stayed in Washington living in unoccupied building and makeshift camps. The government called in the army to remove the veterans. The US Army, under Douglas MacArthur, used extreme measures and violent tactics to remove the veterans and the Bonus Army was disbanded.

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they say about Herbert Hoover's response to the Bonus Army.

From Doc 1, it says that Hoover rejected the demands of the Bonus Army. He didn't want to pay the bonuses early because he thought it would require raising taxes, which he didn't want to do. After the bill to pay the bonuses early was rejected by the Senate, Hoover ordered the army to move against the Bonus Army and evict them violently from their camps.

Doc 2 provides more detail. It explains that the Bonus Army was a group of World War I veterans who had assembled in Washington, D.C., in 1932 to demand early payment of their bonuses, which were scheduled to be paid in 1945. The veterans set up camps, and when a bill to pay the bonuses early was defeated in Congress, many of them stayed in the camps, hoping for a change of heart.

According to Doc 2, after two veterans were killed in a confrontation, Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley, who feared a communist revolution, urged action against the marchers. Hoover then ordered the city government to disperse the marchers, leading to a violent eviction by the U.S. Army, with tanks and troops forcing the veterans out of the city.

Doc 3 is a bit shorter and directly states that Hoover responded by using military force against the Bonus Army members.

Doc 4 discusses the impact of Hoover's treatment of the Bonus Army on his public image. It mentions that Hoover's approval ratings were already low due to his handling of the Great Depression, and the violent eviction of the Bonus Army further damaged his reputation. The public sympathized with the veterans, and Hoover's actions were seen as uncaring and harsh, which contributed to his defeat in the 1932 presidential election.

Doc 5 provides a comprehensive overview of the Bonus Army, including its origins, the veterans' demands, and the eventual eviction. It emphasizes the poor treatment of the veterans by the army and notes that the incident irreparably damaged Hoover's reputation.

So, from these sources, it's clear that Hoover responded to the Bonus Army's demands by ordering the use of military force to disperse them. This action was widely criticized and hurt his public image significantly.

I think the key points are:

1. The Bonus Army was composed of World War I veterans seeking early payment of their bonuses due to financial hardship during the Great Depression.

2. Hoover opposed paying the bonuses early, citing concerns about raising taxes.

3. After the Senate rejected a bill to pay the bonuses early, Hoover ordered the eviction of the Bonus Army from their camps in Washington, D.C.

4. The eviction involved the U.S. Army using force, including tanks and tear gas, which led to violence and damage to the camps.

5. This handling of the situation damaged Hoover's reputation and contributed to his loss in the 1932 presidential election.

I should probably look for any other perspectives or additional details. Maybe check if there were any justifications Hoover gave for his actions or if there were any immediate consequences beyond the damage to his reputation.

Let me see... Doc 2 mentions that Hoover was reluctant to intervene directly in the economy, believing that too much government control would exacerbate the crisis. Perhaps he saw paying the bonuses early as interfering with the economy in a way he thought was harmful.

Also, Doc 4 mentions that there was a fear of a communist revolution, which might have influenced Hoover's decision to use force. It seems like there was a perception that the Bonus Army posed a threat beyond just being a group of veterans seeking financial assistance.

I should consider whether there were any legal or constitutional issues involved in Hoover's decision to use the military against U.S. citizens. Was this action within his presidential powers, or was it controversial from that perspective?

Hmm, maybe I need to look into the legal aspects of his decision. Perhaps see if there were any court cases or official inquiries into the handling of the Bonus Army.

Alternatively, maybe check how the public and the media reacted at the time. Did all sectors of society condemn Hoover's actions, or were there some who supported them?

Let me try another search to find more information on the public reaction and the justification provided by Hoover for his actions.

Hoover's public image and approval ratings, already low due to his inability to adequately address the Great Depression, sank even lower after the Bonus Army March in July 1932. Initial blame perhaps lays with Congress, as they were the ones who failed to approve the Wright Patman Bonus Bill, which would have provided the World War I veterans with $1,000 cash bonuses that they weren't scheduled to receive until 1945. The House of Representatives actually passed the bill; however, the Senate overwhelmingly voted against it.
Once the bill was defeated, Hoover sent troops and police officers to disperse the Bonus Army. When many veterans remained in the makeshift camps they had built in DC, officers shot and killed two of the veteran protesters. General MacArthur is perhaps even more to blame than Hoover for the continued violence. Twice Hoover ordered MacArthur not to pursue the protesters, yet MacArthur ignored Hoover's directives. Mac Arthur argued that the marchers, most of whom were fleeing or had fled, were attempting to overthrow the government, and he pursued them out of the Capitol, despite Hoover's demands to end the pursuit. During this "military operation" to drive the Bonus Army out of the Capitol, one wife of a veteran suffered a miscarriage and an infant died after being exposed to tear gas.
Hoover received much of the blame for the violence, as he first ordered troops to disperse the marchers, and public opinion was sharply against him. Many Americans were suffering from the impact of the Depression and sympathized with the Bonus Army, believing Hoover and the government had done little-to-nothing to try to end the Depression. Unfortunately for Hoover, he was up for reelection and had to campaign throughout that summer and fall. Franklin Roosevelt easily defeated Hoover in the 1932 election.

Hoover's treatment of the Bonus Army greatly hurt his standing with the public.  The Bonus Army gets its name from the Bonus that these World War I vets were promised. They were promised a delayed cash bonus at the end of the war.  This delay was alright during the 1920's when times were good, but when these veterans were suffering from poverty in the Depression, they really wanted and needed this money.  They began to ask President Hoover to give them their money early.  When Hooper refused, they gathered together and about 15,000 of them marched on Washington in 1932.  With little or no resources, they were forced to camp out within the city of Washington building their own little Hooverville.  President Hoover was not amused and he not only refused to help them, he sent Douglas MacArthur after them with tanks.  MacArthur set their camp aflame and forced them from Washington.  This picture of Hoover sending the army after down and out former soldiers drew much criticism and greatly increased his reputation as uncaring and unfeeling.  It also greatly hurt his reelection bid that year, helping FDR into office.

President Hoover sent military police and the army to route the Bonus Army and force them to leave, because they were camping outside for their bonus money, even though they knew the US government HAD NO MONEY.

I believe the answer is: More Americans disliked Hoover
During the bonus army 1932, around 43,000 ex-soldiers marched together to Washington D.C in order to obtain compensation that was promised to them for their service during the wars. This march exposed Hoover for not keeping his promise, which made many Americans disliked hoover even more.

"More Americans disliked H oover" would be the best option, since Hoover completely disregarded the demands of the Bonus Army, which made him seem harsh and cruel.

Okay, from these additional sources, it's clear that Hoover's response to the Bonus Army was widely unpopular and further damaged his already struggling reputation. The use of military force against veterans was seen as particularly heartless, especially during the depths of the Great Depression when many Americans were suffering.

I should also consider whether there were any positive aspects to Hoover's actions or if there were valid reasons for his approach. For example, perhaps he believed that paying the bonuses early would worsen the economic situation, or that the Bonus Army posed a genuine threat to national security.

However, based on the information I've found, it seems that Hoover's main concern was avoiding raising taxes, and he viewed the Bonus Army as a political and potential security threat. The fact that General MacArthur pursued the veterans even after Hoover had ordered him to stop suggests that there may have been an overreaction in terms of the force used.

It's also worth noting that Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army is often cited as a key factor in his loss to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. FDR, in contrast, promised a New Deal to address the economic crisis and was seen as more sympathetic to the plight of the American people.

In conclusion, Herbert Hoover responded to the Bonus Army's demands by ordering the use of military force to disperse them, which was met with widespread public condemnation and further eroded his popularity.
