I'm trying to understand why startups often fail. It seems like every day there's a new startup popping up, promising to disrupt some industry, but most of them don't make it. So, what are the main reasons behind their failures? I need to do some research to get a clearer picture.

First, I should probably define what a startup is. From what I know, a startup is a young company, usually in the early stages of operations, often working on a specific product or service, and aiming for rapid growth. They often seek investment from venture capitalists or other investors to fund their growth.

Now, why do these startups fail? There must be common pitfalls that many of them fall into. Maybe it's related to funding, maybe market demand isn't what they thought, or perhaps there are issues with the team or the business model.

Let me think about funding first. Startups need money to operate, develop their products, hire employees, and so on. If they can't secure enough funding, they might struggle to stay afloat. But I've also heard stories of startups that had plenty of money but still failed. So, while funding is important, it might not be the only reason.

Next, market demand. A startup might have a great idea, but if no one actually wants or needs their product, it's going to fail. They need to have a deep understanding of their target market and make sure there's a real demand for what they're offering. Market research is crucial here.

But again, even if there is demand, executing on that idea is another story. Maybe the competition is too strong, or the pricing isn't right, or the marketing isn't effective. There are many moving parts in a business.

Let me consider the team aspect. Startups are often founded by passionate individuals who have a vision, but running a successful company requires more than just passion. You need a skilled team with diverse abilities—business acumen, technical skills, marketing expertise, and so on. If the team isn't aligned or lacks key skills, that could lead to failure.

Also, the business model is important. How does the startup plan to make money? Is it through selling products, subscriptions, advertising, or something else? If the business model isn't sound or sustainable, the startup will struggle in the long run.

I've also heard that timing plays a role. Even if an idea is good, if it's introduced to the market too early or too late, it might not succeed. The market needs to be ready for the product or service.

Another factor could be burn rate—the rate at which the startup spends its cash reserves. If a startup is burning through its funds too quickly without generating revenue, it won't last long.

Regulatory issues might also pose a problem. Depending on the industry, there might be stringent regulations that the startup needs to comply with, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

Lastly, perhaps the product isn't good enough. Even if there's demand, if the product doesn't meet user expectations or has too many bugs, customers won't stick around.

I think there are multiple reasons why startups fail, and it's usually a combination of several factors rather than just one thing going wrong.

To get more insights, I should look up some statistics or studies on startup failure rates and common causes. Maybe there are reports or articles that have already analyzed this.

Let me try to find some data on startup failure rates. I recall hearing that something like 90% of startups fail, but I'm not sure about the exact figure.

Also, perhaps looking at some famous startup failures and their reasons could provide some valuable lessons.

Wait, maybe I can search for something like "top reasons startups fail" or "common causes of startup failure."

Let me try that.

5 TOP reasons why startups fail
Numerous start-ups already fail with their business idea in the first few years. After more than five years, only one in ten is still in the race. There are many reasons why start-ups fail. Usually it is not just one factor that prevents success, but a combination of several reasons. The five most common reasons are presented in this blog.
1. Lack of market demand
No Market, no Cash. A study by CB Insight shows that more than 40 percent of the 101 shutdown companies examined failed because they had planned their product or service completely out of the market. In some cases, the market was not yet mature or features were developed that were not relevant from the point of view of the target group and which the market therefore did not want.
The latter applies to the Austrian startup Woodero. The company was able to raise the required capital successfully via crowdfunding, but then failed due to the lack of demand for its wood-made smartphone and tablet cases. Dave Sloan's startup Treehouse Logic, launched as SurveyMonkey for Website Configurators, also failed because Sloan wanted to solve a problem that was not relevant enough for customers to generate a profitable business model.
How important the correct interpretation of market research results is can be seen from the Dinnr food delivery service. 70 percent of 250 respondents agreed that they would buy the product. The Alpha test group and 1:1 interviews also produced positive results. Nevertheless, founder Michael Bohanes ruined the startup because he misinterpreted the market research results. Bohanes only presented his idea, which did not offer a solution for a customer problem or a relevant additional benefit. He interpreted the survey data as market potential, while the respondents only expressed their general interest. De facto there was no demand for such a delivery service.
2. Insufficient financial resources
Another important reason for the failure of start-ups is the lack of capital resources. In the growth phase, follow-up financing is often lacking. The CB Insight study puts the proportion of companies that failed due to liquidity problems at just under one third (29 percent).
An example of this is the drone company Airware, which had to close its bulkheads again a few months ago. Airware desperately looked for financiers for 18 months before the company ran out of money and was shut down. The startup wanted to gain a foothold as a pioneer in commercial drones. However, the market did not develop as quickly as Airware expected. In addition, there were long development cycles and missing software features that competitors already had on offer. When Caterpillar left as one of the largest financiers, the company lacked the financial resources to successfully position itself on the market in the long term. Approximately 120 employees were out of a job after the start-up had burned $118 million in cash.
3. The wrong team
Another reliable killer for startups are problems and inconsistencies within the team (23 percent according to CB Insight study). If the cooperation between the team members does not work, the startup doesn't stand a chance either.
„The first five employees will make or break your start-up.“
Oliver Holle, CEO Managing Partner Speedinvest
However, an unbalanced composition of the teams with regard to the competencies of the individual members often hampers the success of the company. Sometimes there is a lack of important skills for the technical implementation of the business idea, sometimes there is a lack of a CTO who acts as an interface between management and the technical departments. The online job platform Standout Jobs, for example, failed due to a lack of professional skills. The team was not able to build an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) itself or with some external support from freelancers. The company could have brought on board additional founders or external innovation partners with the appropriate skills, but failed to take this step and went bankrupt.
In many cases there is also a lack of management competence. The founder of the online platform Nouncer attributes the failure of the start-up to the fact that he did not have a partner who balanced him and provided plausibility checks for business and technological decisions. In addition, the startup also had massive problems finding suitable employees at the location.
4. Strong competition
In 19 percent of the CB Insight study, startups were overtaken by their competitors and forced to give up. A well-known example is Wesabe, a failed online personal financial management service outperformed by Mint. Mint analyzed the weaknesses of Wesabe's MVP and only launched the platform when they had developed a better solution. This gave Mint a competitive edge among other factors. Wesabe was more powerful than Mint and offered more functions, but was more difficult to operate.
Another example of a company that has been caught up by the market is Raptr. The company offered a social network for gamers and benefited for several years from the graphics card manufacturer AMD bundling Raptr software with its graphics driver. When gradually other games platforms like Steam or Xbox were represented on the market and the agreement with AMD 2016 was not extended, this sealed the fate of the company. Until then, investors had invested 44 million dollars in the company.
Investors had put a lot more into Jawbone Up, the company that launched the first fitness bracelet in 2011, namely around one billion dollars. However, the company was outperformed by its competitors. With the entry of Fitbit and various other manufacturers, the market became increasingly competitive and the company's own innovative products did not generate enough demand. After all, the company ran out of money.
5. Pricing and costs
Other problems with many startups arise from difficulties in calculating a price that is high enough to cover costs but low enough to attract customers. After all, 18 percent of the companies in the CB Insight study cited profitability issues as the main reason for failure.
Startup Delight, for example, had the vision of developing a new type of mobile analysis: visual analysis. The most expensive monthly plan was $300. Customers had expected more for this price. In addition, there was a poorly chosen billing model. The price was calculated according to the number of recording credits. Since the customers had no influence on the length of the recordings, most of them were very careful when using up the credits. Pricing models based on the accumulated duration of recordings would have made much more sense and increased the number of subscriptions.
6. Other factors
A bad core product and the lack of a successful business model, wrong innovation marketing or ignoring customer needs are also at the top of the list. The study thus clearly shows how complex and multi-layered the causes of failure can be.
Conclusio: Use learning potential for your own projects
Startups, corporate ventures and established companies can learn from the mistakes of other companies. FuckUp Nights are a way to tap into this knowledge potential. Read also our article "6 things that established companies can learn from start-ups ".

The 13 Top Reasons Why Startups Fail | Startups.com
The 13 Top Reasons Why Startups Fail
Failure is an essential part of the startup ecosystem - but no one wants to fail. To help you avoid that fate, here are the top reasons why startups fail.
December 14th, 2017 |    By: Emma McGowan
Fail fast. Fail forward. Those are just two of the mantras you’ll see hanging in startup offices and incubators across the globe. In the startup world, a failure is considered a learning opportunity, at the least; a feather in the cap of the Founder, at best. We fetishize failure. We normalize it.
But as much as we talk a good game about failure, the reality is that failing sucks. Just as no one goes into their wedding day planning for divorce, no one starts a company thinking, “Yeah, this one will just be my starter. I’ll get it right next time.” No wants to fail, and yet the majority of startups do fail.
According to an examination of startup businesses (by which they mean new companies in general) in the United States conducted by Statistic Brain, almost all new companies fail: 50 percent after five years and 70 percent after 10 years. Their data found that 46 percent of all companies in the US fail due to “incompetence.” That category includes everything from “emotional pricing” to “no experience in record-keeping” to “nonpayment of taxes.” The next 30 percent failed due to “unbalanced experience or lack of managerial experience”, followed by 11 percent failing due to “lack of experiences in line of goods or services.”
But while the failure rate for new companies in general is high, they’re nowhere near the failure rates of startups. A commonly cited number is “90 percent of all startups fail,” but one study by Harvard Business School senior lecturer Shikhar Ghosh found that the number might be closer to 75 percent. The “real” number is probably somewhere in between the two.
Regardless, it’s very high. So why is that?
Why do startups fail?
While we can all share anecdotes about why startups we know failed, let’s take a look at the one actual study examining why startups fail. CB Insights analyzed 101 startup “postmortems” — you know, those Medium posts Founders do when their company goes under — to determine what the most common causes of startup failure were.
According to their findings, here are the top 13 reasons why startups fail, along with some stories from the Startups.co community that we hope will help other Founders who are trying to make it into that 20 (or so) percent that succeed.
1. No Market Need (42%)
The biggest reasons why startups fail is they create a product that the market just doesn’t want. Product/market fit is essential. Maybe they’ve figured out a solution to their own problem and didn’t take into account that other people didn’t have the problem, too. Maybe there were already better products out there. Or maybe the market just wasn’t ready for it. Or, maybe, the world just didn’t need what they were putting out there.
“In 2009 I spend $63,000, hired six part-time employees and spent nine months on a product,” Jevin Maltais, of the Built In A Day podcast, tells Startups.co. “Then I launched… To no one.  The idea was to show everything happening on a map within three street blocks from you: all events, pictures and tweets. Turns out, no one cared enough about the problem I was trying to solve, and there was no path for it to make money. Lesson learned: Talk to people before you build anything!”
2. Ran Out of Cash (29%)
Another big issue? Running out of money before you can get anywhere. Even the lucky companies that land funding can find themselves staring down a very short runway, debating whether or not they’ll be able to afford the rent on their coworking space next month.
“At age 27, I started a business using money in my savings account,” Lyneir Richardson CEO of Chicago TREND and Executive Director of the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development at Rutgers University Business School, tells Startups.co.
“My business grew rapidly from $600,000 in revenue to over $7 million. I was recognized by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a Young Entrepreneur of the Year.
“But I had three major problems. First, I had a low profit margin on the product that I was selling.  Second, I had a lot of payroll costs. Third, there was a long lag time between sales and no consistent recurring revenue. I now know that these are classic symptoms of a company with poor cash flow.  The saying is that ‘Cash is King,’ but in my view, the saying should be ‘Cashf Flow is King.’  Ultimately, I had to sell the assets of my company at a discount, and I went out of business.”
3. Not the Right Team (23%)
The cliché in startup land is that a startup is like baby — and your Co-Founder is your spouse. And, like a lot of clichés, there’s a lot of truth in it. Your team can make-or-break your startup, as 23 percent of failed startups know all too well.
“I once tried to get a startup going,” Stephen Gibson, Founder of the startup review site Vyteo, tells Startups.co. “I joined with a partner and we began working on new projects. Every couple weeks or so he wanted to work on a new project, leaving the previous one behind. Over a short span of time we had three to four projects in the works. We obviously didn’t get anywhere and eventually went our separate ways. Having the right team and partner-fit is essential to getting things off the ground.”
4. Get Outcompeted (19%)
Whether it’s one of the big companies doing exactly what you do or smaller companies killing you with a thousand little bites, getting outcompeted is the reason why 19 percent of startups fail. (And regardless of who’s doing the outcompeting, it sucks.)
“My Sportswear brand, VO2 Sportswear, failed due to a combination of running out of cash and cheap entrants into the market,” Matt Tomkin of Tao Digital Marketing tells Startups.co. “We had grown to the point where we had built significant, to a startup, overheads which needed to be paid every month. We ended up having to try and compete with a flood of back-bedroom businesses that seemed to be happy to make pennies rather than pounds on the kit they were supplying. We just couldn’t compete with this type of approach.”
5. Pricing/Cost Issues (18%)
The best way to figure out how to price your product is to put a price on it and see what happens. Do you get a huge number of signups, suggesting that maybe you could raise the price? Does no one bite, suggesting you need to lower the price? Can you meet your company’s costs while simultaneously meeting that sweet spot of not too expensive and not too cheap?
Unfortunately, one reason why startups fail is because they can’t. It’s a balancing act — and tipping to either side can mean failure for your company.
6. Poor Product (17%)
Sometimes, startup Founders just come up short when it comes to product. That could be because they don’t actually know what they’re doing. It could also be because they didn’t understand their field properly before jumping in, as was the case for Jenni Schwanenberg, Innovation Evangelist of mantro GmbH, in her previous company.
“We wanted to create a hardware device that measures your consumption to give you a better price option,” Jenni says. “But doing the unit economics, we found out: There is a totally different dynamic in the market. Users can save 100 Euro for one time — and then nothing anymore. So we would create a product that had no recurring revenue and was basically useless to us.
We already worked on a hardware device and customer interviews for about three month when we found out and we put a full stop on the project.”
7. Need/Lack Business Model (17%)
Business models aren’t sexy. They aren’t fun. But they are very, very necessary for the success of a startup. Unfortunately, 17 percent of startups failed because they didn’t learn this lesson soon enough.
“Create a business plan first so that you can stay focused and remain true to your long-term goals,” Deborah Sweeney, CEO of MyCorporation.com, tells Startups.co. “Business plans are typically 30 to 40 pages long, requiring time to draft up and objectively view the feasibility of your business. They cover everything from what your business does/offers to a (projected) timeline for your goals along with an analysis on your target audience and examination of your cash flow. Once you have the plan in place, you can really get the ball rolling on the business.”
8. Poor Marketing (14%)
No matter how great your product is, it’s going to fail if no one knows about it. Poor marketing is a major reason a lot of startups fail and one that I personally get a lot of questions about. While you don’t necessarily need a professional PR team at the beginning, learn from the failed startup pile and don’t ignore marketing. (Yes, even when you’re bootstrapping.)
“We ignored marketing,” AR/VR Expert Antony Vitillo tells Startups.co. “At the beginning, we just wrote code, but over time we discovered that marketing is as important as the product. If you don’t market properly, no one knows about your product and so no one can buy it, even if it is the best product in the world. Spreading the word may seem a waste of time, but it is fundamental for a business to survive.”
9. Ignore Customers (14%)
I can’t emphasize enough how important user feedback is to the startup journey, from the first germ of an idea through product develop and testing. I’m a firm believer in launching early with a minimum viable product and testing, testing, testing. When we’re talking about why startups fail, I’m actually surprised that this number isn’t higher than 14 percent.
“My three Co-Founders and I had developed an app for restaurants that allowed their customers to order and pay for their food independently of a waiter—by using the app,” Felicia Schneiderhan, Founder of 30 Seconds to Fly, tells Startups.co. “We had won a major competition in New York and got accepted to the reputable NYU Summer Launchpad accelerator. After six months of working day and night trying to find customers, however, we decided to shut down the company.
There were multiple reasons why our concept didn’t work. The most important one was that we missed product market fit. Our target market were small independent restaurants in New York City. These restaurants had many pain points, from inventory management to diminishing margins. They did not, however, even consider the option of saving personnel cost by replacing their waiters with technology. Let alone were they willing to pay for a technology like that. After we had talked to more than 200 small restaurant owners and managers we understood that the human touch and personal connection they had with their customers was one of their core value propositions. Our product clearly did not match that market segment.”
10. Product Mistimed (13%)
Some startups launch before their time and either the market or the technology just isn’t there yet. Others launch too late, although they might not know yet that it’s too late. That’s what happened to Bob Smith, Founder of Drive & Grow Rich, a monthly CD subscription service, in 2007. At age 33, Smith was pulling in $10 million a year.
Can you guess where this is going?
You got it: Technology killed the monthly CD subscription star.
11. Lose Focus (13%)
Building a company takes time, effort, money and — focus. If you’re the type to get easily distracted or you have trouble finishing what you started, your startup might end up with the 13 percent who fell under this category of why startups fail.
“Ten years ago, my partner Hernán Amiune and I started with our first startup, the first online peer to peer credit platform in Latin America,” Cristian Rennella, CEO and Co-Founder of elMejorTrato.com, tells Startups.co. “The idea was excellent, the team also (two programmers with a lot of free time) and we even managed to raise USD 120,000 of investment, which at that time was a crazy lot of money! The reason for failure? Lack of focus!
“Unfortunately the media sells you the dream of overnight success but that is a plain lie. To do something big, you must dedicate a huge amount of time and effort. Remember: if you want to do something great without failing on the road, your best ally is to have focus! Forget the advantage of first movers, focus on who is still standing after the war.”
12. Disharmony on Team/Investors (13%)
You know how it can sometimes be a terrible idea to be roommates with your best friend? It seems like a great plan — you love each other! You like hanging out! They’re pretty clean! — but when you actually move in, you end up losing your best friend and having to find a new place to live.
That kind of strife can also happen on a startup founding team or between startup Founders and their investors. Either way, it’s a quick recipe for startup failure.
“During the financial crisis in 2008 I had a startup which was focused on raising money for private equity, trading and investment advisory services,” Irina Lunina, CEO and Co-Founder at miramom tells Startups.co. “We had an amazing first six months and made a company profitable early on, but I did bump heads with my Co-Founder. Everyone has different work ethics, some work hard to make things happen and some just ride the wave. When I realized that I pull all the weight, then I really did not want to split profits with someone who just pretended to work. So, problems started and we split.”
13. Pivot Gone South (10%)
Pivoting is another natural part of the startup lifespan: You launch a product, do some user testing, find out it’s not the right product/market fit, and you pivot to something else. In some cases, that pivot is what saves the company. But for others, the pivot takes Founders in the direction of one of those other reasons why startups fail listed above.
The Final 7 Reasons Startups Fail
The CB Insights report actually found 20 reasons why startups fail, but we decided only ones over 10 percent had earned in-depth coverage today. For those of you who are interested, the other seven reasons why startups fail are:
14. Lack Passion (9%)
15. Bad Location (9%)
16. No Financing/Investor Interest (8%)
17. Legal Challenges (8%)
18. Don’t Use Network/Advisors (8%)
19. Burnout (8%)
20. Failure to Pivot (7%)
And despite all of my talk about fetishizing failure, I’m going to leave you with these wise words from serial entrepreneur Marcus Harjani, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of FameMoose.
“I have learned over the years that the idea of failure is not only very personal to one’s context, but actually failure doesn’t exist,” Marcus says. “Every perceived failure in business is a chance to better hone one’s approach. Sure, having to close doors on the business is ‘a failure’ of sorts, but the true failure is if one doesn’t learn why that happened, and runs head first into the same situation again.”
Here that, Founders? Don’t let fear of failure scare you into never trying. Instead, learn from your mistakes and carry it forward. That’s doing failure the startup way. We here at Startups.co also have a bunch of tools that can help you avoid failure, whether it’s your first startup or your fiftieth.
You can engage with each one individually or, if you’re ready to really kick failure’s butt, you can bundle all tools on the Startups.co platform together to take advantage of significant bundle pricing discounts.

(And for those of you who are good at math, you’ll notice that these percentages didn’t perfectly add up to 100%. That’s because some startups cited multiple reasons because, you know, this stuff is complicated .)

The Top 12 Reasons Startups Fail

From lack of product-market fit to disharmony on the team, we break down the top 12 reasons for startup failure by analyzing 110+ startup failure post-mortems.
Where is this data coming from?
Start your free trial today
After we compiled our list of startup failure post-mortems, one of the most frequent requests we got was to use these posts to figure out the main reasons why startups failed.
Startups, corporations, investors, economic development folks, academics, and journalists all wanted some insight into the question:
“Why do startups fail?”
So we gave those post-mortems the CB Insights data treatment to see if we could answer this question.
After reading through 111 post-mortems since 2018, we’ve learned there is rarely one reason for a single startup’s failure. However, we did begin to see a pattern to these stories.
And so after sifting through the post-mortems, we identified the top 12 reasons startups fail.
Since many startups offered multiple reasons for their failure, you’ll see that the chart highlighting the top reasons doesn’t add up to 100% (it far exceeds it).
Following the chart is an explanation of each reason and relevant examples from the post-mortems.

There is certainly no survivorship bias here. But many very relevant lessons for anyone in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
It’s worth noting that this type of data-driven analysis would not be possible without a number of founders being courageous enough to share stories of their startup’s demise with the world. So a big thank you to them.
12. Burned out/lacked passion
Work-life balance is not something that startup founders often get, so the risk of burning out is high. Burnout was given as a reason for failure 5% of the time. The ability to cut your losses where necessary and redirect your efforts when you see a dead end — or lack passion for a domain — was deemed important to succeeding and avoiding burnout, as was having a solid, diverse, and driven team so that responsibilities can be shared.
What can make conversations about burnout difficult, especially in Silicon Valley, is the widespread belief that building a successful company will always involve some degree of possibly hazardous overwork. As former Uber board member and CEO of Thrive Global Arianna Huffington puts it:
“The prevalent view of startup founders in Silicon Valley is a delusion that in order to succeed, in order to build a high-growth company, you need to burn out.”
Amid the pandemic, burnout became even more prevalent among tech workers: 68% of tech employees said they felt more burned out working from home, according to a survey by Blind.
Various founders have spoken up about how damaging burnout can be. Former Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad said,
“I think people are unprepared for how hard and awful it is going to be to start a company. I certainly was.”
At DaWanda, stagnation in both growth and team interest led to the company’s eventual closure. Founder and CEO Claudia Helming shared this message on the company’s website:
“In the last quarter of 2017 we reached profitability and have since been working to cover our costs. At the same time, we had to admit that our growth is stagnating and that we can hardly manage by our own efforts to grow the number of sales on our platform to the desired extent – even our restructuring last year could not change this … Additionally, we haven’t managed to implement enough innovative new ideas over the past few years.
DaWanda is not insolvent. However, we have realised that the risk of no longer being able to keep up is simply too big.”
Doughbies, which raised $670,000 for an on-demand cookie delivery service in 2013, also cited a lack of passion from its founders and team as one of the reasons for its failure. The company appeared to be doing well, with 36% gross margins and 12% net profit at the time it shut down. The problem, as CEO Daniel Conway put it, was that there wasn’t massive growth or enough interest in running the business:
“Ultimately we shut down because our team is ready to move on to something new.”
11. Pivot gone bad
Pivots like Burbn to Instagram or ThePoint to Groupon can go extraordinarily well. Or they can start you down the wrong road.
As The Verge reported on Inboard Technology ‘s failed pivot:
“The startup was one of the highest-profile competitors to top electric skateboard company Boosted, and last year announced plans to enter the electric scooter market — a push that seems to have doomed Inboard.
Founder (and now-former CEO) Ryan Evans told The Verge his team had locked down ‘a very large order’ from ‘one of the largest European scooter operators,’ which explains why the company quickly pivoted away from trying to sell its first e-scooter directly to consumers earlier this year. But Evans said the development timeline for Inboard’s e-scooter ‘outstretched’ its financial runway.”
After investors refused to inject more funds, the company was forced to shut down.
For Frances Dewing, the founder of Rubica, a last-ditch attempt to save her cybersecurity startup from failure amid Covid-19 led her to pivot from focusing on consumers and small businesses to larger companies.
In the end, the new direction didn’t ring true with investors:
“We were all really surprised given how relevant and needed this is right now,” Dewing said. “Investors didn’t agree with that or see it in the same way.”
10. Disharmony among team/investors
Discord with a co-founder was a fatal issue for startup post-mortem companies. But acrimony isn’t limited to the founding team, and when things go bad with a board or investor, it can get ugly pretty quickly, as evidenced in the case of Hubba.
Douglas Soltys writes for BetaKit:
“Considered for most of the decade one of Toronto’s hottest startups, Hubba hit choppy waves in 2018, as the company lost its chief technology officer and chief marketing officer in an three-month span, in addition to two rounds of layoffs which saw headcount reduced by almost half.
It is unclear to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic had hampered Hubba’s growth and customer base. However, one source BetaKit spoke with claimed a months-long battle between [Hubba CEO and founder Ben] Zifkin and Hubba’s board of directors regarding the ongoing viability of the company.”
At Pellion Technologies, the end came more quietly, as its major backer Khosla Ventures lost faith in the company’s ability to execute:
“According to former employees, all of whom requested anonymity, Khosla Ventures lost confidence that Pellion could make enough money serving a niche market. The lithium-metal technology worked for products like drones, but the big money in the battery world is in the automotive sector. Investors weren’t willing to sink the money needed to develop the battery for electric vehicles.”
In March 2019, Khosla decided the company would be shut down and removed Pellion’s name from its online firm portfolio.
9. Poor product
Sometimes, it all comes down to the product — and a flawed one was enough to sink companies in 8% of cases.
According to a Forbes investigation into finance and accounting platform ScaleFactor,
“ScaleFactor used aggressive sales tactics and prioritized chasing capital instead of building software that ultimately fell far short of what it promised, according to interviews with 15 former employees and executives. When customers fled, executives tried to obscure the real damage.”
Bad things also happen when you ignore what users want and need, whether consciously or accidentally.
Here’s what Shoes of Prey wrote about its vision to enable consumers to personalize their own shoes :
“We learnt the hard way that mass market customers don’t want to create, they want to be inspired and shown what to wear. They want to see the latest trends, what celebrities and Instagram influencers are wearing and they want to wear exactly that — both the style and the brand.”
the top 12 reasons startups fail
From lack of product-market fit to disharmony on the team, we break down the top 12 reasons for startup failure by analyzing 110+ startup failure post-mortems.

8. Product mistimed
If you release your product too early, users may write it off as not good enough, and getting them back may be difficult if their first impression of you is negative. And if you release your product too late, you may have missed your window of opportunity in the market.
As Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, CEO of autonomous trucking tech startup Starsky Robotics said,
“Timing, more than anything else, is what I think is to blame for our unfortunate fate. Our approach, I still believe, was the right one but the space was too overwhelmed with the unmet promise of AI to focus on a practical solution. As those breakthroughs failed to appear, the downpour of investor interest became a drizzle.”
VR platform Vreal intended to build a virtual reality space for video game streamers to hang out with their viewers and raised almost $12M in its 2018 Series A. However, the available hardware and bandwidth capabilities didn’t evolve as fast as the company had expected, and though it delivered on its promise, Vreal struggled to attract any significant usage:
“Unfortunately, the VR market never developed as quickly as we all had hoped, and we were definitely ahead of our time. As a result, Vreal is shutting down operations and our wonderful team members are moving on to other opportunities.”
For some companies on our list, an unforeseen factor like the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to product untimeliness. AI-powered vending machine startup Stockwell AI shut down in July 2020 as consumers stayed at home and avoided surface contact. The company’s CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch,
“Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st. We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible. While this wasn’t the way we wanted to end this journey, we are confident that our vision of bringing the store to where people live, work and play will live on through other amazing companies, products and services.”
7. Not the right team
A diverse team with different skill sets was often cited as being critical to the success of a company. Failure post-mortems often lamented that “I wish we had a CTO from the start” or wished that the startup had “a founder that loved the business aspect of things.”
At Fieldbook, which shut down after failing to build a sustainable business model for its database product, co-founder Jason Crawford wrote in his post-mortem blog post that the company’s inability to make key hires was one of the reasons for its downfall:
“I was blindsided by the difficulty of hiring. Hiring was something I’d done successfully for years, including in the early days of Fieldbook and in a previous startup. But at a time when every engineer wanted to work on AI, self-driving cars or cryptocurrencies, a SaaS startup with modest, sporadic growth wasn’t very attractive. I knew that investors would need to see strong, consistent growth before our Series A, but I didn’t expect that engineers would need to see it to even join before Series A.”
Lack of experience, combined with mismanagement, was one of the factors behind the downfall of Katerra, the high-flying construction startup which raised nearly $1.5B in funding. As The Information summarizes,
“The SoftBank-backed startup said it could slash the cost of building and renovating apartments, luring big-name investors. But the company, run by a tech veteran with no previous construction experience, ignored escalating problems and at one point tried to burnish revenue information shown to its board and financial backers.”
For Stratolaunch, the passing of its founder meant the company wasn’t able to continue on in the same way, as Failory reported:
“Despite everything looking great on paper and the best of minds working together on this project, nothing could have predicted Paul Allen’s passing away in October of 2018, which would soon spell out the same fate for Stratolaunch. It became clear that Stratolaunch had been powered only by the vision of its founder, which wasn’t necessarily shared by those left in power after him .”
6. Pricing/cost issues
Pricing is a dark art when it comes to startup success, and startup post-mortems highlight the difficulty in pricing a product high enough to eventually cover costs but low enough to bring in customers.
Hey Tiger struggled to find the right balance in its effort to produce high-quality chocolate and address inequities in the cocoa industry, writing,
“But like any start up, there comes a time when you need to take a hard look at the company’s long term viability. Although we designed a business that customers absolutely love, it proved hard to scale into the profitability it needed to be a sustainable social enterprise. As the scale of our chocolate production grew, so did the tensions between the very things that made Hey Tiger special. Ultimately while succeeding in one goal, we couldn’t make the other.”
The 2019 shutdown of genetic testing and scientific wellness startup Arivale came as a surprise to many partners and customers, but the reason behind the company’s failure was simple: the price of running the company was too high compared to the revenues it brought in:
“Our decision to terminate the program today comes despite the fact that customer engagement and satisfaction with the program is high and the clinical health markers of many customers have improved significantly. Our decision to cease operations is attributable to the simple fact that the cost of providing the program exceeds what our customers can pay for it. We believe the costs of collecting the genetic, blood and microbiome assays that form the foundation of the program will eventually decline to a point where the program can be delivered to consumers cost-effectively. Regrettably, we are unable to continue to operate at a loss until that time arrives…”
5. Regulatory/legal challenges
Sometimes a startup can evolve from a simple idea and enter a world of legal complexities that can ultimately shut it down.
Widely regarded as one of Kickstarter’s greatest failures, Coolest Cooler finally ceased operations in December 2019 after floundering for 5 years (and failing to deliver its coolers to more than 20,000 people). In a project update, the team blamed the trade war:
“As you may know, late last year the U.S. government imposed 10% tariffs on many products imported from China. … However, as of early summer, the “trade war” continued, and the tariff was increased to 25% which affected our entire Coolest product line.”
Mobile savings app Beam met its end quickly after falling afoul of the Federal Trade Commission. FTC Acting Director of Consumer Protection Daniel Kaufman stated at the time of its shut down of the company:
“The message here is simple for mobile banking apps and similar services: Don’t lie about your customers’ ability to get their money when they need it.”
Smart luggage manufacturer Bluesmart also fell victim to legal challenges. The company shut down in 2018 after most major US airlines enacted a policy requiring all airline travelers to remove lithium-ion batteries from their checked luggage:
“We have bittersweet news to share. The changes in policies announced by several major airlines at the end of last year—the banning of smart luggage with non-removable batteries—put our company in an irreversibly difficult financial and business situation. After exploring all the possible options for pivoting and moving forward, the company was finally forced to wind down its operations and explore disposition options, unable to continue operating as an independent entity.”
4. Flawed business model
Most failed founders agree that a business model is important — staying wedded to a single channel or failing to find ways to make money at scale left investors hesitant and founders unable to capitalize on any traction gained.
As Lumina Networks, a provider of open-source software for telecom networks, wrote,
“Essentially, revenue continued to flow to proprietary vendors. The switch to open source did not take place at a pace anywhere close to the speed that would enable us to operate and grow our business, despite commitments from many to the contrary. We have also found that Covid-19 has actually redirected funds away from automation projects and into building-out raw infrastructure, further delaying adoption.”
“Selling Lumina to a proprietary vendor who is naturally antithetical to our mission proved an impossible task and for this reason we must now close our business,” it concluded.
At Aria Insights, the concept of outfitting drones with sensors to collect data from extreme environments seemed promising. But while the company got off the ground and found a few high-profile investors — including Bessemer Venture Partners — it ultimately couldn’t find a compelling use for that data, and, therefore, couldn’t adequately monetize its business model:
“CyPhy Works rebranded as Aria Insights in January 2019 to focus more on using artificial intelligence and machine learning to help analyze data collected by drones. ‘A number of our partners were collecting and housing massive amounts of information with our drones, but there was no service in the industry to quickly and efficiently turn that data into actionable insights,’ Lance Vanden Brook, former CyPhy and current Aria CEO said at the time of the rebranding.”
Various music startup post-mortems also pointed to the difficulty of finding a viable business model in the industry as a reason for startup failure.
UK-based blockchain music startup JAAK pointed to several reasons for its undoing, including its scaling challenges, in a series of Tweets on the company’s corporate account:
“6 years is a long time in startups, especially pre-revenue ones, and, ultimately, we failed to secure the funding required to get to market. Markets change and we didn’t change quickly enough.
I have a Notion full of painful lessons about why we failed but I’ll save those for another day.
tl;dr: users > partners, no premature scaling.”

3. Got outcompeted
Despite the platitudes that startups shouldn’t pay attention to the competition, the reality is that once an idea gets hot or gets market validation, others may try to capitalize on the opportunity. And while obsessing over the competition is not healthy, ignoring it was also a recipe for failure in 20% of the startup failures.
Silas Adekunle of Reach Robotics talked about shutting down after being unable to make it in the hypercompetitive consumer hardware industry in his post-mortem message, stating:
“The consumer robotics sector is an inherently challenging space – especially for a start-up. Over the past six years, we have taken on this challenge with consistent passion and ingenuity. From the first trials of development to accelerators and funding rounds, we have fought to bring MekaMon to life and into the hands of the next generation of tech pioneers. Unfortunately, for Reach Robotics, in its current form at least, today marks the end of that journey.”
Co-founder John Rees also weighed in:
“I’m still taking stock of it all but the short version is that it is true what they say – that ‘hardware is hard’ and consumer hardware is even harder due to the reliance on the Christmas sales period.”
Children’s apparel delivery service Mac & Mia found itself in a tough spot, facing competition from highly successful companies like Stitch Fix, and shut down only a year after its 2018 launch:
“Mac & Mia faced a host of competitors in the children’s delivery box space, including the aforementioned Stitch Fix, which launched its kids clothing service in 2018. Stitch Fix went public in 2017 and has a market cap around $2.7 billion. At least 20 other upstarts have launched similar delivery services for children’s clothes.”
2. No market need
Tackling problems that are interesting to solve rather than those that serve a market need was cited as the No. 2 reason for failure, noted in 35% of cases.
Mobile-focused streaming service Quibi, which shut down in October 2020 just 6 months after launching and raising a mammoth $1.8B, found itself in this position. As reported in the Wall Street Journal, founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and chief executive Meg Whitman said in a letter to employees at the time of the shutdown:
“…[T]here were ‘one or two reasons’ for Quibi’s failure: The idea behind Quibi either ‘wasn’t strong enough to justify a stand-alone streaming service’ or the service’s launch in the middle of a pandemic was particularly ill-timed. ‘Unfortunately, we will never know, but we suspect it’s been a combination of the two.'”
CEO Justin Kan of Atrium was direct about the difficulty of disrupting law firms, telling TechCrunch in an interview,
“If you look at our original business model with the verticalized law firm, a lot of these companies that have this kind of full stack model are not going to survive,” Kan explained. “A lot of these companies, Atrium included, did not figure out how to make a dent in operational efficiency.”
For a company like wedding dress retailer Brideside, Covid-19 obviated the need for its offerings:
“With two-thirds of weddings cancelled in 2020 and an uncertain year ahead, our chapter has come to an end.”
A month after Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell, and Robert Morris started the Y Combinator seed accelerator in 2005, they picked “make something people want” as their motto.
Our study shows that failing to do this is one of the easiest ways to guarantee startup failure.
1. Ran out of cash/failed to raise new capital
Money and time are finite and need to be allocated judiciously. For the startups on our list, running out of cash — tied with the inability to secure financing/investor interest — was the top reason startups cited for their failure.
In September 2019, augmented reality startup Daqri shut down after burning through more than $250M in funding and failing to raise a new round from investors:
“Daqri faced substantial challenges from competing headset makers, including Magic Leap and Microsoft, which were backed by more expansive war chests and institutional partnerships. While the headset company struggled to compete for enterprise customers, Daqri benefited from investor excitement surrounding the broader space. That is, until the investment climate for AR startups cooled.”
Despite fostering partnerships with Boeing, General Electric, and NetJets, aeronautical engineering startup Aerion Corporation was unable to convince investors of its potential:
“The AS2 supersonic business jet program meets all market, technical, regulatory and sustainability requirements, and the market for a new supersonic segment of general aviation has been validated with $11.2 billion in sales backlog for the AS2.
However, in the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements to finalize the transition of the AS2 into production.
Given these conditions, the Aerion Corporation is now taking the appropriate steps in consideration of this ongoing financial environment.”
European budget airline Wow Air met a similar fate; Chairman Skuli Mogensen wrote to employees:
“We have run out of time and have unfortunately not been able to secure funding for the company… I will never be able to forgive myself for not taking action sooner.”

Why Do Startups Fail? 5 Main Reasons for Startup Failure

Why do startups fail? This is one of the pretty common questions of many entrepreneurs because startup activity is of great popularity. It seems that at least one out of ten people run their own startups. Why is it so popular and what is it?
A startup (also start-up) is a private or collective business conducted by an individual or a group of entrepreneurs. It’s targeted at finding and satisfying the needs of the masses. There are various kinds of startups. This may be a concrete application, a selling website, etc. Everything depends on the creativity and possibilities of businessmen. This is a certain business model, which is pretty promising if it’s launched properly. However, there are hundreds and thousands of examples of failed startups.
This is a risky business with lots of obvious, as well as hidden impediments. We have analyzed multiple startups that failed. We have conducted special research to define and realize possible reasons that lead to failure.
Our experts have come up with 5 reasons startups fail. These reasons are pretty common and may befall every entrepreneur both experienced and a newcomer. Make allowances for the following factors:
Lack of skills. Mostly, the key reason is that people do not have enough experience dealing with the production and marketing of a new item. In order to succeed, it is a wise idea to turn to a company like Clockwise Software and get the needed assistance.
Poorly developed leadership skills. One of the other common issues is that the founder does not know the product properly. In this case, hiring an experienced CEO is the best solution.
Great expenses. Most business people think that as soon as they launch a product, they will earn money. Unfortunately, any business needs expenses, and developers have to wisely plan them in order not to waste money on useless services and other goods.
No market need. It is very important to research the market and make sure your product is unique as well as useful for the target audience. Analyze your customers, their needs, budgets, etc as well as make sure your product presents a special offer that no similar company has.
No practice with MVP. It is almost impossible to produce a perfect product on the first attempt. MVP is a minimum viable product that you present first and only then, after having analyzed your audience and their demands, you can add some reasonable features that will make your offer wanted.
Hereafter, we will review every point in some greater details. It’s needed to shed more light on these reasons so that you could see the picture big. Thus, you’ll be able to draw correct conclusions and avoid startup failure.
1. Inappropriate Skills
One of the typical reasons why most startups fail is a lack of skills, which are required for the successful development of a business campaign. Oftentimes, entrepreneurs don’t fulfill things that are really necessary for success. For instance:
Lack of experience. A beginner doesn’t know how to launch new products.
SEO optimization is poor. A person doesn’t know how to advertise and promote business.
No interest for consumers. Potential customers don’t recognize the benefits of the advertised products.
If you want to be successful, you should develop your own skills that lead to a victory. If you feel that you’re missing something important and aren’t able to promote your web products/services, it’s better to turn for help to an experienced professional company, such as Clockwise Software.
2. Ineffective Leadership
The second issue is associated with leadership skills and a dependable team of workers. Many beginners aren’t able to recruit professional workers and fail miserably when it’s required to motivate them. As a result:
People aren’t organized;
Productivity is low;
You don’t earn enough;
Your business fails;
Your workers should recognize a leader in you. In order to succeed you ought to summon all your strength and enthusiasm. It’s necessary to continuously improve your skills and be a self-confident leader. You should be more organized, dedicated to what you do, and be ready to face multiple impediments. Most people are not ready to spend 80 hours every week. They never think that it should take that long. Being a leader means to sacrifice a lot. You should be passionate about the market.
Nonetheless, it’s not easy to have a progressive startup app development at once. Under the condition, you think that this task is too difficult you should hire specialists. Approved experts have the necessary leadership skills to effectively organize the working process, encourage the staff, accept challenges and find effective solutions.
3. Great Expenses
Another common reason is an issue of money. Many businessmen strongly believe that after they launch a brilliant project, they will instantly earn heaps of money. In the meanwhile, the number of their investments is actually miserable. Every startup requires huge investments. This means that you will have to tighten your belt and wait at least a few months until you earn something. Many people:
Choose non-perspective industry;
Spend money on unimportant things;
Invest during the financial crisis;
They also have:
Poor leadership abilities;
Bad knowledge of the market;
Bad understanding of your own product;
Poor advertising campaign;
Low SEO optimization.
The wise people know what should be bought and what isn’t worth a penny. Understand your needs and concentrate on their stabilization. Reject all other needs of lesser importance. Do not burn out your cash.
4. Know Your Customers’ Needs
The final typical reason for failure is a low interest to what you sell. Many inexperienced entrepreneurs are dreamers. They have a certain dream and wish to sell products and/or services they wish without giving heed to the actual needs of customers. This is a huge mistake. You should always keep in mind that the main objective of any startup is to satisfy and meet the needs of customers.
Properly study the market and the needs of potential customers. Think which products and/or services you can sell and create your marketing strategy. Recognize your targeted audience and think about how to deliver your message. Commonly, people use social media and searching engines. Always pay attention to the recent alterations and requirements of your customers.
5. The Absence of MVP Practice
Never try to launch a complete product with all necessary features instantly. You’ll fail because you don’t know the actual needs of consumers. Begin with MVP. Test a prototype of your product and always ask for the feedback of online users. Afterward, fix all the drawbacks and improve your product until it’s perfect. Your product should fully meet the demands of users. If you hurry and launch an untested product at once, you risk losing your money and time. Give it time, test, consult with the specialists, hire a specialized company, and make a worthy proposal.
It’s obvious that the launching of a business model is utterly difficult. You should take it seriously and act responsibly. Be ready to face lots of challenges, and the desired success will become a reality.

The Top 10 Reasons Startups Fail to Find Success
The Top 10 Reasons Startups Fail to Find Success
09/23/19 | 7 MIN READ
An extensive look at why startups fail to find success to help you avoid these issues.
Running a startup is a difficult endeavor for any entrepreneur, which means that you'll experience a significant number of struggles in the early months and years of this process. Before you delve into the lengthy and complicated process that comes with building a successful startup, it's important to understand that all companies run into their share of problems.
If you want your startup to garner success, it's essential that you do what's necessary to overcome these problems. Creating a startup in the U.S. will almost certainly prove to be an arduous task if you're not fully prepared for all of the hurdles that you'll need to navigate, which is displayed by the fact that around 90 percent of all startups in the U.S. will fail within the first three years of business.
The issue with attempting to create a successful startup is that there are many reasons that a startup can fail. Whether you don't plan properly for the future or you attempt to expand too quickly, there are a myriad of moving parts that you'll need to handle effectively if you want your startup to see continued success in the years to come.
The following provides an extensive look at the top 10 reasons that startups fail to find success, which should help you avoid these issues.
1. Lack of Planning
Many startups won't plan into the future because they feel like their idea for a product or service is enough to garner success. While having a great idea should help you in the early stages of forming a startup, you need to combine this product with a comprehensive business plan if you want sustained success. A lack of planning means that you'll be required to make decisions about marketing strategies and product direction on an almost daily basis, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.
It's also very difficult to avoid distractions when you don't know what you're working towards. While creating a business plan might seem to be a daunting task, it will allow you to have a road map that you can reference in the years to come. This business plan should take your marketing strategies into account as well.
2. Expanding Too Quickly
No matter the industry you work in, it can be difficult to understand when it's time to expand if you've never created a startup before. Among the more common reasons that startups fail to find success is because they expand too quickly when they aren't actually ready for the demands that come with expansion. This ties back to a lack of planning in an obvious way.
When a startup creates a detailed business plan, they will have a firm understanding of the gradual steps that need to be taken when trying to gain success. Without a business plan, you'll likely find it difficult to determine when the time is right for expansion, which can easily cause you to expand far too quickly.

When you expand your startup too quickly, you may be unable to maintain every other aspect of the company, which will likely prove to be problematic as time goes on and may worsen your reputation among your customers. Some of the dangers of growing your business too fast include making mistakes with your cash flow, hiring the wrong employees, not properly scaling customer service, and making management mistakes. Even one of these problems could sink your startup. Only expand when you have the resources, time, and experience necessary to do so without many bumps in the road.
3. Hiring the Wrong People
If you're an entrepreneur who believes in your product/service and has a good idea of what it will take to create a successful business, you likely understand that you'll need to hire employees throughout the process if you want your business to properly handle growth. However, many startups will hire the wrong people who aren't right for the job.
For instance, some startups will focus on hiring their friends for jobs who may not have the expertise necessary to take on the challenges of the position. In the formative stages of your startup, it's imperative that the people you hire are great for the job. If you hire the right people, you'll find that your company will function properly.
If you've never hired employees before, there are some general hiring tips that will make this process go much smoother and should minimize mistakes in the hiring process. For instance, you need to ask each prospective employee about why they want to work at your company and how they would tackle common problems that occur in a standard workday.
You should also try to fit the personality to the job. If the job that you're hiring for requires regular conversation with other employees, management, and potential investors, you should hire someone with good social skills and an outgoing personality. Likely the best method to simplify the hiring process is to have a proper HR team within your startup. When you hire an HR team for your startup, they'll be able to handle the finding, recruiting, and training of all applicants, which will make your job easier.
4. Lack of Adequate Funding
If you have a great idea for a product or service that you believe can be successful, you need to market this idea to prospective investors if you want to be able to grow and expand your startup in the years to come. While the initial funding for the majority of startups is comprised of personal income and investments from friends and family members, you're almost certainly going to need to obtain outside funding. While a lack of adequate funding is a common reason that many startups fail, it's also a simple problem to remedy since you can seek funding through an array of different avenues.
Likely the first type of funding that you should seek for your startup involves one or more angel investors. These individuals are typically looking to get in on the ground floor of new and exciting startups. You could also join an incubator or accelerator if you want to gain the resources necessary to succeed without needing to spend too much of your budget.
Other types of funding that you should consider as a startup include venture capitalists and small business grants. By obtaining more money than you might require at the moment, you should be secure in the strength of your business. If ever an unforeseen problem occurs, you'll have the funding necessary to address the problem.
5. No Online Presence
If you want your startup to be successful, it's almost required that you build an online presence for your company. Many startups fail to find success because they focus solely on delivering their product or service to the market without any thought towards the need for an online presence. The best way to build your customer base and appeal to the modern audience is by setting up a strong online presence, which requires effective marketing skills.
In order to create an online presence that elevates your startup and brand, you need to build a website for your business as well as a social media presence, the latter of which can be done on such platforms as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
The key towards marketing your startup successfully on your website or social media page is to provide customers with relevant content on a regular basis. A strong online presence will grow your customer base, which can pay dividends in the future.
6. Poor Product
If you've thought of an idea for a product and believe that it would sell well when placed on the market, it's essential that this belief is backed up by market research. First, ask yourself if the service or product that you want to develop provides any kind of value. For a product or service to be successful in today's market, you must either provide customers with an entirely new product that answers a problem or provide them with a product/service that's a refined and better version of something else on the market.
If the product or service that you've thought of has high competition among other companies, you might want to avoid placing too many resources into the idea. However, a product that's in high demand would almost certainly experience initial success.
7. Not Being Customer- Focused
Numerous startups will fail to find success because they aren't customer-centric with their approach to running a business. If you want to obtain continued success, you should show your customers that they are important to your business. For instance, do you provide good customer service to your main customers? If you can't easily answer this question, you likely aren't doing enough to provide assistance to your customers. Your primary audience needs to be able to create a relationship with your company that builds trust.
If you run a social media page on Facebook, a great way to show your customers that they are important is by engaging with them in comment sections and by answering the questions and problems that they might have. If you have a website, make sure that your customers can reach you and will be provided with a prompt response. If you're loyal to your customers, they will be loyal to you. Without taking the necessary steps to make your business customer-centric, it's likely that your success will be short lived.
8. Pricing Conflicts
When you're looking to set a price for a product or service that you offer, it's important that this price will be appealing to your target audience and won't conflict with what your audience expects. If the products that you currently sell are known for being reasonably priced, it's recommended that you stick with this approach.
Many startups will change course and attempt to price one of their products higher so that they can market it as a luxury product. While this marketing approach can work from time to time, it's also very risky for smaller startups that have yet to gain a loyal customer base. High pricing may significantly restrict the population that you can reach. Avoiding pricing conflicts will lessen your risk of failure with your startup.
9. Poor Management Team
Once you've progressed past the concept stage of your startup, you'll likely need to hire a management team to assist you with running the business. Many startups will fail to find long-term success because they've hired the wrong team to manage the company. A common problem with a poor management team is that they don't provide workers with the right management or enough work. This team could be providing your workers with poor guidance and impossible workloads, which is a recipe for disaster.
Some management teams will be slack and lazy on a consistent basis, which means that work won't get done and business goals will be missed. The management team that you hire must be right for the specific type of company that you're building.
The individuals that comprise the management team should know how to properly manage large projects while also knowing how to delegate tasks to others when necessary. The first step towards building a successful startup is to make the right hires.
10. High Competition
Nearly 20 percent of all startups will fail to find success because there's too much competition. For instance, any company that attempts to make a smartphone will invariably find it difficult to gain success in a market that's dominated by Samsung and Apple.
While you'll almost certainly have some competition no matter the type of startup you create, you don't want your product or service to be competing with many other companies that have already garnered success. Entering a highly competitive market will make it difficult for your company to be unique to visitors and users. If your competition mainly consists of big brands and big companies that have years of history, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to gain a significant share of the market.

Alright, I've got a bunch of information here from different sources about why startups fail. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, it's clear that startups have a high failure rate. The statistics vary, but it seems that somewhere between 70% to 90% of startups don't make it past a certain number of years. That's pretty staggering. So, understanding why this happens is crucial for anyone thinking about starting a business.

From the search results, there are multiple reasons cited for startup failures, and it's often a combination of several factors rather than just one. Let's see what the common themes are.

1. **No Market Need:** This seems to be the top reason why startups fail. According to CB Insights, 42% of startups fail because there's no market need for their product or service. That means the idea might be great, but if customers don't want or need it, it's not going to succeed. This emphasizes the importance of thorough market research and validating the product idea before投入大量资源.

2. **Ran Out of Cash:** Another major reason is running out of money. Startups need funding to operate, develop their products, and grow. If they can't secure enough funding or if they burn through their resources too quickly without generating revenue, they'll inevitably fail. Managing finances carefully and having a sustainable business model is crucial.

3. **Not the Right Team:** The team behind a startup plays a vital role in its success. If the founders or key members lack necessary skills, experience, or compatibility, it can lead to poor decision-making and execution. Building a diverse and skilled team is essential.

4. **Get Outcompeted:** Startups often face competition from bigger, established companies or from other startups. If they can't differentiate themselves or offer something better, they might get overshadowed and fail. Standing out in a crowded market is challenging.

5. **Pricing/Cost Issues:** Finding the right price point for a product is tricky. If the pricing is too high, customers might not buy it; if it's too low, the company might not make enough profit. Additionally, managing costs efficiently is crucial to maintain profitability.

6. **Poor Product:** Even if there's a market need, if the product doesn't meet customer expectations or has flaws, it won't succeed. Continuous improvement and listening to customer feedback are important.

7. **Failure to Pivot:** Sometimes, startups need to adapt their business model or product based on market feedback. If they can't pivot effectively when needed, they might miss opportunities and fail.

8. **Harmony Among Team/Investors:** Disagreements within the founding team or with investors can derail a startup. Clear communication, shared vision, and alignment of goals are essential.

9. **Burnout/Lack of Passion:** Starting a business is incredibly demanding. If founders burn out or lose passion, it can negatively impact the company's performance.

10. **Legal/Regulatory Challenges:** Non-compliance with laws or facing regulatory hurdles can also lead to failure. Navigating legal requirements is important.

These are the main reasons highlighted in the search results. Each of these points comes with examples and stories from real startups that failed due to these reasons. It's evident that startups need to be mindful of all these aspects to increase their chances of success.

Reflecting on this, I can see that a lot of these reasons are interconnected. For instance, if there's no market need, it's likely that the startup will struggle with funding and revenue. Similarly, if the team isn't right, it can affect decision-making related to pricing, product development, and more.

For someone considering starting a business, it's crucial to address these potential pitfalls proactively. This might involve conducting thorough market research, building a strong and diverse team, managing finances carefully, being adaptable, and ensuring there's alignment among all stakeholders.

Moreover, seeking mentorship and advice from experienced entrepreneurs can be invaluable. They've likely faced these challenges themselves and can provide insights on how to navigate them.

In conclusion, while starting a business is risky, being aware of the common reasons for failure and taking steps to mitigate those risks can significantly improve a startup's chances of success.
