As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide you with some points to consider when discussing whether all vaccines for all diseases should be mandatory.

Firstly, vaccines have been instrumental in eradicating or controlling many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, and measles. Mandatory vaccination policies have played a significant role in achieving high immunization rates, which not only protect individuals but also contribute to herd immunity, safeguarding those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.

On the other hand, some people raise concerns about individual freedoms and the right to choose what medical treatments to accept for themselves or their children. They may also have concerns about vaccine safety and potential side effects, although extensive research generally supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

Moreover, mandating all vaccines for all diseases might not be practical or necessary. Some diseases may pose less risk to public health, or the vaccines may have lower efficacy rates. It's essential to evaluate each vaccine and disease on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as disease severity, transmission rates, and vaccine effectiveness.

Additionally, implementing mandatory vaccination policies requires careful consideration of ethical, legal, and logistical aspects. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines, addressing misinformation, and providing education about vaccine benefits and risks are crucial components of successful vaccination programs.

In conclusion, while mandatory vaccination has proven beneficial in controlling infectious diseases, it's important to approach the issue thoughtfully, balancing public health needs with individual rights and considerations specific to each vaccine and disease.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, not all vaccines for all diseases should be mandatory.}} \]
