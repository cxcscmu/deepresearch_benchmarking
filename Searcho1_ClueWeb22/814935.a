So I have this question: "What makes a director an auteur?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what "auteur" means in this context, but I think it has something to do with film directors and their style or something. Maybe it's about directors who have a unique vision or leave their personal mark on their films. But I need to be precise here, so I should probably look up what "auteur" means in film theory.

Let me start by understanding the term "auteur." I believe it comes from French, and "auteur" means "author." So, in the context of film, it might refer to the director being considered the author of the film, similar to how a writer is the author of a book. That makes sense because directors have a lot of control over the final product, especially in terms of vision and style.

But I need to confirm this. Maybe I should look up the "auteur theory." I think it's a concept in film criticism that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly associated with French critics like François Truffaut and André Bazin. They argued that the director is the primary author of the film, and their work reflects their personal vision and style, much like an author's books do.

So, if that's the case, then being an auteur director would mean that a director consistently demonstrates a unique style, thematic concerns, and a distinct viewpoint across their body of work. It's not just about directing movies; it's about imprinting each film with their own personality and artistic choices.

Let me think about some examples. Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, and Quentin Tarantino are often cited as auteurs because they have distinctive styles and recurring themes in their films. Hitchcock's use of camera angles and his fascination with psychology, Kubrick's attention to detail and exploration of human nature, and Tarantino's nonlinear storytelling and dialogue—are all hallmarks of their authorship.

But I should also consider that not all directors fit this mold. Some directors are more collaborative, working closely with screenwriters, producers, and other crew members, and may not impose such a strong personal vision on their films. In those cases, the film might be seen as a collective effort rather than the expression of a single author.

Moreover, the auteur theory has been criticized over the years for overlooking the contributions of other key players in filmmaking, such as screenwriters, cinematographers, and editors. It's important to acknowledge that making a film is a collaborative process, and the director isn't the only one making creative decisions.

Despite these criticisms, the auteur theory remains influential in film studies and criticism. It highlights the importance of the director's role in shaping the film's overall vision and style. So, to answer the question, what makes a director an auteur is their ability to consistently infuse their films with a personal style, thematic preoccupations, and a distinct viewpoint, thereby making their films an expression of their authorial voice.

Maybe I should look up some key characteristics or criteria that define an auteur director. Perhaps there are specific elements that critics look for when designating a director as an auteur.

Let me consider conducting a search to get more precise information.

An auteur can be defined as a film director who influences their films so much that they rank as their author.
Would you like to find out more about Auteur cinema and its features?
Put simply, an auteur is a director that has an unique style and narrative in their filmmaking.
screenprism.com
The concept first appeared in France during the 1940s. The auteur cinema was first coined by directors such as André Bazin, Alexandre Astruc, and François Truffaut.
laughingsquid.com
It becomes easier to distinguish who is an auteur when you begin to understand the concept.
No need for long and boring explanations. It is possible to spot an auteur movie from miles away.
4.bp.blogspot.com
Even if you don't know anything about the movie, each sequence of that movie is filled with that director's signature style.
Auteur directors are carefully involved with every single aspect of their movies.
realvision.ae
The concept was first coined by French new wave cinema artists. Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks were amongst the first directors that were granted to this title.
nerdbastards.com
It should be noted that this wasn't a race to earn the title 'auteur.' The concept has created its own examples over time.
sensesofcinema.com
Stanley Kubrick can be counted as an example. For instance, Kubrick's movies do not resemble one another when you consider their plots. However, you can easily sense a signature style when you watch all of his films by looking at his camera angles or obscured sense of humor.
Which directors could be considered as auteurs? Let's take a moment to think about this.

It is not possible to come up with all of the talented auteurs in an instance. Considering a repetitive visual pattern might be helpful to spot and understand who is making auteur cinema.
Such as Quentin Tarantino...
Paul Thomas Anderson.

It's a real shame if your path has not crossed Paul Thomas Anderson.
And certainly Wes Anderson! The ambassador for vivid colors and perfect symmetry...

Auteur
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For the band, see The Auteurs.
An auteur (/oʊ ˈ t ɜːr/; French: [otœʁ], lit. 'author ') is an artist with a distinctive approach, usually a film director whose filmmaking control is so unbounded but personal that the director is likened to the "author" of the film, [1] which thus manifests the director's unique style or thematic focus. [2] As an unnamed value, auteurism originated in French film criticism of the late 1940s, [3] and derives from the critical approach of André Bazin and Alexandre Astruc, whereas American critic Andrew Sarris in 1962 called it auteur theory.[4] [5] Yet such[clarification needed] first appeared in French during 1955 when director François Truffaut termed it policy of the authors, and interpreted the films of some directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, as a body revealing recurring themes and preoccupations.
American actor Jerry Lewis directed his own 1960 film The Bellboy via sweeping control, and was praised for "personal genius." By 1970, the New Hollywood era emerged with studios granting directors broad leeway. Pauline Kael argued, however, that "auteurs" rely on creativity of others, like cinematographers. [6] [7] Georges Sadoul deemed a film's putative "author" potentially even an actor, but a film indeed collaborative. [8] Aljean Harmetz cited major control even by film executives. [9] David Kipen 's view of screenwriter as indeed main author is termed Schreiber theory. In the 1980s, large failures prompted studios to reassert most control. By now, the auteur concept has been applied to other media, as to describe some record producers and video game developers. [10]

Film[edit]
Origin[edit]
Film director and critic François Truffaut in 1965
Even before auteur theory, the director was considered the most important influence on a film. In Germany, an early film theorist, Walter Julius Bloem, explained that since filmmaking is an art geared toward popular culture, a film's immediate influence, the director, is viewed as the artist, whereas an earlier contributor, like the screenwriter, is viewed as an apprentice. [11] [12] James Agee, a leading film critic of the 1940s, said that "the best films are personal ones, made by forceful directors". [12] Meanwhile, the French film critics André Bazin and Roger Leenhardt described that directors, vitalizing films, depict the directors' own worldviews and impressions of the subject matter, as by varying lighting, camerawork, staging, editing, and so on. [13]
Development of theory[edit]
As the French New Wave in cinema began, French magazine Cahiers du cinéma, founded in 1951, became a hub of discourse about directors' roles in cinema. In a 1954 essay, [14] François Truffaut criticized the prevailing "Cinema of Quality" whereby directors, faithful to the script, merely adapt a literary novel. Truffaut described such director as a metteur en scene, a mere "stager" who adds the performers and pictures. [15] To represent the view that directors who are authoritative and flexible make better films, Truffaut coined the phrase La politique des auteurs, or The policy of the authors .
Jerry Lewis, an actor from the Hollywood studio system, directed his own 1960 film The Bellboy. Lewis's influence on it spanned business and creative roles, including writing, directing, lighting, editing, and art direction. French film critics, publishing in Cahiers du Cinéma and in Positif, praised Lewis's results. For his mise-en-scene and camerawork, Lewis was likened to Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, and Satyajit Ray. In particular, Jean-Luc Godard credited Lewis's "personal genius" for making him "the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn't falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles", "the only one today who's making courageous films." [16]
Popularization and influence[edit]
As early as his 1962 essay "Notes of the auteur theory", published in the journal Film Culture,[17] American film critic Andrew Sarris translated the French term la politique des auteurs, by François Truffaut in 1955, into Sarris's term auteur theory. Sarris applied it to Hollywood films, and elaborated in his 1968 book, The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968, which helped popularized the English term.
Via auteur theory, critical and public scrutiny of films shifted from their stars to the overall creation. [12] In the 1960s and the 1970s, a new generation of directors, revitalizing filmmaking by wielding greater control, manifested the New Hollywood era, [18] [19] when studios granted directors more leeway to take risks. [20] Yet in the 1980s, upon high-profile failures like Heaven's Gate, studios reasserted control, muting the auteur theory. [21]
Meta-Cinema[edit]
In a study conducted by Dr. Shlomit Aharoni Lir and Prof. Liat Ayalon on the price paid in the male artistic creation process , the researchers examined 
three meta-ﬁctional ﬁlms that focus on male directors, as an auteur for whom cinema is the pivotal center of their being: the Israeli ﬁlm Peaches and Cream  (2019, directed by Gur Bentwich), the Spanish ﬁlm Pain and Glory (2019, directed by Pedro Almodóvar ), and American ﬁlm All That Jazz (1979, directed by Bob Fosse ).  The researchers noted how the three films correspond with Fellini's work Eight and a Half in the manner they deal with the director's inner world, and his place in relation to his creative process.
The scholars addressed the cultural conception of genius as essentially masculine and the way in which it relates to the myth of the tormented artist. They pointed out how the auteur, as a total artist, who seeks to leave his mark on every detail of his work and who is completely involved in his artworld, may be lost in the creative process, and suffer both physically and mentally, as each of the examined films portrays. [22]
Criticism[edit]
Pauline Kael, an early critic of auteur theory, [23] [24] debated Andrew Sarris in magazines. [25] [7] Defending a film as a collaboration, her 1971 essay "Raising Kane ," examining Orson Welles 's 1941 film Citizen Kane, finds extensive reliance on co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz and on cinematographer Gregg Toland.[26]
Richard Corliss and David Kipen argued that a film's success relies more on screenwriting. [27] [28] [29] In 2006, to depict the screenwriter as the film's principal author, Kipen coined the term Schreiber theory .
To film historian Georges Sadoul, a film's main "author" can also be an actor, screenwriter, producer, or novel's author, although a film is a collective's work. [8] Film historian Aljean Harmetz, citing classical Hollywood's input by producers and executives, held that auteur theory "collapses against the reality of the studio system ". [9]
In a feminist criticism, Maria Giese in 2013 alleged that the auteur theory is biased to males, as the pantheons of auteurs barely include a woman. [30] This may reflect the sheer scarcity of women as directors, with about 7% of directors being women among the 250 highest grossing films in 2016. [31]
Law[edit]
In some law references, a film is treated as artwork while the auteur, as its creator, is the original copyright holder. Under European Union law, largely by influence of auteur theory, a film director is considered the film's author or one of its authors. [32]
Popular music[edit]
See also: Art pop and Recording studio as an instrument
Record producer Phil Spector in 1964
The references of auteur theory are occasionally applied to musicians, musical performers and music producers. From the 1960s, record producer Phil Spector is considered the first auteur among producers of popular music. [33] [34] Author Matthew Bannister named him the first "star" producer. [34] Journalist Richard Williams wrote:
Spector created a new concept: the producer as overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label. [35]
Another early pop music auteur was Brian Wilson,[36] mentored by Spector. [37] In 1962, Wilson's band, the Beach Boys, signed to Capitol Records, and swiftly became a commercial success, whereby Wilson was an early recording artist who was also an entrepreneurial producer. [38] Before the "progressive pop" of the late 1960s, performers typically had little input on their own records. [39] Wilson, however, employed the studio like an instrument, [37] as well as a high level of studio control [40] that other artists soon sought. [36]
According to The Atlantic's Jason Guriel, the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds, produced by Wilson, anticipated later auteurs such as Kanye West, as well as "the rise of the producer" and "the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art. ... Anytime a band or musician disappears into a studio to contrive an album-length mystery, the ghost of Wilson is hovering near." [41]
Video games[edit]

This section focuses too much on specific examples without explaining their importance to its main subject. Please help improve this article by citing reliable, secondary sources that evaluate and synthesize these or similar examples within a broader context.(March 2022)
As to the audio-visual environment within video games, Japanese developer Hideo Kojima —known for the Metal Gear series—may be the first recognized auteur. [42] Others from Japan include Fumito Ueda (Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, The Last Guardian ), [43] Shigeru Miyamoto (Mario and The Legend of Zelda series), [44] Goichi "Suda51" Suda (Killer7, No More Heroes series), [45] Hidetaka Miyazaki (Souls series), [46] Hironobu Sakaguchi (Final Fantasy series creator), [47] Yu Suzuki (Out Run, After Burner series, Virtua Fighter series, Shenmue series), [47] Yasumi Matsuno (Ogre Battle, Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy Tactics series), [48] Yoko Taro (Drakengard/Nier Series), [49] Keita Takahashi (Katamari Damacy)[10] Yuji Horii (Dragon Quest series) and Kazunori Yamauchi (Gran Turismo series). [50] In North America, similar esteem has been granted to Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango, Psychonauts)[51] [52] and Ken Levine (Bioshock, Bioshock: Infinite ). [53] Auteurs from Europe include Ragnar Tørnquist (Dreamfall: The Longest Journey ), [54] Éric Chahi (Another World ), [10] and Jeff Minter (Gridrunner, Attack of the Mutant Camels, Tempest 2000 ).

The Cinematic Auteur
Steven Spielberg
Auteur Theory says that a director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the French word for "author"). In spite of the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through all kinds of studio interference and through the collective process.”
Steven Spielberg is now recognized as one of Hollywood’s leading auteurs; a filmmaker who expresses his identity over a body of films. Steven Spielberg, for instance, lends his touch to films he's associated with, whether it's as director OR producer, as with The Goonies
Importance of auteur theory in film analysis and interpretation.
Auteur theory is the process in which to critique films.  “The theory gives enormous, almost total responsibility for a film’s success or failure (artistically, not at the box office) to the director” (Goodykoontz  & Jacobs, 2011).  According to film critic Andrew Sarris there are three rules to determine if a Director is an Auteurist.   (1) Technical competence which refers to how well a movie is made; (2) Distinguishable Personality which refers to movies must have identifiable style and viewpoint; (3) Interior Meaning which refers to that the body of work should express coherent world stance.
The features of being an auteur include; 1 having a recognizable style, 2   repeatedly returning to the same subject mater, 3   habitually address a particular psychological or moral theme, 4 employ a reoccurring visual and aesthetic style,   5 constantly work with the same actors or cinametogarphers or editors…ect , or demonstrate any combination of the above. Steven Spielberg is an auteur and today I am going to prove it. I will show you through his   use of themes, subject matter, visual style, Collaborations, and Institutions.
Name a director who you would consider an auteur and explain your reasoning
Some notable Auteur Directors are Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg and Spike Lee, hugely popular with their blockbuster movies. What are some arguments against auteur theory and provide examples to support your points.
Arguments against the auteur theory by film critic, Pauline Kael stating that we are over thinking the movies stating “How was one to guess what art was and was not based on a logic that seemed hidden to all other critics?” (Kael et al., 1963).
In the world of directors' cuts, such destructive choices are commonplace. Even the subtleties, while peripheral and seemingly innocuous, have their effects. An extra cutaway here, a quick reaction shot there, and suddenly the gags aren't quite as funny. The sex scenes aren't as breathless. The fights lose their drive. The dialogue drags. Just a little more padding and primping and the intangible gestalt of the original is lost.
Directors' cuts make financial sense because studios can resell the movies in their vaults at little cost. However, there's a point at which auteur perfectionism slides into decadent excess, and the film suffers. It was one thing when Orson Welles asked that the intrusive titles be plucked from the now-classic opening shot of Touch of Evil (1958)--a request Universal granted 40 years later--another when James Cameron insisted on buffing up Terminator 2 with soap-operatic sequences he'd once had the good sense to leave out.
Consider Steven Spielberg's adjustments in the 20th-anniversary remastered edition of his 1982 E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. The changes range from the unnoticeable--accentuating the hobble of E.T.'s gait as he races through the woods--to the sacrilegious--digitally replacing the cops' guns with walkie-talkies. If these strike you as cosmetic, recall the inexcusable interludes of colonial romance and stranded Playboy bunnies in Apocalypse Now: Redux, or the egregious Pixarification of Jabba the Hut in the Special Edition of Star Wars.
The same goes for Spielberg's digital polishing of E. T. Most viewers probably don't notice the difference, at least not consciously but they may well feel a shift in the film's tone as the danger level is diminished. For me, swapping guns for walkie-talkies violates the core principle of the movie--indeed, any children's adventure worth its salt--which is kids versus adults. The moment you reduce the threat from a bullet in the head to a rap on the knuckles, you are sacrificing not only the dramatic stakes but also the movie's underlying mythic conflict” (Rose, 2010)
How does auteur theory influence audiences and critics, using examples from film criticism, film marketing campaigns, and your own personal experience
The auteur theory can affect the way a film is marketed by giving directors recognition for their work such as movies by Peter Jackson in the new movie the Hobbit due out soon everywhere you turn there is a commercial for this movie because he is so popular with his other movies such as Lord of the Rings and Adventures of Tintin that were blockbusters, but directors who are not as popular will not be marketed as well. “When a famous director makes a good movie, we look at the movie, we don't think about the director's personality; when he makes a stinker we notice his familiar touches because there's not much else to watch” (Kael, 1963).

Auteur Theory : Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan)
...Auteur Theory:
            Translated from the French, auteur simply means "author". There have been varied perceptions regarding this theory, its importance and effectiveness. Auteur theory is essentially “a method of evaluating films based on the director’s involvement and input”. The concept of ‘Auteur’ was first introduced by François Truffaut in 1954 in A Certain Tendency in French Cinema.(1) In this work he claimed that film is a great medium for expressing the personal ideas of the director. He suggested that this meant that the director should therefore be regarded as an auteur. According to him, there are three forms in which a director may be regarded as an Auteur. He agreed with André Basin’s idea that the film must be the direct expression of the director’s vision. The second aspect was that the director must be skilled with the camera. He believed the director is to camera as the writer is to pen. Lastly he believed for a director to be considered as an Auteur, he must leave behind a distinctive signature (based on Alexander Astruc’s idea), visually or as an idea in the film. (2) Years later, this concept was reintroduced by Andrew Sarris in 1962, in a publication titled “Notes on Auteur theory” (3). Accordingly, for a director to be considered as an auteur, the director must be well versed with the technical aspects of the film. The director must have a distinct style or a signature that distinguishes his films from the others. The movies must have a theme, an inner......

Analysis on Rear Window
...Film Analysis: Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock
            	The scene in the film Rear Window was about the community and the protagonist named L.B. Jefferies. The scene started with the window. Then came the cat walking in the alley. From that moment, the audience can see the whole set of the neighborhood early in the morning and L.B. Jefferies sleeping when he was sweaty. Next, the viewer can see the old fashioned thermometer, the composer shaving his beard, the couple sleeping outside their balcony, the dancing woman in a pink undergarment, the dog’s leash tied to the lamppost, and the woman with a pet bird. Then back to the L.B. Jefferies. At that moment, the viewer can see him taking a nap in his pajamas, in a wheelchair, his leg in a cast with his name on it, his broken camera, his black and white pictures, and a magazine of a woman. Overall, Alfred Hitchcock filmed this scene to deliver the audience the idea of what the neighborhood looks like, who are the people in the neighborhood, and what they do in their everyday life. Not only about the neighborhood but also the protagonist. He also wants to show what kind of a person L.B. Jefferies is and why is the protagonist of the story. In general, Alfred Hitchcock delivered his beautiful art of mise-en-scene and cinematography to convey this scene.
            
            	In terms of mise-en-scene, the most noticeable elements observed in the scene were the production design and acting. For the production design, the 1950’s feel of the movie was......

An American Beauty Mise En Scene Analysis
...Introduction
            This essay seeks to analyse the use of mise-en-scene in one of the early scenes in the film American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes. Mise-en-scene, a French term translated as "putting into the scene", refers to properties of a cinematic image that exists independently of camera position, camera movement, and editing.
            The story centres on Lester, played by Kevin Spacey, a father who is experiencing a mid-life crisis. Despite employing a traditional Hollywood plot structure that focuses on a problem and a protagonist’s quest in resolving the issue, the film is special. The problem in the film is special as it is Lester’s entire state of life – his unhappiness and dissatisfaction of the way things are in his life.
            The film’s theme centres on the definition of happiness, more specifically in the context of the American Dream. The characters of the American Beauty seem to have confused material well-being with happiness. The plot is pushed by the main protagonist, Lester, in trying to find meaning and happiness in his life that was before dictated by the American expectation.
            We will be looking at the second scene of the film, which begins when Lester enters Brad’s office to discuss his performance at work. Brad is the company efficiency expert who was recently hired. The scene will be discussed separately based on two different locations. The essay will examine the use of settings, costume and make up, staging, lighting and lastly the use of space and time for......

...the term “auteur” has been questioned by some commentators as failing to acknowledge the complexity of the filmmaking process. With reference to one of the directors studied so far on the module, discuss the degree to which analysing his films through an auteurist perspective can help or hinder understanding. You should take into account the ways in which your chosen director uses the resources of cinema as a medium as well as the question of personal vision.
            
            Film director Pedro Almodóvar was symbol of Spain’s newfound freedom in the post-Franco democracy and has since developed into the dominant figure of contemporary Spanish cinema. Paul Smith (2000: 5) describes him as “the one true auteur to emerge in the 1980’s”, while many commentators see him as a “consummate and undisputed auteur” (Jordan and Allinson, 2005: 77). However, attempting to conclusively define Almodóvar as an “auteur” is challenging as the concept has been consistently defined and redefined since its inception. Vernon and Morris (1995: 13) state, “Models of auteurism at work today bear scant resemblance to the term’s original meaning”. Through an auteurist perspective, we must consider how both Almodóvar and his films conform to aspects of both the original ‘theory’, such as personal vision and ‘signatures’, and subsequent developments of the concept focusing on areas of collaboration and commercialisation. Our conclusions can then be used to determine whether Almodóvar’s status, as an auteur or not,......

Alfred Hitchcock Rear Window Essay
...Hitchcock had been described as one of the first 'auteurs' through the stylistic techniques recurring throughout his work, creating a sort of synergy in the films he has produced which today, have been recognised as 'Hitchcockian'. An auteur is usually someone who can be recognised by their films due to a certain kind of theme they take and employ throughout their work. Key elements of the 'Hitchcockian" genre appearing in Rear window include voyeurism, suspense, female roles, and use of theatrical elements. What makes these techniques "Hitchcockian" is that he uses them most consistently throughout his films. Examples of the techniques employed in rear window can also be clearly seen in his other films, for example vertigo can be made comparable to rear window. Psycho and rope also embed "Hitchcockian" themes into them. To enable us to understand what is "Hitchcockian" about rear window and the elements employed, we must consider comparisons to the other works of Hitchcock.

Psycho Shower Scene
...La scène de la douche dans Psychose d’Alfred Hitchcock
            
            La scène de la douche que je présente aujourd’hui est extraite du film « Psychose » ou « Psycho » en version originale et est considérée comme l’une des plus célèbres séquences du cinéma. Ce film, réalisé par Alfred Hitchcock en 1960, est certainement le film d’horreur qui a le plus influencé l’histoire du cinéma. En effet, le dénouement était aussi inattendu qu’effrayant.
            Alfred Hitchcock était un réalisateur anglais qui s’est installé aux Etats-Unis en 1940. Il fut le seul à croire en l’adaptation au cinéma du livre de Robert Bloch et pour cela il prit des risques : il choisit des acteurs inconnus à l’époque (Janet Leigh et Anthony Perkins), il tourna en noir et blanc (alors que le premier film en couleur datait de 1922), avec un petit budget, il fit disparaitre l’héroïne dès le premier tiers du film, mais surtout il osa tourner un film violent avec un meurtre sanglant.
            
            Le film, qui dure 1h49, commence sur une scène entre deux amants dans une chambre. La femme, Marion est en sous-vêtements, ce qui présentait encore un risque à l’époque car les règles de censure étaient très strictes. Marion n’est pas heureuse, elle souhaiterait vivre son amour au grand jour, si seulement ils avaient de l’argent… Puis Marion, qui est secrétaire, se voit confier la tâche d’aller déposer une grosse somme d’argent à la banque pour son patron. Elle rentre chez elle, fait ses valises, et quitte la ville en voiture avec l’argent. Après......

Auteurism in the Lady from Shanghai

            “The new film would resemble the person who made it, not so much in the autobiographical content but rather through the style, which impregnates the film with the personality of its director. Intrinsically strong directors will over the years exhibit a recognizable style and personality” (Stam, 2000)
            “Auteur study stressed the how over the what, a history of films over films in history. Although the danger of excesses was already apparent to Andre Bazin, who warned against a "cult of personality "and other sins, we should also note that auteur criticism had seminal importance in stressing formal questions of visual analysis.”(Truffaut, 1954)

Why More and More Students Are Looking for Social Environments to Study Alongside Each Other?
...Recently we have seen a significant change in study behavior of today’s Flemish students (Belgium) of higher education. In exam periods, more and more students are looking for social environments to study alongside each other. Public places such as libraries, study landscapes, student restaurants are receiving large groups of students.
            Looking on the broad research literature related to this phenomenon we found two lines of theorizing and research that describe the same phenomenon, but could not offer us a satisfying explanation.
            On the one hand recent studies and projects have used thematic pedagogical concepts, such as student-centeredness, active learning, collaborative group work and technological enhancement to drive design for informal learning spaces to provide students with a common area in which to gather, relax, socialize and work together outside classes. The increases use of students studying in these common areas support the success of this redesigning, but not our phenomenon. In Flanders this phenomenon occurs also in old libraries without such innovations.  
            On the other hand, a lot of research focuses on the current generation of students and their relationship to technology. Termed ‘digital natives’ or the ‘Net generation’, these young people are said to have been immersed in technology all their lives, imbuing them with sophisticated technical skills and learning preferences. These characteristics suggest that this Generation would benefit from a more......

            Introduction to Ethics
            Professor Fumerton
            November 30, 2012
            “Ethical judgments are social instruments”
            	In his essay “The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms”, Charles Leslie Stevenson (C.L. Stevenson), a professor of philosophy who taught at the University of Michigan, theorizes that the function of ethical statements is not to describe, but is rather to prescribe. He claims that language carries a type of meaning which he calls ‘emotive meaning’, rather than descriptive meaning and uses many examples of the term ‘good’ to establish his belief. He aims at showing that the notion of ‘good’ is equivalent to taking favor of something (“X is good”= “I like X”). Stevenson’s in-depth analysis of the concept of ‘good’ ultimately shows his readers the reality that the disagreement over whether something is good or not is just simply a disagreement in attitude.
            	The first method used in determining the emotive meaning of ethical statements is to first address ethical questions in answering the question ‘Is X good?’ by what Stevenson calls ‘substitution’. He explains that in order to help understand this concept, the question must be substituted by a question that is free from ambiguity and confusion (Stevenson 370). It would not make sense to substitute this question with one that is irrelevant or with one that is the same as the question being assessed. He uses an example of substitution with the statement ‘Is X pink with yellow trimmings?’ This statement clearly......

            Many of us use the scientific method unconsciously on a daily basis, for work, tasks such as cooking and budgeting. The same elements present in traditional scientific inquiry are present in these everyday examples. Understanding how to apply the scientific method to these seemingly non-scientific problems can be valuable in furthering one's career and in making health-related decision. 
            The scientific method is a process to ask question and answer scientific problem solving by making observation and doing experiments. 
            We can follow the below steps to solve our problem scientifically: 
            Observation

            The second step in the scientific method is formulated by questions. Ask as many questions as we need to answer. Science can answer many questions, but there are some which cannot be answered by science.
            Hypothesis
            The next part of our scientific method is to form a hypothesis. This is simply an educated guess as to the answer for the question.
            Prediction
            The prediction is an official way to put a hypothesis to a test. If the test works most likely we are on a right track to solve our problem. If we have carefully designed our hypothesis to be sure......

...scientific statements provide knowledge of the wide range of physical and natural aspects of the universe. Each of the different fields of the sciences gives us unique insights into a branch of scientific knowledge. Second, this knowledge is conveyed in theories backed by physical evidence obtained through observation and experimentation. Observation and experimentation are essential components of the scientific method because they result in valid and reliable scientific statements.
            	All the different fields of the sciences form scientific statements which deepen our understanding of the universe. For example, biology which is one of the major branches of science focuses on the science of life and living organisms. Chemistry is the branch of science concerned with the composition of substances, their properties, and their reactions. Physics is yet another branch of science which deals with both matter and energy and their interactions. Therefore, scientific statements cover a wide range of subjects which revolve around the mechanics of the natural world. 
            	The high validity and reliability of scientific statements depend on the observations and experimentations performed as part of the scientific method. Scientists develop theories using well-organized scientific procedures which consist of direct and controlled experiments. An example of such an experiment is physicist Ernest Rutherford’s “gold foil experiment.” In 1911, Rutherford performed the “gold foil experiment” to......

Auteur Theory: The Definitive Guide to the Best Auteur Directors
By StudioBinder on September 12, 2019
E arly filmmakers showed the world that a movie director could be an artist. But not every movie director. Because part of auteur theory is knowing how to define auteur directors. Before auteur theory, Directors were important, but the other factors were still more significant. Stars. Studios. Producers.
People referred to a ‘Clark Gable movie’ for example, because in the 1930’s stars ruled the day. Auteur theory came in the early 1950’s, and it changed all that. It shifted some power away from actors, producers, and studio moguls. It shifted power towards directors. Towards specific types of directors. And it ultimately led to a kind of director-crisis. We’ll get to that later…First, let’s define auteur and auteur theory.
auteur definition
What is Auteur Theory?
Auteur Theory is the idea that the director is the author and primary creative force behind a movie.
At first, it seems strange to call the director of the film the "author."
After all, Didn't someone else write it? Why isn't the writer considered the film's author? Well... we all know how Hollywood treats its writers…
Another reason is that scripts often change. So writers come and go.
Casablanca, considered one of the greatest movies of all time, has five credited writers. At least one more uncredited.
Film credits can be their own minefield to navigate, so if you want to know more on that check out this post on understanding film credits.
Back to “authorship”...
As much as everyone depends on the quality of a script the end product of a movie is a result of the execution.
And the execution?
That often comes down to the director. The director will be the one helping each department execute the script.
So if you ask who made a movie, the answer will invariably be:
The Director.

Auteur Directors
Not just any director...
Auteur theory states that the director is more than a conduit for the script. More than a conduit for the project.
Just a sort of well known auteur
The auteur director shapes every part of the movie. Their fingerprints are visible on every aspect.
Many directors, in fact, most, are NOT auteurs. Not according to Auteur Theory, anyway. There is a particular set of rules for defining a director as an auteur.
The auteur of a film is the film's true artist. The visionary behind it. The prime mover. But you can't have that credit just by being the movie's director.
Before we get into the rules, let's back up a moment. Who created all this thing in the first place?
origins of auteur cinema
Where does it come from?
Auteur theory comes from a French publication in 1954 of Cahiers du Cinema.
Cahiers definition is "book", or "notebook". The title loosely translates as "notes on cinema." The publication had been around since 1951. Then in 1954 Francois Truffaut, yes the soon to be legendary French director, wrote a scathing piece on the state of French movies at the time.
He held up as a far superior example, certain American films, and their directors.
In particular, he championed Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. It's no accident that a future filmmaker was the one to get the auteur theory ball rolling. Peter Bogdanovich would later spend years interviewing the great directors, celebrating auteur theory. He went on to make his movies.
American critic Andrew Sarris was the one who referred to Truffaut's manifesto as "Auteur Theory."
Film critic Andrew Sarris helped create the auteur definition
Truffaut famously claimed "there are no good or bad films. Only good or bad directors." Why?
The theory is that a director isn't necessarily a film artist. But an auteur is.
AUTEUR DEFINITION
What is an Auteur?
While the auteur definition in french is literally “author”, in the dictionary it now reads:
“ An auteur is a filmmaker whose individual style and complete control over all elements of production give a film its personal and unique stamp.”
Creating meaning that only he can, using the tools of filmmaking, through the lens of his mind and personality.
A bad movie from an auteur was at least the work of an artist. The excellent film from an average director was not.
Good news Tommy Wiseau!
So why Hitchcock and Hawks? There were plenty other prominent name directors at the time.
Bigger, in fact. Even more celebrated.
The quick answer:
Hitchcock and Hawks seemed to have signature elements to all their movies.
In many ways Howard Hawks was the prototypical auteur.
Which brings us to this question:
auteur filmmaker requirements
What are the rules of Auteur Theory?
When Andrew Sarris took the auteur theory to the next level, he laid out three basic rules:
1. Basic Competency
"A great director has to at least be a good director." Which is to say that the director's movies must be technically competent.
You can't have an auteur who's movies fail to clear some of the fundamental hurdles.
Sorry, Tommy Wiseau...
2. Signature Style
"Over a group of films a director must exhibit certain recurrent characteristics of style which serve as his signature."
This one is pretty self-explanatory. If a director isn't doing this, then he's not an auteur.
You need to know it's Howard Hawks just by looking at it. Hawks is a great example because he made movies across genre. Hell, he practically defined every genre.
The gangster genre with the original Scarface.
Romantic comedy with Bringing Up Baby.
Westerns with Red River.
Adventure with To Have and Have Not and Only Angels Have Wings ...
Hawks' oeuvre is one genre-defining classic after another. The common thread to each? The Hawks signature elements.
It’s also interesting to note that Howard Hawks was not celebrated by his peers, this piece goes a little deeper on how auteur theory changed the perception of Hawks and why.
3. Interior Meaning
"Interior meaning is extrapolated from the tension between a directors personality and his material."
Hmm. Huh?
It seems what Sarris meant here was that the director's innermost soul must come through in the movie.
One of the only ways to know that is what the director went through to get the movie made. Did he have to fight hard against a studio for certain things? Or against the script? Are there specific moments that go beyond a familiar stylistic flourish? Moments that feel more like a little piece of that filmmaker up on the screen?
An example of this might be a moment distinct to the director, but that doesn't belong in the movie. An odd thing to celebrate... but more on that later...
Interior meaning is a tricky thing to get at with a director. How do we know what strange elements they came up with… or where odd little accidents?
That's the LAST rule, or guideline, to defining auteur directors.
That vagueness is what leaves open the great debate that can rage on and on...
best auteur directors
Who are Greatest auteur directors?
Think of it as a debate over who is the greatest one-on-one basketball player. Some people will say it's Michael Jordan. Some younger people might say Lebron James.
But the problem with those types of debates is that they cross an uncrossable distance of time and space. We can never see prime athletes matched up against one another across eras.
But...
We can judge great movies, from great directors at the height of their powers, against one another.
Auteur directors?  Kubrick, Fellini, Welles, Ford, and Hitchcock
How does Spielberg stack up against Hawks? Scorsese vs. Ford?
Let the debates rage on!
Who's the better auteur Hitchcock or Tarantino?
Well if you ask me, a writer-director doesn’t really fit within the auteur definition.
Why? Isn't a writer-director a much more obvious choice for an auteur?
Maybe.
But the strictest auteur definition applies to directors only, as they are the ones imbuing a written source with a unique artistic interpretation. In other words, an auteur director uses only their directing skill to create meaning.
Auteur or noteur?
Who are the best auteur directors?
So Quentin Tarantino really isn’t an "auteur" in a classic sense. But Steven Spielberg could be. This goes against the assumption that an auteur is "artsy" versus a more commercial director like Spielberg who churns out audience-friendly mainstream fare.
To be clear: Wh y is Spielberg more an auteur?
Because whether he starts with a script about dinosaurs or the Holocaust, his stamp will be all over it.
Tarantino conceives of all his films on the page first. So, of course, his stamp is all over it.
This probably won't make Tarantino very happy. But it's the truth if you consider the classical source of the term.
Although, if you ask most people of Tarantino has a signature directing style, the answer would be a resounding "YES." But if you dig deeper, you could make the case that Tarantino's signature style is really found in the writing — and he upholds this writer's vision when directing.
It’s okay Quentin! We still love you even if you’re not a film auteur!
It's also part of the auteur backlash. Because this distinction is a bit silly.
Billy Wilder is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. He made movies in every genre, same as Hawks. His films have his signature qualities.
Wilder co-wrote most of them, if not all of them. In fact, he started out as a writer. This is part of why he was such a great filmmaker. You could make the case that he was a more "complete" storyteller than Hawks.
What about Paul Thomas Anderson? Or Wes Anderson?
How can Hawks and Spielberg be on a auteurism scale that excludes Wilder and Tarantino?
Hmm. This type of endless coffee shop debate is what makes auteur theory so interesting and timeless.

AUTEUR THEORY HATERS
Why do some people hate auteurs?
Many people are not fond of the reductionist qualities of the auteur definition, or any similar theories.
Critic Pauline Kael led the charge against auteur theory. She and Sarris went back and forth over the subject.
Not before she poked some large holes in it.
John Huston, for example, was an excellent director of Hollywood's golden age who "gets no love" from the auteur theories and theorists.
Instead, he's passed off as having made actors films. Kael dismisses this as being arbitrary.
Other problems with the theory are that it seems to champion lesser films. A bad movie by a great director is notable because it has some of his signature elements.
Another quality that has come under fire is the idea of the interior meaning.
If a director forces his 'style' upon a movie where it might not belong, is he a "good" director?
The auteur theory says yes.
DEFINING AUTEUR THEORY
Auteur theory endgame
The auteur theory was part and parcel of the first generation of cinephiles.
The study of film and film directors became more and more popular. Film schools sprung up.
This is John Ford. Does he look like he cares about auteur theory examples?
Early directors like Hawks and John Ford, saw what they did as something of a trade. Not an art form.
When Peter Bogdanovich followed them around with a notepad, they thought he was crazy.
The generation of movie fans that became directors started churning out the movies of the 1970's that would become classics.
Scorsese. Coppola. Friedkin. Altman.
Auteur theory breaking point
Auteur theory consequences?
Things reached a breaking point. Studios started handing these auteurs huge budgets, and some of the results were catastrophic.
After The Deer Hunter director Michael Cimino got a blank check from United Artists.
The auteur theory was starting to pay big.
But Cimino's attention to detail left the production in ruin. It bankrupted the studio. United Artists was sold to MGM.
Cimino's career never recovered.
Meanwhile, something else was happening in film. Other members of that generation made the first true blockbusters... Jaws in 1975 and Star Wars in 1977 showed Hollywood a better way to make money.
Auteur theory changed the way people think of directors and movies.
It went to some extremes at times, but the fundamental notion that a filmmaker is an artist comes directly from auteur theory. The idea that studying a director and his or her work can make you better also came out of it.
But there is a limit to what the Director's power should be. Without checks and balances in place, things can veer into disaster.
A production is a group effort. The finished product is the result of coordinating many artists and technicians. Boiling it down to one person and placing their influence above everyone else makes for bad movies.
The original auteurs themselves would agree.

Alright, so I've got this question: "What makes a director an auteur?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what "auteur" means in this context. I think it's a French word, and it probably relates to film directors in some way. Maybe it has to do with their unique style or vision in filmmaking. Let me try to dig deeper into this.

I remember hearing about the "auteur theory" in some of my film classes, but to be honest, it's been a while, and I need to refresh my memory. I think it's a concept that emphasizes the director as the primary creative force behind a film, similar to how an author is to a book. So, in essence, the director is the author of the film.

But I need to make sure I have a solid grasp of this. Maybe I should look up the origins of the auteur theory. I believe it came from French film critics in the 1950s, like François Truffaut and André Bazin. They were part of the French New Wave movement, and they proposed that directors should be considered the authors of their films, especially those who consistently exhibit a personal style or thematic concern across their body of work.

So, if I'm understanding this correctly, being an auteur means that a director has a distinct vision and style that is recognizable in their films, and they have control over the creative aspects of their work. It's not just about directing; it's about leaving a personal imprint on the film.

Let me think of some examples. Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, and Quentin Tarantino are often cited as auteurs because they have very distinctive styles and recurring themes in their films. Hitchcock's use of suspense and his trademark MacGuffins, Kubrick's attention to detail and exploration of dark themes, and Tarantino's nonlinear storytelling and stylized violence—all of these are hallmarks of their authorship.

On the other hand, there are directors who are more collaborative, working closely with writers, producers, and other crew members, and their films might not have such a strong personal stamp. So, perhaps the auteur theory places a higher value on directors who assert their individual vision over the collective input of the filmmaking team.

But I should also consider that the auteur theory has been criticized over the years. Some argue that it overlooks the contributions of other key players in filmmaking, such as screenwriters, cinematographers, and editors. They contend that making a film is a collaborative process, and attributing authorship solely to the director is reductive.

Moreover, in the Hollywood studio system, directors often had less autonomy and were expected to realize the vision of the producers or the studio heads. So, applying the auteur theory to directors working within that system might not always be accurate or fair.

Despite these criticisms, the auteur theory remains influential in film studies and criticism. It highlights the importance of the director's role in shaping the film's overall vision and style. So, to answer the question, what makes a director an auteur is their ability to consistently infuse their films with a personal style, thematic preoccupations, and a distinct viewpoint, thereby making their films an expression of their authorial voice.

Maybe I should look up some key characteristics or criteria that define an auteur director. Perhaps there are specific elements that critics look for when designating a director as an auteur.

Let me think about this. Maybe I can conduct a search to get more precise information.
