Alright, so I've got this question: "What most likely changed when cottage industries began to disappear?" Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to understand what cottage industries are and why they disappeared. I think cottage industries refer to small-scale home-based businesses where people used to produce goods in their own homes, right? Like, back in the day before factories were a thing. So, these were probably common during the pre-industrial revolution era.

I need to think about what happened when these cottage industries started fading away. Probably, there were some major shifts in how things were produced, where people worked, and maybe even in the economy overall. Let me try to break this down.

First, I should probably look up what exactly cottage industries are to make sure I have the right understanding. Maybe do a quick search on that.

What Is a Cottage Industry?
A cottage industry is a small-scale, decentralized manufacturing business often operated out of a home rather than a purpose-built facility. Cottage industries are defined by the amount of investment required to start, as well as the number of people employed. They often focus on the production of labor-intensive goods but face a significant disadvantage when competing with factory-based manufacturers that mass-produce goods.
Key Takeaways
A cottage industry is a small manufacturing operation, often run out of a person's home.
Cottage industries play a significant role in the economies of developing countries.
Small-scale cottage industries also are an important source of employment, especially in rural areas.
How Cottage Industries Work
The first cottage industries were light manufacturing operations in England and the United States engaged in subcontracted garment-making, textiles or sewing, as well as shoemaking and small metal machine parts. They may have been made up of family members engaged in producing finished goods by utilizing raw materials supplied by a business manager. Many contemporary industries that currently operate in factories were once cottage industries before the Industrial Revolution .
Many modern cottage industries serve a market that seeks out original, handcrafted products as opposed to mass-produced, name brand products. These can include anything from clothing items to crafts to decorative home furnishings.
Special Considerations
Cottage industries play a significant role in the economies of developing countries. These economies may lack the capital and financial systems to support larger industries. It may be difficult for smaller firms to grow due to a lack of available capital or because of uncertainty relating to private property and legal rights.
Developing countries also are more likely to have a comparative advantage in the use of labor compared to the use of capital, allowing them to produce labor-intensive goods more cheaply than developed countries. Because cottage industries may employ labor methods that are heavily reliant on traditional tools and machinery or which require the use of hands, they are more likely to see lower productivity. Thus, even though they may employ a large portion of the population, they may not produce a proportional amount of output.
Small-scale cottage industries also are an important source of employment, especially in rural areas. For farmers, operating a cottage industry out of the home can supplement the income raised from selling crops. In winter, when farming activities tend to abate, a cottage industry can create extra income. For small villages, a cottage industry can allow local residents to come together to produce crafts for sale in local markets or even for export to larger cities and other countries.
While companies operating in cottage industries may remain small, they still have to compete with other firms, whether other cottage industries or larger-scale companies. This requires them to employ new technologies that will improve efficiency and productivity. They also will have to compete for sources of labor, which can be especially difficult as a country becomes more developed and wages rise.
Many flea markets or farmers markets often have people selling crafts or other goods that are the products of cottage industries.﻿
Example of a Cottage Industry
Competitive dancers, figure skaters, and other similar performers often wear original, handmade costumes. At the lowest levels of youth competition, parents might make costumes for their children. As performers rise to higher levels of competition, however, the demand for costumes of higher quality grows, creating opportunities for the most highly skilled costume designers to fill those demands. If skilled enough, designers who began by creating costumes for their own children and maybe a few others can end up creating a cottage industry for themselves.
Designers who have costumes worn by top competitors in the sport can see increased demand for their original creations. Even at regional levels in these sports, there are designers who create names for themselves with their costumes and can be very successful within such a niche market .

Cottage Industry Definition
Cottage industry is a production system that relies on producing goods, or parts of goods, by craftsmen at home, or small workshops, by individuals, small teams or family units instead of large factories. A cottage industry describes the methodology used to produce most goods common throughout much of human history up until the Industrial Revolution.
How Cottage Industries Work
Modern cottage industries serve customers who seek out original and handcrafted goods. Cottage industries can also specialize in services that only require a single or small number of people to operate. Commonly, artists producing artisanal products – whether paintings, sculptures or pottery – operate in a cottage industry as they are capable of completing the entire production process under a single roof alone or with only a few assistants.
Given the rise of e-commerce, many cottage industries have seen a comeback. Artisans can leverage niche websites to offer everything from hand-sewn clothing to crafts to custom woodworking. Etsy.com, for example, permits vendors to list for sale to a global market a wide range of unique artisanal products made by hand by individuals or small groups. Similarly, eBay empowers single individuals to create goods and sell them independently to potentially a vast market.
Though most goods are now mass-produced, goods made by hand are still seen as a sign of higher quality.
Cottage Industry Example
If a bride planned on an expensive wedding and required all of her bridesmaids to be outfitted in the same style, she could turn to a private seamstress working from home to design and fabricate all outfits by hand. That seamstress working alone would be considered a cottage industry.
Interestingly enough, many global factory-based industries today started as cottage industries. For example, the first fixed-wing powered aircraft was made by two entrepreneurs, Wilbur and Orville Wright. They constructed by hand a simple biplane made in a cottage industry: their bicycle shop. The Wright brothers built the plane from scratch, starting with little more than wood, canvass and steel. They even built their gasoline engine. Each piece of their airplane was individually fabricated by hand.
Cottage Industry Advantages and Disadvantages
Historically, a significant advantage of cottage industry was that most of the world’s population did not live in or near towns and cities, but rather in small farming villages. Small family units were forced to be mostly independent and usually produced much of their own food, clothing, and household items. This ancient system allowed families to survive independently across a vast geographic area. The few cities that existed were far too distant to reach regularly to purchase manufactured supplies or food.
Because we live in an increasingly modernized and hyper accessible world, most cottage industries have long since been replaced by industrialization over a century ago. Centralized production in factories usually produce the same quality of goods in a far less expensive manner. In medieval times, a single person could spend days producing an item of clothing as they would usually start with little more than raw hemp fibers.
By the industrialized era of the late 1800s, textile manufacturing was an enormous factory-based industry. Villagers left the farms and rural areas to live and work in urban centers where factory production proliferated. Cottage industries were rapidly eliminated and replaced by industrialization, which could produce a far greater quantity of a good at a far lower unit cost.
Nonetheless, despite the high unit costs of production, cottage industries, particularly in producing unique one-off goods, are still thriving in many areas of the globe. In underdeveloped economies, cottage industries provide employment and a means of survival. Further, even in industrialized economies, there is a growing consumer demand for handmade artisan goods, such as artwork, that is still usually produced by cottage industries.

Alright, so from these search results, I've gathered that cottage industries are small-scale businesses that operate out of people's homes. They're often family-run and involve producing goods or providing services. These industries were more common before the Industrial Revolution when most production happened in people's homes rather than in factories.

So, the question is asking what most likely changed when these cottage industries began to disappear. I think the key here is understanding the transition from home-based production to factory-based production. This shift is closely associated with the Industrial Revolution, which brought about significant changes in how goods were manufactured.

Let me think about this step by step. First, during the time of cottage industries, people worked from their homes, often using their own equipment. This meant that production was分散的, with many small producers spread out over a wide area. In contrast, the Industrial Revolution introduced factories where production was centralized in one location.

So, one major change would be the centralization of production. Instead of people working in their own homes, they started working in factories, which were often located in urban areas. This likely led to people moving from rural areas to cities in search of work, contributing to urbanization.

Another change would be the scale of production. Factories could produce goods much more efficiently and on a larger scale compared to individual craftsmen working in their homes. This led to increased productivity and lower costs per unit, making goods more affordable for consumers.

Additionally, the nature of work changed. In cottage industries, workers had more control over their schedules and methods of production. In factories, there was a stricter regimen, with set hours and standardized processes. This likely led to a loss of autonomy for workers.

Moreover, the skills required for work changed. In cottage industries, workers often needed to be skilled craftsmen, able to complete multiple stages of production. In factories, tasks were broken down into simpler, repetitive jobs, which required less skill but perhaps more physical endurance.

From an economic perspective, the disappearance of cottage industries probably led to the consolidation of production into fewer, larger entities. This could have resulted in increased competition and potentially the displacement of small producers who couldn't compete with the efficiencies of factories.

Also, the social structure might have changed. Cottage industries were often embedded within communities, with families and neighbors working together. The shift to factories could have disrupted these community ties and led to more isolated working environments.

Furthermore, the environment might have been affected. Factories often led to increased pollution and environmental degradation, especially in urban areas where they were concentrated.

Let me see if there's anything else. Education patterns might have changed as well. With more people working in factories, there could have been a shift in the types of skills that were valued in education systems.

Also, the role of women and children in the workforce might have changed. In cottage industries, women and children often participated in production alongside men. In factories, there were sometimes regulations about child labor, and women's roles might have changed as well.

Hmm, that's a lot to consider. Now, I need to think about which of these changes is the most likely or significant one in response to the question.

Probably, the most fundamental change was the shift from home-based, decentralized production to factory-based, centralized production. This change had ripple effects on many aspects of society, including where people lived, how they worked, and the structure of economies.

So, to sum it up, when cottage industries began to disappear, the most likely change was the transition to factory-based production, leading to urbanization, increased productivity, changes in work conditions and skills required, and broader social and economic transformations.

I think that captures the essence of what happened during that period of historical shift.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{the transition to factory-based production, leading to urbanization, increased productivity, changes in work conditions and skills required, and broader social and economic transformations}} \]
