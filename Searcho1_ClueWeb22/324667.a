So I've got this question here: "How does the negative example of Cain shed some light on the gospel plan?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure where to start with this. I know that Cain is a figure from the Bible, specifically from the book of Genesis. He was the first son of Adam and Eve, and he killed his brother Abel. That's about as much as I recall off the top of my head. So, I need to dig deeper into this story and see how it relates to the gospel plan.

First things first, I should probably refresh my memory on who Cain and Abel were and what happened between them. I think a web search would be helpful here. Let me try searching for some key information.

Cain and Abel: Bible Story Summary
Cain and Abel: Bible Story Summary
by Crystal McDowell · Print · Email
Tweet
I t’s often said that our actions speak louder than words. For the first two sons of Adam and Eve, their actions spoke of their level of faith in God. One son demonstrated his faith and was received from God. The other son, Cain, demonstrated his faith in works leading to his sinful demise.
Bible Story Summary
Sometime after Adam and Eve sinned against God and were forced out of the Garden of Eden, they began to have children. The first son was Cain and he was a farmer. The next son was Abel who was a shepherd. When it was time to offer sacrifices to God, Cain brought fruit from the ground and Abel brought the fat portions from some of the firstborn. God favored Abel’s sacrifice, but He didn’t extend that same grace to Cain. This rejection made Cain angry and God admonished Cain to do the right thing and his sacrifice would be accepted. Cain was also warned that if he refused to do the right thing—sin was ready to consume him.
Cain disregarded God’s admonition and warning. Instead he took out his anger on his righteous brother, Abel. In a premeditated manner, Cain invited Abel out to the fields where he murdered him! Later God approached Cain about the whereabouts of Abel just as He did with Adam and Eve with their sin. Cain (being a child of sin and the devil) lied and countered the all-knowing God with the infamous question, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
Cain’s response lacked remorse for his dead brother, but rather that his punishment was too severe and that he would be killed in revenge.
God responded quickly with the pronouncement of his punishment: Cain would be driven from his people, no longer able to farm the land and he would be a wanderer. Cain’s response lacked remorse for his dead brother, but rather that his punishment was too severe and that he would be killed in revenge. The Lord God, being full of mercy and grace, put a mark on Cain to keep people from killing him. As a result Cain left the presence of God, started a family, and built a city. His descendants were prosperous, worldly, and without God. The legacy of Cain led to the destruction of the entire world with the flood. (You can read the Biblical account of Cain and Abel in Genesis 4)
What can we learn from this Bible story for our lives today?
Question #1) Are we better than Cain?
“Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him” (1 John 3:15).
It’s easy for us to judge Cain without taking a look at our own sinful hearts. Cain was jealous of Abel because of God’s favor on him. Do we harbor jealousy and envy towards our brothers and sisters in Christ who are honored for their righteous service and gifts to the Lord? The sin of jealousy can wind itself around our hearts and minds with such deception that we may not even recognize it right away.
When the Holy Spirit sends us that gentle nudge about envy or jealousy in our hearts, we have the same opportunity that was afforded to Cain…repent! By admitting our weakness in the flesh we can be forgiven and restored to right relationship with God. Otherwise, we allow the bitter root to grow into sin and become murderers in our hearts.
Question #2) Are we offering the right sacrifices?
“You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 2:5).
Cain gave back to God what he deemed adequate. Abel brought a better offering in faith and was honored by God. Do we offer sacrifices out of duty, compulsion, or seeking the admiration of other people? While our spiritual sacrifice may seem great on the surface, God knows our hearts. He knows our true motives in giving towards the kingdom of God in our time, energy, finances, and efforts. There is nothing hidden from Him.
By spending time in prayer and Bible study, our hearts are kept sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit. We are compelled by our love for God to give the best we have to offer in light of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
Question #3) Are we mastering sin or being mastered by it?
“For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace” (Romans 6:14).
God warned Cain that sin desired to have him, but that he should master it. Are we entangled in sin as much as those without Christ? It should never be so with believers! We’ve been bought with the precious blood of Jesus so that we no longer live as slaves to sin. Just as Cain, we’re warned through the Holy Spirit to not use grace as an opportunity to sin.
As Christians we have the power of the Holy Spirit to overcome sinful choices. Sin wants to take root in our hearts. But we resist it by keeping our hearts fertile with the desire to please God more than pleasing ourselves.
Cain or Abel? Your choice…
Cain’s actions were evil and Abel’s were righteous. Both men demonstrated in action the passions of their hearts. What is your passion concerning the Lord? If you’re spiritually passive and stale—it may be time for a heart check. The Lord wants the best from you and the best for you. Don’t ignore the knocks on your heart from the Holy Spirit, repent and be made whole in the way of righteous Abel rather than the error of Cain.

Bible Story: Cain and Abel
Bible Text: Genesis 4 :1-16
Story Truth(s):
Sin leads to sadness and separation from God.
Story: After Adam and Eve sinned, the Bible tells us in Genesis 4 that God gave Adam and Eve two sons. The first born, Cain, became a farmer. The second born, Abel, was a shepherd. Each son brought a sacrifice to the Lord. Cain brought some of his harvest, and Abel brought the firstborn of his flock. God saw the heart behind each offering, and God liked Abel’s sacrifice (and heart) more.
Cain was angry. He didn’t want God to tell him what to give. Cain wanted to decide for himself. His anger wasn’t good because it came from his pride and was selfish. Cain was jealous of Abel, and he was mad at God. The Lord warned Cain that his selfish anger was dangerous.
But, Cain didn’t listen to God. He was still angry. So, one day, when he was in the field with Abel, Cain let his anger rule, and he killed his brother. Immediately, Cain wanted to hide his sin and Abel’s death.
When God asked Cain where Abel was, Cain pretended not to know but God already knew that Cain killed Abel. Sin can’t be hidden from God because He knows all things.
When God saw Cain’s sin, He was sad because He knew sin’s cost. Cain’s sin had to be punished so God sent Cain away from His presence. Cain was sad to leave God.
Cain’s sin led to being sent away from enjoying fellowship with God.

Cain and Abel are brothers, the two sons of Adam and Eve. Cain was the first while Abel was the second born. Abel was a shepherd taking care of the animals while Cain was a farmer growing crops and grains. In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord, and Abel also brought offering, fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. So, the Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering and accepted it, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So, Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
So, the Lord noticed Cain’s mood that he was angry and down casted, God asked Cain why was his countenance down? “And God also said, if you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.”
One day, Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”[d]While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel? “I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
But the Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.  And God cursed Cain saying ‘you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”
Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” But the Lord said to him, “Not so[e]; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. So Cain went out from the Lord ’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,[f]east.
However, there are lessons to learn from the story of Cain and Abel, not to despise Cain or to blame Cain but for us to desist from the mistakes he made.
Give God your best: David said in 1 Chronicles 21:24 that, “he will not gift to God what does not cost him anything and this what we learnt from Abel, Abel gave the best of his cattle to God as a sacrifice and God was pleased with him and accepted Abel’s sacrifice while on the other hand, Cain just gave what pleases him to God rather than giving God the best of his crops and grains. As a child of God, we must give God what He only deserves. We should not give Him our left overs, We must honor Him with our best, what only He deserves. God sees and knows all we have at hand per time and He is the only one that can multiply whatever we gift to Him. We must strive to give God our best all the time.
Give to God from our hearts: Whenever it is time to give to God, we must give Him from our heart. Whatever we want to give to God must flow from a sincere and a thanksgiving heart, when we do this, we won’t have to doubt if what we are giving is small or not. As we read from the story, Abel gave God from a sincere and a joyful heart, that was why he never taught of giving God what was less than what He deserved. Whatever we do, comes from the heart. If Cain was thinking right and his mind was pleased with God, he would have offered a more pleasant sacrifice to God, but because his mind was not right with God, he just offered anything to God. The bible says we should guide our hearts with all diligence for out of it flows the issues of life. What happens in our reality is what we have conceived in our hearts. Let joy from your heart and be sincere in your dealings.
Rebuke the spirit of jealousy: If you are opportune to see what another person is offering to God either in thanksgiving or tithe, never get to the point where you start getting jealous of what the next person is giving. Jealousy brings bitterness against one another, it may not be only in the area of sacrifice, in every area of one’s life we must rebuke the spirit of jealousy, because it is a sin and will hinder one’s prayers from been answered, jealousy brings hatred and hatred can lead to killing just like Cain did to his brother in the story.
Always ask God for forgiveness :  Whenever you fall short of God’s glory do not hesitate to ask Him to forgive you. Remember, punishment does not mean repentance. God punishes those whom He loves, but we must ask God to forgive us. One thing that was not stated in the story was, if Cain asked God to forgive him, despite Cain having an opportunity to talk to God about the curse God laid on him, it was not stated he repented and asked God to forgive him. Whenever it is clear to us that God is correcting us from our bad ways, we must ask God to forgive us of the trespasses so that we can favor in His eyes.
Rebuke the spirit of anger: The first issue Cain had was anger against his brother, then anger against God. Cain did not deal with the spirit of anger in him, rather he allowed the spirit of anger in him to grow into jealousy where he later killed his brother. Abel did not do anything against Cain, but Cain was just angry Abel’s sacrifice was accepted while his own was rejected. Instead of getting angry with a neighbor or friend doing well, why not thank God for them and even learn from them so that you can get better too. Spirit of anger will only make things worse and not solve anything. We must identify when anger is setting in our lives and we must rebuke it fervently.

Alright, so from these search results, I've gathered some basic information about Cain and Abel. They were the first two sons of Adam and Eve. Cain was a farmer, and Abel was a shepherd. They both made sacrifices to God, but God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's. This made Cain angry, and eventually, he killed Abel. God punished Cain by making him a wanderer on the earth.

Now, the question is about how this negative example of Cain sheds light on the gospel plan. I need to connect this old testament story to the gospel, which is about Jesus Christ and salvation through him.

First, maybe I should understand why God favored Abel's sacrifice and not Cain's. According to one of the sources, God saw the heart behind each offering. Abel's heart was pure and faithful, while Cain's was not. This suggests that God looks at the motivation and attitude behind our actions, not just the actions themselves.

In the context of the gospel, this relates to the idea that salvation is not about outward deeds or following rules, but about having a genuine faith and relationship with God. Abel's sacrifice was acceptable because his heart was right with God, whereas Cain's was not.

Perhaps this story illustrates the difference between faith and works. Abel's sacrifice was an expression of his faith and obedience to God, while Cain's was more about performing a ritual without the proper heart attitude. In the gospel, salvation is by faith in Jesus Christ, not by our own works or efforts.

Moreover, Cain's anger and jealousy led him to commit murder, which is a serious sin. This shows the destructive power of sin and how it can consume a person if not dealt with properly. In the gospel, Jesus came to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. Through his death and resurrection, he provided a way for us to be reconciled to God and freed from the power of sin.

Another aspect is God's warning to Cain: "sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." This shows that God gave Cain a chance to overcome his sinful desires, but Cain chose to give in to them instead. Similarly, in the gospel, Jesus calls us to resist sin and follow him, promising to give us the strength to do so through his Spirit.

Furthermore, after Cain sinned by killing Abel, he tried to hide his罪 and even lie to God about it. This reminds me of the concept of guilt and denial that often accompanies sin. In the gospel, confession and repentance are essential for forgiveness and restoration with God.

God's punishment of Cain by making him a wanderer can be seen as a separation from God's presence and blessings. This echoes the idea that sin separates us from God, and the gospel offers reconciliation and restoration of that relationship.

Additionally, God showed mercy to Cain by placing a mark on him to protect him from being killed by others. This demonstrates God's grace and compassion even towards those who have sinned greatly. In the gospel, God's grace is extended to all who believe in Jesus, regardless of their past sins.

Moreover, the story of Cain and Abel foreshadows the ongoing conflict between the descendants of Cain and Seth (Adam and Eve's third son), which eventually led to the flood. This can be seen as a symbol of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, which is central to the gospel message of redemption and victory over evil through Jesus Christ.

In summary, the negative example of Cain sheds light on the gospel plan in several ways:

1. It highlights the importance of having a sincere heart and faith in God, rather than just performing religious rituals or good deeds.

2. It illustrates the destructive nature of sin and the need for salvation from its power and consequences.

3. It shows God's warnings and opportunities for repentance, similar to how Jesus calls people to turn from their sins and follow him.

4. It underscores the theme of separation from God due to sin and the gospel's offer of reconciliation and restoration.

5. It demonstrates God's grace and mercy even towards those who have committed grave sins, as seen in his provision of a way of salvation through Jesus Christ.

Therefore, the story of Cain and Abel serves as a powerful illustration of the human condition and the need for the gospel of Jesus Christ to save us from our sins and restore our relationship with God.

\boxed{\text{The story of Cain and Abel illustrates the importance of faith over works, the destructive nature of sin, the need for repentance, and God's grace, all of which are central themes in the gospel plan.}}
