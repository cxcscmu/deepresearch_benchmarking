Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects our health. Hmm, climate change is a big topic, and health is broad too. Maybe I should start by understanding what climate change is and then see how it connects to health issues.

First things first, what is climate change? I think it's the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. So, it's not just about the Earth getting warmer, but also changes in precipitation, sea levels rising, and more extreme weather events. I remember hearing about greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trapping heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming, which is a part of climate change.

Now, how does this relate to health? Well, directly, warmer temperatures can lead to more heat-related illnesses, like heatstroke or dehydration, especially in areas that aren't used to high temperatures. And I've heard that extreme weather events, like hurricanes or floods, can cause injuries and disrupt access to clean water and healthcare services.

Also, probably vector-borne diseases are affected. For example, mosquitoes that carry diseases like malaria or dengue fever might spread to new areas as temperatures warm up. So, regions that were previously too cold for mosquitoes might become habitable for them, exposing new populations to these diseases.

Moreover, climate change can impact air quality. Things like increased wildfires due to droughts can lead to more particulate matter in the air, which is bad for respiratory health. And higher temperatures can worsen smog, which also affects breathing.

Agriculture might be affected too. Changes in temperature and precipitation can alter crop yields and food availability, potentially leading to malnutrition or foodborne illnesses if storage conditions are compromised.

Water scarcity is another issue. As some areas get drier, access to clean water decreases, which can lead to waterborne diseases from people resorting to contaminated sources.

Mental health is also a consideration. Events like hurricanes or prolonged droughts can cause stress, anxiety, and depression, especially for those who lose homes or livelihoods.

I should probably look into this more deeply. Maybe there are specific studies or reports that outline these impacts. Let me see if I can find some reliable sources to back up these thoughts.

Effects of climate change on human health
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The effects of climate change on human health include direct effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and loss of life, [1] as well as indirect effects, such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures or lack of access safe drinking water. [2] Climate change poses a wide range of risks to population health. [3] The three main categories of health risks include: (i) direct-acting effects (e.g. due to heat waves, extreme weather disasters), (ii) impacts mediated via climate-related changes in ecological systems and relationships (e.g. crop yields, mosquito ecology, marine productivity), and (iii) the more diffuse (indirect) consequences relating to impoverishment, displacement, and mental health problems.
More specifically, the relationship between health and heat (increased global temperatures) includes the following aspects: [4] exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves, heat-related mortality, impacts on physical activity and labour capacity and mental health. There is a range of climate-sensitive infectious diseases which may increase in some regions, such as mosquito-borne diseases, diseases from vibrio pathogens, cholera and some waterborne diseases.[4] Health is also acutely impacted by extreme weather events (floods, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires) through injuries, diseases and air pollution in the case of wildfires. Other health impacts from climate change include migration and displacement due rising sea levels; food insecurity and undernutrition,[4] reduced availability of drinking water, increased harmful algal blooms in oceans and lakes and increased ozone levels as an additional air pollutant during heatwaves. [5]
The health impacts of climate change are felt around the world but disproportionately affects disadvantaged populations, making their climate change vulnerability worse, especially in developing countries.[4] : 15  Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages, and together with older people, to extreme heat.[6]
The health effects of climate change are increasingly a matter of concern for the international public health policy community. Already in 2009, a publication in the well-known general medical journal the Lancet stated: "Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century". [7] This was re-iterated in 2015 by a statement of the World Health Organisation.[3] In 2019, the Australian Medical Association formally declared climate change a health emergency. [8]
Studies have found that communication on climate change is more likely to lead to engagement by the public if it is framed as a health concern, rather than just as an environmental matter. Health is one part of how climate change affects humans, together with aspects such as displacement and migration, security and social impacts.

Overview on causes and effects of climate change[edit]
This section is an excerpt from Climate change.[edit]
Contemporary climate change includes both global warming and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural causes. [9] Instead, they are caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane. Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Certain agricultural practices, industrial processes, and forest loss are additional sources. [10] Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it through to heat the Earth's surface. When the Earth emits that heat as infrared radiation the gases absorb it, trapping the heat near the Earth's surface. As the planet heats up it causes changes like the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, amplifying global warming. [11]
Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. [12] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. [13] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[14] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[15] Climate change threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, extreme heat, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can be a result. [16] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. [17] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include sea level rise, and warmer, more acidic oceans. [18]
Types of pathways affecting health[edit]
Illustration for the effect of climate change on human health.
Climate change is linked with health outcomes via three main pathways, mechanisms or risks: [19] : Figure 2 
Direct mechanisms or risks: changes in extreme weather and resultant increased storms, floods, droughts, heat waves (wildfires also fit here) [4]
Indirect mechanisms or risks: these are mediated through changes in the biosphere (eg, in the burden of disease and distribution of disease vectors, or food availability, water quality, air pollution, land use change, ecological change))
Social dynamics (age and gender, health status, socioeconomic status, social capital, public health infrastructure, mobility and conflict status)
These health risks have "social and geographical dimensions, are unevenly distributed across the world, and are influenced by social and economic development, technology, and health service provision". [19]
Overview of health impacts[edit]
General health impacts[edit]
The direct, indirect and social dynamic effects of climate change on health and wellbeing produce the following health impacts: cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, undernutrition, mental illness, allergies, injuries and poisoning.[19] : Figure 2 
Health and health care provision can also be impacted by the collapse of health systems due to climate-induced disasters such as flooding. Therefore, building health systems that are climate resilient is a priority. [20] [4] : 15 
Mental health impacts[edit]
This section is an excerpt from Effects of climate change on mental health.[edit]
Smoke in Sydney 's CBD from large bushfires (in 2019), affected some people's mental health in a direct way. The likelihood of bushfires is increased by climate change.
The effects of climate change on mental health and well-being can be rather negative, especially for vulnerable populations and those with pre-existing serious mental illness.[21] There are three broad pathways by which these effects can take place: directly, indirectly or via awareness. [22] The direct pathway includes stress related conditions being caused by exposure to extreme weather events, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Scientific studies have linked mental health outcomes to several climate-related exposures—heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires and floods. [23] The indirect pathway can be via disruption to economic and social activities, such as when an area of farmland is less able to produce food. The third pathway can be of mere awareness of the climate change threat, even by individuals who are not otherwise affected by it.
Mental health outcomes have been measured in several studies through indicators such as psychiatric hospital admissions, mortality, self-harm and suicide rates. Vulnerable populations and life stages include people with pre-existing mental illness, Indigenous peoples, children and adolescents .
The emotional responses to the threat of climate change can include eco-anxiety, ecological grief and eco-anger. While unpleasant, such emotions are often not harmful, and can be rational responses to the degradation of the natural world, motivating adaptive action. [24]
Assessing the exact mental health effects of climate change is difficult; increases in heat extremes pose risks to mental health which can manifest themselves in increased mental health-related hospital admissions and suicidality.[25] : 9 
Higher global temperatures and heat waves (direct risk)[edit]
Further information: Instrumental temperature record
Impacts of higher global temperatures will have ramifications for the following aspects: vulnerability to extremes of heat, exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves, heat and physical activity, change in labor capacity, heat and sentiment (mental health), heat-related mortality. [4] : 5 
The global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature show a warming of 1.09 °C (range: 0.95 to 1.20 °C) from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, based on multiple independently produced datasets. [26] : 5  The trend is faster since 1970s than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years. [26] : 8 
Exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves[edit]
Further information: Effects of climate change § Heatwaves
A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C is a threshold at which the resilience of human systems is no longer able to adequately cool the skin. [27]
Another impact that the warming global temperature has had is on the frequency and severity of heat waves. The effects of heatwaves on human health are generally worse in urban areas, due to the "heat island" effect. The heat island effect is when urban areas experience much higher temperatures that surrounding rural environments. This is caused by the extensive areas of treeless asphalt, along with many large heat-retaining buildings that physically block cooling breezes. [28]
The human response to heat stress can be hyperthermia, heat stroke and other harmful effects. Heat illness can relate to many of the organs and systems including: brain, heart, kidneys, liver, etc. [29] Heat waves have also resulted in epidemics of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent[when?] studies have shown that prolonged heat exposure, physical exertion, and dehydration are sufficient factors to developing CKD. [30] These cases are occurring across the world congruently with heat stress nephropathy.
A 2015 report revealed that the risk of dying from chronic lung disease during a heat wave was 1.8-8.2% higher compared to average summer temperatures. Bodily stress from heat also causes fluid loss, which disrupts pulmonary perfusion. In combination with higher pollutant concentrations, this leads to bronchial inflammation. A 2016 study found in people with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), increased indoor temperatures resulted in worsening breathlessness, cough, and sputum production. A 2009 study, conducted in New York, found a 7.6% increase in hospitalization rate for COPD patients for every 1 °C increase in temperatures above 29 °C. [28]
The human body requires evaporative cooling to prevent overheating, even with a low activity level.  With excessive ambient heat and humidity during heatwaves, adequate evaporative cooling might be compromised. Even under ideal conditions, sustained exposure to a wet-bulb temperature exceeding about 35 °C (95 °F) is fatal. As of 2020, only two weather stations had recorded 35 °C wet-bulb temperatures, and only very briefly, but the frequency and duration of these events is expected to rise with ongoing climate change. [31] [32] [33] Elderly populations and those with co-morbidities are at a significantly increased health risk from increased heat. [28]
Exposure to extreme heat "poses an acute health hazard, with  individuals older than 65 years, populations in urban environments, and people with health conditions being particularly at risk". [4]
A study that investigated 13,115 cities found that extreme heat exposure of a wet bulb globe temperature above 30 °C tripled between 1983 and 2016. It increased by ~50% when the population growth in these cities is not taken into account. Urban areas and living spaces are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, partly due to the urban heat island effect. [34] [35]
Heat-related mortality[edit]
Health experts warn that "exposure to extreme heat increases the risk of death from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory conditions and all-cause mortality. Heat-related deaths in people older than 65 years reached a record high of an estimated 345 000 deaths in 2019". [4] : 9 
Increasing access to indoor cooling (air conditioning) will help prevent heat-related mortality but current air conditioning technology is generally unsustainable as it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, peak electricity demand, and urban heat islands.[4] : 17 
Heat and physical activity[edit]
High temperatures can reduce the frequency and duration of physical activity as well as the desire to engage in exercise. [4] : 7 
The higher temperatures may have a substantial effect on human physiology and mental health. These effects may also be indirect: for example during the past four decades "the number of hours in which temperatures were too high for safe outdoor exercise" increased by an average loss of 3.7 hours for people in developing countries (low HDI country group). [4]
Change in labour capacity[edit]
High temperatures can affect people's ability to work. [4] : 8  Occupational heat exposure affects especially laborers in the agricultural sector of developing countries: It has been estimated that "295 billion hours of potential work were lost due to extreme heat exposure in 2020, with 79% of all losses in developing countries occurring in the agricultural sector. [4] : 8 
A study by NOAA from 2013 concluded that heat stress will reduce labor capacity considerably under current emissions scenarios. [36]
Extreme weather events other than heatwaves (direct risk)[edit]
Further information: Effects of climate change § Extreme weather events
A schematic showing the regions where more natural disasters will occur due to climate change.
Infectious disease often accompanies extreme weather events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). El Niño can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and flash floods.[37] Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature. [37]
Infectious disease often accompanies extreme weather events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. [38] Local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment.
Floods[edit]
Further information: Flood § Health effects
Floods have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well-being. Short term implications include mortalities, injuries and diseases, while long term implications include non-communicable diseases and psychosocial health aspects. [39]
This section is an excerpt from Effects of climate change § Floods.[edit]
Increased rainfall intensity due to climate change can worsen flooding. [40] Sea level rise further increases risks of flooding: if sea levels rise by a further 0.15 m, 20% more people will be exposed to a 1 in a 100 year coastal flood, assuming no population growth and no further adaptation. With an extra 0.75 m, this rises to a doubling of people exposed. [41]
It has been determined that climate change and variability have the potential to drastically impact human exposure to flood hazards, but this comes with a lot of uncertainty due to multiple climate models. [42] Similar to droughts, climate change has also been shown to have the potential to increase the frequency of bigger storm events. [43] This increase in the frequency of large storm events would alter existing Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves (IDF curves) due to the change in frequency, but also by lifting and steepening the curves in the future. [44]
Hurricanes and thunderstorms[edit]
Further information: Effects of climate change § Tropical cyclones and hurricanes
Stronger hurricanes create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish. [45] [46] Extreme weather also means stronger winds. These winds can carry vectors tens of thousands of kilometers, resulting in an introduction of new infectious agents to regions that have never seen them before, making the humans in these regions even more susceptible. [45]
Another result of hurricanes is increased rainwater, which promotes flooding. Hurricanes result in ruptured pollen grains, which releases respirable aeroallergens. Thunderstorms cause a concentration of pollen grains at the ground level, which causes an increase in the release of allergenic particles in the atmosphere due to rupture by osmotic shock. Around 20–30 minutes after a thunderstorm, there is an increased risk for people with pollen allergies to experience severe asthmatic exacerbations, due to high concentration inhalation of allergenic peptides. [28]

Due to climate change, tropical cyclones are likely to increase in intensity, cause increased rainfall, and have larger storm surges, but might also lead to fewer of them globally. Tropical cyclones may also intensify more rapidly, and occur at higher latitudes. These changes are driven by rising sea temperatures and increased maximum water vapour content of the atmosphere as the air heats up. The 2018 U.S. National Climate Change Assessment reported that "increases in greenhouse gases and decrease in air pollution have contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1970".
Tropical cyclones are known as hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific Ocean, typhoons in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and cyclones in the southern Pacific or the Indian Ocean.[47] Fundamentally, they are all the same type of storm.
Droughts[edit]
Many of the consequences of droughts have impacts on human health. This can be through destruction of food supply (loss of crop yields), malnutrition and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.[48]
This section is an excerpt from Effects of climate change § Droughts.[edit]
Climate change affects multiple factors associated with droughts, such as how much rain falls and how fast the rain evaporates again. Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand which will increase the severity and frequency of droughts around much of the world. [49] [50] Due to limitations on how much data is available about drought in the past, it is often impossible to confidently attribute droughts to human-induced climate change. Some areas however, such as the Mediterranean and California, already show a clear human signature. [51] Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion, and environmental protection efforts in many areas. [52]
In 2019 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a Special Report on Climate Change and Land. The main statements of the report include: [53] [54] In the years 1960 – 2013 the area of drylands in drought, increased by 1% per year. In the year 2015 around 500 million people lived in areas that was impacted by desertification in the years 1980s – 2000s. People who live in the areas affected by land degradation and desertification are "increasingly negatively affected by climate change".
Wildfires[edit]
Air pollution from a surface fire in the western desert of Utah (wildfires become more frequent and intense due to climate change).
Further information: Wildfire § Climate change effects, and Wildfire § Health effects
Climate change increases wildfire potential and activity. [55] Climate change leads to a warmer ground temperature and its effects include earlier snowmelt dates, drier than expected vegetation, increased number of potential fire days, increased occurrence of summer droughts, and a prolonged dry season.[56]
Warming spring and summer temperatures increase flammability of materials that make up the forest floors. [56] Warmer temperatures cause dehydration of these materials, which prevents rain from soaking up and dampening fires. Furthermore, pollution from wildfires can exacerbate climate change by releasing atmospheric aerosols, which modify cloud and precipitation patterns.
Wood smoke from wildfires produces particulate matter that has damaging effects to human health. [57] The primary pollutants in wood smoke are carbon monoxide and nitric oxide.[56] Through the destruction of forests and human-designed infrastructure, wildfire smoke releases other toxic and carcinogenic compounds, such as formaldehyde and hydrocarbons.[37] These pollutants damage human health by evading the mucociliary clearance system and depositing in the upper respiratory tract, where they exert toxic effects. [56]
The health effects of wildfire smoke exposure include exacerbation and development of respiratory illness such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder; increased risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma and tuberculosis; increased airway hyper-responsiveness; changes in levels of inflammatory mediators and coagulation factors; and respiratory tract infection.[57] It may also have intrauterine effects on fetal development, resulting in low birth weight newborns. [58] Because wildfire smoke travels and is often not isolated to a single geographic region, the health effects are widespread among populations. [37]
Climate-sensitive infectious diseases (indirect risk)[edit]
See also: Waterborne disease and climate change
Climate change is affecting the distribution of arthropodborne diseases (transmitted via mosquitos, ticks etc.), food-borne, and water-borne diseases. [4] : 12  Climate change results in changes to the climate suitability for infectious disease transmission as well as vulnerability to mosquito-borne diseases. Warming oceans and a changing climate result in extreme weather patterns which have brought about an increase of infectious diseases —both new and re-emerging. [45] [59]
This section is an excerpt from Climate change and infectious diseases.[edit]
Global climate change has resulted a wide range of impacts on the spread of infectious diseases. Like other climate change impacts on human health, climate change exacerbates existing inequalities and challenges in managing infectious disease. It also increases the likelihood of certain kinds of new infectious disease challenges. Infectious diseases whose transmission can be impacted by climate change include dengue fever, malaria, tick-borne disease, leishmaniasis, ebola. There is no direct evidence that the spread of COVID-19 is worsened or is caused by climate change, although investigations continue.
Documented infectious disease impacts of climate change, include increased malaria and dengue, which are expected to worsen as the global climate changes directly result in extreme weather conditions and higher temperatures. Not only will it propagate their spread, but climate change will probably bring forth new infectious diseases, [60] and change the epidemiology of many existing diseases.
Mosquito-borne diseases[edit]
Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include malaria, elephantiasis, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and dengue fever.[61] [62] [63] Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought. [61] [62] Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well,  shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates. [45] As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before. [45] As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world. [45]
Increased heat, generated by the buildup of carbon, has been found to help disease-carrying organisms such as mosquitos thrive by producing stable environments for them. A research organization known as Climate Central states "The land area of the U.S. most suitable for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes is projected to increase from 5 percent to about 50 percent by 2100, putting 60 percent of the northeastern U.S.' population at risk for the diseases carried by this mosquito, including West Nile virus, dengue and Zika." [64] An outbreak of diseases like the West Nile and Zika virus could trigger a crisis since it would cause severe illness in people as well as birth defects in infants. Less advanced countries would be especially affected as they may have very limited resources to combat an infestation.
Diseases from vibrio pathogens[edit]
The area of coastline with suitable conditions for vibrio bacteria has increased due changes in sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity caused by climate change. These pathogens can cause gastroenteritis, cholera, wound infections, and sepsis. It has been observed that in the period of 2011–21, the "area of coastline suitable for Vibrio bacterial transmission has increased by 35% in the Baltics, 25% in the Atlantic Northeast, and 4% in the Pacific Northwest. [4] : 12 
Cholera[edit]
The warming oceans are leading to more frequent cholera.[45] [63] [65] As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within zooplankton emerge from their dormant state. [65] The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing cholera outbreaks.[65] As flooding increases there is also an increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply. [66] El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly. [65] [66]
Parasites in warmer freshwater[edit]
Warmer freshwater due to global warming is increasing the presence of the amoeba Naegleria fowleri, in freshwater and the parasite Cryptosporidium in pools, and both can cause a severe disease. [67]
Zoonotic diseases[edit]
Climate change can facilitate outbreaks of zoonoses, i.e. diseases that pass from animals to humans. [68] One example of such outbreaks is the COVID-19 pandemic .
With regards to zoonotic diseases (e.g., diseases that pass from animals to humans), deforestation, climate change, and livestock agriculture are among the main causes of increased disease risk. [69] As of 2016, outbreaks have cost lives and financial losses amounting to billions dollars; future pandemics could cost trillions of dollars. [69]
Diseases from ticks[edit]
Ticks are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate. [70] The black legged tick, a carrier of Lyme disease, when not feeding, spends its time burrowed in soil absorbing moisture. [46] [71] Ticks die when the climate either becomes too cold or when the climate becomes too dry, causing the ticks to dry out. [46] [71] The natural environmental controls that used to keep the tick populations in check are disappearing, and warmer and wetter climates are allowing the ticks to breed and grow at an alarming rate, resulting in an increase in Lyme disease, both in existing areas and in areas where it has not been seen before. [46] [70]
Other infectious diseases[edit]
Other diseases on the rise due to extreme weather include hantavirus,[72] schistosomiasis,[62] [63] onchocerciasis (river blindness), [63] and tuberculosis.[59] It also  causes the rise in hay fever, as when the weather gets warmer there is a rise in pollen levels in the air. [73] [74]
Food and drinking water availability (indirect risk)[edit]
Food insecurity and undernutrition[edit]
Further information: Effects of climate change on agriculture and Effects of climate change on oceans
Climate change has impacts on terrestrial and marine food security and undernutrition. Food insecurity is increasing (some of the underlying causes are related to climate change, for example an increase in extreme weather events, pests and pathogens)[75] and has affected 2 billion people in 2019. [4] : 13 
Terrestrial food insecurity[edit]
Over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality due to climate change. [76] [77]
Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide may reduce the nutritional quality of some crops. [78] Elevated CO 2 may reduce the nutritional values of crops, with for instance wheat having less protein and less of some minerals. [79] Studies have shown that increases in CO 2 lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop and non-crop plants with negative consequences for human nutrition, [80] including decreased B vitamins in rice. [81] [82]
Climate change induced drought stress in Africa will likely lead to a reduction in the nutritional quality of the common bean. [83] Studies have also shown that higher CO 2 levels lead to reduced plant uptake of nitrogen (and a smaller number showing the same for trace elements such as zinc) resulting in crops with lower nutritional value. [84] [85] This would primarily impact on populations in poorer countries less able to compensate by eating more food, more varied diets, or possibly taking supplements.
Marine food insecurity[edit]
A headline finding in 2021 regarding marine food security stated that: "In 2018–20, nearly 70% of countries showed increases in average sea surface temperature in their territorial waters compared with in 2003–05, reflecting an increasing threat to their marine food productivity and marine food security". [4] : 14 
With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with climate change. Increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans.
Reduced availability of drinking water[edit]

As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh underground water and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming.
Fifty percent of the world's fresh water consumption is dependent glacial runoff. [86] Earth's glaciers are expected to melt within the next forty years, greatly decreasing fresh water flow in the hotter times of the year, causing everyone to depend on rainwater, resulting in large shortages and fluctuations in fresh water availability which largely effects agriculture, power supply, and human health and well-being. [37] Many power sources and a large portion of agriculture rely on glacial runoff in the late summer.  "In many parts of the world, disappearing mountain glaciers and droughts will make fresh, clean water for drinking, bathing, and other necessary human (and livestock) uses scarce" and a valuable commodity. [37]
Water management[edit]
Climate change poses a threat to our current systems for water management, which in turn poses a threat to the availability of drinking water. Traditional water management systems use rely heavily on the assumption of stationarity. Stationarity in water management is “the idea that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability.” [87] The significant anthropogenically induced change in Earth's climate has altered hydrologic stationarity, changing the means and extremes of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge rates. [88] [87] [89] [90] Traditionally, water plans are based on historic data, such as streamflow data and historic precipitation rates. [91] With the variability of climate change, many of these models are rendered ineffective. For example, in the Colorado basin, there has been an observed increase in high and low stream flow by 24% when compared to historic data. [90] This increase variability in the water cycle has the potential to render traditional methods of water planning and management ineffective, leading to shortage of drinking water supply. [92]
Water quality[edit]
Water quality can be affected by climate change in several ways. In some regions, climate change will drive an increase in precipitation. The increasing volume of water has the potential to overwhelm sewer systems and water treatment plants, resulting in contaminated water entering municipal water supplies. [93] [94] Moreover, heavy downpours can increase runoff into surface water bodies. Runoff contaminants may include sediments, nutrients, pollutants, animal excrement, and other harmful materials. The increase in runoff into surface waters can result in a degradation of water quality. [93] [95] In addition, freshwater resources along the coastline are at risk of saltwater contamination. As the sea level rises with climate change, saltwater will move into freshwater areas, contaminating drinking water supplies. [94] [93] Moreover, the increase in water consumption in regions of drought can cause salt waters to infiltrate further upstream as freshwater is drained from rivers and reservoirs upstream. The increase in droughts can lead to saltwater contamination in once-reliable freshwater sources. [93] [95]
Water treatment[edit]
In areas of increased flooding and precipitation, water treatment plants will not be able to keep up with the increased water volume, leading to contamination. [93] On the other end of the spectrum, the increase in droughts and temperatures can result in lower streamflow, therefore treatment will have to be increased to meet minimum flow requirements in some regions. [93] On top of this, rising sea levels from climate change can damage infrastructure and reduce treatment efficiency. [93] As water treatment becomes less effective, water-borne diseases will become more prevalent.
Water related illnesses[edit]

Climate change increases the risk of illness via "increasing temperature, more frequent heavy rains and runoff, and the effects of storms". [96]
Displacement and migration (social dynamics)[edit]
1:28
A video summarizing the interplay between global warming and Wet-bulb temperature (global warming and wet bulb temperatures might make the tropics uninhabitable).
Humanitarian crises are ever increasingly impacted by climate change in areas where climate hazards interact with high climate change vulnerability. Climate change is driving displacement throughout all regions of the world, but small island states have been disproportionately affected. In areas such as Africa, Central, and South America, flood and drought-related food insecurities have increased. [97]
Warming above 1.5 degrees can make tropical regions uninhabitable, because the threshold of 35 degrees of wet bulb temperature (the limit of human adaptation to heat and humidity), will be passed. [27] 43% of the human population live in the tropics. [98]
This section is an excerpt from Climate migrant.[edit]
Climate migrants are a subset of environmental migrants who were forced to flee "due to sudden or gradual alterations in the natural environment related to at least one of three impacts of climate change: sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and drought and water scarcity ." [99] Climate change is often described as a threat multiplier that compounds crises over time and space. [100] The United Nations Global Compact on Refugees states that “while not in themselves causes of refugee movements, climate, environmental degradation, and natural disasters increasingly interact with the drivers of refugee movements.” [101] Still, climate migration relates to matters of political instability, conflict, and national security. First, displaced people may be relocated to regions geographically vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. [100] Second, there are both short- and long-term effects of climate change. The cumulative impact of longer-term effects may lead to political conflict, insurrection, poverty, and other socioeconomic disparities. [102]
This section is an excerpt from Effects of climate change § Displacement and migration.[edit]
Climate change affects displacement of people in several ways. Firstly, involuntary displacement may increase through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats. Effects of climate change such as desertification and rising sea levels gradually erode livelihood and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. On the other hand, some households may fall (further) into poverty due to climate change, limiting their ability to move to areas less affected. [103]
Other health risks from climate change[edit]
Harmful algal blooms in oceans and lakes[edit]
See also: Harmful algal bloom
The warming oceans and lakes are leading to more frequent harmful algal blooms.[45] [63] [65] Also, during droughts, surface waters are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms. [104] Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. [105]
One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called domoic acid which is responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning.[106] [107] The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater CO 2 concentrations associated with ocean acidification. [106] Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; Ciguatera fish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning. [106]
Ozone as an air pollutant[edit]
Further information: Ozone § Ozone air pollution, and Ozone § Low level ozone in urban areas
Ozone pollution in urban areas is especially concerning with increasing temperatures, raising heat-related mortality during heat waves.[108] During heat waves in urban areas, ground level ozone pollution can be 20% higher than usual. [109]
One study concluded that from 1860 to 2000, the global population-weighted fine particle concentrations increased by 5% and near-surface ozone concentrations by 2% due to climate change. [110]
Ozone pollution has many well-known health effects: [111] [112]
(1) Ozone can cause adverse effects to the respiratory system such as shortness of breath and inflammation of the airways in the general population
(2) Long term exposure to ozone is likely one of the many causes of asthma development
(3) Ozone exposure is a potential cause of premature deaths
Carbon dioxide levels and human cognition[edit]
Higher levels of indoor and outdoor CO 2 levels may impair human cognition. [113] [114] [115]
Drowning accidents from higher winter temperatures[edit]
Researchers found that there is a strong correlation between higher winter temperatures and drowning accidents in large lakes, because the ice gets thinner and weaker. [116]
Pollen allergies[edit]
A minor further effect are increases of pollen season lengths and concentrations in some regions of the world which can affect people with pollen allergies.[117] [118] [119]
Armed conflicts induced by climate hazards[edit]
Climate change may have influence on the risk of violent conflict, including organized armed conflict. Evidence shows links between armed conflict and variations in temperature: conflict incidence substantially increases during warmer periods. [120] Climate change is predicted to diminish natural resource availability. [121] Water scarcity, food shortages, and decreased livelihoods may lead to an increase in desperate populations, enhancing the risk of intra and interstate conflicts. [121] Climate hazards are a driving force of involuntary migration with a growing impact and a potential important contributor to violent conflicts even though the importance is small compared to other factors such as culture, politics, and economy. Climate hazards are associated with increased violence against vulnerable groups and the mitigation could potentially exacerbate violent conflicts.  Future increases in violent-conflict-related deaths induced by climate change have been estimated at conflict-prone region.
Potential health benefits[edit]
Health co-benefits from mitigation and adaptation[edit]
The health benefits (also called "co-benefits") from climate change mitigation measures are predicted to be signification: potential measures can not only mitigate future health impacts from climate change but also improve health directly. [122] Climate change mitigation is interconnected with various co-benefits (such as reduced air pollution and associated health benefits) [123] and how it is carried out (in terms of e.g. policymaking) could also determine its impacts on living standards (whether and how inequality and poverty are reduced). [124]
There are many health co-benefits associated with climate action. These include those of cleaner air, healthier diets (e.g. less red meat), more active lifestyles, and increased exposure to green urban spaces. [4] : 26  Access to urban green spaces provides benefits to mental health as well. [4] : 18 
Compared with the current pathways scenario (with regards to greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation efforts), the "sustainable pathways scenario" will likely result in an annual reduction of 1.18 million air pollution-related deaths, 5.86 million diet-related deaths, and 1.15 million deaths due to physical inactivity, across the nine countries, by 2040. These benefits were attributable to the mitigation of direct greenhouse gas emissions and the commensurate actions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, as well as improved diets and safe physical activity. [125] Air pollution generated by fossil fuel combustion is both a major driver of global warming and the cause of a large number of annual deaths with some estimates as high as 8.7 million excess deaths during 2018. [126] [127]
Placing health as a key focus of the Nationally Determined Contributions could present an opportunity to increase ambition and realize health co-benefits. [125] Some politicians, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger with his slogan "terminate pollution", say that activists should generate optimism by focusing on the health co-benefits of climate action. [128]
Potential health benefits from global warming[edit]
It has been projected that climate change will bring some benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa.[129] : 48  Benefits are projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures, especially in developing countries .
Global estimates[edit]
In 2021 more than 230 medical journals issued a statement saying that climate change already severely hurts human health, including by: "an increase in heat deaths, dehydration and kidney function loss, skin cancer, tropical infections, mental health issues, pregnancy complications, allergies, and heart and lung disease, and deaths associated with them". A 1.5 degree temperature rise with biodiversity loss will cause a catastrophic damage. They called to not allow such temperature rise and stop biodiversity loss. [130]
Estimating deaths (mortality) or DALYs (morbidity) from the effects of climate change at the global level is very difficult. A 2014 study by the World Health Organization tried to do this and estimated the effect of climate change on human health, but not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates. [131] For example, the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded. They did assess deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood undernutrition. The authors estimated that climate change was projected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 but also stated that "these numbers do not represent a prediction of the overall impacts of climate change on health, since we could not quantify several important causal pathways". [131]
Climate change was responsible for 3% of diarrhoea, 3% of malaria, and 3.8% of dengue fever deaths worldwide in 2004. [132] Total attributable mortality was about 0.2% of deaths in 2004; of these, 85% were child deaths. The effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded from this study.
Policy responses[edit]
Due to its significant impact on human health, [133] [134] climate change has become a major concern for public health policy. The United States Environmental Protection Agency had issued a 100-page report on global warming and human health back in 1989. [135] [136] By the early years of the 21st century, climate change was increasingly addressed as a public health concern at a global level, for example in 2006 at Nairobi by UN secretary general Kofi Annan. Since 2018, factors such as the 2018 heat wave, the Greta effect and the October 2018 IPPC  1.5 °C report further increased the urgency for responding to climate change as a global health issue. [135] [137] [74]
While a matter of international and national concern,  health impacts from climate change have been described as "inherently local". [137] For example,  a city may be adjacent to the sea and suffer a heat island effect, so may have considerably different climate related health concerns to a nearby small town located only 20 miles inland. [137] The health impact of climate change are expected to rise in line with predicted ongoing global warming. [138] [135]
The 2015 Lancet "Commission on Health and Climate Change" concluded that "tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of this century". [19]
Economic development is an important component of possible adaptation to climate change. Economic growth on its own, however, is not sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change. [139] Future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change, but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in society. [140] For example, in the 19th century, rapid urbanization in western Europe led to health plummeting. [140] Other factors important in determining the health of populations include education, the availability of health services, and public-health infrastructure.[139]
Climate-sensitive health system resilience[edit]
The World Bank suggested that climate-sensitive health system resilience should be increased through investment in two areas: [141]
Health system strengthening to improve resilience and build capacity to prepare for the varied environmental impacts and health impacts caused by climate change (for example early warning systems, disaster preparedness systems); and
Programmatic (e.g., disease-specific, nutrition-focused) responses to address the changing burden of disease related to climate change.
Society and culture[edit]
Health equity and climate justice[edit]
Much of the health burden associated with climate change falls on vulnerable people (e.g. coastline inhabitants, indigenous peoples, economically disadvantaged communities). Often these people will  have made a disproportionately low contribution toward man-made global warming, thus leading to concerns over climate justice.[142] [74] [135] Climate change can worsen the existing, often enormous, health problems, especially in the poorer parts of the world.
Climate communication[edit]
Further information: Individual action on climate change
Studies have found that when communicating climate change with the public, it can help encourage engagement if it is framed as a health concern, rather than as an environmental issue. This is especially the case when comparing a health related framing to one that emphasised environmental doom, as was common in the media at least up until 2017. [143] [144]

Our health is closely linked to the environment we live in. However, our climate is changing, with significant consequences for our health, wellbeing and safety.
Climate change is a change in the world’s weather systems that occurs over decades. Most of the recent changes in our climate have been brought about by human activity. Without intervention, the changing climate will have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences for our state, the country and the rest of the world. It is an urgent problem with implications at the global, national, community and personal level.
The good news is that there are simple things we can all do now to build our resilience to the effects of climate change and help slow its pace. Many of these actions will also directly benefit our health, the environment and our wallets.
Climate change
Climate change is caused by increases in the amount of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere, which cause the earth’s average temperature to rise.
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, raising air and sea temperatures. They are primarily produced through the burning of fossil fuels (like coal) for electricity generation, as well as through agricultural, mining, land management and transport practices.
The effects of climate change are already being felt. Because of global warming, Australia’s climate has warmed on average by 1.4°C since official Bureau of Meteorology records began in 1910.
In Victoria, the average temperature has increased by just over 1.0°C across the state since 1910. With this amount of warming, Victoria is already experiencing:
an increase in the frequency of days of extreme heat
an increase in dangerous fire weather and length of fire seasons
a decline in cool season rainfall, resulting in the lowest streamflow on record over the past decades
a rise in sea levels.
In recent decades, Victoria's climate has changed by becoming warmer and drier. Victorian climate projections by the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology suggest these changes will continue into the future. Climate projections for Victoria suggest:
further increases in the number of very hot days and extreme heat
the number of very high fire danger days increasing and the fire season being prolonged
average annual rainfalls decreasing and a continuous decline in streamflow affecting the health of waterways and Victorian water supplies
extreme rainfall being of a higher intensity, potentially increasing the risk of flash flooding in some locations
coastal sea levels continuing to rise.
Most of Victoria’s population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast. Rising sea levels and storm surges will increase risks of flooding and erosion, endangering life, damaging property and causing ecosystem damage that may affect agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism.

Climate change has been described by the World Health Organization as the biggest threat to health in the 21st century – it affects health and wellbeing in many ways:
Directly, by the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events (such as heatwaves, floods and bushfires); and
Indirectly, through worsening air quality, changes in the spread of infectious diseases, threats to food and water and effects on mental health.
Climate change will also impact certain parts of the economy with increased unemployment, financial stress, food insecurity, and rising social inequalities.
Who is most at risk of health effects due to climate change?
Some people are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and health:
Children are vulnerable for several reasons. For example, children are more susceptible to heat stress and dehydration and are more sensitive to exposure to air pollution and smoke from bushfires. Their immune systems are not fully developed, putting them at increased risk of infections. They often need to rely on adults to keep them safe during emergencies and help them to recover afterwards.
Pregnant women are at increased risk of heat stress during heatwaves due to the physiological demands of pregnancy. They and their unborn babies are particularly sensitive to exposure to air pollution and smoke from bushfires.
Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions are more prone to dehydration, heat stress, infections and exacerbation of heart and lung disease.
People living in rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people on low incomes and other vulnerable populations are also at increased risk, in part due to inequalities in underlying health outcomes and limited accessibility of healthcare and other services. People living in rural or remote communities or along the coast are also at risk from extreme events such as bushfires, droughts, storms and sea level rises.
Extreme weather events
The effects of climate change are already being felt through more frequent and increasingly severe extreme weather events such as floods, severe storms and heatwaves.

How to cope and stay safe in extreme heat
Over the last century, average temperatures in Australia have increased and heatwaves have become longer, hotter and more frequent. This trend is expected to continue as the world gets even warmer. You can stay healthy in the heat by:
drinking plenty of water
never leaving anyone in a car
staying somewhere cool
planning ahead
checking in on others.
Read more about how to cope and stay safe in extreme heat.
Stay safe from mosquito bites
Warmer average temperatures can mean earlier spring seasons, longer warm seasons, shorter winters, hotter summers and more frequent flooding events. As a result, conditions may become more hospitable for mosquitoes that can carry diseases such as Ross River virus disease and Murray Valley encephalitis.
You can protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites by:
wearing loose-fitting clothing when outdoors
using mosquito repellents containing DEET or picaridin on exposed skin
trying to limit outdoor activity if lots of mosquitoes are about
making sure there is no stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed around your home
ensuring your house is properly fitted with mosquito netting or screens.
Read about more ways to Beat the Bite!
Avoid risks from floods and minimise health risks in natural waterways
Warmer temperatures can result in a number of health risks to swimmers, including exposure to toxins from blue-green algal blooms, which are expected to become more frequent with climate change.
You can minimise these risks by:
avoiding swimming at beaches or in waterways after heavy rainfall events, including floods
looking out for any water quality advisories following flooding events or in response to blue-green algal blooms
checking the EPA’s Summer water quality website for water quality forecasts for 36 beaches in Port Phillip Bay and four sites along the Yarra River over the summer months.
Learn more about avoiding risks from flooding and beach water quality.
Be a healthy swimmer
Cryptosporidiosis outbreaks associated with swimming pools are expected to become more common due to increased patronage of swimming pools on hot days. Follow these healthy swimming tips to keep the water clean:
Do not swim if you have had diarrhoea in the past 14 days.
Shower and wash thoroughly (especially your bottom) before you swim.
Wash your hands thoroughly after going to the toilet.
Avoid swallowing water while swimming.
Inform the pool operator if you become ill after swimming in the pool.
Get more healthy swimming tips.
Be aware of air pollution
Many factors affect the quality of the air that we breathe:
Burning fossil fuels releases pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter into the air.
The interaction of air pollution and sunlight produces ozone. While ozone in the upper atmosphere helps to protect us from UV radiation, breathing in ozone at ground level can trigger asthma attacks and breathing problems.
Air quality is adversely affected by bushfires, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity due to climate change.
Climate change is expected to increase the length of pollen seasons in some areas and may also result in increased growth and pollen production in some plant species. Pollen can cause allergic reactions such as hay fever in some individuals.
You can minimise your risk of exposure to air pollution and poor-quality air by:
checking the VicEmergency website or downloading the app and setting up a ‘watch zone’ to find out about any bushfires (or other extreme events) in your local area
checking the air quality in your area on EPA’s AirWatch website
during the grass pollen season (October through December), checking the pollen forecast for stations around Victoria on the Melbourne Pollen website or via the Melbourne Pollen Count mobile app.
Other suggestions for days of poor air quality include:
plan (or postpone) any outdoor activities accordingly
avoid or limit vigorous physical activity
if you have a pre-existing lung or heart condition (including asthma) take your medication, and follow your treatment plan.
Read more about air pollution and reducing harm from bushfire smoke.
Keep food safe
Higher temperatures increase the risk of food-borne infections such as gastroenteritis (gastro), caused by increased growth of pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli.
Read more about Food safety and storage, Food safety outdoors, and Food safety for summer celebrations.
Look after your mental health
Aside from its effects on physical health, climate change may adversely affect the mental health of many Australians. Extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and bushfires can lead to psychological distress due to trauma, illness, loss of loved ones, destruction of property and displacement, and disruption of communities, goods and services.
Getting help and support for mental health issues early can make a big difference to getting the right treatment or assistance for your needs.
Actions to reduce your contribution to climate change
Individual action can make a difference. If we each make changes, together this adds up to collective action that makes an even bigger difference.

There are plenty of positive things you can do to help slow or reduce climate change, which will also benefit your health, including:
Increasing your use of ‘active transport’ (such as walking and cycling) can help to reduce your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, and musculoskeletal conditions.
Reducing your reliance on cars by using active transport or public transport will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, helping to reduce rates of lung cancer and other lung conditions (including asthma), heart disease and stroke.
Eating a diet rich in plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains, and with fewer animal-based foods is good for your health and the environment.
As part of a well-balanced, regular diet and a healthy, active lifestyle, eating the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables for men and women every day can help you reduce obesity and maintain a healthy weight, lower your cholesterol and lower your blood pressure.
Reducing your consumption of high kilojoule processed foods will help to reduce excess energy consumption and reduce the environmental impacts associated with these foods. Processed foods are generally high in saturated fat, added sugars or salt, take more energy to produce and are usually packaged, which contributes to landfill waste.
Drinking tap water. Victoria has some of the world’s best drinking water. Drinking tap water over bottled water or sugary drinks is better for your health and the environment, and it’s a lot cheaper too.
Cooling and heating your home efficiently will help you remain comfortable all year round, and save on energy.
These benefits are not only important for the health of our communities, but also help to reduce demands on the health system.

Climate Change and Health
January 6, 2022
Climate change refers to the increase in air temperatures and changing weather patterns observed over the past several decades. The changing climate is impacting the health of people around the world in a myriad of ways.
What causes climate change?
Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are created by burning fuel, livestock farming, destruction of forests, plastic production, and other sources. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing overall increased temperatures as well as changing weather patterns.
Climate vs. Weather
Weather (what you experience)
Climate (long-term patterns)
A hot day in July.
Longer, hotter summers.
No rain all week.
Year-long drought and water shortages.
Snow in May.
Changing seasonal patterns.
Extreme hot and cold temperatures, air pollution, ecosystem changes, and extreme weather events like storms and wildfires are increasingly common and can be harmful to your health.
What are the health effects of climate change?
Climate change contributes to the risk of:
Stroke and heart attacks
Asthma and allergies
Mental health conditions
Dehydration
Heat-related illnesses
Food-borne illnesses
Malnutrition due to food supply problems
Insect-borne diseases like Lyme and West Nile
Missed work and school due to extreme weather events
Injuries from extreme weather events, flooding, and property damage
Who is most at risk from the effects of climate change?
Children are less able to regulate their body temperature, making them more susceptible to illnesses associated with extreme heat and cold. Climate change is increasing the number of poor air quality days, which in turn increases the risk of asthma attacks in children. Asthma and extreme weather events both contribute to an increase in the number of missed days of school. An estimated 88% of illness from climate change occurs in children under 5 years old.
Pregnant people who experience climate-associated extreme heat and air pollution are at increased risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, and having infants who are low birth weight.  Air pollutants can cross the placenta and contribute to gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Pregnant people of color and those with asthma are most at risk from the impacts of climate change.
Extreme heat during pregnancy can be a risk factor
People who work or exercise outside experience greater exposures to air pollutants, extreme temperature, insect-borne illnesses, and other climate change effects.
People with chronic illnesses like diabetes and diseases of the heart, lung, and brain are more likely to be impacted by climate-associated air pollution, extreme temperatures, and stress. Some medications used to treat these illnesses increase sensitivity to heat.
Low-income and communities of color are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses that worsen the impacts of climate change. Low-income communities are less likely to have access to air conditioning and heat, leading to exposure to extreme temperatures. These populations tend to live in neighborhoods that have substandard housing and less protection from extreme weather events like hurricanes and flooding.
How can I protect myself and my family from the health impacts of climate change?
Choose locally grown food and eat less meat
Talk to your healthcare provider about your specific health concerns and climate change.
Monitor real-time air quality using apps like AirNow.
Limit time outdoors if the air quality is poor.
Protect yourself from insect bites.
Stay hydrated and seek shade during hot weather months.
Talk to your doctor to find out if there’s a need to adjust your medications.
Develop an emergency plan for extreme weather events at www.ready.gov.
Choose locally grown food and eat less meat.
Plant trees and support local parks and green spaces.
Encourage laws that reduce carbon emissions.
Choose companies that use energy from the wind and sun.
Carpool, take public transportation, walk, or bike.
Bring reusable bags when you shop and reduce the use of plastics.
Support local climate and health preparedness and programs.
How we’re studying climate change at Mount Sinai
From extreme temperature events to structural racism
Dr. Perry Sheffield
Dr. Perry Sheffield is a board-certified pediatrician who studies the effects of climate change and associated extreme temperatures and weather events on human health, specifically children and workers. A recent paper by Dr. Sheffield and a team of researchers examined health inequities among children affected by both climate change and structural racism. This report details how climate injustice, which perpetuates inequities in exposure to air pollution, traffic, and poor infrastructure, contributes to adverse child health outcomes. This work aimed to provide clinicians with tools to promote healthy behaviors in the clinic, become advocates for their patients, and use their position to address existing structural issues.
Dr. Sheffield’s research has also shown that while very young children are most at risk for heat-related illness, older children and adolescents are also adversely impacted.
Dr. Sheffield is also studying the adverse impacts of extreme weather events on communities, finding that toxic exposures that results from Hurricane Harvey disproportionately affected low-socioeconomic status (SES) communities. This study, conducted with Bian Liu, PhD, and other collaborators, found that while all toxic sites in Houston were equally vulnerable to flooding, toxic releases were more common in low-SES communities. This work is vital to understanding how climate change-related weather events exacerbate existing health inequities in low-SES communities.
Dr. Emily Senay
In 2022, together with Dr. Emily Senay, Dr. Sheffield serves as course director for the annual Clinical Climate Change Conference hosted by the Institute for Exposomic Research. Founded by Dr. Senay in 2019, it is now in its 4 th year. This annual CME event is aimed at a broad audience of allied health professionals seeking to understand the health effects of the climate crisis and improve patient outcomes. It aims to provide learners with up-to-date, clinically relevant evidence-based information.
Harnessing satellite data to go back in time
Dr. Allan Just studies children’s environmental health, environmental epigenomics, endocrine-disruptors, and air pollution. Using satellite data, he is able to recreate historical temperature and air pollutant exposures to identify climate-related exposures that occurred during pregnancy, early childhood, and other vulnerable periods.
Dr. Allan Just
Together with Dr. Itai Kloog and Dr. Maayan Yitshak-Sade, Dr. Just recently published a study that found associations between exposures to heat and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and lower birth weight. Pregnant people were most vulnerable during early and late pregnancy. Climate change is causing higher daily temperatures and longer heat waves; understanding the impacts is essential for adapting programs and policies that lead to better pregnancy outcomes.
Dr. Just also contributed to a study that found that an association between heat and elevated ischemic stroke risk, with hypertension increasing vulnerability to hemorrhagic stroke associated with changes in temperature. As heat waves and extreme weather events become more common due to climate change, this work is vital to protect vulnerable populations at risk of stroke.

The effects of global warming and climate change
The effects of global warming and climate change
Introduction
Global climate change is now widely recognised as one of the foremost – perhaps the foremost – environmental challenge of the 21 st century.  The evidence for human influence on climate change through emissions of greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning, and methane from various sources), is now very strong.  Climate change has importance for health in two main ways.  First, some degree of climate change now appears inevitable, which means it is necessary to learn to adapt to climate change and to consider how to protect the population against its adverse effects.  Those adverse effects include direct effects of extreme weather, changes in the frequency, distribution or burden of ‘climate-sensitive‘ diseases, and indirect effects operating through such mechanisms as changes to crop production and water availability.  At the same time, major changes are needed in all sections of the economy to try to reduce human influence on climate change through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation ). This implies substantial changes in energy use, transportation and in other sectors, which themselves are likely to have effects on health, for example through reduction of toxic air pollutants if dependence on the burning of fossil fuels is reduced.
Key definitions and terms
Adaptation
Strategies, policies and measures undertaken now and in the future to reduce potential adverse impacts of climate change.
Climate
The average state of the atmosphere and the underlying land or water in a specific region over a specified time scale (usually longer term).  Should be distinguished from weather, which is the atmospheric conditions at a specific place and time, usually the day to day variations.
Climate change
A statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its measurable variability, persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer).
Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)
Gases present in the Earth's atmosphere which reduce the loss of heat into space and therefore contribute to global temperatures through the greenhouse effect.
IPCC
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body of scientists tasked with evaluating the risk of climate change caused by human activity. It was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), two organisations of the United Nations.
Mitigation
An anthropogenic (human) intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.
Climate change
Climate and climate in context
Climate change has been a constant feature throughout the history of the Earth.  Over different timescales, these changes have been driven by a variety of natural processes, among them plate tectonics, volcanic eruptions, changes in the ocean-atmosphere circulation, variations in the orbit of the Earth and in its obliquity and precession of spin (the main factors responsible for the glacial cycles of the last half million years or so), and variations in solar output.  Life itself has played a crucial role through its acceleration of rock weathering and in the capture of carbon in plant biomass and marine sediments which are central to the long-term carbon cycle.
Anthropogenic climate change
There is now recognition that human activity is contributing to changes in the composition of the atmosphere which are likely to lead to climate change over this century.  The main focus is on carbon dioxide generated by the burning of fossil fuels, but other greenhouse gases (GHGs) include:
methane;
nitrous oxide;
ozone;
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
Thus land use changes, agriculture and many other aspects of human activity contribute to global warming.
Rapidity of climate change
There is nothing ‘optimal’ about the current climate. The Earth has been much warmer (and cooler) than now and, over geological timescales, climate change is the norm and occasionally abrupt.
However, over the last 10,000 years (the Holocene), the climate has been unusually stable.  This stability may have been an important factor in the development of agriculture and the flourishing of human civilisation.  Concerns about climate change over this century relate to:
the expected pace of change;
our dependence on intense utilisation of the Earth's resources;
population density.
IPCC scenarios
It is not possible to be precise about the course of climate change, but scenario-based modelling carried out for the IPCC suggest increases in global mean temperatures which are rapid and large in magnitude. The range of scenario estimates published in the fourth IPCC report suggest several degrees Celsius warming is likely compared with around a 5 degree Celsius increase in temperatures since the depth of the last glacial maximum around 18,000 years ago. Such change is likely to disrupt natural ecosystems upon which we all depend, as well as being a direct threat to human populations.
Effects on health
Among the many effects of climate change are likely to be direct and indirect effects on health (figure), including:
Direct effects
Health impacts of temperature extremes, specifically of heat waves. In the UK, for example, under credible climate change scenarios, the type of heat wave seen in Paris in 2003 [1] and Europe in 2006 is likely to become a once-in-two-year event by around the middle of this century.
Increased frequency of extreme weather events, including severe storms, floods and droughts.
Sea level rise which will threaten many low-lying areas with inundation.
Increased frequency of food- and water-borne diseases.
Potential for change in the seasonal patterns or geographical distribution of some vector-borne disease.
Interactions with air pollution and effects on the seasonality and duration of aeroallergens.
Indirect effects
Impacts on water resources and agricultural productivity – with potential for socio-economic dislocation and mass migration of environmental refugees.
The most predictable impacts on health may not be the most important.  There is much uncertainty about the potential effects of rapid climate change on ecosystems already under pressure from human activity.  The regional impacts are particularly difficult to predict.  Local changes in precipitation and temperature may make unsustainable some forms of habitation for humans and other species, and the impacts may follow a non-linear trajectory.  Effects on agriculture and water resources may be among the most important (malnutrition, environmental migrations, economic impact).
Responses
Adaptation
Some degree of climate change is now inevitable because the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, remains in the atmosphere for many decades: the current levels are sufficient to increase temperatures, and climate modelling indicates that the increases will begin to become appreciable in the fourth and fifth decades of the century.
It is therefore important for populations to learn to adapt to climate change.  Adaptation strategies may include:
infrastructure developments, including specific protection measures (e.g. against heat or flood risks, and solar shading).
public health protection measures (e.g. heat-health warning systems, vaccinations for vector borne diseases).
information dissemination.
Mitigation
At the same time, there is recognition that it is important to try to limit the degree of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other measures.  There are formidable social, political and technological barriers to achieving the changes on the required scale and speed, but there is also increasing recognition that many of the changes are likely to have substantial net benefits to health, because of such factors as reduction in outdoor air pollution, increased crop growing seasons, warmer climates.
Latest developments
The Paris UN Climate Change Agreement: on 22 April 2016 –  175 world leaders signed the Paris Agreement at the United Nations Headquarters. Adopted in Paris by the 196 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at a conference known as (COP21 ), the Agreement’s objective is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to strive for 1.5 degrees Celsius. At least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification [2].
The UK Climate Change Act 2008 [3] requires the net UK carbon account for all six Kyoto greenhouse gases for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline, towards actions avoiding dangerous climate change, and a 35% reduction by 2020 for the UK. The Act promotes the UK to become a low-carbon economy and gives ministers powers to introduce the measures necessary to achieve a range of greenhouse gas reduction targets. An independent Committee on Climate Change was created under the Act to provide advice to Government on these targets and related policies [4].

Climate change and health are linked in more ways than one
No matter where you live, you probably experienced some unusual or extreme weather effects this year. There is no shortage of climate change facts that show how much the state of the planet is changing.
For one, global temperatures in July 2021 were higher than any other July on record.
On top of this, the concentration of carbon dioxide​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere is the highest it has been in human history.
But how does all of this affect you? And what is the effect on your team members, who may be scattered around the world?
How does climate change affect health on a personal level?
The truth of the matter is that climate change and health are inextricably linked. Global rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions put all of our health and well-being at risk. But some communities are particularly vulnerable.
Let’s take a look at the health impact of climate change. We’ll also discuss what you can do to reduce your contribution to global climate change.
What is climate change?
Climate change is the gradual shift in temperature and weather patterns experienced in our planet’s environment. These changes are directly linked to environmental health.
The Earth and its atmosphere are a complex system. Changes in one part of the system can gradually, and sometimes rapidly, trigger changes in other parts of the system.
Over time, the combination of global warming and human activity has resulted in significant climate alterations. The aggregate impact of seemingly small changes can quickly become large, such as when the average temperature of the ocean rises just a bit or the Gulf Stream current shifts, bringing large storms into more heavily populated areas.
The earth’s naturally rising temperatures have played a role in climate change. But the problem also stems from human contribution.
The industrial-scale burning of fossil fuels has resulted in greenhouse gas emissions. These gases degrade the environment. This affects everything that lives within it.
As a species and a society, we are vulnerable to the health of our climate and environment. When the environment around us is less healthy, that damage reflects in our own health and well-being.
Increasingly, business and political leaders as well as scientists and ordinary people are starting to understand this connection. Climate change and health are tightly integrated and must be addressed as equal issues of importance.
Who is at risk?
Even though we all share the same planet, some groups of people are more at risk for exposure to climate change than others.
In many aspects of our society, it is often marginalized people or groups that are discriminated against that are most vulnerable to danger. When it comes to climate change, things are no different.
According to the American Public Health Association, it’s people of color, low-income communities, and those who live on small islands who are most heavily impacted by climate change and its health effects. People with disabilities, young children, and the elderly are also at high risk.
This is due to a variety of factors.
People of color are subject to structural racism. This weakens their social capital and inhibits their access to proper health systems and healthcare. And it limits their ability to protect themselves.
Anyone living in a low-income community is at a systemic disadvantage for:
Food security
Access to resources
Psychological distress
People living on small islands are especially vulnerable to natural disasters and rising sea levels. Plus, they often lack sufficient socio-economic infrastructure.
Both children and the elderly with health conditions require special care and attention. This makes them sensitive to environmental shifts and dependent on others for support.
However, regardless of which demographic you fit into, nobody is completely safe from the risks that climate change brings.
6 health effects of climate change
By nature, climate change and health issues are intertwined. Both mentally and physically, we are highly susceptible to the dramatic shifts in the environment that climate change brings.
1. Worsening air quality
Climate change and air pollution are closely linked. In addition to driving climate change, widespread industrial activities are a major source of air pollutants. More than 10 million people die every year from pollution-related illnesses.
Poor air quality has an immediate, noticeable impact on well-being and mental health when it curtails outdoor activities. But the physical damage is even worse.
The worsening quality of our air can give way to several major health concerns. These include:
Lung cancer
Heart disease
Emphysema
Bronchitis
Asthma
And a variety of other serious respiratory diseases.
Scientists now believe that millions of preterm and underweight newborn births worldwide can be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution.
It’s clear that climate change and its health effects are a serious concern not just for our current generation but for future generations as well.
2. Water-borne illnesses and diseases
Contaminated water is one of the biggest global health threats. 785 million people lack even a basic drinking-water service. By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.
These are just some of the pathogens you could pick up from contaminated water:
Typhoid
Cholera
Hepatitis
Gastroenteritis
Scabies
Giardiasis
Campylobacteriosis
Amebiasis
Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is for drinking, cooking, or food production.
3. Natural disasters
Erratic weather patterns and the extreme weather events that they cause are major symptoms of climate change.
As temperatures continue to rise, an increase in natural disasters is likely to follow. Extreme events like droughts, storms, hurricanes, and wildfires are the planet’s natural responses to such drastic climate shifts.
4. Food insecurity
Climate change is already affecting food security. But the severity of the situation is not likely to slow down anytime soon.
The unpredictable weather patterns that climate change brings put a massive strain on farmers. Their crops do not respond well to increasingly extreme conditions.
This impacts the livelihoods of farmers and drives up the price of available food.
Food insecurity could increase the number of chronically hungry people around the world. Today, 1 in 9 (821 million) people are undernourished due to a shortage of food.
5. Diseases carried by vectors
Vector-borne diseases are diseases carried by blood-sucking arthropods. Some of the most common carriers of vector diseases are mosquitoes, ticks, flies, and fleas.
Changing climates and extreme weather like floods are expected to increase the prevalence of vectors. As a result, there is likely to be an increase in outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue.
Vectors can carry deadly diseases like malaria, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus.
6. Impact on mental health
The combination of all of these issues from climate change can have mental health implications for humans. The stress that comes with living alongside the health risks of climate change has the potential to cause just as much damage as any of the above concerns.
Anxiety, depression, and mental exhaustion and physical exhaustion are our bodies’ natural responses to high stress. Learning how to cope with stress will be crucial to your health.
How to stay healthy with climate change
One of the best ways to marry climate change and healthcare is to take personal responsibility for your state of well-being. Focusing on self-care practices and learned optimism are two of the most constructive things you can do for yourself.
1. Stay cool and safe during a heatwave
The dangerous health outcomes of extreme heat include heat exhaustion and heatstroke. In the July 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest, all-time temperature records killed at least 112 people.
During periods of extreme heat, keep your body cool by staying indoors and using a fan or air conditioner. Stay hydrated by drinking enough water.
2. Protect yourself from vectors like mosquitoes
According to the World Health Organization, vectors cause over 17% of all infectious diseases. This results in more than 700,000 deaths annually.
If you are traveling to a malaria area, invest in a mosquito net. Wear light clothes that cover your entire body and keep insect repellent handy.
If you have the means, you can also donate to organizations like the Against Malaria Foundation. Malaria is preventable with the right interventions. Yet, according to the CDC, an estimated 409,000 people died of malaria in 2019.
3. Eat a healthy diet
Your diet plays a vital role in your well-being. Make sure you consume a wide range of foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains for optimal health.
In the future, produce is not likely to be as diverse as it is now. Find alternate fruit and produce to consume that has less of an impact on the earth.
4. Take care of your mental health
One of the biggest climate change and health issues we can expect to face is an epidemic of poor mental health.
Adopting good habits like journaling and mindfulness reduces your stress levels. If you’re struggling and feeling alone, don’t be afraid to ask for help from a health professional.
4 actions to reduce your contribution to climate change
Prioritizing environmental health will help promote your personal health. Here are some steps you can take to reduce your contribution to climate change.
1. Reduce your food and water waste
Food and water are precious resources. Acting as though they are infinitely available will get us nowhere. It’s time to start reducing how much you waste.
You can do this by using water and food more intentionally. Don’t buy more than you absolutely need, and take short showers instead of baths.
2. Make your home energy efficient
If we all switched to renewable energy sources, we could prevent 4–7 million deaths per year.
Make your home more energy efficient by switching from electrical to renewable energy sources, such as solar panels. Weatherize your home with insulation to prevent heat from escaping.
3. Cycle and walk instead of drive
Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the greatest contributors to climate change. If you opt to cycle or walk instead of drive, you can drastically alter your carbon footprint.
Choosing to omit driving every day is not only good for the planet, it’s also good for you.
A study found that people who cycled to work were 45% less likely to develop cardiovascular disease and 46% less likely to develop cancer.
This wellness trend is a win-win for your body and the environment.
4. Choose sustainable, eco-conscious products
You can express your desire to make the world a better place by practicing conscious consumerism.
Opt for eco-friendly products that are locally made, use recycled materials, and have less packaging. Shop from eco-conscious companies that sell ethical and sustainable products.
Climate change and health are linked in more ways than one
Climate change and human health are inescapably connected.
But climate action isn't just about protecting our own health. For many, taking action to find more sustainable ways to live and maintain a healthy environment gains greater purpose for the sake of future generations. Each of us has a personal stake in doing what we can to protect the air, water, and land that sustains us.
