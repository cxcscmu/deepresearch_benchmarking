Alright, so I need to figure out what impact the Protestant Reformation had on society in the 16th century. I don't remember a lot about this, but I know it was a big deal in European history. Let me start by recalling what the Protestant Reformation was.

I think it was when some people in Europe started questioning the Catholic Church and broke away to form their own Protestant churches. It was led by figures like Martin Luther and John Calvin, right? So, it must have caused a lot of religious upheaval at the time.

But beyond religion, I wonder how it affected society as a whole. Maybe it influenced politics, education, economics, and culture. Let me try to think about each of these areas one by one.

First, politics. Since the Catholic Church was so powerful in medieval Europe, challenging its authority must have had political implications. I think some rulers used the Reformation to assert their power against the church. For example, Henry VIII in England broke away from Rome to establish the Church of England, mostly for personal reasons, but it also strengthened his rule.

Similarly, in Germany, where Luther was based, the Reformation led to the Peasants' War, which was a social uprising with religious overtones. That must have destabilized society to some extent.

In terms of education, I believe the Protestants placed a greater emphasis on literacy because they wanted people to read the Bible for themselves. So, maybe education became more widespread, at least in Protestant regions.

Economically, the Reformation might have had an impact too. The Catholic Church owned a lot of land and wealth, so challenging its authority could have disrupted the economy. Also, the sale of indulgences, which Luther protested against, was a way for the church to raise money, so abolishing that must have affected the church's finances.

Culturally, the Reformation probably led to changes in art and literature. For instance, Protestant ideals might have influenced the subjects and styles of art, perhaps moving away from religious imagery.

But these are just some initial thoughts. I need to verify them and see if there's more to it. Maybe I should look up some specific events or developments during the 16th century that were influenced by the Reformation.

Let me consider the spread of printing presses. Gutenberg invented the movable type printing press in the mid-15th century, and by the 16th century, it was widely used. The Reformation benefited from this technology because pamphlets and books promoting reform ideas could be printed and distributed quickly.

In fact, Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, which criticized indulgences, were printed and spread rapidly throughout Germany and beyond. This helped spark the Reformation. So, the printing press played a crucial role in disseminating reformist ideas.

Moreover, the Reformation led to the establishment of different Protestant denominations, such as Lutheranism, Calvinism, Anglicanism, and others. Each had its own beliefs and practices, which must have diversified religious life in Europe.

But along with diversity came conflict. The Reformation led to religious wars, most notably the Thirty Years' War in the early 17th century, although that's slightly outside the 16th century. Still, the tensions built up during the 16th century contributed to that war.

In the 16th century itself, there were various rebellions and conflicts between Protestant and Catholic regions. For example, the French Wars of Religion between Huguenots (Protestants) and Catholics, and the English Reformation's fluctuations under different monarchs.

So, the Reformation definitely had a destabilizing effect on society, leading to violence and instability in some areas.

On the other hand, perhaps it also had some positive impacts. For instance, the translation of the Bible into vernacular languages by reformers like Luther and William Tyndale helped standardize those languages and foster national identities.

Additionally, the emphasis on individual interpretation of the scriptures might have contributed to the development of critical thinking and intellectual freedom.

I should also consider the impact on women. Some Protestant groups allowed more opportunities for women, such as accessing education and participating in religious discussions, although overall, women's roles remained limited.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I need to look into that specifically.

Another aspect is the relationship between church and state. The Reformation challenged the traditional authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church, leading to the idea of religious tolerance and the separation of church and state, which are important principles today.

However, it's complicated because many Protestant leaders also sought to impose their own religious views on their subjects, leading to religious intolerance in some cases.

Hmm, perhaps the Reformation didn't immediately lead to religious tolerance, but rather set the stage for it over time.

I should also think about the impact on the arts. The Catholic Church was a major patron of the arts, commissioning works from artists like Michelangelo and Raphael. With the Reformation, Protestant regions might have reduced their support for religious art, leading to changes in artistic trends.

Furthermore, the Counter-Reformation, which was the Catholic Church's response to the Reformation, led to the promotion of art that reinforced Catholic doctrines, such as the Baroque style.

So, the Reformation had ripple effects across various aspects of society.

But I need to make sure I'm focusing on the 16th century. Let me think about some key dates.

The Reformation began in 1517 when Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the castle church door in Wittenberg. From there, it spread throughout Europe in the following decades.

In 1529, the term "Protestant" was first used at the Diet of Speyer, where Protestant princes protested against the Catholic majority.

In England, Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church in the 1530s, leading to the establishment of the Church of England.

In Switzerland, John Calvin founded Calvinism in the 1530s and 1540s.

So, throughout the 16th century, the Reformation was gaining momentum and causing significant changes.

Now, to summarize, the Protestant Reformation had profound impacts on society in the 16th century, including:

1. Religious division and conflict, leading to wars and social unrest.

2. Changes in the relationship between church and state, with some rulers asserting more control over religion.

3. Increased emphasis on literacy and education, particularly in Protestant regions.

4. Spread of reformist ideas through the printing press, contributing to the development of national languages.

5. Diversification of religious practices and beliefs with the emergence of various Protestant denominations.

6. Long-term implications for the development of democratic ideals and religious tolerance, although these may have taken time to manifest fully.

I should probably look up some specific statistics or events to support these points.

For example, regarding education, maybe I can find data on the establishment of schools and universities in Protestant areas compared to Catholic areas during the 16th century.

Also, concerning the printing press, perhaps there are estimates of the number of books and pamphlets printed during this period, and how many of them were related to the Reformation.

Moreover, looking into the French Wars of Religion and the English Reformation would provide concrete examples of how the Reformation affected specific countries.

Wait a minute, maybe I should conduct some searches to gather more precise information.

Let me try that.

First, I'll search for "impact of Protestant Reformation on education in 16th century."

Introduction The European Reformation continues to draw the attention of a large category of researchers: historians,  philosophers, economists, jurists, political scientists, pedagogues and of course theologians. The Protestant  Reformation may be considered as the most important event in the history of 16th century Europe, John Calvin was  a notable theologian through the depth of his thinking, but at the same time he was a visionary and a man of action  who, together with Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli and Philip Melanchthon decisively influenced the evolution of  a large part of Europe and North America.  The numerous works devoted to the Protestant Reformation evinced the impact he had in point of philosophy,  culture, economy, law, theology, but only a few books and studies focused on the effects of Protestantism on  education. The Reformers in the first half of the 16th century aimed at being mainly religious pedagogues, able to  provide people with a sound Christian education based on the Word of God; it is also worth noticing that the later  Middle Ages highlighted the close connection between education and lay piety, as well as between education and  the reformation of monasteries (McGrath, 2004, pp. 12).  The Renaissance humanism embraced a set of values or cultural and educational ideals, showing a marked  interest in the Greek and Roman Antiquity, and the scholars of the time searched for the best means to improve  human nature. They accurately sensed that the relationship of man with the divinity and his fellow humans can only  undergo a change for the better by education; in addition, many of the famous philosophical and theological treatises  of the time bore the title â€œinstitutioâ€�, which may be translated by â€œeducationâ€�. The logical conclusion may be that no  change on a social-political or institutional level may be achieved unless preceded by a similar change in intellectual  and spiritual education, prone to giving a new orientation to the attitude of man, created â€œad imaginem Deiâ€�,  towards the world and life in general.  The major role ascribed by the Reformers to learning classical languages may be explained not only by virtue of  the well-known Renaissance recourse to the fascinating wisdom of the ancient Greek Roman world: the fathers of  Protestantism wished to reach the state where any Christian would be literate, able to read the Bible in the original  so that to find Godâ€™s will in regard to people and how far the tradition of the Church has strained from the divine  commandments. That is why, to the 16th century Reformers who stressed the doctrine of the priesthood of all  believers, Christian education and evangelization were quite similar, which was why they focused on drawing up  catechisms and founding institutions of theological higher learning which reached notoriety in their time and are still  quite famous today(McGrath & Marks, 2004, pp. 56ff).  The present paper aims at reviewing certain pedagogical aspects of representative figures of the 16th century  Reformation, such as Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, Philip Melanchthon and John Calvin. We shall naturally  start with the initiator of the Reformation, also the most important Protestant leader in Germany: Martin Luther  (1483-1546). He stressed the idea that a preacher has significant educational responsibilities and so has to possess a  good academic and oratorical background, as he needed to face successfully the polemics of the time. Criticising the  scholastic education of the time, Luther published two catechisms which were an indispensable tool in the activity of  the Christian initiation of children, irrespective of gender or social class. He was not attracted only to the ecclesiastic  or liturgical reform, but also the educational reform, looking for the best means to make the Scripture known to the  masses, clergy and laymen alike, in its German translation. And anyway, an ecclesiastic reform presupposes a re- evaluation of the public system of education meant to have a solid study of the Bible at its foundation. 2. A New Pedagogy Luther himself was a university professor, as well as a very prolific writer: he produced many â€œtreatises, popular  tracts, educational works, and lettersâ€� (McKim, 2003, pp.241). All the prominent personalities of Protestantism were  perfectly aware of the fact that without a solid education provided by well-trained teachers nobody may behave in a  civilised manner or adequately distinguish right from wrong, and truth from falsehood: without proper education  nobody has the ability to accurately grasp â€œthe essentials of the Christian faithâ€� (Green, 2009, pp.13; Hillerbrand,  1968, pp.275).  In Lutherâ€™s vision, education is an opportunity to serve God better and to support oneâ€™s fellow humans, as an  educated man copes better with the challenges of his existence than a man without education. He constantly stressed  the idea that the childrenâ€™s duty is to obey their parents. Obedience is of utmost importance, as without it order gives  82   Mihai Androne /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  137 ( 2014 )  80 â€“ 87  way to chaos, and the lack of discipline in families poses a threat to the mere existence of the state: â€œFor what is a  city but a collection of houses? How then can a city be well governed, when there is no government in the separate  houses, and neither child nor servant is obedient? Likewise, what is a province but a collection of cities, towns, and  villages? When, therefore, the families are badly controlled, how can the province be well governed? Verily there  can be nothing but tyranny, witchcraft, murders, thefts, disobedience. A principality is made up of districts; a  kingdom, of principalities; an empire, of kingdoms; these are all composed of families. Where the father and mother  rule badly, and let the children have their own way, there neither city, town, village, district, principality, kingdom,  nor empire, can be well and peacefully governedâ€� (Painter, 1889, pp.114-115). The important role of education and discipline is also evinced by the German reformer on several other  occasions, both in the â€œLarge Catechismâ€� and the â€œSmall Catechismâ€�. The Bible clearly states that husbands should  love their wives, wives should obey their husbands, and the young should pay respects to their elders: likewise,  parents should not abuse the authority they have on the young (Lull, 1989:495) but instead all should abide by the  rule of love and piety. Parents are responsible for the future of their children, parents have first and foremost  pedagogical duties towards the younger generations, and they are called to teach the children the â€œTen  Commandmentsâ€� from the very beginning.  Education is somehow double-natured, as it pertains to manâ€™s quality as a God-created being living in society  who thus has to abide by the rules of the human community he is part of. Luther insists that parents are responsible  in Godâ€™s eyes for the good education given to their offspring. â€œParents should consider that they are under  obligations to obey God and that, first of all, they are conscientiously and faithfully to discharge all the duties of  their office; not only to feed and provide for the temporal wants of their children, servants, subjects, etc., but  especially to train them to the honor and praise of God. [â€¦] If we wish to have worthy, capable persons for both  temporal and spiritual leadership, we must indeed spare no diligence, time or cost in teaching and educating our  children to serve God and mankindâ€� (Luther, 1908, pp.77).  The Father of the German Reformation values most the childrenâ€™s religious education within the family. Without  being properly educated, nobody may be orderly, faithful and obedient. But it is not just the youthâ€™s domestic  education which is at stake; Luther strongly advocates enrolling children in public schools. The ecclesiastic reform  in the 16th century was closely linked to an educational reform; if medieval education  revolved around monastic  schools, the German Reformer pleads for an unrestricted education to which all young people should have access,  irrespective of their gender or social class; he rejects the medieval opinion according to which only the clergy have a  real religious calling, as Protestantism states that any individual is responsible before God for his own salvation, and  an ordained minister of God does not have a privileged position in point of an alleged sacred hierarchy as compared  to the rest of the believers. In this respect we may recall two of Lutherâ€™s texts. One is â€œAppeal to the German Nobilityâ€� (1520), and the other  - â€œTo the Councilmen of all Cities in Germany that they Establish and Maintain Christian Schoolsâ€� (1524). The  latter is richer in ideas regarding the beneficial character of public education provided to young people (most of the  principles in this text are also found in  â€œA Sermon on Keeping Children in Schoolâ€� - 1530). Education is expensive,  but at the same time it is extremely useful for everyone and for society as a whole. Lutherâ€™s phrase is full of pathos:  â€œMy dear sirs, if we have to spend such large sums every year on guns, roads, bridges, dams, and countless similar  items to insure the temporal peace and prosperity of a city, why should not much more be devoted to the poor  neglected youth-at least enough to engage one or two competent men to teach school?â€� (Lull, 1989, pp.707;  Lindberg, 2010, pp.123) Thus, one may draw the conclusion that the entire society cannot survive without properly instructed citizens,  cultivated leaders, as ignorance negatively affects inter-human relations, and has nothing positive or illuminating, on  the contrary. No country may have cultivated citizens if it has no properly trained teachers or well endowed  libraries. â€œFor if the gospel and all the arts are to be preserved, they must be set down and held fast in books and  writing [â€¦].This is essential, not only that those who are to be our spiritual and temporal leaders may have books to  read and study, but also that the good books may be preserved and not lost, together with the arts and languages  which we now have by the grace of Godâ€� (Lull, 1989, pp.730).  A people can only make progress through culture, and Lutherâ€™s analytical spirit and his patriotic feeling make  him deplore the precarious state of the education in the German territories. First, the Reformer is a critic of the  higher education of his time, opining that the universities are devoid of vigour, becoming merely un-Christian,  without any genuine spirituality. Parents, realizing this state of fact, refuse to send their children to school any  83 Mihai Androne /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  137 ( 2014 )  80 â€“ 87  longer, to keep them away from a corrupted system (Luther, 1970, pp.100). Besides, many of the adults, being  themselves devoid of any genuine Christian education, are more concerned about providing a better living than the  genuine reference frames of a Christian life. Schools should benefit from public support, the German Reformer believes that the education provided to  underprivileged children is â€œan excellent investmentâ€� (Lull, 1989, pp.708). The most important task of adults, here  on earth, is to take care of the young generationâ€™s education, as nothing is useful to adults if they do not care for  their children. Luther is very radical in this respect, i.e. the need for parents to care for their childrenâ€™s education,  and the following assertion is proof of this vision: â€œWhat would it profit us to possess and perform everything else  and be like pure saints, if we meanwhile neglected our chief purpose in life, namely, the care of the young? I also  think that in the sight of God none among the outward sins so heavily burdens the world and merits such severe  punishment as this very sin which we commit against the children by not educating themâ€� (Lull, 1989, pp.710).  Neglecting children is a deadly sin, as parents give birth to children all over the world, but unfortunately too few  are willing and know how to care for the education of their offspring. There are several reasons why adults fail in  doing their duty towards their children. These adults are either lacking in goodness and decency, rather manifesting  cruelty, or content themselves with bringing children into the world without caring for their future. And how may  one allow, he asks rhetorically, that the youth grow uneducated, so that they may pollute others with their ignorance,  thus contributing to the ruin of the whole community they live in. Many of the parents have no education themselves  and have no clue about how they should instruct their offspring: they are solely concerned with the material aspects  of life and do not value anything that pertains to the spiritual.  Itâ€™s true however, says Luther in the same text, that the less blameable situation may arise when parents have  both the will and the ability to care properly for their children, but they lack the necessary time and opportunity,  being too absorbed in domestic chores. In this case society should be of assistance, providing them with the  possibility to send their children to public schools, especially in the case when they cannot afford hiring a private  tutor. Besides, society should consider that some of the children are orphaned, and the responsibility of their care falls  to the public authorities (Luther, 1827, pp.136). It goes without saying that the wealth of a city consists not only of  the treasures it has managed to amass in time, but also the human quality of the people inhabiting it. The explanation  is easy to find: ultimately, only citizens who are learned, wise, honourable and well-educated are really able to  properly use and increase a stateâ€™s wealth  The Reformer Martin Luther pleads in favour of a â€œclassicâ€� system in schools, proof of his humanist background.  He rejects the idea that people enrolled in schools should learn all subjects in German, leaving aside the study of  Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Classical languages are  â€œfine and noble a gift of God, with which he is now so richly  visiting and blessing us Germans above all other landsâ€� (Lull, 1989, pp.715). Although the Bible has God as the  author, yet nobody should forget that it reached us through the classical languages, sacred languages, and it should  be preserved in the same manner. Luther praises the value of these ancient languages, directly and indirectly  orienting people to study them as thoroughly as possible.  In his opinion, this study is not a mere task of linguistic or intellectual nature, but also a higher, moral and  religious responsibility: â€œThe languages are the sheath in which this sword of the Spirit [Eph. 6:17] is contained;  they are the casket in which this jewel is enshrined; they are the vessel in which this wine is held; they are the larder  in which this food is stored; and, as the gospel itself paints out [Matt. 14:20], they are the baskets in which are kept  these loaves and fishes and fragments. If through our neglect we let the languages go (which God forbid!), we shall  not only lose the gospel, but the time will come when we shall be unable either to speak or write a correct Latin or  Germanâ€� (Lull, 1989, pp.717). And in this vein it is also worth mentioning that the German Reformer is not only in  favour of the study of theology or the languages of the Bible, but he also considers that besides Latin, Greek, and  Hebrew, young people could really benefit in schools from the study of literature, history, music and mathematics.  Just like law and medicine.  When talking about the influence of the Protestant Reform on education, one should not confine oneself to  Martin Lutherâ€™s vision, but refer as well to other religious reformers who were inherently concerned with the quality  of the educational system and the university curriculum. The examination of the pedagogical thinking of the  Reformation may continue with another important leader, Huldrych Zwingli (1484-1531), the author of a short  treatise called â€œOn the Education of the Youthâ€� (1523).  84   Mihai Androne /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  137 ( 2014 )  80 â€“ 87  Zwingli took upon himself the task of reforming the schools in Zurich, militating just like Luther for a better  knowledge of classical languages, in view of a deeper study of the Bible. In the paper mentioned earlier he makes  remarks regarding the religious education of young people, as to his mind education plays an extremely important  role in the overall moral and intellectual development of an individual. He rightfully senses an aspect of utmost importance on the educational level, which is largely neglected in our modern world: taking up the moral duty is  closely linked to knowing the religious truth. The mission of the school in a Christian society is not only cultivating  and capitalizing the youthâ€™s intellectual skills and abilities, but also transforming them into genuine Christians. â€œIt  seems to me to be quite in keeping with Christâ€™s own teaching to bring young people to a knowledge of God in and  through external phenomena. For as we bring before them the fair structure of the universe, pointing them to each  part in particular, we learn that all these things are changing and destructible, but that he who conjoined them (and  many other things besides) in so lasting and marvellous a whole is necessarily unchanging and immutableâ€�  (Bromiley, 2006, pp.104). That is why one should not be surprised if in this short work (as most of the works of the  Reformers) one finds a presentation of the basic teachings in the Bible, as by definition the Protestant religious  education is of biblical nature.  The Zurich Reformer focuses on the importance of the spiritual cultivation of people, which aids them in getting  to know themselves better, expressing themselves accurately, and wishing to live in decency and moderation,  proving self-control, nevertheless without neglecting their physical training. The spirit is more important than the  body, but the latter is not devoid of value either, hence the need to maintain its vigour and health through physical  exercise (Bromiley, 2006, pp.116) and a healthy lifestyle. A vigorous well-trained body aids the young man in  pursuing a military career, but he should under no circumstances forget that all aspects in manâ€™s life on this earth are  regulated by God: â€œBut if the young man does undergo military training, he must see to it that his only purpose is to  protect his own country and those whom God approvesâ€� (Bromiley, 2006, pp.113). Luther and Zwingli are the most notable first generation reformers. Their followers furthered the reflection on  issues of theology and pedagogy. Philip Melanchton (1497-1560) was Lutherâ€™s close colleague and disciple, a  systematic thinker, a university professor, and just like Luther, the author of a prestigious religious work. He is also  known as the Teacher of Germany (Praeceptor Germaniae) due to his pedagogy-related concerns and because he  closely supervised the reform of the educational system in Germany, and got actively involved in the establishment  of new schools. Like Luther and Zwingli, Melancthon believes in the beneficial character of learning classical  languages, mainly old Greek: as an expert in his doctrine opines, â€œMelanchthon stresses the necessity of Greek for  any renewal of learning and pietyâ€� (Ben-Tov, 2009, pp.140; Woodward, 1906, chapter XI).  Melanchthon closely studied the field of the Ethics of Education. Like his magister Martin Luther, he proved to  be an advocate of the liberal arts and a knowledgeable student of ancient philosophy. A passionate supporter of the  evangelical faith, Melanchthon was convinced that the ecclesiastic and social reform can only succeed to the extent  it was coupled with an educational reform, in other words the  implementation of a high quality education system.   He stresses the fact that education is absolutely necessary for any manâ€™s progress and the survival and prosperity of  the entire society. By education Melanchthon meant religious education, as well as philosophical, and implicitly  philological education. If nobody may know the divine truth through philosophy, nevertheless the latter is apt to  urge people to value civic virtue in order to preserve social peace and harmony: â€œlisteners need to be warned to  banish the error which already occupied their minds, namely that the writings of the pagans are unworthy of being  read by Christian people, and that Christians should give a wide berth to philosophy. [â€¦] Philosophy does not  provide confirmation of the will of God, nor does it instruct on the fear of God and the trust in Him; that pertains  properly to the Gospel. However, apart from these things, precepts for civic life are necessary, which teach how men  may live peacefully with each other. [â€¦] Since Christians should cherish and support this civil society, this teaching  of civic morals and duties has to be known by themâ€� (Kusukawa, 1999, pp.81).  The study of philosophy is not meant to replace the study of theology, and conversely, the study of the Bible does  not invalidate the study of the ancient philosophers of the Greek Roman world. Melanchthon considers that it would  be a grievous error to believe that the Gospel is in total disagreement with the classical antiquity: in fact he militates  for the institution of a certain relation between the Christian and the pagan culture, which would not operate by  mutual exclusion or an exclusivity that would be really harmful to the entire social order. In this respect  Melanchthon appeals to the authority of the classics, quoting Xenophon who, in his â€œHousehold Managementâ€�  stated that all that is more useful and more beautiful to man is order. Culture constitutes an indispensible ingredient  for the preservation of social life, thus the German Reformer contradicts those who unreasonably believe that  85 Mihai Androne /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  137 ( 2014 )  80 â€“ 87  humanities are not useful and therefore devoid of interest: â€œTherefore, just as that divine order in the totality of  things is perturbed if one element is removed, so there can be no articulated sound if the consonants are discarded.  And in the same way, just as there is a natural relationship of the various letters with each other, the various arts are  associated and yet separated. And those who feel that the lower disciplines are useless for life, because their benefit  is not so visible, disturb this chorus of the artsâ€� (Kusukawa, 1999, p.5). However, the Bible itself may be read and explained only by those who have a good command of the classical  languages, that is why these languages prove to be a vital tool in interconfessional polemics, in combating erroneous  doctrines. Besides, a solid culture constitutes the premise for a happy life. It would ensue that the happiness to which  each man naturally aspires and which Christianity sees as closely connected to knowing God, also depends on  attending school. Melanchthon constantly promotes the idea that the Church itself needs well educated ministers in  order to face any dispute they may get involved in: â€œIt is a great mistake to imagine that ministers can be carved  from any wood, and that the teaching of religion can be grasped without erudition and without long training. [â€¦]  Therefore in all ages there have been the most violent disputes in the Church. However, for the explanation of the  major controversies one needs not only a ready mind and a certain knowledge of the sacred books, but also the art of  disputation, fluent speech and a knowledge of history, antiquity and judgments of the pastâ€� (Kusukawa, 1999,  pp.16). Man is a social being, his need of communication is an essential one, and a fruitful dialogue only exists to the  extent of mastering the art of eloquence. The Church and society as a whole need cultivated people who are equally  good orators, literate, articulate, and able to support their opinions. Melanchthon makes the apology of erudition,  showing that it is not a purpose in itself, but an extremely effective means in the religious debates of the age (and of  any age, in our opinion), in order to support good and defeat evil: â€œThen even more difficult is the defence of  religion, in which it is necessary to bear in mind the quarrels of all ages, to reveal snares, to refute sophisms, to  remove the disguise of false convictions and to make clear and fortify the true opinions. No one can do these things  without a great variety of skills and without eruditionâ€� (Kusukawa, 1999, pp.18).  The stress the Reformers placed on the education of the young generations â€“ tomorrowâ€™s religious and political  leaders â€“ may be better understood in the context of a change of vision, occurring at the end of the Middle Ages, in  regard to the child and his condition. During the Middle Ages the idea of childhood was virtually non-existent, as  society was not concerned with the peculiar nature of the child, who is too fragile to count in the world of the strong,  of the grown-ups, but starting with the 14th century something significant changes in the mentality of the time, the  emergence of the tendency to express the childâ€™s specific personality in art and religion. It seems that the  Renaissance did not exhibit the same indifference towards childhood: â€œThere was an abandonment of the concept of  the child as an immature adult, and his [the childâ€™s] emergence as a creature recognized as having special needs and  aptitudesâ€� (Luke, 1989, pp.2; AriÃ¨s, 1962, pp.128-129). In dealing with this issue of the influence of the Reform on education, special attention should be given to the  contribution to the field of the most important Protestant thinker in history, John Calvin (1509-1564). The famous  Reformer of Geneva authored no paper on education; however, it may be said that his entire life and numerous  writings dealt with the crucial issue of the Christiansâ€™ spiritual and intellectual elevation. He is the founder of the  University of Geneva and many other prestigious European universities were founded by the adepts of the Reformed  faith. It is noteworthy that in all that he did, the Reformerâ€™s interest was predominantly religious, attempting to  transform Geneva an example of Christian cohabitation and an  welcoming refuge for the Protestants persecuted in  their countries of origin. That is why he made a lot of effort towards a better organisation of Church life, as well as  the socio-economic and political life in the city where he spent most of his life. He was fully aware that religion and  education have to be unitive, as true faith is not blind, but knowledgeable: as a result, it was necessary that the  School and the Church stay together to cooperate in spreading the Word of God. Some may be tempted to believe  that the Reformer made no clear distinction between â€œpreachingâ€� and â€œteachingâ€� (Montgomery, 1984, pp.233-234),  but one should not forget that even if the preacher also teaches his audience at the same time, yet Calvin placed the  doctoral office and the pastorate on different levels, for the good reason that these responsibilities dispose of their  specific character (Montgomery, 1984, pp.262). Calvin took care that the higher education institution he had founded in 1559 could benefit from the services of  the best teachers of the time, experts in classical languages (Hebrew, Greek, Latin), philosophy, theology, physics,  literature, mathematics, French, law and medicine; the experts in the life and work of the Academy founder consider  86   Mihai Androne /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  137 ( 2014 )  80 â€“ 87  that this institution was in fact â€œthe crown of Calvinâ€™s Genevan workâ€� (Walker, 1906, pp.367; Wendel, 1963,  pp.105).  The Reformer was not just an organiser, but also a man of action deeply involved in the reality of his time, and a  visionary theoretician, which is obvious mainly in the â€œEcclesiastical Ordinancesâ€� (1541), as well as the rest of the  books he published during his lifetime in Latin or French, which were subsequently translated in all the languages of  the world. A passionate and optimistic supporter of public education and public schools maintained and controlled  by the state, his philosophical-religious ideas largely contributed to the rise of the modern world, a democratic and  creative one, where the main concepts would be tolerance, performance, and individual responsibility.  He highlights the special dignity of the calling of a teacher, comparable to that of a pastor, even if the two may  not be considered equal. Calvin brings forth the special meaning of the knowledge act â€“ knowledge of God and of  oneself -, but he does not forget to warn his readers against an intellectual pseudo-faith deriving from a pseudo- knowledge saturated with philosophical speculations, which is truly harmful in point of spirituality. Real knowledge  constitutes the premise of the saving faith: the extent to which the Reformer privileges the act of knowledge is the  same to which he privileges the teaching profession.  â€œSola fideâ€� is one of the basic principles of the Protestant Reformation. But it is through this idea that the  Reformation indirectly focuses on the cognitive act of the human being, as well as on his attempt to transmit his  fellow humans and offspring a collection of ideas and feelings, i.e. his own life experience. Faith involves  knowledge, this conviction makes Calvin reject the notion of â€œimplicit faithâ€�; in a fragment of his main work,  â€œInstitutio Christianae religionisâ€� (1559) he states: â€œFaith rests not on ignorance, but on knowledge. And this is,  indeed, knowledge not only of God but of the divine will. We do not obtain salvation either because we are prepared  to embrace as true whatever the church has prescribed, or because we turn over to it the task of inquiring and  knowingâ€� (Calvin, 2006, pp.545).  On the spiritual level it is not enough for man to believe what he is told, without understanding and researching  the validity of the information he receives, so Calvin only exhorts his contemporaries and descendants to carefully  and systematically study any piece of information which is given as true, simultaneously indicating the harmful  effect of ignorance and the beneficial character of knowledge. No teacher on earth is infallible, that is why no pupil  is spared the effort of personally checking the information provided. If the truth is important to man, then education  should be of equal importance. 3. Conclusions It is common knowledge that the Reformers were accomplished cultivated men, and the Reformation itself came  to be as a result of the consistently systematic reflection on the Bible, and on the degree to which the doctrine of the  Church of the time observed the Scripture. The Protestant scholars merely resume and promote words originating in  Antiquity: â€œAmicus Plato, sed magis amica veritasâ€�. Man cannot just believe anything, ignorance is to blame, and  gullibility is the cause of manâ€™s ruin. The man who is well-educated and believing in God analyses, compares,  verifies, and draws conclusions in the know, as par excellence â€œthe understanding is joined with faithâ€� (Calvin,  2006, pp.546).  This final assertion of Calvinâ€™s is emblematical, tending to reflect the mentality of an age which could wisely  reconcile science and faith: if would be a great accomplishment if we, the ones living in the 21st century, could at  least try to meditate more on this spiritual balance that our predecessors found and we seem to have partially lost  along history!

The end of the 15th century marked the blossoming of educational institutions and humanistic studies in England. Drawing from the ideas of Lauwerys et al., such a period represented rapid transformation from the medieval tradition to the period of the Renaissance. With the ushering in of the new century, therefore, the humanists produced texts for the study of the Classical languages besides starting a new grammar school type. Some of the prominent humanist scholars of the period include John Colet, Thomas More, William Lily, and Thomas Linacre. These authors prepared excellent texts on the language syntax, parts of speech, and the structure of language, mostly Latin. On the part of Androne, he considers the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century a significant factor in the intellectual and education transformation. The Reformation played a role in deeply changing not only doctrinal, ritualistic, and leadership aspects of the Church but also the political and socio-cultural aspects of society. Nebiolo emphasizes the contribution of the Reformation wars to the intellectual advancement in medicine as he highlights how the improvement of weapons in the battlefield demanded better approaches to treat wounds. And as the education continue develops, as I will analyze in the rest of the paper, the intellectual and education has changed dramatically. The 16th century to the 17th century was marked by the shift from religious pedagogy to the focus on science and math.
Back to the end of 15th Century, Lauwerys et al. single out the critical role of Colet in English education as the dean of St. Paul’s Cathedral. In his position, Colet founded the St. Paul’s School that favored the introduction of humanism as well as transforming the old ecclesiastical medieval schools in England. Having traveled to Italy and France a great deal, Colet desired to introduce the fascinating humanistic culture thus going ahead to start a grammar school in 1510. The school was open to approximately 150 scholars who had completed elementary school as well as having an aptitude for study. The school became a lively English humanism center courtesy of the energy and personality of Colet. Besides Colet, Lauwerys et al. also underline the critical role of More, a statesman and distinguished humanist. His interest was in pedagogy hence dedicating part of his Utopia (1516)’s work to it. More was a strong proponent of the Greek language and its new instruction representation in the battle against medieval tradition that was deeply rooted. Lauwerys et al. continue the arguments by asserting the development of new social and political systems in the European countries that had broken away from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. The proposition made is that the newly found countries exhibited the crucial characteristic of the significance of the state in organizing the educational system. Thus, European humanism and the Reformation influenced one another where both events expressed a keen interest in the study of the Greek and Hebrew Classical languages.
Even so, humanists and reformers clashed at some point especially regarding the access to education. Lauwerys et al. claim that whereas humanists emphasized the developing of a world of artists and writers committing their time to the pursuit of literary and artistic works, the reformers’ targeted educating the masses. Such education, nonetheless, aimed at promoting piety as its primary purpose was to enable Scripture reading in the purest of forms. No wonder, German religious reformer and theologian Martin Luther expressed in a letter to Jacob Strauss in 1524 that the “neglect of education will become the greatest ruin to the Gospel” (Lauwerys et al.). He thus advocated for the extension of education to all children, girls and boys, rather than making it available to a leisured minority as was the case in Renaissance Italy. Other than the struggle between humanism and the Reformation in 16th century education, Androne’s sentiments emphasize the religious pedagogy characterizing the education of the era. The author asserts that there was focus on providing people with a sound Christian education founded on the word of God. There was thus a connection between the Reformation and the Renaissance humanism that embraced education ideals and a set of values that took an interest in Greek and Roman Antiquity. The scholars of the period felt that education was the instrument for changing man’s relationship to God and fellow humans hence creating a sense of spiritual and intellectual education. The aim was to have literate Christians that could read the Bible in the original hence able to find God’s will regarding the extent to which the Church’s tradition had strained from the divine instructions. The Protestantism personalities, equally, recognized the impossibility of civilized behavior or the differentiation of right from wrong in the absence of a solid education by teachers that were well-trained (Androne). In Luther’s perspective, he felt that education people would serve God better as well as cope with existing challenges of existence. Other than that, he stressed the aspect of discipline and obedience in connection with education hence the 16th-century education had the characteristic of parents had the responsibility of pedagogical duties for the younger generations.
Roberts also offers a perspective on the 16th-century education that points to the existence of education of girls besides such educational practices being unconventional. He says that the 16th and 17th centuries in England showed evidence of girls’ secondary education for learning Latin and foreign languages. The parents, however, determined the education girls received based on what they thought was essential in readiness for playing the role of a wife and mother (Roberts). Among some of the parents, there was the perception that advanced education for the girls could prove a disadvantage as intellectual wives were difficult for the husband to manage. The conclusions drawn from the period’s education was that the children learned only what was necessary for later life. After all, the future life’s role was dedicated to reproduction hence intellectual prowess was irrelevant. The education of women was also viewed as a threat to their modesty. Unsurprisingly, home-tutoring characterized the education of the 16th century as the girls’ education reform was left to the choice of the parents rather than taking a wide scale reform.
By the 17th century, Nebiolo notes that there was a shift toward the intellectual liberation of the century, signifying a departure from the religious pedagogy of the 16th century. Education began to focus on the learning and development of science and math. Focus, therefore, was turned from religious and culture aspect to the natural world. By way of example, Nebiolo underscores the progression in the field of surgery that traces back to the mid-16th century. The increasing demand for surgeons prompted the introduction of surgical courses and literature in medical schools. Other than surgery being done by the local barber surgeons, as known then across Europe, the battlefield emerged as a significant area calling for the services of the surgeons. Despite the deteriorating status of surgeons owing to the associated experiences of pain and loss of body parts in the process of their duties, the introduction of more menacing weapons in the battlefield came as a welcome event. Cannons and gunpowder from the mid-16th century, for instance, was crucial in the barber surgeons’ intellectual advancement to more efficient tools. Considering such weapons induced severe damage to parts of the body, technological inventions the Guy de Chauliac’s speculum received modifications that include the mounting of a mirror to assess wounds and determine the extent of bullet embeddedness (Nebiolo). Therefore, the intellectual progression from the 16th to the 17th century was marked by the improvement of surgical craft as a representation of the focus on science. The Reformation wars thus helped a great deal in advancing from medieval learning to the pursuit of the natural world pedagogy.
A changing public opinion on education also contributed to the transformations in education as medical professions changed. As such, there was a growth in published texts on surgery as an indicator of the changing public opinion. Nebiolo notes that it was not until the late sixteenth century when surgical texts started circulating in Europe. The new research on human body and surgical tools emerged in that period hence the emergence of books as a new source of knowledge for the surgeons.
In conclusion, the weight has shifted from a heavily religious base to the learning of math, physics and all other types from 16th century to 17th century. 16th-century education saw parents offering basic education to their children with the intention of gaining the competence to read the bible. At the dawn of the 17th century, however, attention turned to intellectual liberation that emphasized the methods of the natural science. The field of medicine, in particular surgery, represents the enlightenment of the period, pedagogy influenced by the introduction of advanced weapons in the Reformation wars.

“What impact did the Protestant Reformation have on society in the 16th century?”
It had a very beneficial effect in that it allowed society to begin to get out from under the control and corruption of the Catholic Church.
For centuries the Catholic Church had been controlling the kings (and sometimes queens) of European countries from behind the scenes, what’s known as ‘eminence grise’. They did this by threatening excommunication of the king if he didn’t follow the dictates of the Church. Even if a king didn’t believe in theology and wasn’t concerned the populace did and if they saw that their

What were the effects of the Protestant Reformation?
As a former lifelong Protestant, it is my belief that some of the effects of the Protestant Reformation have certainly been positive, but most of it has been negative. And, almost all of the good that has come from the Protestant Reformation is almost entirely centered upon the Bible.
Some of the positive effects of the Reformation is that it, along with Johannes Gutenberg, helped speed up the mass printing and distribution of Bibles into the hands of the common man. The Reformation helped spur greater rates for literacy throughout Europe, where many schools were formed, initially, only so that

What are the political changes that happened in England during the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century?
I will first put my cards on the table! As an English Catholic I am not at all sympathetic to the Protestant “Reformation” suffered by England.
Politically I would say that the main feature under Henry VIII, Edward VI and Elizabeth I was the rise and consolidation of State absolutism. During the Middle Ages, the Church had been a real power in the land, able at times to challenge the monarch, and in its best aspects, to protect the common people.
The parish churches were the centre of town and village life. They were the heart of the community. The Church provided the glue which held society as

If the Catholic Church had adopted most of Luther's demands in the 16th century, rather than excommunicating him, is it possible the Protestant Reformation and schism within Christianity would have been avoided altogether?
Your premise is not legitimate. The Catholic Church does not make up what it believes, it can only receive that from Our Blessed Lord, and revelation was closed fourteen centuries before the time you are talking about.
The Catholic Church can only teach what has been revealed to it, it cannot make up new stuff, or change what it believes. Martin Luther came up with absolutely novel ideas which had never been believed or even heard of in sixteen centuries of Christendom. The Church had no choice by to excommunicate him before his heresy spread further.

What were the effects of the Counter Reformation in the European society of the 16th century?
A lot of bad things including religious persecution and terror.
But also a couple of good things, and they are the ones who have been lasting.
The main good thing that came from the counter reformation is education. You see us pesky protestants insisted that the bible was like really important. That is why we translated it into languages we could understand. We and our “papist” brothers were largely illiterate and thus unable to read the bible regardless of language. The answer to this problem? Education.
The Catholics did not sit idly by while we were educating our people for heretical purposes.

Is the 16th century Protestant Reformation more aptly called the Protestant Revolution, since the word "reformation" implies staying in the Church of Christ?
In his book From Dawn to Decadence, historian Jacques Barzun does indeed call the Protestant Reformation a revolution, on the basis that it was responsible for sweeping and fundamental changes in those regions that became Protestant.
It seems to me that it could be both a reformation and a revolution; they are not mutually exclusive. But I suppose if you are a sectarian Catholic (as indicated by the implicit statement that the Protestants left the Church of Christ) you might prefer something like "Ejection of the Schismatic Heretics" to "Reformation".

Originally Answered: What led to the reformation in church history?
There are quite a few causes, although the cause of reform had been pushed for centuries by that point, and several church councils had made half-hearted efforts which inevitably failed. There are probably two main causes we can look at for setting up the Protestant “Reformation” (more properly a revolution), then two causes for its success where similar movements failed, establishing the Protestant Reformation triumphant and forcing the Church to finally embrace its own reform at the Council of Trent.

Well, the Protestant revolt produced a great number of English martyrs, separated the English people and those they influenced, such as the United States, from the Sacraments which God instituted for our salvation.
The end result five hundred years later has been the growth of atheism and all other kinds of errors, not just Protestantism and atheism, but Modernism… Big boost for Satan and his campaign to separate us from God and eternal salvation.

Oh, crumbs, is THAT a question! My answer is going to be a long way from being perfect, so be warned:
Protestantism tends to be highly individualistic, since it says that all men can have a personal relationship with God. This wound up meaning that lots of peasants and working-class people and city boys started to think that feudalism wasn’t such a great idea.
Religion gave kings and princes a brand new reason to go to war against each other. They did this so much that they had to invent whole new ways of conducting warfare: instead of buying off mercenaries left and right, and calling up aristo

What was the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation?
Well, the Protestant Reformation was because the Catholic Church had gotten pretty dysfunctional and power hungry - so many who saw this left the Church and followed their own beliefs, actually beginning the various Protestant Churches.
The Catholic Counter-Reformation was a reaction by the Church to the Reformation. It began with the Council of Trent, which started in 1545. This was a meeting of all the Church leaders in Europe to address the issues of the Church.
Of course, there was also bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics over these issues and differences of opinion - and loss of pow

How did the Protestant Reformation expand?
Mostly by local rulers realizing that they could take total control of the Church in their own dominions. They could then be rid of any internal or external opposition from the Church. They could take hold of the revenues which used to be sent to Rome. They could grab and confiscate church land, valuables, parish and monastic property.
This happened in Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire, under King Christian III in Denmark, Norway and Iceland, more gradually in Sweden (and Finland), in England under Henry VIII, Edward VI and Elizabeth I.

What could the Catholic Church have done to stop Luther from breaking with Catholicism? Kill him, maybe? The Church had been so corrupt for so long, the only strange thing is why it took so long for someone to split off from it.

The Catholic Church discouraged the populace from reading the Bible for themselves. This sentiment started sometime after the counsel of Nicaea and intensified during the middle ages.

The prejudice that Catholic theology was un-Biblical and the ensuing aim to bypass it to get a really Biblical theology, and the hatred of Papacy, Holy Mass, Monasticism and Clerical celibacy were common trends.

Fair question. There were other ‘heretical’ movements before the XVIth century but most of them were marginalized or became extinct.
I see three reasons.
First, a great weakening of the papacy and the Catholic church.
During the great western schism, the papacy weakened itself terribly by having in turn, two or even three popes fighting for legitimacy.
They lost touch with society, lost control in some area, and that was felt. Bohemia accepted a heresy called hussism and contrary to what happened in southern France, the pope and the princes simply failed to destroy it.

At least initially, the Reformation led to bloodshed that was (proportionally) at least as bad as World War II in Europe. Whole cities like Magdeburg were obliterated, literally millions died, by far most of them in Germany in the Thirty Years' War. In that war, whole regions of Germany were depopulated, so severe was the warfare.

The Protestant Reformation ignited a religious reform movement that separated the western Christian church into Catholic and Protestant groups. Martin Luther embarked on a Journey to start the religious reform movement; there were other developments before him that set a foundation for a religious alteration in the sixteenth century.
The Protestant Reformation allowed for Protestantism to flourish throughout Europe, united the Roman Catholic Church with Christian denominations, enabled people to develop independent thinking and creative, fostered etermination in people to attain religious and political freedom, and allowed for Christianity to evolve permanently throughout history. Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz helped produce the development of printing from a moving type. In Europe there were thousands of printers that published religious books like the Bible, sermons, Latin and Greek classics, legal handbooks, and works on philosophy.
This type of development manifested an "immediate impact on European intellectual life and thought" (Duiker 429). This kind of invention fostered creative thinking and determination in people to study scholarly resources. Printing allowed the European civilization to disperse new religious ideals. This communication throughout Europe played a major role in enabling people to acquire newfound knowledge and formulate beliefs of their own. Many historians state that Desiderius Erasmus "laid the egg that Luther hatched" (History 1). Erasmus was an influential Christian humanist.

Christian humanism or northern Renaissance humanism combined the ideas of the classical Italian Renaissance with the ideas of early Christianity. According to Christian humanism, a society must alter the human beings that compose it. They strongly believed that people are smart enough to formulate their own ideals and beliefs. They did no have to solely depend on an irrational religion for happiness and salvation. Erasmus was most influential in teaching that religion should be a philosophy for a direction of life, not a source of arbitrary practices and rituals, which is what medieval religion emphasized.
Erasmus also placed an emphasis on teaching the philosophy of Jesus Christ. Erasmus did not approve of the abuse of power of inside the church. The opposition towards a dogmatic religion encouraged the Christian and northern Renaissance humanists to stand against the orruption of the Catholic Church; they gave mankind hope and encouragement to believe in themselves, and to fight for freedom of religion. Another factor that influenced people to start a reform was the corruption of the Catholic Church. The all-powerful Roman Catholic Church labeled any non-believer as a heretic; punishment included being burned at stake.
The Catholic Church's power was assembled over centuries, and depended on the lack of religious education and unawareness of people. People's primary motivation of believing in the Catholic Church came from the belief of salvation to heaven though the Catholic Church. Any other belief was disregarded. The realization that many popes were not committing to the needs of the church and people outraged many people in Europe. Many popes' interests were not focused on the spiritual uprising of religion, but worldly interests like power and wealth The process ot salvation was becoming a traud.
This ignited hate and bitterness towards the Catholic Church and stimulated the idea for change and reform. The Catholic Church strongly emphasized that good works and strong faith were the gateway for personal salvation. Martin Luther had a strong opposition o that idea, even as a monk and professor at the University of Wittenberg. Through personal study and dedication to religion he discovered that no weak and powerless human being could do enough good works to achieve salvation. He believed that through a powerful faith and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, that alone was enough for people to achieve salvation. Justification by Faith" (PBS 1) became the primary belief of the Protestant Reformation. Luther's repulsion of Catholic Church teachings enabled him to create the Ninety-Five Theses, which opposed the sale of indulgences and revolted against clerical abuses. According to many historians this was the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. The Ninety-Five Theses were quickly created and disseminated throughout Germany. Luther encouraged German royalty to overthrow the idea of salvation though the Catholic Church.
His idea of salvation through faith alone was widespread and becoming acceptable to many people. The Roman Catholic Church was outraged and did not accept his view of salvation. The Catholic Church believed that he was to be excommunicated from the church in 1512. When Luther was summoned to appear to the Holy Roman Empire and to "recant the heresies" (Duiker 431). He responded by rebuffing and making a statement that "became the battle cry of the Reformation" (Duiker 431). This angered the members of Reichstag, who ordered Luther to be detained.
Luckily for him, Fredrick of Saxony protected him. A revolution was manifested upon Luther's religious ideals; this revolution changed the European Civilization forever. Luther's popularity fostered from hatred and dissatisfaction with the greed of wealth power, corruption and dogmatic ideals of the Roman Catholic Church. The marriage between Luther and Katherina von Bora demolished the idea of clerical celibacy; his marriage ighlighted the life of a Protestant minister with a family. German rulers strongly supported Luther; they quickly acquired control and supervision of the German churches.
Luther emphasized that the churches focus on the preaching the Word of God and Bible study. In Luther's eyes in was necessary to abolish Catholic Mass and gravitate towards new religious services. All of these changes highlight the metamorphosis that Christianity was experiencing. People who believed and promoted these new ideals were complacent with a new religious experience. In 1 519, Charles V ruled a vast empire, composed of Austrian lands, part of Italy, Spain, nd other territories. Though election he was granted the Holy Roman Empire title.
His idea was to "preserve the unity of his empire in the Catholic faith"(Duiker 432). By this time, Germany detached it self from the idea of imperial ruling; this disintegrated any loyalty to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1546, Lutheranism was the prominent belief and practice throughout Germany. Charles Vs effort to bring combat and war to disintegrate Lutheranism was a failure. This failure encouraged Charles V to create the Peace of Augsburg, which granted freedom to German states to choose between Catholicism and Lutheranism.
The expeditious spread of Lutheranism and Protestant beliefs reassured that Christian unity was no longer a possibility. Switzerland had a prominent role in the Protestant Reformation. The revolution sparked upon Ulrich Zwingli. Zwingli ignited religious changes in member states of the federal states of Switzerland and the city of Zurich. Evangelical reforms took over these areas. For example, Mass was replaced by services that promoted biblical study and prayer, relics were destroyed, and pope's authority was no longer accepted.
His primary source of support came from the people of Zurich and the agistrate, known as Mark Reust. Zwingli created an alliance with the German rulers, and Martin Luther. In 1513, rage and dissatisfaction festered between Catholic states and the Swiss Protestants. This created a war that led to Zwingli's death, his responsibility and loyalty to manifest change in Switzerland was handed down to John Calvin. John Calvin was a practical theologian who organized the Protestant reform. His conversion to Protestantism led him to escape his native France to Switzerland.
His beliefs coincided very closely with Luther's beliefs. A unique belief that he promoted was the idea of predestination. Predestination was a belief that "God predestined some people to be saved, and the others to be damned, both who He would admit to salvation, and whom He would condemn to destruction" (PBS 1). Calvin also emphasized absolute sovereignty of God; he called it the "power, grace, and glory of God"(PBS 1). His reputation and credibility arose from his publication of the Institutes of the Christian Religion, an integration of Protestant beliefs and stands.
In 1536, he expanded his revolutionary Protestant reform to the city of Geneva. Calvin created The Consistory, a governing body that attested to moral virtue nd discipline, and enabled a systematic way of including clergy and laymen in church service. The success that was fostered upon Geneva, allowed for missionaries to travel throughout Europe and infiltrate all of Europe with Protestantism. The city of Geneva stood as a Protestant citadel that gave success to the religious reform. The Anabaptists were radical promoters of the Protestant faith, who also played a pivotal role in the reformation.
Their concern was to return to practice and religion of early Christianity, they emphasized equality in all believers. Separation of Church and State was something they strongly advocated. They did not see any benefit of the government dictating the Jurisdiction of religion. The Anabaptists opposed the idea of baptism in infants. Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics grew hostility and hatred towards the Anabaptists because of that belief. That is why they were heavily persecuted in the sixteenth century. The English Reformation played a pivotal part in the Protestant reformation.
King Henry the VII was seen as selfish glutton. Surprisingly his strong desire to divorce Catherine of Aragon, his first wife made the English Reformation a more political than religious cause. The pope refused to grant Henry VII's request to divorce Catherine of Aragon for Anne Boleyn. His attention then focused on the archbishop of Canterbury, head of the highest court in England. The archbishop condoned a divorce and annulled King Henry VII's first marriage. Soon after Anne became queen she had a child, whom was a girl.
This infuriated King Henry VII because he did not have a son to inherit his throne. This anger encouraged Henry VII to promote separation of the Church of England with Rome. This was known as the Act of Supremacy in 1534, it declared that the King was in complete control of the doctrine and Church of England. During Henry VII's reign, Archbishop Cranmer attempted to reform the administrative and religious ruling. Shortly after this, Henry VII died and left his ruling to his underage son. Cranmer took advantage of this situation by directing the Church ot England in a Protestant direction.
T manifested new Protestant services and ideals in the Church of England. Mary a Catholic succeeded Edward VI. Her nickname "Bloody Mary' was no understatement. Her primary concern was for the Church of England to return to Catholicism; she murdered more than 300 heretics who opposed Catholicism. Ironically, her actions ed for England to become more Protestant than ever before. By the mid-sixteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church no longer dominated Europe. Protestantism was infiltrating all of Europe and becoming more dominating and accepted.
Due to this nature, the Catholic Church underwent a reformation of its own known as the Catholic Reformation. The Catholic is divided in to three parts known as the Jesuits, a reformed papacy, and the Council of Trent. Ignatius of Loyola, Spanish noblemen, founded the Society of Jesus. This society accepted the directing of the pope and promoted the principals of obedience to the papacy, and hierarchical ruling of ociety and civilization. They fostered missionaries to explore Asian countries to convert people to Catholicism The reformed papacy was another aspect of the Catholic Reformation.
Pope Paul Ill took the initiative to create a reform to team to hold Catholic Church's accountable and enforce discipline. Through this he was able to create the Council of Trent and gave recognition to the Society of Jesus. In 1545, church officials gathered in the city of Trent started the Council of Trent. This Council of Trent met continuously though three different sessions in the sixteenth century. Their ideas coalesced and they came to the conclusion that the "selling of indulgences was prohibited, both faith and good works were required for salvation, and only the church could interpret scripture" (Duiker 438).
This manifested one doctrine and religion under the Roman Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation had significant impacts in the foundation of our world nations. This impact allowed for the re-establishment of political and religious views throughout the European civilization, challenged the authority of the Catholic popes, and led to modern concepts of democracy. This reformation is key to understanding how religion has laced an importance in the foundation and building of every nation in our world.
The fight for equality and freedom will always be an obstacle throughout history; understanding the struggle, rebellion, and motivation to fght that many people faced in reformation, allows for our world to become educated and motivated to strive towards a better world.

The Protestant Reformation made liturgy and church services accessible to lay people.[1] The Protestant Reformation caused the Roman Catholic Church to initiate its own reform. [1]
The Protestant Reformation was a major 16th century European movement aimed initially at reforming the beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. [2] Reformation, also called Protestant Reformation, the religious revolution that took place in the Western church in the 16th century. [3] Martin Luther sparked the Protestant Reformation, a far-reaching religious, social, political, and economic revolution. [4] Why is the Protestant Reformation a big deal? It was a social, political, and economic revolution in the truest sense. [4]
The Protestant Reformation impacted nearly every academic discipline, notably the social sciences like economics, philosophy, and history. [4] The Protestant Reformation impacted religion, philosophy, politics and economics worldwide. [5] Max Weber's (1904) thesis that the Protestant Reformation was instrumental in facilitating industrial capitalism in Western Europe is generally viewed as the "most famous link between culture and economic development." [6] The immediate effect of the Protestant Reformation is that it led to a schism that culminated in the creation of several new denominations within western Christianity. [7] The long term effects of the Protestant Reformation have been religious and political, indeed. [8] Evangelical sects began to form after the Protestant Reformation, and countries such as France and England were fraught with religious conflicts as the radical Hugenots and the Anabaptists were in conflict with the ruling Catholics and. [8] The Protestant Reformation was a long-term movement that challenged papal authority and questioned the Catholic Church's practices. [5] The Protestant Reformation is a term used to describe a series of events that happened in the 16th century in the Christian Church. [9] Many people think of the Protestant Reformation as only a religious revolution. [4] What happens when people start to break away from the entity that bound an entire civilization together for over a thousand years? How does one go from unparalleled devotion to God to the exploration of what man could do? From absolute acceptance to intense scrutiny? Sheeple to independent thinkers? Like all revolutions preceding it, the Protestant Reformation did not happen overnight. [10] On October 31, 2017, people came from all over the world to Wittenberg, Germany, to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. [4]
The Reformation, because Protestants emphasized the primacy of Scriptural authority, also fostered literacy in Western Europe. [7] A: A major result of the Reformation was the creation of the Protestant movement. [5]
" An Economic Analysis of the Protestant Reformation," Journal of Political Economy, University of Chicago Press, vol. 110(3), pages 646-671, June.[11] " Causes and consequences of the Protestant Reformation," Explorations in Economic History, Elsevier, vol. 62(C), pages 1-25. [11]
" The economic effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber hypothesis in the German Lands," Economics Working Papers 1260, Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra. [11] What were the long-term political effects of the Protestant Reformation? The Protestant reformation created a lot of alliances and enemies in Europe. [12] Distinguished legal scholar John Witte Jr. will present a lecture on the effects of the Protestant Reformation still being felt today in Western society. [13] "The Protestant Reformation transformed not only theology and the church but also law and the state," says Witte. [13] " Media, Markets and Institutional Change: Evidence from the Protestant Reformation," CEP Discussion Papers dp1367, Centre for Economic Performance, LSE. Laurence R. Iannaccone, 1998 [11] People began to think by themselves, so they understood that God didn't choose the king, and they also doubt about the church's influence, so they helped so much to the Protestant Reformation. [12] You go on crusade. or else, etc. Emperors approached Popes on their needs, did penance, etc. The Protestant reformation weaken the grip of the Catholic Church, allowing the secular elites to squirm out from under the church's foot. [14] The selling of indulgences were but one of many of practices of the Catholic Church Martin Luther contested and though probably one of the most crass I doubt it were a difference crucial to bringing about the Protestant Reformation. [14]
This close connection of church and state during the Reformation contributed to the emergence of the wars of religion, a period of a century and a half during which Europe was rocked by a cycle of ever more violent and intractable wars -- often essentially civil wars -- between Protestants and Catholics. [15] During the Reformation, in the 16th century, the Catholic West further split up into two groups; one that remained Catholic and the other that took the new name of Protestant. [16] The finely grained data we collect enable us to document that Protestant and Catholic regions and universities were not on different trajectories before the Reformation. [14]
The protestant reformation of 16th century had both: immediate and long term effects. [17] We won't delve far into theology or matters of faith, but some basic church history will help explain the Protestant Reformation : a major schism within Christianity that changed history in ways so embedded in the Western world that they're easy to overlook or take for granted. [18] Prior to the Protestant Reformation, the medieval church in Western Europe was criticized for _______. [19]
Some men have wrongly called the Protestant Reformation a Protestant revolution because much of the Reformation was political and economic. [20]
While this article will not concern itself with the Catholic Reformation, which took place soon after the Protestant one began, a few words may be stated about its causes and effects. [21] "Let us clearly understand the meaning of these words -- Catholic, Protestant, and Reformation. [21] Then there was a major split within the Western church in the early 16th century when Protestant denominations broke away from Catholicism during the Reformation. [18] Dozens of Protestant denominations, including Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Church of Christ, and Mormons, would put their own distinctly American stamp on the Reformation. [18] The Reformation gave rise to all forms of Protestant Christianity outside the established Church or what we now call the Roman Catholic Church including Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, United Church of Christ, Reformed, all forms of evangelical fundamentalism, and Mormonism. [18] Even aside from the English Civil War, the Reformation encouraged democratic revolt against authority and Protestants thrived in areas of Europe like Switzerland and the Netherlands that contained small pockets of republican rule. [18] After Luther’s initial concerns inadvertently created a movement -- the Reformation -- the result was a division between Catholicism and the varied Protestant traditions, conflicts among those traditions and, eventually, changes in how religion influenced people’s lives. [22]
France was mostly Catholic but had enough Protestants to warrant an entire subset of massacres and edicts called the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598) severe enough to disrupt France’s colonial American agenda (Chapter 3). [18]
POSSIBLY USEFUL
Until the Reformation, the only Bible readily available to the Western church was the Latin Vulgate.[1] The centuries leading up to the Reformation exposed the profound corruption at work when church leadership is seduced by wealth and power. [1] At its core, the Reformation provided the break with the status quo needed to reorient the church to the gospel and its God. [1]
The Reformation John Calvin John Calvin followed in Luther's footsteps to publish his own religious beliefs in a book called the Institutions of the Christian Religion. [23] He began the Reformation by posting his 95 theses (or 95 complaints) about the Catholic Church on the Wittenburg Cathedral in Germany. [23]
Once Protestant princes throughout Germany broke with Rome (and the Holy Roman Empire), they also felt empowered to carve their own paths to power, independent of religious authorities. [1] They taught love and forgiveness and a God who would let them into Heaven without needing money or good deeds. Caused many religious wars in Europe, because Caholics hated Protestants (Lutherans/Calvinists), and Lutherans disliked Calvinists. [23]
Referred to as the Counter-Reformation, those inside the traditional structures of the church responded to the Protestant movement by attempting to reform itself. [1]
This led to a schism in the church, into Catholics and a number of Protestant churches. [9] One only needs to look at the history of Ireland, once a Roman Catholic country unified, but when the Protestant English came in and dominated, there were longlasting conflicts between Irish Catholics and their oppressors. [8] Protestants were Christians who disagreed with Roman Catholic doctrines and. [5] The term Protestant was not initially applied to the reformers, but later was used to describe all groups protesting Roman Catholic orthodoxy. [2]
In recent work, an alternative explanation has been proposed that receives strong empirical support: Protestants had higher human capital, which made them more productive and therefore increased their economic prosperity. [6] Protestants also began to break with other Protestants, leading ultimately to the vast religious pluralism that exists today among many different "kinds" of Christians. [8] By breaking with the Catholic Church, Luther helped encourage others to do so, leading eventually to a proliferation of many different Protestant sects. [8] This Peace recognized the confessional division of the German states and gave the right to Protestants to practice their religion. [9] Protestants are influential in the United States and the English Canada. [9]
Having far-reaching political, economic, and social effects, the Reformation became the basis for the founding of Protestantism, one of the three major branches of Christianity. [3] This article explores the recent advancements in the economics of religion that assign a leading role to human capital in understanding the economic effects of the Reformation. [6] It first provides a brief sketch of the underlying theory and then presents extensive evidence on the effects of the Reformation on human capital using data from nineteenth-century Prussia. [6] Some of the long-term effects of the Reformation included the outbreak of religious wars in the Holy Roman Empire and France that spanned much of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. [7] The Reformation ended the religious unity of Europe and ushered in 150 years of religious warfare. [10] The movement came to prominence largely through dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church, which was a preeminent authority in Europe in the 1500s when the Reformation began. [5] As a backlash to the Reformation, the Church began its Counter-Reformation, also called the Catholic Revival. [5] Reformation began to spread through Europe before and during this time. [5] As a result of the Reformation, literacy increased throughout Europe, particularly among the common people. [4]
Britannica Classic: The Reformation: Age of Revolt This 1973 video, produced by Encyclopædia Britannica Educational Corporation, discusses the Reformation and its leader Martin Luther, whose grievances against the Roman Catholic Church produced a chain of events that left a profound impact on religion and politics. [3] Its beginning was religious in nature, but the Reformation progressed to transcend religion. [4] A: The primary difference between the Reformation and the Renaissance was that the Reformation focused on a religious revolution, while the Renaissance focuse. [5]
The Reformation movement within Germany diversified almost immediately, and other reform impulses arose independently of Luther. [3] In the centuries following the Reformation, major movements like women Ûªs suffrage and the abolition of slavery grew out of the Reformation era's principles of challenging authority. [5]
In the aftermath of the Reformation, many scholars still saw the ''hand'' of God in history. [4] The Reformation truly ends the Middle Ages and begins a new era in the history of Western Civilization. [10]
Five hundred years on, assessing the impact of the Reformation on the state, identity, and liberalism. [24] In my opinion, the immediate cause that started the reformation was Martin Luther’s act of posting the 95 Theses on the door of the Wittenberg Cathedral in the Roman Empire. [10]
Five hundred years on from Martin Luther's audacious act, our findings confirm that the Reformation transformed not only Western Europe's religious landscape, but also its politics and economy. [14] The Reformation marked a critical juncture in Western history - the moment when the religious monopoly of the enormously rich and powerful Catholic Church was successfully challenged. [14] This column argues that the Reformation not only transformed Western Europe's religious landscape, but also led to an immediate and large secularisation of Europe’s political economy. [14] How did an intensely religious movement, preaching biblical revival, produce economic secularisation? And why did resources so disproportionately shift towards the control of secular rulers? To help us understand how the introduction of religious competition during the Reformation could transform Europe’s political economy, we develop a conceptual framework. [14] As we show in Figure 1, during the Reformation new construction events shifted from primarily religious purposes toward secular ones. [14] An immediate and unfortunate effect of the Reformation was intolerance, which expressed itself in persecution and religious wars. [16] Though the Reformation was religious in nature, it had far-reaching effects in all fields. [16] This activity is easy to operate and effective, designed for students to analyze the long lasting effects of the spread of Christianity during the Renaissance and Reformation on both Europe and the Americas. [25] The Reformation transformed Europe and Christianity in both obvious and subtle ways. [15]
By annihilating the economic power of the medieval Church, the Reformation paved the way for the rise of capitalism. [16] We might still be under Papal Rule because the Reformation got people interested in the separating Church and State. [26] The aim of the series is to give a systematic account of what happened to the ideas and institutions of law and politics as a consequence of the tremendous changes in theology and church life brought on by the Reformation, and what the enduring values of those changes are for church, state, and society even today. [13] In the name of the Reformation, Henry VIII deprived the Pope of any powers over the English church. [16]
" Malthus Meets Luther: The Economics Behind the German Reformation," CESifo Working Paper Series 6010, CESifo Group Munich. repec:oup:restud:v:82:y:2015:i:4:p:1409-1448. is not listed on IDEAS., 2005 [11] We would not have Protestantism without the Reformation of the way people viewed religion that Martin Luther sparked. [26] The Reformation became a global phenomenon because it was exported by colonists wherever they settled, by bringing their religion to new colonies and preaching to peoples they encountered throughout the world. [15] Instead of generating the true spirit of Christ, that is, the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, the Reformation made thousands suffer on account of their religion. [16]
This lecture, offered in anticipation of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s Reformation, explores the Reformation’s enduring impact, for better or worse, on Western life, law, and learning." [13] The Reformation was exclusively a Western European phenomenon, further dividing Western and Eastern Christianity. [15] Social scientists have long argued that the Reformation transformed the European economy and played a role in the rise of the Western world. [14] Social scientists have been right to point to the Reformation as a crucial turning point in European and world history. [14]
The Reformation began within a few years of another world-changing European revolution -- the age of exploration and colonialism. [15] None of the branches of Eastern Christianity -- Orthodox, Armenian, Syriac, Nestorian and Coptic -- participated in any significant way in the spiritual and intellectual revolution of the Reformation. [15]
Significantly, our findings indicate that some of the Reformation's most important consequences were unintended, and have not been fully documented before - the results of interactions among religion, politics, and economics, which produced a secular Europe from its most famous religious movement. [14] Prior to 1517, graduates of eventually Protestant universities sorted into religious and secular occupations at similar rates to graduates from universities that would remain Catholic. [14] The divide between Catholic and Protestant was not simply religious and political. [15] " Protestants and Catholics: Similar Work Ethic, Different Social Ethic," Economic Journal, Royal Economic Society, vol. 120(547), pages 890-918, September. [11] " Does a Protestant work ethic exist? Evidence from the well-being effect of unemployment," Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, Elsevier, vol. 91(C), pages 1-12. [11]
" Protestants and Catholics: Similar work ethic, different social ethic," Economics Working Papers 743, Department of Economics and Business, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, revised Sep 2010. [11] The Protestants asserted that final authority rested in the Bible, while the Catholics and the Orthodox claimed that it lay in the living institution of the Church. [16] Figure 2 shows that both Catholic and Protestant regions witnessed a decline in church construction following 1517. [14] In 1618, a war broke out in Germany between the Catholics and the Protestants, which lasted for thirty years. [16] The Protestant princes of Germany punished their Catholic subjects. [16] After 1517, however, there is a sharp shift towards "secular’ occupations among Protestant university graduates, and no such shift among Catholic university graduates. [14] It also created a lot of wars between protestant, and catholic kings, helped by the pope. 9. [12]
I ran into the "religious" equivalent of this sort of Market thinking in one branch of the Protestant Church of the Life Abundant. [14] Only in Protestant regions (left panel) was there a sustained increase in secular construction, leading to a permanent gap between church and secular construction rates. [14] While Protestant theologians initially attempted to reserve these resources for religious and social purposes, the price of political legitimacy fell, and secular territorial lords were able to strike deals that left them significantly wealthier. [14] At the centre of much of the post-Reformation bargaining between secular rulers and religious elites was the massive wealth that had been held by monasteries that were closed after 1517, particularly in the Protestant territories. [14] Rich historical evidence confirms that secular territorial lords bargained with Protestant religious elites over the allocation of monastic resources. [14] Protestant theologians provided the legal justification for these transfers of wealth - this is consistent with our framework, which views these transfers as outcomes of bargains between secular and religious elites. [14] " The Protestant Fiscal Ethic: Religious Confession and Euro Skepticism in Germany," Cahiers de Recherches Economiques du Département d'Econométrie et d'Economie politique (DEEP) 15.03, Université de Lausanne, Faculté des HEC, DEEP. [11] Protestant Christianity mainly spread in northern and central Germany, Scandinavia, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, the Northern Netherlands, most of Switzerland, Scotland, England, the United States, most of Canada, South Africa and Australia. [16] Protestantism spread most effectively where Protestant colonists settled -- especially in the United States. [15]

Alright, I've got these search results. Let me see what I can gather from them.

First, there's a scholarly article from ScienceDirect about the influence of the Protestant Reformation on education in the 16th century. It seems pretty comprehensive. The author, Mihai Androne, discusses how the Reformation led to changes in education, making it more accessible to the masses, including women and children from all social classes.

According to Androne, the Reformers emphasized the importance of literacy so that people could read the Bible themselves. This led to an increase in the establishment of schools and universities, especially in Protestant regions. The Reformers also placed a strong emphasis on the study of classical languages like Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, which were necessary for understanding the Scriptures in their original languages.

Androne mentions that the Reformation challenged the traditional authority of the Catholic Church and led to the establishment of Protestant denominations with their own educational institutions. This diversification of religious practices and beliefs also had an impact on education, as different Protestant groups had their own approaches to teaching and learning.

Another article from Essaysauce.com provides a student's perspective on education in the 16th and 17th centuries. It talks about the shift from religious pedagogy to a focus on science and math, particularly in the 17th century. The author mentions that while the 16th century was marked by religious education, the 17th century saw a move towards intellectual liberation and the study of the natural world.

The essay also touches on the role of figures like Martin Luther in advocating for universal education, especially for children, regardless of gender or social class. It contrasts this with the Renaissance humanism that valued classical education but perhaps didn't extend it to all segments of society.

From Quora, there are various answers to the question about the impact of the Protestant Reformation on society in the 16th century. One answer suggests that the Reformation allowed society to get out from under the control and corruption of the Catholic Church, leading to greater freedom and intellectual advancement. Another answer takes a more critical view, arguing that the Reformation led to division and hostility within Christianity.

An answer by James Hough emphasizes that the Reformation was a necessary challenge to the corruption within the Catholic Church, but it's clear that different people have different perspectives on its effects.

Looking at the other sources, such as the essay from PHDessay.com, it discusses the Protestant Reformation's impact on Christianity, leading to the separation into Catholic and Protestant groups. It mentions the role of figures like Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, and John Calvin in spreading Protestant ideas across Europe.

The essay also touches on the Catholic Counter-Reformation, which was the Catholic Church's response to the Protestant movement, involving reforms within the Church and the establishment of new religious orders like the Jesuits.

In terms of specific effects, the sources mention:

1. **Education:** Increased emphasis on literacy and the establishment of schools and universities, particularly in Protestant regions.

2. **Religious Divisions:** The split within Christianity led to religious wars and conflicts, such as the Thirty Years' War and the French Wars of Religion.

3. **Church Reform:** The Catholic Church initiated its own reforms in response to the Protestant challenge, leading to the Council of Trent and internal reforms.

4. **Cultural Changes:** Changes in art, literature, and intellectual thought, with Protestant ideas influencing various aspects of culture.

5. **Political Changes:** The Reformation had political implications, as some rulers used it to assert their power against the Catholic Church and establish their own national churches.

Given these points, I can summarize that the Protestant Reformation had profound and multifaceted impacts on European society in the 16th century, affecting religion, education, politics, culture, and more.

Now, to answer the question directly: "What impact did the Protestant Reformation have on society in the 16th century?"

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Protestant Reformation had a profound impact on 16th-century society, leading to religious divisions, the establishment of Protestant denominations, challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church, and significant changes in education, politics, and culture.}} \]
